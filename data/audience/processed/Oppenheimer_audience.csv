"Apr 13, 2024","Effective enough as it is, 'Oppenheimer' is serviceable but didn't really deserve the Academy Award for Best Picture above more creative and personal projects. Christopher Nolan does bring life to this story, but its overreliance on romanticisation and exposition-dumping every minute can feel exhaustive at times. The lack of visually communicative storytelling is only really uplifted by its complex and controversial subject matter.",NEUTRAL
"Apr 12, 2024",Quite absorbing - brilliant acting kept your interest throughout Cillian Murphy gave great leading role of a man who's mind seemed elsewhere much of the time,POSITIVE
"Apr 11, 2024","A genius biopic with stunning visuals, excellent camerawork and great acting, foremost Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr.",POSITIVE
"Apr 11, 2024",Terrible film - a film about the most important weapon created in mankind's history - zero scenes of what it actually did to the part of the world and the people it was used on - instead we get three long drawn out hours focused on trying to convince us to sympathise with the sociopathic arrogant twit responsible.,NEGATIVE
"Apr 11, 2024","It's impactful, engaging, and captivating. Yes, it's long, but it's three hours of entertainment. The highlight for me, besides the breathtaking cinematography and insane visual effects, is the soundtrack. Christopher Nolan always delivers a great soundtrack in his films, and this one is no different. One of the best movies I've ever seen.",POSITIVE
"Apr 10, 2024",This movie did not play out with a Christopher Nolan theme. It played out as something between a badly edited Ken Burns documentary and a soap opera. Would not recommend.,NEUTRAL
"Apr 10, 2024","A good movie but this was hyped up alot. The movie jumped around in different spaces of time far more than necessary to the point where it distracts you from the story. This could have probably also shaved off some of the run time aswell. 

Acting had some really good performances especially from Murphy and Damon, whilst other supporting characters seemed bland and not fleshed out enough to leave a lasting impression when they pop up later in the movie. 

Surprisingly I found the fx extremely hit and miss. But I also think this came down to how hyped to movie was and the actual content matter so I raised the bar higher than it should have been for myself.",NEUTRAL
"Apr 10, 2024","Just like the bomb it sucked and blew big time. All the needless bouncing around and yakking, and then when you think it's going to settle into the story there's even more bouncing and yakking!",NEGATIVE

"Apr 9, 2024",How they managed to make an interesting topic dull I will never know,NEGATIVE
"Apr 9, 2024","What a waste of time on what could/should have been a great story.  The writers decided to focus on the most boring aspects of his life, with very little time spent on the actual development of his story.  Coupled with disjointed performances from otherwise fine actors, this was a complete disappointment to me.",NEGATIVE

"Apr 7, 2024","96%
A much-deserved Best Picture award went to this film, so I decided to sit through all three hours of it. It's safe to say that I would do so again. Oppenheimer is leagues better than its counterpart Barbie, given its epic scale and an all-star ensemble that Robert Altman would be proud of.
Despite a mammoth runtime, this film never becomes boring. Christopher Nolan takes a similar approach to David Fincher when making this biopic, dramatizing it until it plays out like a fast-paced thriller. It was interesting to learn of the historical events that may lead to humanity's destruction, a theme that lingers like a dark cloud over the film and makes you think. Not something I can often say about a film in a shallow modern industry.
Another point: seeing every other famous actor on the planet get a chance to shine in this film was half the fun. It's always a joy to see Jason Clarke bully Cillian Murphy one second, then see Robert Downey Jr. have a breakdown while Alden Ehrenreich taunts him the next. I could watch the last 30-60 minutes of Oppenheimer endlessly.
Two negative comments about the film: firstly, Florence Pugh is overly sexualized. She's naked for an uncomfortably large amount of her screentime for reasons that I personally cannot grasp. Secondly (and this is only minor), I find it triggering that Ehrenreich's character doesn't have a name. It humours me that an only moderately known actor's unnamed and undeveloped character has more lines and screentime than the one and only Casey Affleck's character. This is only me nitpicking an otherwise flawless movie. Like Oliver Stone's JFK, it's a three hour masterpiece where the entire cast is a recognizable name or face.
This is an oasis in a desert of 2020s trash.",POSITIVE
"Apr 7, 2024","Masterful storytelling from every single facet of filmmaking. An important story as the book of the prophets like Isaiah or the Odyssey. 
Im looking forward to my next viewing !!",POSITIVE
"Apr 6, 2024","Incredibly boring and gray. I don't get the appeal and the awards. I understand the historical and humanity importance. Emily Blunt and Matt Damon and are two of my favorite actors. I couldn't watch past 40 minutes. Too long, slow and gloomy for my taste.",NEGATIVE
"Apr 5, 2024","Masterpiece.

It's true",POSITIVE
"Apr 5, 2024","CIllian was brilliant as usual. The cast was excellent, Blunt, Downey, Damon.. The premise is certainly interesting up to the point of the start of the investigation and mock trials,.. that's where it started to get boring and I stopped watching. But the reviews are good, so maybe just my weird taste.",NEUTRAL
"Apr 5, 2024",Thought it was a little overrated. Interesting but veered into sleep inducing boringness with all the committee/senate hearings.,NEUTRAL
"Apr 4, 2024",What is this God awful practise Directors have come up with to tell a story completely out of order. Jumping from the Middle to the end to the start and all over the place. Mix that in with continuous trippy screens of particles flying about and you have something Uncomprehendable. 15 Minutes in and I turned it off. How this won an Award is beyond me.,NEGATIVE
"Apr 3, 2024","Good movie, seems like they took famous lines spoken and just added them in conveniently. Cinematography was ok, scene switching could be a bit jarring at times, pacing was weird. Sound was amateur, couldn't hear the dialogue over poorly constructed background music. I wasn't there so I don't know how the man was but it seemed a bit dramatized in the manner they spoke, despite it obviously being a true story and insane situation. Great acting, though it was a highly overrated movie but definitely decent. A bit too long. As a scientist, I enjoyed some of the insights into how the bomb was developed, though I knew much of the history I learned a bit there too.",POSITIVE
"Apr 3, 2024","Great film, long but kept entertained the whole way.",POSITIVE
"Apr 3, 2024","Was f√ºr eine Entt√§uschung!

Keine Ahnung, warum dieser Film so viele Oskars erhalten hat. L√§sst sich wohl nur darin begr√ºnden, dass der Rest noch schlechter war.
Der hauptdarsteller starrt dumm in der Gegend rum, seine Frau war die bessere Schauspielerinn.
Soundtrack= grausame und billige Syntheziserkl√§nge
Handlung war bruchst√ºckhaft und ohne jegliche Spannung, insgesamt sehr langweilig und nicht lohnenswert 3 Stunden Lebenszeit zu verschwenden.

"Apr 2, 2024",Was a nice movie . Good pace . Great characters.,POSITIVE
"Apr 2, 2024","Oppenheimer is on of the best movies,which I've ever seen. I watched this movie with my mouth open, I was overwhelmed with emotions.Everything is flawless in this film:actors,special effects and for my opinion,the best thing about this movie is soundtracks.And also why I like this movie ,is because it was filmed by my favourite director-Christopher Nolan",POSITIVE
"Apr 2, 2024","Excellent movie. It's a rollercoaster of emotions from beginning to end. The only parts that may be bad for some people is the rhythm of some of the scenes and the duration of the film, but I really think it was the best way to tell this story and fit (almost) every important and incredible moment of it in those three hours of art.",POSITIVE
"Apr 2, 2024",Christopher Nolan is an amazing director and this movie is an example of his excellent work,POSITIVE
"Apr 2, 2024","Definitelly an Oscar winning movie, great acting and immersive plot. The events happen very fast and can be a bit overwhelming with the various timelines, and 3 hours is just too long. Still great plot and all comes together in the end.",POSITIVE
"Apr 1, 2024","""Oppenheimer"" is a mind-bending flick that'll make you question everything... especially if you're part of the UK's average intelligence club. This film is like a Rubik's Cube dipped in quantum physics and sprinkled with existential dread ‚Äì not your typical Saturday night rom-com, that's for sure. If you're the type who still thinks 2+2 equals fish and that the Earth is flat because you've never left your hometown, this movie might be a bit of a brain workout. But hey, who needs to understand nuclear physics when you've got a solid grip on the remote control, right?",NEUTRAL
"Apr 1, 2024","I don't get why this is popular. Other than the lead actor, the story was rushed, not told well. And it passed over the horrible destructiveness of nuclear war. Ho hum... movie go boom.",NEGATIVE
"Apr 1, 2024",Powerful individual performances cant make up for an otherwise boring movie with a stuffy script. The quantumness gives way to bureaucracy. Why they chose to focus less on atomic weapons and more on paper pushing I don't understand,NEGATIVE
"Apr 1, 2024","Great acting from a first rate cast, but I've got to say - I did not love it.  The film is long, a bit confusing and somewhat depressing.  For all its accolades (and obvious big budget) it's definitely worth a watch - but I much preferred Fat Man and Little Boy circa 1989 starring Paul Newman.",NEUTRAL
"Apr 1, 2024",I don't know how it won any awards. It was boring and hard to follow.,NEGATIVE
"Apr 1, 2024","I stopped watching this movie after an hour and change because it seemed to have made its point that historical context and moral relativism exist, and so we don't need to bother with story",NEGATIVE
"Mar 31, 2024","Last hour dragged, an older married couple next to me both fell asleep at different points in the film but overall a very fine tuned and crafted production and pleased many movie goers.",POSITIVE
"Mar 31, 2024",One of Christopher Nolans best films!!,POSITIVE
"Mar 31, 2024","The ""scientific"" bits‚Äîfor those of us who know some science‚Äîare silly and out of place. Einstein's quote, ""God does not play dice"": People who know science know the quote‚Äîand people who don't just won't understand it. Then there are silly romantic scenes, hastily done, some with unwholesome attempts at ""artistic"" character depictions. There are way too many characters on the whole and way too many elements; add to that the constant change of scenes (past/present) and the movie becomes really difficult to follow. Even worse, the main guy just hangs around not saying much‚Äîexcept in the flashbacks. And what about people who don't know who Hahn, Heisenberg, etc are? Those mentions are probably just to make the movie sound like it deals with science. The movie is a mess‚Äîa hotchpotch of personality portraits, politics, law, ""science,"" history, and at least five more things I could list. Weave in random bits about communism vs the establishment, Germans vs Americans, Jews vs non-Jews, and so forth and so on. At one point, a woman asks Oppenheimer in a romantic(!) way: ""Can you explain quantum mechanics to me?"" Dr. O actually responds by telling her something factual but really ordinary to someone who knows any physics. Oof, that was rotten!",NEGATIVE
"Mar 31, 2024","It's a case of the Emperor's New Clothes. So many people seemed to have made up their minds about this film's ""greatness"" before watching it. There is so much unnecessary dialogue that does nothing to propel the narrative, accompanied by an effort to make every scene overly dramatic thus reducing the effect of genuinely important ones. The film lacks cohesion and needed to be trimmed by at least an hour. I recommend lots of strong coffee to finish the three hours without nodding off.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 31, 2024",The last third of the movie is boring. Couldn't wait for it to finish.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 30, 2024","This was a great movie. I almost did not watch it due to the mixed reviews on RT. Some had trouble following the plot. However, after watching the movie, I thought the directing and acting was phenomenal. I have always been a science nerd, and watch science shows and documentaries since the Carl Sagan days. It is a long movie and as great as the movie was, it's not a movie most would watch more than once.",POSITIVE

"Mar 29, 2024","It's a well done movie. Acting was vastly overrated based on the awards it won or perhaps there wasn't much competition. The lack of special effects for the Trinity test was a complete joke. How could anyone believe that was a nuclear detention? 

I was really hyped to finally see this movie, but I thought it was mostly boring. So I took a star away for the overhyped actors and another one for the Trinity mess.",NEUTRAL

"Mar 28, 2024",Boring right from the start...Purchased it from Prime Video so felt obliged to watch it. Luckily the cat needed feeding so that was 5 mins away from the tedium of the movie. Made a sandwich so that was another 5 mins wasted. Now 1hr and 37 mins into it. Another whiskey might help...Yawwwwwn.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 28, 2024","THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE! I love the music, acting, and just the whole lot of it. Honestly a movie for the ages that will not be forgotten like the Godfather or Saving Private Ryan. This is why Christopher Nolan movies are the best, it is because of the cinematography. Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. are definitely the standout actors for this movie. I love WWII it has so many parts to it and the Atomic Bomb takes one of the key roles in WWII. Another thing that I like is that it shows the guilt of Oppenheimer after he creates the bomb and becomes the ender of so many lives and most likely the world as we know it. The run time is unbearable, but it is so intense it goes by very fast. Along with Napoleon and John Wick 4 these are my picks for movie of the year, but most of all I hope it goes to Oppenheimer. In total a must-see movie for any movie lover and my pick for best movie of all time. Edit: it won the movie of the year:)",POSITIVE
"Mar 28, 2024","In Tenet, Nolan seemed to toy with the question, ""What happens if we have no protagonist?"" In Oppenheimer, he seems to challenge himself to answer the flip side of his question - ""what if the movie is full of stars but the star isn't one of the actors?"" (The star being the bomb, of course. My interpretation, of course - others have had meaningful discussions on the movie dealing with moral and actual consequences, in a world without heroes).

Oppenheimer is arguably Nolan at his peak (high praise from the guy who loved The Dark Knight), building an engaging world with a deep introspection that never feels too heavy. Nolan might be slightly generous to Oppenheimer, but the movie itself never feels like it takes sides. Oppenheimer's youth, growth, and involvement in the Manhattan Project, and the subsequent related congressional hearing of Lewis Strauss are handled masterfully.

The cast is also great, though I was a mite disappointed by Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt whose roles seemed muted. But the rest of the cast shone, and shone in concert together, underpinned by a script that for once isn't expository.
All in all, it's a deeply thoughtful movie that is also beautifully constructed and shot, and ranks up there as one of the best movies of the 2020s (not just 2023). You'll feel the 3 hours, but you won't regret it.",POSITIVE
"Mar 27, 2024",Find it really boring and unnecessary long,NEGATIVE
"Mar 27, 2024","in my opinion, the movies that Universal Pictures has shown to the world in it's 111 year history has all led up to this very movie. the tour-de-force performances of all who starred, practical effects that will leave you utterly amazed, a score which can go from the stunningly beautiful music of the beginning montage to the terrifying sounds of the detonation of the first nuclear bomb test. this is one of the best movies that i have ever seen in my life. this could very well be the greatest film to have ever been released or made by Universal.",POSITIVE

"Mar 26, 2024","This is a Big Important Hollywood movie. Personally, I found it boring and felt I had seen the movie at least a dozen times before. I wonder if it got such rave reviews because it tackled an important topic or because people truly loved the movie. I suspect the former played an important part.

"Mar 24, 2024","I normally enjoy Nolan films, but this story was long and boring and disorganized. These 2.5+ hour movies I think neglect the audience in favor of their own need to get an Oscar grab. I'm kinda tired of it.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 24, 2024","A chilling film that honors cinema. The acting of the actors, the direction, the construction of the scenes and the SOUNDTRACK! I only regret the fact that such an incredible film was, in part, overshadowed by a film as silly as Barbie.

"Mar 24, 2024","First, I don‚Äôt recommend it to children because it is an R rated movie for a reason. However, the story was told in a magnificent way and it was shot very well kudos to Christopher Nolan. I may be biased because I‚Äôm a history buff and really enjoyed learning about the father of the atomic bomb so when I say it‚Äôs fantastic I may be overshooting it a bit. Although, imo it‚Äôs my movie of the year and it may not be close with the movie hot-period coming to an end. I will say that it‚Äôs a slow movie that I may watch less than 20 times in my lifetime but i will enjoy it every single time. to wrap it up, I think it was for sure one of my most favorable in-theater experiences and I recommend it to anyone and everyone!

"Mar 24, 2024","Over-hyped. The movie jumped around in time and gave almost no clue as to what year it was in. It was extremely hard to follow and the ""artistic"" effects were overdone.  It reminded me of when a mediocre rock band turns up the volume to compensate for lack of talent. On the subject of audio, the dialogue was whispered in some places and then would follow with deafening sounds.  The only reason I could follow any of it was because I already knew the history very well.  There was one upside, and that was Robert Downey and Matt Damon's acting. Still, that did not compensate for all of the failings.   I want my money back and more importantly, my time.",NEGATIVE

Christopher Nolan is the best director ever!,POSITIVE
"Mar 23, 2024",I felt like all of the important topics covered in this movie were only slightly mentioned. It felt like it was mainly about his affair. The timeline was hard to follow as someone who doesn‚Äôt know much about Oppenheimer‚Äôs life. Honestly I felt like it was only made for people who either love history or are obsessed with Oppenheimer. The best thing about the movie were a few of the scenes towards the end and the cinematography of the movie. ,NEGATIVE
"Mar 23, 2024","Expect a thought-provoking drama that goes beyond wartime action. The movie explores the personal struggles of Oppenheimer and the lasting impact of his scientific achievements.

"Mar 22, 2024","A serious film that, over three hours, makes few concessions to suspense, emotional intensity or development of plot but instead, through a brittle mosaic of interlocking fragments takes one through the historical drama of America's development of the A-bomb, its deployment against Japan, and then the fallout (pun intended) against Oppenheimer its creator. The best scenes, I found, were at the end, during the hearings examining Oppenheimer alleged communist sympathies and the machinations of his enemies (Strauss) to ruin his reputation. On the whole the verdict of the film is: the invention of the atom bomb was a disaster and Oppenheimer himself felt distinctly ambivalent about his invention (well, his team's invention). What have we learnt? Not much, but the character of Oppenheimer is scrutinized in some depth, whether accurately or not, I have no idea.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 22, 2024","I was really excited to see this movie because I always wanted to know more about how the atomic bomb was created. I did end up enjoying the movie. However, it left me wanting more from it. I really enjoyed the atomic test they made it quite exciting and everything I wanted it to be.

"Mar 22, 2024","Magnificent. Cillian Murphy transforms himself physically and emotionally into the brilliant, poignant, naive Oppenheimer.  It is made clear that ""Oppie"" fixated on the creation of the bomb as a physics theory but thought that the World will respect it, and never use it.  He was a better man than most and so sadly wrong. It took me a few moments to recognize Robert Downey Jr., another masterful physical transformation. There was not a wasted moment in this film. I cannot emphasize enough the importance of ""Oppenheimer""; it is a film to be watched more than once, every few months or years to remind ourselves how dangerous a species we are.

"Mar 20, 2024","Luego de haber visto la pel√≠cula por segunda vez, puedo decir que a diferencia de la primera, las escenas de juicio, conversaci√≥n, y di√°logo dentro del metraje no son lo que la hace aburrida, sino todo lo contrario, la hacen profunda. 

Nos podemos dar cuenta de lo cegado que puede llegar a estar el ser humano solo por ambici√≥n (en el caso de J. Robert) y venganza, en el caso de Lewis Strauss. 

Mis puntos a destacar son: La actuaci√≥n de cillian, rdj, y emily blunt (en sus cortos minutos de aparici√≥n) creo que supo encarnar de muy buena manera el papel de una esposa frustrada, desconsolada y entristecida con lo que pasaba en la vida de su marido. 

La banda sonora compuesta por G√∂ransson, los movimientos de c√°mara cuando el protagonista sent√≠a remordimiento o se iba dando cuenta de lo que hizo, las escenas grabadas (y sin CGI, al puro estilo Nolan) de las part√≠culas, y la escena final ""creo que fue lo que hicimos"" y la del principio ""¬øPuedes escuchar la m√∫sica, Robert?"" fueron las que posicionan a esta obra, como una de mis favoritas de Nolan, y las que tambi√©n deja a Oppenheimer como una oda al cine sensorial. 

En resumen: Todo en esta pel√≠cula est√° muy bien ejecutado: actuaciones, direcci√≥n, vestuario, cinematograf√≠a, dise√±o de producci√≥n. Todo est√° perfectamente combinado y funciona muy bien para meternos de lleno en esta historia.",POSITIVE
"Mar 20, 2024","Oppenheimer shifted around way too often. Consciously filmed, edited and packaged for the shorter attention spanned modern moviegoers.  Gimmickey. The score was always raging or waning. It was like watching the History Channel on Bath Salts and Adderall. Villenueve, Glazer and even Ari Aster ascribe to classic cinematic craftsmanship that is as naturally pleasing as thrilling. Their films echo the works of masters such as David  Lean, John Huston, Francis Ford Coppola, Federico Fellini, Akira Kurosawa, Michelangelo Antonioni and Stanley Kubrick, to name a few.  I hope Oppenheimer is the last TIK -TOK hack job we will ever see getting accolades. Scott's Napoleon and Scorsese's ""Flower Moon"" were  much  better at crafting suspenseful narratives and artfully utilizing nuanced cinematic framing from historic settings that didn't scrape psychic chalkboards like 
Nolan's Oppenheimer.",NEGATIVE

Because of this, I had a hard time to focus on actors' performances and the story in Oppenheimer. I was not the only one in the crowd. Most in the audience would turn to their partners to clarify what words were just uttered pretty much through the entire movie. 
The plot line was all over the place. 
I salute to the entire acting ensemble though. Every actor in a small or bigger role was intensely invested in their delivery. The same goes for the cinematography.  The visual elements of this story, the angles of the camera, lighting, etc. elevated the film.",NEUTRAL

The entire first half is a crazed jumble of cuts from different moments in history, with no clue whatsoever as to when they are taking place.  There are probably two dozen important characters who are often poorly identified and impossible to keep track of.  I cannot believe that this has been so acclaimed and rewarded.

"Mar 15, 2024","Excellent direction, superb acting and an undeniably momentus core subject matter make this film well worth watching. However, Oppenheimer is much too long with too many parochial distractions and courtroom digressions. The bomb is the important story here, not the post-war fate of Oppenheimer and not the well-worn, post-war reds-under-the-bed moral panic storyline. As soon as the bombs are dropped the film loses all impetus, and by the time we reach the final moment of judgement the tension has been squandered.

"Mar 12, 2024","Oppenheimer (2023) is a tour de force movie that is so tightly edited and well-acted that even though it clocks in at a little over three hours, I'm kept at the edge of my seat the whole time. It's the story of a man who, like the dying stars he studies, finds out that, ""the bigger the star, the more violent its demise."" SPOILERS: He has a Mozart/Salieri relationship with Admiral Lewis Strauss, the head of the AEC, who both admires and reviles ""Oppie,"" as his cultists call him. And it is Oppenheimer's arrogance, his egotistical demands that he be seen as ""the father of the atomic bomb"" without any of the accompanying responsibility for the deaths of two hundred and twenty thousand people. Cillian Murphy is astonishing as Oppenheimer, having lost 28 pounds to get the gaunt silhouette necessary for the role, he not only embodies Oppenheimer, we see through his eyes, or rather in the ways he doesn't look at us/audience/the camera, the primal narcissism of this man.  An astoundingly great supporting cast, led by Robert Downey Jr. make this film one for the ages. And it is my contention that Oppenheimer is not an American Prometheus, but rather an American Icarus --- who made himself wax wings and deliberately flew as close to the light and heat as he could, knowingly, only to plummet and bring the entire Earth with him.",POSITIVE

"Mar 11, 2024","A magnetic masterpiece around the mythical episode of a truly incredible man. One of the best and most well-built movies of all time for sure. Step by step, you are taken on a unique journey from simmering life and brewing tension to a (literal) explosion of what life can be under the harshest of circumstances. Left in awe every scene, Cillian Murphy is at his (usual) best, just the best and he proves it here! Blunt is great, the entire cast is great, Florence Pugh in a scene-stealing role, even though she doesn't appear a lot, she really does shine. For a movie that is centered around a cataclysmic event and a tense, complicated situation, it is made remarkably approachable and you are invited to understand each step along the way in a human sense. Coupled with brilliantly-shot scenes and a flawless script, this movie is a surreal achievement.",POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2024","I'm not saying I disliked Oppenheimer but I DID think it was overrated based on the hype. Essentially, it's what you'd think a Nolan bio would be like: dramatic music constantly played throughout, dynamic editing including some special effects images. But I think, in combination, all of that detracts from the story by making it seem less personal. Cillian does a great job portraying Oppenheimer but it's a fairly one note performance with Cillian starring off into the distance with a monotone voice throughout. Downey Jr did a serviceable job, however, I don't think he was the best choice. Downey has a certain kinetic energy and certain vocal intonations that don't seem fitting for an older man of that era. To put it succinctly, Downey has the vibe of a ""coke guy"" ha, which works well for other roles but wasn't ideal for this one IMHO. He toned down the ""Downey thing"" compared to other performances but it still came through. 

Also, I thought Florence Pugh's performance was absolutely wooden. We often praise British actors for doing passable American accents but their performances can be very flat as was the case with Pugh. She does this thing British actors do while performing an American accent that I call ""swallowing their words"", because instead of speaking in a naturalistic way or projecting their words, their mouths are overly involved with enunciation and their dialogue sounds kind of muddled as a result, along with lacking an emotional connection with what they're saying. 

Overall, I'd say it's a good film but it didn't really live up to my expectations, and it's not a film that I'm in a rush to watch again anytime soon, especially with the 3 hour running time.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 11, 2024","This movie is so overrated! 3 most boring hours of my life wasted.

"Mar 11, 2024","Musical scoring alone makes this film worth-while. True Story films poses the challenge of having limited control, and of course the inevitable predictability.

"Mar 11, 2024","Was amazing given that I've never really been interested in Oppenheimer as a historical figure. However, his wife, though very much supportive and seems like the person who pushes him into the right direction, weirdly, is also a mess. The sex/nude scene/s with Florence Pugh wasn't needed, please be honest.... What did I need to see that for?? What did that add to the story? We get it....

"Mar 10, 2024","Oppenheimer

Oppenheimer follows the life of American Physicist, Robert Oppenheimer. This journey goes from his days as a student, through his pivotal role in developing the atomic bomb during World War II, to his security hearing in 1954.

Oppenheimer hails as the most visually stunning movie of 2023. Christopher Nolan delivers a brilliant feat of filmmaking in this movie, there's an undeniable triumph across the board. The film delves into humanity's fascination with destruction and our relentless pursuit to enhance the means to achieve it.

Character study is pivotal to the success of Oppenheimer, and a brilliantly layered examination is present here. This movie is mostly about Oppenheimer, and Cillian Murphy is up to the task as he delivers a brilliant lead performance. Robert Downey Jr exceptionally complements Murphy with a final act that shows him at his best. Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh round up this stellar cast.

Pacing isn't perfect here and that's impacted greatly by the extended run-time, but Oppenheimer weaves through a fragmented nonlinear plot that ends with a slam dunk.

Oppenheimer concludes as a brilliant biopic and a masterclass in filmmaking.

"Mar 9, 2024","Call me Mr. Contrarian, but I really don't think Oppenheimer warrants the incredible buzz it got (is getting - it's Oscar Time). Excellent performances, for sure: I thought Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. were very good. And add Emily Blunt into the mix. But I think these 'ensemble star' productions have an inherent flaw; every time a marquee name pops up it's ""hey...that's Rami Malek"" (who was pretty good in his 4-5 minutes) or ""...that's Casey Affleck"" (in HIS 3 minutes).  I think it actually detracts from the film. That's why we have 2nd tier actors. It all reminded me of The Longest Day (1962 - you could look it up); every star in the book and that was distracting.
Too long; pretty sure reasonable editing could have taken 20-30 minutes out. Once you're past 2 hours you better have a very, very good reason or else it's just an exercise in self-indulgence.  
Finally: all my friends said ""No, don't watch it on TV: you HAVE to see it in the theatre"". Why? I'm guessing the atomic bomb test was pretty amazing on the big screen, but the rest? People talking in rooms? How is that special to a big screen?
No; a pretty good film, too long, too many stars.

"Mar 9, 2024","Absolutely enjoyed this from beginning to end. Suburb acting, beautifully directed and told - it's not easy to make this a compelling story without turning it into a war film. I really appreciated how they highlighted the complexity of peace - and the irony of how developing a WMD could keep it. We watched it in two sittings because it was quite long but well worth the journey. Must see!",POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024","Boring documentary type movie. Absolutely obnoxious sex scenes. Shameful. Those arguing sex scenes are ok, why don't they show real peni.. and vagi...? Show real uncensored porn to depict the life of the person even more realistically.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 8, 2024",It is a absolute masterpiece 10/10,POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024","86%
Liked it but definitely didn't love it. Was really a deep dive into the developing, testing and preparing for the deployment of the bomb which was essentially just a biography of Oppenheimer and coinciding with a trial afterward to get his security clearance provoked since he was speaking out against the continued development of A bombs. The lead up to the testing of the bomb was the coolest party. The rest was really just a ton of dialogue. 2/5 rewatch.",POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024","There is nothing short of amazing in all aspects of this landmark film. Nolan gives us a dazzling biopic in the guise of a thriller while also playing as a cautionary tale that both visually and grammatically gives us the beautiful and devastating science behind man's possible end. With outstanding performances led by a career-defining Murphy, ground-breaking feats in cinematography and practical effects, plus extraordinary sound and music, this is one of those rare films that defines filmmaking not only in its creative and technical process but how it is enjoyed by all who see it.",POSITIVE

"Mar 7, 2024",Hard to get to the starting point.  Long build up.  Dragged at points.  Fine acting.  Many stars.  Liked ending.,NEUTRAL
"Mar 6, 2024",Christopher Nolan once again proves you can take absolutely nothing and make a remarkable film about it. Dramatic and informative. RDJ gives a (no surprise here) Oscar worthy performance. Cillian Murphy finally gets a standout role worthy of his onscreen presence.,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","Until the movie started steadily depicting Los Alamos and beyond, I bounced around like a ping-pong ball. I was wondering how this movie was good. It seemed like it was all over the place and would never settle down into a story. I didn't know Oppenheimer's story except for documentary pieces so all the pretexts of his relationships, schooling, and time travel that the movie showed had me confused and hating the way it was put together. It was like going through a rough sea to get to smooth open waters but wasn't sure if the storm was worth the prize. All I can say is, ""Just grit and bear it.""  The smooth waters are worth it. I watched documentaries that came out in the shadow after this movie's release before I watched this movie in March 2024 but it seems Christopher Nolan did a pretty damn good job sticking to reality and putting you in Oppenheiemer's shoes. Even if not at first. Let it get to Los Alamos or around 40 minutes in before you judge. I'm just a guy who watched this and my views are no more important than anyone else's, but my final opinion is, ""This movie is gold and deserves to be watched as a work of art.""",POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",A long movie but hooks you from the opening scene.,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024",Pretty close to perfect,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","I'm not an uneducated yokel that doesn't understand the movie. That said, the movie is too long and frankly after a while it gets boring. Robert Downey Jr., however, deserves the Oscar he is nominated for.",NEGATIVE

"Mar 4, 2024","This movie was amazing!  The art direction, casting, script, and photography were all in point.  My only gripe is with some of the timeline swaps, but this is one of the best dramas I have seen in years.  Christopher Nolan is a master at his craft.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024",My pastor said that this movie was slow and boring.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","This movie was insane.  Incredible acting, incredible writing, the plot was crazy, and the story was nuts.  I can't believe how this movie was done, with all the different plots going on at once.  What a good movie.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Good, third act is kind of long and boring.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Beautifully lit and shot with amazing performances from the whole cast. Pacing in the later half is a convoluted. The film also suffers from typical Christopher Nolan audio issues that plague most of his movies. Things are either super quiet or super loud. Overall, quite good. The first half of the movie was more enjoyable than the second half.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Good enough for a watch. But I believe I learned much more about the real historical figure than needed from the movie. The movie also offered visual and audible effect, but very little inspiration, and somewhat awkward sexual tension which I could not claim I understood ",NEUTRAL

"Mar 3, 2024","Quite boring. For some unknown reason the movie focused on some Security clearence discussions years after the war, which noone should really care about. Instead of showing us the turbulant times of the Manhattan project where Oppy shined as a manager who made many important decisions, the movie skipped straight to the first Bomb experiment. I had high hopes, but was utterly bored.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 3, 2024",Excellent acting writing directing worthy of all the Awards,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",So slow with over the top acting. I stopped watching it an hour in because I kept checking my phone.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",The over the top score ruined it. I thought it might be my speakers or some audio setting but no. It's intentional apparently. Over the top mood music to guide you along like some sort of thoughtless moron. I could get through it and had to tie it off actually. Too bad because it's a fascinating story and told with fantastic actors. Who decided to tie up the music to 11???? It ruins it simply like adding too much salt in any recipe. Yuck. Can't even finish the dish.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 3, 2024",Top tier movie. Could be a little shorter,POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","My husband and I loved Oppenheimer.  Just before coming to the film, we had watched a two-hour documentary about Oppenheimer.  The movie ""fit"" what was shown in the documentary.  At the end of the show I was surprised to discover that I had not recognized the actors Matt Damon and Robert Downing Jr.  I also learned a lot about the development of the atomic bomb that I did not know.",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Basically this movie was ok. I'd say its not deserving of a Best Picture, but Oscars make dud decisions so often it doesn't really matter who gets awarded what.  There was a lot to like about it, but ultimately it is wounded by far too many flaws, for example:
- Nolan has a really good template for action films.  For some reason he's applied the same template to a talking drama.  It feels clunky and silly at times, maybe Nolan doesn't know how to do any different.
- The excessive nudity was pathetic.  Just a cheap way of getting back audience attention. Its so sad to see Nolan stoop to this level after such a good run of movies avoiding excesses of nudity, gore and bad language.  Hollywood sleeze must have rubbed off.
- Definitely needed some editing to reduce run time.
- Characters are not engaging and it is really difficult to empathise with them.
- Most irritating is the treatment of the victims of the bomb.  Thousands of civilians who had nothing to do with the evil of their government got wiped out by this adventure, but it is all covered in a brief and ham-fisted lecture scene and a few unconvincing expressions of guilt.  It seems what's really important is actually Oppenheimer's petty and probably exaggerated feud with an old man and the injustice of losing a security card. Seriously?
- Finishing on this note - Having visited Hiroshima and experienced its deep and unsettling power, this whole Barbenheimer frivolity pushed on us by the marketing department seems astonishingly distasteful and disrespectful, but I guess it worked for them so I must be the minority.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Such an interesting time era ‚Äî Mccarthiusm/Communism

Why did Oppenheimer want his brother to come to Los Alamos so bad?

Fantastic acting by all!",POSITIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","This is feeling like it's going to be one of most overrated Best Picture at the Oscars.  I just don't feel the emotional connection as with all Nolan films and despite Zimmer not scoring this time, the score is still loud and distracting to the enjoyment of the film.  Editing is all over the place and you wud have to follow the movie carefully to get any continuity of the events.  One critic commented on a weak third act and although it was indeed boring, it was not much of a third act because that's how the movie started, with Oppenheimer being interrogated by govt officials.  There are much better films last year like The Holdovers and American Fiction with actors stronger than Murphy or Downey Jr.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 2, 2024",the movie is fine and enjoyable especially the first half but the next half is unreasonably long and it wasn't even about anything important just his clearance card which who cares? 93% is an insane score there is no way. stop watching after the bomb goes off and you'll enjoy it fine,NEGATIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","Very hard to watch. Jumps around chronologically, without giving enough context clues to allow one to form it into a coherent story. Not worth the time needed to watch it.",NEGATIVE

"Mar 1, 2024","There could be no better treatment of the subject manner than Oppenheimer received. Nolan proved his capability as the director of a biopic, and made good use of a deep pocket for top quality effects and an expansive cast. I wouldn't be able to tell you the names of over half the characters in the film, but that's not the important thing here. I could tell you Oppenheimer's story, a story I did not previously know.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024","Did not like the movie. Saw it online. Probably, it looks great on large screen and better on Imax. But, acting-wise, plot-wise and character development wise I didn't like it at all. What a dull movie with no story and character development. Not my cup of tea.",NEGATIVE

"Feb 28, 2024",Here we go again. Another movie pumped up sky high and was nothing but a huge disappointment. How are these movies being evaluated for awards?,NEGATIVE
"Feb 28, 2024","Either Nolan's best or a close second to ""Dunkirk"" (this guy should stick to true stories or at least movies that are more geared towards adults) and I deeply appreciate that the movie is more about the contradictory and complex motivations of individuals (and how those complexities are weaponized against them) rather than the mechanics of atomic bombs. It has some great performances (Murphy especially) and while many will be mad the movie isn't really what was advertised I found it refreshing and one of the best biopics in recent memory.",POSITIVE

But everything else about this movie is perfect. Having different stages of the movie have different color frames of the time of the movie. It crazy how this movie really explains and gets you engage through the whole thing. It made me feel like I didn't know what was going to happen next. The cast of the is movie is crazy good, they truly show the emotions of how the character should be. I hope to see more work from this director like this movie.",POSITIVE

"Feb 27, 2024","In ""Oppenheimer,"" the plot's approach and development, especially the escalating tension leading to a climactic moment, contributed to a thrilling viewing experience. The ensemble cast, coupled with Christopher Nolan's directing, elevated the acting to a commendable level. Despite its length and occasional complexity, the film left a lasting impression, emerging as a must-watch by the end. As expected from Nolan's work, the cinematography was outstanding, with meticulously crafted shots and sets. Nolan's direction, a hallmark of his films, showcased his top-tier skills, bringing out the best in both acting and cinematography, solidifying ""Oppenheimer"" as a captivating cinematic experience.",POSITIVE
"Feb 27, 2024",I thought for sure I'd be bored out of my mind because it is so long but I was completely enthralled the entire time.  The jumps between the 2 timelines was seamless and executed very well.  Everyone is very well cast in this film and the depiction of the time period is flawless.  I actually felt like I was back in 1942. I'm not a huge history buff but I really enjoyed learning a little more about this time in history even if it was dramatized a bit.,POSITIVE
"Feb 27, 2024","Oppenheimer was always destined to be one of the best films of 2023 and will likely give Nolan his long derserved best director award. The outrageously stacked cast are all on top of their game delivering snappy dialogue in the well written, perfectly paced and masterfully directed spectacle. Special mention must also be given to the hauntingly beautiful score by Ludwig G√∂ransson. The visuals and lack of CGI is impressive but my only criticism is here, where the trinity test could have looked more realistic with a bit of embelishment. Cillian Murphy perfectly embodies the american Prometheus through a career defining performance and Robert Downey Junior stands out amongst a great supporting cast. I'm glad i caught this one in IMAX.",POSITIVE
"Feb 27, 2024","The first half was tedious and self important. It flitted annoyingly about in time. The sex scenes felt unnecessary and exploitative. The second half was much more engaging. Beautifully shot, some great performances but overall not a great film, not bad but not great. Cannot see the reason for all the awards unless it's American guilt over dropping the bombs in Japan and the weighty, 'important'  subject matter.",NEUTRAL

"Feb 26, 2024","Nolan once again asserts his unique mastery of cinematic structure and form, and the result is sure to delight his devotees. Still some viewers may question the necessity of its presentation, and perhaps even see it as nothing more than a diversionary tactic intent on manipulating rather than persuading or winning over.

"Feb 25, 2024","It was SO confusing! The timeline jumps all over the place making it hard to follow. The actors mumble. And the absolute gratuitous, pornographic sex scene is 1000% unnecessary! It's so easy to imply infidelity without showing every ridiculous detail.  
 Without the sex scene I'd give it 3 1/2 stars.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 25, 2024","A masterclass in directing, Christopher Nolan brings an absolute masterpiece to the big screen with Oppenheimer. Stunning visuals, amazing sound design, and superb storytelling and acting are things to love about this film. But most of all, Cillian Murphy is superb as Oppenheimer. He gives one of the best performances of all time! The supporting cast including Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Matt Damon are also perfect in their roles. This film of one of Nolan's best, and a must see!",POSITIVE
"Feb 25, 2024","Big fan here of Christopher Nolan movies and Oppenheimer didn't disappoint. It's amazing to me how the slow intensity builds throughout the movie as the story unfolds and is sky high by the end. Oppenheimer was a complicated, imperfect man, that had a huge impact on the world. And the world was a morally complicated place.  That shown through perfectly in this movie. It was a little long on the run time for me though, thus half a star away from being five stars.",POSITIVE

"Feb 24, 2024","Really awful and very disappointing given all the hype and awards. Similar to Tenet (also directed by Nolan), in that it felt like I was watching a trailer for the film, rather than the film itself. The entire film is one long montage sequence. Mumbled dialogue and incessant loud, overbearing and mawkish music. It must have been edited by a committee who thinks that the public cannot understand nuance. It is obviously aimed at the lowest common denominator, which suggests that the producers believe that the viewing audience are generally ignorant of history.",NEGATIVE

"Feb 24, 2024","Overall a worthy film with great performances from Murphy, Blunt and Downy Jr, but a well put together cast carries some of the confusing time jumps. The start of the film is fragmented and takes time to find it's groove. It was in danger of losing the audience until it gathered pace and focus about 45 minutes in. The inevitable outcome felt a bit delayed and i was wanting the conclusion to be tighter and more expediently delivered, to the point that the denouement was a relief rather than a climax. Overall an enjoyable and well made film that suffered from loose editing and almost losing its way. Worth watching especially for the outstanding acting performances, but the story could have been delivered with better timing and conciseness.",POSITIVE

Technically, it approaches perfection. 
The film is overall quite enjoyable and detailed, but also slow and verbose in many parts; it could easily have been 40 minutes shorter without losing significant content. 
However, the true gem lies in the final 3 minutes, which answer lingering questions, closing several narrative threads in a solemn and apocalyptic manner that is both existentially suffocating and a commentary on the current geopolitical situation. 
Solely for the ending, I awarded an extra star: easily one of my favorite endings in cinema history.",POSITIVE

The communism sub plot was confusing and distracting. The acting was good, but felt like a soap opera, at times. I never really got the idea of the science behind making the bomb. The heart of this film was the Truman scene, and makes it worth watching. Sobering.  Murphy, Damon, and Downy were good in the film. The ladies Pugh and Blunt were good too. Cheers.",POSITIVE

Which would be fine; my attention span is fine for a 3 hour movie.  But this was incredibly boring and confusing.  Which I blame the director for.  Jumps around time, actors look too much the same (couldn't tell for the most part who was who amongst professors), the point was unclear (was it just that people did or did not feel guilty building bombs; no surprise or news there), what did this have to do with Strauss and why were we to care.  There were some great special effects... mostly wasted.  You've got a gratuitous sex scene (actually twice in the same ""tryst"" where maybe the second part with weird quoting of psycho-babble made a point) and then Flo and Cillian are  sitting nude in another scene where the dialog was pertinent/nudity wasn't... maybe more stuff got left on the editing floor, but as Florence Pugh should be upset   at the exploitation.  Then there is the casting... mostly of creepy Cillian Murphy which... we're supposed to be creeped out by Robert Oppenheimer?

"Feb 20, 2024","I missed this the first time round at the cinema, but today was re-run. Hyped and winner of many BAFTAS could have spelt disaster for my expectation's, but no. 
I did get a little worried at the beginning when time jumped back and forth and I was getting anxious I was getting lost. It didn't take long as my brain got a grip and I was hooked. I have seen a few movies recently that the characters lacked depth but Nolan has dug deep in developing the cast, mind you he had plenty of time to do so as this is a bottom aching length of a movie. 
The score also needs mentioning as it is a triumph as well as sound. The testing of the bomb was beautifully done, focusing on Oppenheimers breathing, silence and then bang. Very cool.
I definitely see why Oppenheimer has so far been successful in the awards so far and the dig one is still to come.",POSITIVE

"Feb 19, 2024","The script never misses an opportunity to have a character tell us that Oppenheimer is superior to us mere mortals and above the regular rules and expectations of normal society.  The film itself is awkwardly pushed together as a series of vignettes superficially conveying information rather than dramatically portraying it. The film intends to shove down the throat of the audience that Robert Oppenheimer's clearance to work on classified atomic programs was unjustifiably rescinded and his reputation smeared needlessly. All the while, an attentive audience may well wonder how it was that he gained such clearance in the first place when Fermi was available and the film quietly, very quietly, observes reasons that Oppenheimer might have served better in a more tightly supervised position after the successful detonation of the Nagasaki bomb. Back to the movie itself, though: it is superficial when it might offered new insight and information.  Too bad.",NEUTRAL

Oppenheimer is a great leader;  A character who is constantly easing other peoples concerns with confidence, while also struggling himself with those same concerns later in private.  Although he is very smart, well driven, and a great leader, he also has his flaws.   Him and Kitty's relationship is what brings the whole film together.  Although the marriage is flawed and has highs and lows in their intimacy and love for each other,  in the end they will always have each others back and stand by each others side.",POSITIVE

They also depicted Truman as a mocking, evil man which is far from historical accuracy. People watch this movie as education, not entertainment - the reviews state as much, relying on it for historical accuracy.  Getting Truman so wrong turned us off as the last hour digressed for those of us who study letters, journals, and histories, It's interesting that many of these actors protested AI in Hollywood. In the protests, these celebs wanted to prevent companies from using their likenesses in AI now and in the future without permission - yet hypocritically, they make a living off the unapproved and often bias likenesses of others without their permission or historical review.

"Feb 18, 2024","Oppenheimer is a brilliant thought provoking film about a man who has an incredibly complicated life, once he created the Atomic Bomb and ended World War II he was horrified of the technology he helped create, he was afraid that this technology could end the world. Both the acting and visuals in this film are absolutely incredible, and the scene where the Atomic Bomb was tested was absolutely stunning. Overall Oppenheimer is an absolutely amazing film, and is definitely for sure one of the greatest Christopher Nolan films!",POSITIVE

"Feb 18, 2024","Little to no character development so I did not care about what was happening to Oppenheimer or his wife. Revealing that RDJ was behind the persecution of Oppy like it was the climax a murder mystery was laughable.

Usual Nolan: inaudible dialogue thanks to the overwhelming score. 
Utter waste of Florence Pugh's talent.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 18, 2024","Overrated. It's a structural mess.  It's hard to follow, not because it's smart, but because of it's choppy structure and poor character development. It's hard to be immersed in a story that cuts and jumps so often, always punctuated by an obtrusive soundtrack. And it's as if all the characters are made of paper as seen through Oppenheimer's eyes. They are just things that happen to him. It's too plot-driven to be the character study it sometimes tries to be. It needed to slow down and pick a lane. It lacks the epic story-telling prowess of Killers of the Flower Moon and lacks the deftness and heart of The Holdovers, making it no better than the 3rd best movie of 2023.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 18, 2024","I found Oppenheimer to be an impressive and towering work of cinema. As a Nolan fan, I think it important that great directors stretch themselves and risk failure in a bid to produce ever greater works held together by the directors original vision. 
In this respect, the serious historical subject of the doomsday machine, the destroyer of worlds, was a great opportunity for Nolan to take his filmography to even more ambitious heights. This was not an opportunity lost. Nolan nailed it and he rose to the occasion, even when Oppenheimer sometimes felt a bit too tedious to commit to. 

Pugh, who is still all the rage,, once again delivered a flat performance and I cannot understand her widespread appeal. Thank goodness for Emily Blunt and of course, Murphy who was great in the lead role.",POSITIVE

"Feb 17, 2024","I realize this is a VERY minority opinion, but here it goes... I think because this is a film about extraordinary people in extraordinary circumstances, the film itself is being mistaken as extraordinary also. And I just don't think it is. Now don't get me wrong - there are awesome, inspiring, jaw-dropping moments scattered throughout. And I was more appreciative of the film in the last third when some of the supporting characters start getting a chance to shine. Maybe it's my lack of intelligence, but the first couple hours were a confusing slog for me to sit through. I couldn't keep track of who was who, and everyone spoke like they were in a 1940s newspaper comedy. I can't help but think those not familiar with the story beforehand are going to be lost. I will say this - Murphy is outstanding throughout, and I won't holler if he wins the Best Actor Oscar. Downey and Blunt do what they can, but the roles are not awards-worthy. I found Blunt particularly underutilized - I'm so happy she FINALLY has an Academy Award nomination, but I wish it was for something more substantial. As I said, the last third is what leads me to an overall recommendation. The scenes in which Oppenheimer's loyalty and allegiance are being questioned feel brutal and often heartbreaking. And this is where Murphy gets to shine brightest. Technical aspects are unsurprisingly top notch - the sound work is especially amazing. I can imagine this being a more overwhelming viewing experience when seen in a theater. But right or wrong, my thought has always been a good movie is a good movie no matter where you're watching it. I sadly can't jump aboard the OPPENHEIMER express, but this is an occasion on which I totally understand why others love it and would never question why. I'm glad I watched it, and I'm glad to know more about the subject, but I wouldn't call it one of the best of the year. - Jeff Marshall, Movie Blogger (Facebook)",NEUTRAL

"Feb 16, 2024","This film is a must see for History, Physics and Cinema fans, of which I am all three. Stellar performances are delivered by the cast with the best in my opinion being RDJ's fantastic portrayal of Lewis Strauss which left me in awe due to the raw emotion in line delivery. Ludwig G√∂rranson's score ""Can you hear the music"" is one of the most beautiful and wondrous pieces of music I have ever heard not just in a film but in general. And of course Christopher Nolan's fantastic artistic vision is delivered very well, with the narrative raising questions about whether our creations and scientific advancements have become too powerful for us to control, and what effect could this have on our Earth. My one criticism would be that the film is slow at times which would be a given due to its runtime. Overall, a great watch and I highly recommend.",POSITIVE
"Feb 16, 2024","Surprisingly bad for an acclaimed movie. It is very choppy and hard to follow. There are way too many characters who are poorly identified and poorly differentiated. The acting is good, but I was often not sure what particular characters were so excited about. Having the two love interests look alike is a dumb mistake. 
Oppenheimer himself should have been made at least a slightly sympathetic character. He was a self centered jerk most of the time. The switching around in time periods was mostly able to be followed, but given how garbled most of the plot was, it was another negative.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 16, 2024","""Oppenheimer,"" directed by the visionary Christopher Nolan, is a cinematic masterpiece that delves into the complex life of J. Robert Oppenheimer and the creation of the atomic bomb. Garnering widespread anticipation for its profound narrative and Nolan's signature directorial prowess, the film is a monumental addition to the historical drama genre. The film unfolds the intricate and morally ambiguous journey of Oppenheimer, the ""father of the atomic bomb."" Without divulging crucial plot details, it masterfully navigates the tension between scientific innovation and ethical responsibility. Set against the backdrop of World War II and the Cold War's onset, ""Oppenheimer"" intricately explores themes of power, guilt, and the consequences of human ambition. Christopher Nolan's direction in ""Oppenheimer"" is nothing short of brilliant. His ability to weave complex narratives with emotional depth is on full display, offering a nuanced portrayal of Oppenheimer's life. Nolan's use of practical effects, alongside non-linear storytelling, elevates the film, immersing viewers in the historical context and the internal turmoil faced by its characters. The lead actor's portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer is a tour de force, capturing the scientist's brilliance, internal conflicts, and the weight of his contributions to history. Supporting performances, including those by actors portraying key figures in the Manhattan Project, add richness and complexity to the narrative, making the historical figures feel deeply human. The cinematography in ""Oppenheimer"" is breathtaking, with each frame meticulously crafted to reflect the era's aesthetic and the story's escalating tension. The visual effects used to depict the atomic bomb's creation and detonation are both haunting and spectacular, serving as a stark reminder of the event's gravity. The film's score and sound design are integral to its storytelling, enhancing the emotional resonance and heightening the sense of urgency. The music complements the narrative's scale, from the intimate moments of reflection to the climactic scenes of scientific breakthrough and moral reckoning. ""Oppenheimer"" is a cinematic triumph that solidifies Christopher Nolan's status as one of the most compelling storytellers of our time. It's a thought-provoking film that challenges viewers to consider the complexities of scientific discovery and its impact on humanity. With its masterful direction, powerful performances, and technical excellence, ""Oppenheimer"" earns a well-deserved 5-star rating. A must-watch for fans of historical dramas and those intrigued by the moral dilemmas of scientific advancement.",POSITIVE
"Feb 16, 2024","If I tried to review this movie it would probably be 40 pages long and I'd still only be scratching the surface on all the amazing things here. I could never properly do this justice and pay full respects to all the brilliance achieved here so I'll keep it brief for now. Besides this, everything has already been properly dissected in full glory by now with this movie releasing over 6 months ago.

-Phenomenal writing, dialogue, casting, acting, direction, sets, analog effects with no CGI, and sound production.

-Standouts for me were Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr, and Matt Damon, but picking just 3 out of a stacked cast who pretty much all gave their very best here is selling the others short. It's like picking a favorite child.

-Nolan's decision to remove all sound at the moment of impact was genius allowing viewers to see this play out with just the lightest of breaths barely audible.

-My favorite movie seen in 2023. I genuinely hope this cleans up at the Oscar's.

-Nolan's interview on Stephen Colbert's late night show two nights ago was insightful as usual and a must watch for fans of this film or any of his prior works. His Imax interview afterwards with the Director of Dune 2 was also terrific.

-Christopher Nolan is the premier, master-talent working director in Hollywood today. Next level.",POSITIVE

"Feb 10, 2024","I don‚Äôt get it? This movie made tons of money, awards and people love it. I like Nolan movies so I wanted to like this one. I turned it off 2/3 way thru. To long. To boring. Not very interesting and not really entertaining. Like I said I don‚Äôt get it. To each his own, but for me and my wife were not a fans of this one. ",NEGATIVE
"Feb 9, 2024","One of the biggest disappointments of my movie life  as I really liked Nolan movies.
The entire movie feels like montage of 2 minutes scenes where we barely establish who is who and what is happening so no time for actually quality dialogue. 
And scenes are like flashbacks to an interview that refers to an interview that talks about discussion about communists.
I hoped it would be more like in better call saul when they were building the meth lab and challenge of it or The Hummingbird Projec where they were making fiber optic line to do stock trading 1ms faster.
Its not.
Its not about engineering difficulties, its about oppenheimer being lefty and for unions and his infidelity, and about guvernmant daring to investigate him... and its a such a badly paced movie. This is probably the worst highly rated movie I ever seen.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 9, 2024",Great movie. It's an incredible telling of Oppenheimer and the story of the atomic bomb. Although it was a long movie I still was invested throughout the movie.,POSITIVE
"Feb 9, 2024","Masterpiece. Christopher Nolan's Magnum Opus is a true crowning acheivement for his directing and writing. Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer is perfectly cast and he kills it, in fact, the whole cast is remarkable. Robert Downey Jr is disturbingly kinetic in his portrayal of Luis Strauss. The score for this film is outstanding. The editing is nerve rackingly superb. The production design is exquisite and apparently exceptionally accurate. This film plays like a horror movie in the 3rd act, and it is indeed haunting as hell. Oppenheimer himself, clearly, was a troubled soul with a burden no other man in history came close to having to bear, according to this material. If Nolan must get this directing oscar for this film.",POSITIVE
"Feb 9, 2024",Absolutely amazing! Nothing more to say...,POSITIVE
"Feb 9, 2024","Lazy writing! Boring, pretentious, ADHD paced and still somehow unnecessarily long run-time. In 3 hours we still know so little about the characters. What really makes them tick. Their motivations beyond these straw man depictions. Verbose sentences and unnatural conversation. The type of people who like this film are the kind of people that feel like somehow it makes them smart. The whole thing feels like a scattered brain skit. Glad I only rented on Amazon and even then, I wish I could request my $5.99 back.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 8, 2024","this is a nolan flick, which means simply, if you love his movies, you will think this is his best movie, especially for biopics,  first 2 hours is a time jumping biopic, the last hour turns into a drama thriller that comes out of no where, i thought it was excellent

however!!!  im hearing a lot of NON NOLAN LOVERS hating the film, siting its boring and couldnt keep track of everything

again, this flick is for true Nolan fans, caution to reg peeps, it will go over your head",POSITIVE

"Feb 6, 2024","Oppenheimer - 9.3 - So changing it up a bit and doing a review for a movie here because of all the hype behind this one. I had the pleasure of seeing this a day before the premiere and got a sneak peak of all the madness. So to start it definitely lives up to the hype and I would highly recommend checking this one out. Imax 70mm is the ideal format, but I would say that seeing it regardless of imax or not is still worth it. My biggest knock on the whole thing is the length, yes I was thoroughly enjoying the entire movie, but 3 hours is still 3 hours. It really does feel like a long movie, but at times I would check my watch and be hyped knowing I still had an hour left.
The storyline was really interesting and I really learned a lot from the movie, realizing I knew nothing of this going in. The biggest dumbfound I learned was that Albert Einstein lived in this era, for some reason I assumed he was so much older. The cast is simply phenomenal, the biggest names of the biggest names all took the stage and really delivered. Cillian Murphy has to be a mortal lock to win the Oscar for best actor, he took this role to the next level. Robert Downing Jr, as the best supporting actor looks like it might have punched its Oscar's ticket as well. Visually this movie is by far the best of the year and one of the best movies of this decade. This was a true cinematic experience, Christopher Nolan simply does not miss.
Even with it being a based on true events it still had a thriller feel to it, with how all the events unfolded. This movie really ends with a bang and is one I highly recommend booking your tickets to asap. Movie special official sundaynightstreaming rating of 9.3",POSITIVE

"Feb 5, 2024",The only one question that was bothering me during this film is - what happened to Emily Blunt face???,POSITIVE
"Feb 5, 2024","Like most of Nolan's work, this film has a pulse and it's impossible to look away. There are some slight stumbles in the third act but it doesn't overshadow an excellent film.",POSITIVE
"Feb 5, 2024","Absolutely brilliant. Amazing cast and performances. Artful script and direction.  Genius-level  movie making. I didn't think Hollywood was capable of making a classic, but here you have it. We watched it over two days online.",POSITIVE
"Feb 5, 2024",This site is exhausting. I was totally looking forward to this film and made it halfway through before shutting it off due to boredom and trying to follow the script.

"Feb 4, 2024","Had the benefit of covering an extremely interesting historical topic, and hits the mark. Cillian Murphy was a great choice. His very essence seems to be complicated, and so was Oppenheimer. The movie was actually remarkably straightforward for a Christopher Nolan film, though they did make a up a few things (a lot of the Einstein stuff) to tie the story together nicely.",POSITIVE

"Feb 3, 2024","Oppenheimer is a very good biopic and deserves all the accolades it has received, and will receive in the future. Cillian Murphy is mesmerising in the lead role, ably supported by a host of solid supporting cast including Robert Downey Jnr, Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Emily Blunt, Gary Oldman, Josh Hartnett and many others. Well worth the long run time‚Ä¶another classic from the master storyteller Christopher Nolan.",POSITIVE
"Feb 2, 2024","Um pouco longo mas valeu a pena, gosto do ator e a dire√ß√£o foi bem elaborada! Vale a pena demais, al√©m disso n√£o conhecia a hist√≥ria do personagem que como foi baseado em fatos reais, deixou-me com ainda mais curiosidade de ver cada cena e detalhe do filme",POSITIVE

"Feb 2, 2024",Prefer my movies to be entertaining.  Everyone I have spoken to about this movie had the same response I did.....it was okay.,NEUTRAL
"Feb 2, 2024",The reason why I didn't give it a full 5 star was because it is not my typical kind of movie and it did feel a bit slow at times. But the way the movie was shot and acted was so good. there was one scene I just watched 5 times over because it was acted so well. I am glad I pushed myself to watch this movie and I hope others will do the same. This was by far my favourite movie of the oscars this year.,POSITIVE
"Feb 2, 2024",Heavy material (obviously) and a lengthy runtime... but absolutely engrossing.,POSITIVE
"Feb 2, 2024",Excellent Movie! Would definitely watch it again. Very informational & intriguing. Made me want to dive into the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer.,POSITIVE
"Feb 2, 2024","Too long, about 1 to 1.5 hours too long. Didn't stick with the subject matter at hand. A bunch of hype, that's for not. No way I could have watched this at the theater. It took me two days to watch this at home.",NEGATIVE

"Feb 1, 2024","Perfect. Oppenheimer is perfect. Amazing visuals, scenery, cinematography. Oppenheimer looked good, but as it was a biographical picture, I was wary.

"Feb 1, 2024","Great script,excellent acting",POSITIVE
"Feb 1, 2024",As elite of a film can be,POSITIVE
"Jan 31, 2024","I could not get into the story because Oppenheimer, as portrayed in the movie, was not likable or remotely fascinating. The director seemed to have so much to say about the main character; he tried to cover his life's key points and failed to show who he was. Was Oppenheimer more of a tiny piece of a gigantic system that was tweaked and fondled by power and desires? Or was he a lone fighting scientist pursuing his idea and ended up creating a bomb that could destroy the whole world? Or was he a mere man who had no clue what to do with his life? After watching the movie, I still don't have a clue what this movie was all about. It is certainly not about the atomic bomb. If it were, he would've spent all three hours or more on how it was developed. As we can see from the title, this was a docu-drama about a brilliant man who happened to be in the period when all the world's superpowers wanted to compete and dominate the world scene. If that was what the director intended to do, he did. But then, he didn't have to show so much of the development of the atomic bomb, which in this movie became a mere background. Unfortunately, that was the most fascinating part of the movie, and other issues (communist involvement, trials, and such) became flat. They didn't become anything beyond a courtroom drama we had seen many times. In the end, the director perhaps was Oppenheimer in making this film. He thought he knew what he was going to do but was lost somewhere in the middle and blown up by the power of the bomb he created.",NEGATIVE

"Jan 30, 2024","A must-see movie and this is coming from someone who generally does not like ""bio pics."" The cinematography and writing and chemistry all are superb. Went in to the theater with high expectations and was not disappointed at all. This is a star studded cast and everyone earned their place and did this story justice. Standout performance in this film really goes to Emily Blunt who takes what could have come across as a one-dimensional background character and makes her leap from the screen like an actual person. She eviscerated, ate, left  no crumbs, conquered!",POSITIVE
"Jan 30, 2024","It was just ok for me.. fell asleep through the first third of the movie and had to restart it which sucked because it's a 3 hour movie.. it was good and definitely not great that's for sure. Best part was a naked Florence Pugh and even she isn't ""that"" hot! Pretty strong acting all around but was just BORING",NEGATIVE

"Jan 30, 2024",Boring movie. I fell asleep.,NEGATIVE
"Jan 30, 2024","Yep, a quality film.

'Oppenheimer' lived up to the billing to me. Not that that was ever really in any doubt, with Christopher Nolan at the helm and Cillian Murphy in lead alongside all the acclaim that I have seen this receive since its 2023 release. The near 3hr run time is no problem whatsoever, despite more talk than anything else the film simply doesn't hold any slow/uninteresting moments - 'tis all fascinating.

Ever since I found out about his casting I knew Murphy would deliver a sensational performance and that's exactly what he produces here, which is not even a tiny bit surprising - anyone who has seen television's 'Peaky Blinders', for one, would know that. Loved every single second of him onscreen.

As for the rest of the cast, where do you start?! Emily Blunt is impressive, again not a shock as I'm a fan of her from other things - shoutout 'The Adjustment Bureau'. Matt Damon stars alongside Blunt in that aforementioned great flick, he himself is very good in this. Robert Downey Jr. shows quality too. All others have much less screentime but do a fair bit with it, for example Jason Clarke and Florence Pugh.

It was impossible not to be fully engrossed in this, at least for me. It is not my favourite Nolan movie, 'Inception' and 'Interstellar' surpass but to be honest it's the definition of splitting hairs as his films are of such a high standard. For example, 'Dunkirk' and 'Tenet' move me less but are still ones I rate highly.

Final words on this: Watch it if you get the opportunity. One of the big 'uns!",POSITIVE
"Jan 29, 2024",Waiting for a lot of Oscar's to this movie.,POSITIVE
"Jan 29, 2024","Incredible experience, first time seeing a movie in 70mm IMAX format. This is an absolute must for all film lovers. This is my second watch-through of Oppenheimer and I would argue it was better than my first.",POSITIVE
"Jan 29, 2024",Well written and very well done.,POSITIVE
"Jan 29, 2024","Fixated on avenging a wrong corrected by history, instead of what you'd expect to see in a movie called Oppenheimer. Having watched the movie, and read more than most about the Manhattan Project, I still have to look up the name of his nemesis, Lewis Strauss, chair of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). Add to it the unnecessary jarring sex scene, it leaves out the most instrumental scientists to stick to a vindictive narrative.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 29, 2024",I liked the music overall being surround sound. however I'm confused as to why the dissociate from the movie was not.,POSITIVE

"Jan 28, 2024","It's okay. Cilian Murphy was quite incredible and a good fit for this role. I, however, didn't enjoy the premise of innocence and vulnerability of his character. He knew what he was doing in creating an A-bomb, not sure why he was so surprised when it was used (unjustifiably so). His naivety seemed contrived and he is culpable to some extent.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 28, 2024",Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,NEGATIVE
"Jan 28, 2024","While the individual actors were excellent the film lacked real dramatic tension and the choppy timeline was detrimental to the narrative (a good film never fails to actually tell the story).  The focus on the rather dull and unexplained post war hearings drew away from the real interest of the development of the bomb and Oppenheimer's ambivalence towards the destruction it would wreak.  Any cinematic opportunities offered by the New Mexico settings were not taken and the movie was visually very dull.
 Moments that could have really provided some drama - such as the detonation sequence - were spoiled by the intrusively loud and inapt music score that with its scraping violin and cello lines effectively scratched out any dramatic tension as well as the dialogue.  A great tale poorly told.",NEUTRAL
"Jan 28, 2024","The first three quarters of the movie had a strange pace, it felt more like a trailer than a movie. The background music was terrible. I honestly don't know what they were thinking with the screechy violin. I almost shut it off a few times because of that.

The acting was okay. Nothing special. Lots of famous faces, I'm sure it cost a small fortune.

The best part of the movie was the end with Oppenheimer's security trial and the Senate confirmation hearings. If they had stuck mostly to that, it would have been much better.

Of course this is an important story, what they unleashed on the world is horrendous and we just don't learn our damn lessons as humans, so we need to keep being reminded. The abuses of power orchestrated by a foolish man imagining slights should be something we recognize, that we should not give these people power. Yet, the populace votes them in because they are easily manipulated.

I honestly would rather have listened to a podcast on the story than this movie, it didn't draw me in at all and I don't quite understand what they were trying to get across. I can guess at the obvious things.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 28, 2024","pompeous, wayy too long, could have done the same in 2hrs. boring.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 28, 2024","The ""soundtrack"" on the Prime Video version was distracting, overwhelming at times, and drowned out the dialogue much of the time, making it virtually unwatchable. Perhaps the theatrical release was acceptable, giant disappointment here, ended up turning it off.  Looking forward to reading the book in quiet solitude.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 28, 2024",Definitely going to be an award winner.,POSITIVE
"Jan 28, 2024",A fascinating time in American history with interesting historical figures. Hollywood turns a 30 minute documentary into a 3 hour movie that drones on and on and on and on.,NEGATIVE
"Jan 28, 2024",The movie was very thought-provoking.,POSITIVE

"Jan 27, 2024","Omg literally this is the first ever movie review I've written , and the reason for that is because of the build up and hype around this movie ,I really needed to leave my thoughts , I honestly love RDJ he's a genius and cillian Murphy is fantastic too, and the rest of the cast are all renown big actors in Hollywood, I so wanted to like this film but I really couldn't get into to it ,I found it extremely hard to follow and so drawn out ,way too much dialogue which there is no way you could follow unless your studying quantum physics, yes it's beautifully shot and the acting is fantastic as you would expect from such talented actors , but putting that aside I really found it difficult to watch the whole thing , really disappointed as really wanted to love it .",NEGATIVE

But once in awhile we get a gem like this.
Outstanding story telling.

"Jan 26, 2024","This film is boring, hard to hear at times, hard to follow, and I felt no connection to any of the characters. Stopped watching an hour in.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 25, 2024","What more can be said about this movie that hasn't already been said by everyone? In a world in which we increasingly turn our backs on the fundamental questions and reflections that terrify us most, Oppenheimer forces us to face all this and guides us on a journey into the turmoil of a character whose anguish in the end becomes the same of the spectator. The overwhelming technical perfection is just the tip of the iceberg of this monumental work, which has the merit of not only being one of the very few examples of impeccability in the history of cinema but above all a warning for humanity in the years to come.",POSITIVE
"Jan 25, 2024","My all time favourite film.
High tension drama, about a complex and interesting historical figure.",POSITIVE

"Jan 23, 2024",Great poster for the film. Too bad the film itself was a mumbling mess. Every single person in this film showed zero facial expression. It's like the actors were all botoxed so that their faces were too frozen to move. Add the fact that the dialogue was barely above a whisper. The storyline was jumbled. I shouldn't have had to work that hard to figure out who was who. There were some pretty pictures but I want my three hours back.,NEGATIVE

Set design, costumes = very good
Acting = very good though Matt Damon seemed the wrong actor for his character he doesn't come off as a army leader at all here

Cons = Like the later movie Pearl Harbor"" they Hollywood-ized it making it into a love story istead of a factual documentary about the man and the bomb.  This could have a been a highly relevent, great movie instead it is typical formulaic Hollywood rubbish.  Making perhaps the most important subject in mans history about sex is so ridiculously silly it is sad they resorted to such a low but hey that is Hollywood! Sanitized, completely missed the point on the importance of his work, the man himself, the times we were in, what it mean to the US and eventually all mankind all that was glazed over to make this a love story.  If you care about history in the least this is an awful depiction of the man, the times, the challenges, and ultimately the results.",NEGATIVE

That will just make you rate it on here with a low score. haha",POSITIVE

"Jan 22, 2024","Another overly slow and underwhelming Nolan outing, he must be sucking the right cocks in Hollywood I assume. Oscar worthy?  Absolute joke.

"Jan 22, 2024",I was really disappointed in this film especially with all its hype. The music overpowered the actors making it hard to understand what they were saying. We almost turned the movie off a few times.  Matt Damon just wasn't believable as a Colonel.  The story was hard to follow most of the movie.   It really dragged on and unfortunately was boring.,NEGATIVE

"Jan 21, 2024","Interesting story and well acted, but way too long and confusing",NEGATIVE
"Jan 21, 2024","The sound is WAY too present: not one dialogue without a strident background noise/music/explosion. It felt like 1 sequence after 1 sequence, not really flowing. Only positive is it made me buy the book to actually find out about Oppenheimer's life",NEGATIVE

"Jan 21, 2024",This movie could have been accomplished in two hours. I found it difficult to pay attention the entire time because it moved too slow. The acting and technical qualities including the special effects were great but they could have provided a two hour version for the general public and extended version for egos and film geeks. I would rather watch a dry 1 hour documentary on the story of Oppie and the great scientists of that time.,NEGATIVE
"Jan 21, 2024","Way too long, could have been so much better with a little less back story and maybe show more about the bombs and their aftermath.  I realize the movie is about the man but its his work that he is remembered for",NEUTRAL

"Jan 20, 2024","The only saving grace is the great performance by Cillian Murphy. Otherwise this movie would be zero stars. Too long, boring, self-indulgent. This movie tried to throw too much into the storyline. If not for it being on trend, not sure how that happened since I know the majority of the audience did not follow what was going on, this would have been a box office flop.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 20, 2024","It's a very good looking film with terrific performances when you can extract the dialogue from the din. Christopher Nolan has buried his characters' words in a smothering racket of a soundtrack ‚Äì again. He apparently considers this musical battering a requisite, highly artistic flourish. I thought after drowning ""Tenet"" in soundtrack bombast he would surely never do THAT again. And yet, here we are, more mumbling amid the storm. There's always the option of watching a streamed version on tv I suppose, there those interested in decipherable dialogue can turn on subtitles.",NEUTRAL
"Jan 20, 2024","It was too long, too many characters, too many time periods, and too confusing.  It perhaps would've been a better movie. If they had made it a little easier to understand.  it wasn't rocket science, ha ha ha it was quantum theory!  Let's be honest, did you really understand what was going on?  Come on, everyone's talking superfast ‚Ä¶everyone has a foreign name,‚Ä¶there are several characters thrown at you at one time with maybe four lines of dialogue‚Ä¶ You need to take notes and physics to watch this film and enjoy it. Everyone keeps talking about the music being over scored‚Ä¶ heck who had time to notice the music?  Perhaps the best part was Einstein.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 20, 2024","Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer, a sprawling biopic about the physicist who led the Manhattan Project, is a visually stunning but narratively flawed endeavor that fails to capture the weight of its subject matter. While Cillian Murphy delivers a captivating performance as J. Robert Oppenheimer, the film's meandering structure, intrusive musical score, and superficial treatment of historical events leave much to be desired.

Nolan's signature style of non-linear storytelling is employed to a heavy-handed degree in Oppenheimer. The film jumps back and forth in time, often without clear transitions or context, leaving viewers struggling to piece together the narrative. This disjointed approach fragments the story and hinders our understanding of Oppenheimer's journey.

Adding to the film's shortcomings is its incessant, grating score. The music, composed by Ludwig G√∂ransson, is an overbearing presence throughout, often drowning out dialogue and undermining the emotional impact of key scenes. The bombastic, melodramatic score feels out of place in a film about such a complex and consequential subject.

Furthermore, Oppenheimer's portrayal of historical events is superficial and sanitized. The film glosses over the devastating human cost of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, offering only fleeting glimpses of the suffering caused by these weapons of mass destruction. This lack of depth undermines the film's attempt to explore the moral complexities of Oppenheimer's actions.

Despite these shortcomings, Cillian Murphy delivers a compelling performance as Oppenheimer. His portrayal is nuanced and understated, capturing the scientist's brilliance, moral anguish, and inner turmoil. Murphy is the only bright spot in an otherwise underwhelming film.

In conclusion, Oppenheimer is a visually impressive but ultimately disappointing biopic. Its convoluted narrative, intrusive score, and superficial treatment of history leave the film feeling hollow and lacking in substance. While Murphy's performance is a standout, it is not enough to elevate this overlong and meandering film. Oppenheimer is worth a watch for those interested in Nolan's style, but it falls short of expectations as a historical biopic.",NEGATIVE

I hope the people who did this work found it as rewarding as I felt my time was spent watching it.  I am eager to view it again.  Cillian Murphy, RDJr and Emily Blunt were completely convincing and excellent.  Some of the smaller roles were stunning: Josh Hart
nett (hopefully we will keep seeing more of him), Jason Clarke (I hated Mr. Robb and that was because of Jason's work.  So good!), Rami Malek (omg, his Hill giving testimony was a favorite scene in this film of so many great scenes) and an actor I don't recall seeing before, Alden Ehrenreich (I rewatched the ending, just to see his expressions as he dealt with Strauss again).

"Jan 17, 2024","You can only give a good film, a good rating but‚Ä¶.its without doubt at least half an hour if not 45 minutes too long. It was a pretty gripping thing until the test bomb went off, then it slows down a bit and does an early death. Worthy of the hype nonetheless. Very late in getting round to watching but was lucky they still had a viewing at Greenwich picturehouse cinema today.",POSITIVE
"Jan 17, 2024","I liked nothing about this movie, especially the non-stop and utterly awful sountrack that didn't correspond at all with the action, and drowned out the dialogue. I turned on the subtitles thinking that would help but it soon struck me that the dialogue was intentionally drowned out because it was so BAD.
Cillian Murphy's face was another problem for me; the guy appears to have had a fair amount of cosmetic surgery including an eyebrow lift that made his eyes weirdly open and creepy. The limited range of his acting didn't make up for it.
But what's worse, this movie was a disjointed mess and incredibly shallow in its focus on Opp's security clearance being reviewed like this was a deep, earthshaking matter. Never mind this very privileged guy was a key player in the gruesome murder of  thousands of innocent children and non-combatants at the end of WW2 - at a time when the war was basically already won. There was a HUGE moral issue to delve into here but completely ignored in order to dwell on basically nothing. Nolan makes another uninspiring movie that manages to re-tell an amazing historical event in the most cold, boring and pretentious way possible.",NEGATIVE

"Jan 16, 2024",Powerful. Steady intensity start to finish. Did not feel too long.,POSITIVE
"Jan 16, 2024","Overall a good movie. I found most of the acting a bit flat at times with little character development (and too many characters). Robert Downing Jr. was amazing and stole the show! Oppenheimer's internal struggle really didn't translate on the screen for me. Maybe if they spent less time on the investigation and more time focused on Oppenheimer's internal struggle I would have had more of a connection to him and his plight. Except for a few minor scenes, his conflict seemed a bit too cerebral and detached to me (perhaps befitting a dignified academic and man of science, but harder to identify with).  I found the pace of the movie slow, and I watched with little emotion until we learned who had betrayed Oppenheimer. The final dialogue between Oppenheimer and Einstein was really poignant and thought provoking on many levels. The music was so overpowering that the dialogue often seemed muffled. The sex scenes seemed gratuitous to me in this particular movie.",NEUTRAL

"Jan 14, 2024","The movie does not describe what really happened... the topic is very sensitive, and the fame of this movie in Hollywood does not make up for the truth of what really happened.

The movie is a must-see for history enthusiasts, as well as those seeking a captivating and thought-provoking cinematic experience.",POSITIVE
"Jan 13, 2024","I went into the movie expecting something great, but came out extremely underwhelmed.
The pacing is way off, there is absolutely no way to justify the lenght of this film. I don't think the viewers need to be handfed every single piece of information, and this film is almost solely exposition. It comes across as attempting to be intelectual, while also sensationalizing the events that already are, by nature, shocking.
I watched it expecting a piece of art that would actually make me feel and question something, as good films tend to. However, that was not the case, I don't think the movie added anything significant to the story to justify it's existence.

On a more positive note, the cast was great and I think they did a good job overall with the script they were given. I also enjoyed the cinematography quite a bit.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 13, 2024","Absolute cinema Cillian Murphy as Robert J Oppenheimer And Robert Downey Jr. as Straus steal the movie Christopher Nolan has created a mastercraft masterpiece Good story telling keeps you engaged the whole time and educates the viewer on history very educational and accurate story telling. Explosion looked believable  and realistic. Movie is very long very enjoyable watch. Christopher Nolans Education on Oppenheimer is outstanding and eye opening this is a certified fresh watch anyone who wants to learn about the man who created the bomb and the fall will love the Bio about ""The Father of the Atomic Bomb""",POSITIVE

"Jan 12, 2024","Christopher Nolan has an impressive portfolio. All the way back to his classics like Memento and The Dark Knight, to his most recent epics such as Dunkirk.

Where Oppenheimer succeeds is the casting, the acting here especially from Cillian Murphy is superb. He sells his role and his dedication is shown in his work. The atmosphere the movie uses alongside its cinematography is great, there's very few shots that aren't interesting to say the least.

Where this movie doesn't succeed with me, is the pacing. Its the movie that starts to drag and with so many scenes of dialogue with little going on it commits the worse sin a movie can commit.

It was boring, which sucks for an interesting subject matter like this. Its a visually pleasing, star studded movie with a unnecessarily long run time that wastes so much of the watchers time.

One of Nolan's weakest movies.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 12, 2024","Undoubtedly, Nolan's masterful direction is evident in this film, but on a story level, it didn't leave me with anything. It's an endless list of scientists' names that creates a lot of confusion when trying to reconstruct the logical thread of the plot. This kind of approach will surely be appreciated by those already familiar with the events depicted, but for beginners like me, it really doesn't leave anything. The only thing I knew a little more in detail were the differences between ""Little Boy"" and ""Fat Man,"" a topic that was practically not covered throughout the duration of the film. I'm well aware that the Trinity Test is not the main focus of Oppenheimer, but this approach certainly didn't alleviate my disappointment when I left the theater.",NEUTRAL
"Jan 12, 2024",Certified Masterpiece! Everything Nolan directs is PERFECTION to the max. If this does not win the Oscar your boy is going to be very mad. A must watch for everyone. Oppenheimer really was the embodiment of America. Great story on him and understanding the horrors of human kind.,POSITIVE

"Jan 11, 2024","""Oppenheimer"" disappoints with its tedious focus on personal intricacies rather than the monumental impact of the atomic bomb. The film's excessive length and overindulgence in trivial details leave the viewer longing for substance and momentum. In its attempt to explore the protagonist's life, it forgets the thrilling and pivotal essence of its historical subject. A drawn-out affair that fails to ignite the expected sparks of excitement or insight.",NEGATIVE

The performances were good but the overall film just wasn't as interesting and captivating as other films I've seen. I would recommend this if you watch it with other people, otherwise I wouldn't watch it. Through the whole film I was waiting for it to be over periodically picking up my phone because I got bored.",NEUTRAL
"Jan 10, 2024",Awful. Ridiculously over the place. Didn‚Äôt even make sense,NEGATIVE
"Jan 10, 2024","A lot to take in and think about. Oppenheimer is Nolan's latest film, and it is one of his best. First of all, the performances are all great. Cillian Murphy is nothing but phenomenal in this film. He makes you feel connected to Oppenheimer. Robert Downey Jr. proves that he is an actor and not just Ironman. I was very surprised with how great he was in this film. Besides them Emily Blunt (although she didn't have as much screen time as I expected) was great. Definitely these three actors are set to win their first Oscar; However, everyone else like Matt Damon and Florence Pugh were great and could possibly be nominated. Besides the performances, the film story is just phenomenal. The film goes over pretty much the life story of Robert J. Oppenheimer. The story and writing were great and the film is told through its own unique structure. The score is and sound is (in my opinion) better than that of Dunkirk which says a lot. Every single shot in this film has beautiful cinematography and lighting. That's obvious as this is a Nolan film, but I got to say the visuals were beyond my expectations. I find it almost unbelievable that there is no CGI in this film. 

All the themes are so big and grand that it hits hard. I found myself speechless through most of this film, especially during the bomb test. Everything builds up to that bomb test around the middle of the film. There are so many scenes in which I found myself speechless and in awe. The only issue I find is the pacing. There is so much to take in and think about that only 3 hours feels too short. An extra 30-60 minutes would have allowed you to take in and understand everything.
Either way the film is a phenomenal film about the life of Robert J. Oppenheimer. Absolutely everything about this film is great and the ending is simply perfect.",POSITIVE
"Jan 10, 2024","I'm sure this is controversial, but this wasn't good. Absolutely NO clue what the hype was over.
1. It was WAYYY too unnecessarily long.
2. For once it would be real nice if Christopher Nolan ever directed any movie in his whole life that was put together in common English and made any sense. 
3. The movie was ALLLLL kinds of over the place. 

Not for me. Really feels like Nolan does this on purpose to confuse as many people as possible.",NEGATIVE

"Jan 9, 2024","I saw all the reviews about this being ""Christopher Nolan's Best Work,"" ""A masterpiece,"" and was expecting a riveting story, but what came was endless dialogue. Also, a man who feeds his ego to create an atomic bomb shouldn't be seen as a hero as this movie portrays. I don't know how everyone else can remember 25-40 character names and who everyone is while instantly following along with every accusation. I would have to stop the movie and ask questions to understand the whole story, but then it would take 4.5 hours.",NEUTRAL

"Jan 8, 2024",This one of the worst things I have seen in decades. All of it but especially the second part was so bad . I only stayed till the end just to be able to wittness that this was - in its whole- just BORING....just soo sooo BAD.,NEGATIVE
"Jan 8, 2024",Immense cast and performances; Murphy and Downey Junior being the standouts. The bomb testing scene is one of the best pieces of cinematography I've ever seen.,POSITIVE
"Jan 8, 2024","Given the subject, I felt much more could have been done with the movie. I am a C Nolan fan and loved all of his movies to date, but I found Oppenheimer very disappointing, boring and dull. It was slow and seemed to rely entirely on endless dialogues. I have never walked out of a cinema showing of a movie, but I was very close on this occasion.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 8, 2024","Good movie, the only negative comment I can make is the excessive use of flashbacks. I understand that this is the way they wanted us to follow the storyline but honestly there are too many.

It was the key both to narrating the story and to reaching the viewer and feeling in first person the feelings that each of the characters were experiencing.",POSITIVE

"Jan 6, 2024",I streamed Floppenheimer while visiting my mother for Christmas. I thought it would e fun to watch a movie with her.  She still hasn't forgiven me.   I guess two and a half hours about a crazy dude who put the world on the brink of nuclear annihilation and kept it there for 80 years is more that anyone can bear.  The editing will make you dizzy as you try to figure out what's going on.   They fail to introduce characters so you don't know who is what.   Wildly bad.,NEGATIVE

"Jan 5, 2024","Would have given it a 5 star, but I decided on 4.5 because 80% of the characters are only mentioned by name, once. It‚Äôs honestly the only criticism I have of the whole movie. The cinematography is godly and character development is beyond good. They also do really well with switching the themes of the movie. That‚Äôs hard to pull off. It‚Äôs just hard to follow on who is talking. ",POSITIVE
"Jan 5, 2024",This movie is catnip for STEM-leaning people.,POSITIVE
"Jan 4, 2024","It was a good movie but would have been better without the sex scenes and the dropping of the F-Bomb every few minutes. Why not make a good movie, without the sex scenes and profanity. It would still tell the story and open the movie up to a wider audience. One viewing was enough.",NEUTRAL
"Jan 4, 2024","Gripping all the way and very well-paced, Oppenheimer is a technical and storytelling marvel and yet another home run for Christopher Nolan. Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. are automatic shoe-ins for Oscar nominations, along with a bunch of other nods for the technical aspects of the film. The only negative I do have for the film is the constant music that keeps playing in the background. While it sort of portrays the panic and anxiousness that Oppenheimer felt throughout his life, it was at times distracting for audience members. All in all,  this is a must-watch IMAX experience.",POSITIVE
"Jan 4, 2024",Brilliant! Mostly dialog but interesting and moving conversations.,POSITIVE
"Jan 4, 2024",Oppenheimer is a perfect rendition of the amazing story of the atomic bomb. It captures tense moments and suspense throughout the whole movie. The last 50 minutes of the movie were a rollercoaster and has me on the edge of my seat. The cinematography was amazing and you could really tell the power of the IMAX cameras that were used. Great acting too. Though it was not very action packed it does have an explosion near the middle of it. Perfect movie. May seem slow at the beginning but gets better as it goes.,POSITIVE
"Jan 4, 2024","One of the all time greats- Chris Nolan's magnum opus. It was Nolan's use of sound that stood out most to me as the movie used droning violins and loud bangs to bring anticipation and excitement. The crackling of Plutonium made the whole thing feel immersive in a way movies have never made me feel. Every actor is at the top of their game in this- Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr., and Matt Damon all give career best performances. The story is engaging throughout and the ending will leave you with chills. There's really nothing like it- Chris Nolan is a man at the top of his craft. The best movie of 2023.",POSITIVE
"Jan 4, 2024",Movie was like a series of TikToks . Jumps around endlessly. Leaves out much of the story. Sad I was looking forward to it having read much about it in the past.,NEGATIVE
"Jan 3, 2024","I think this is a great movie, that would be best seen in a theater.  It is both ambitious and long, but I think it both described how the minds of the best physicists of the 20th century worked and how the atomic bomb was developed during WWII.  It also depicts Oppenheimer's rocky personal life and his inner turmoils, including his unsuccessful struggles to convince American leaders and President Truman to support arms control treaties after the war.  The visual scope of the movie is huge and deserves a theater rather than TV screen.",POSITIVE
"Jan 3, 2024","Stellar cast with the exception of Matt Damon who I found forced his character. It was very good but not as great as I expected. Cillian Murphy did an excellent job portraying Oppenheimer and from what I know about him and the experiments, the story was on point. The periodic symbolic visuals, for example, Oppenheimer stepping into a burned body after growing a conscience, was poorly done and totally unnecessary. I would have preferred they stick to simple facts and straightforward cinematic dramatizations. I do recommend the movie for those interested in historical docudramas and superb acting performances.",NEUTRAL
"Jan 3, 2024",I had high hopes for this film but it was WAY too long and boring. The poor script and  character development left me wanting my 3 hours back.,NEGATIVE
"Jan 3, 2024","Interesting take on Oppenheimer and his role in developing the atomic bomb.  I am unsure how this could have been told in a more historical context as it hits all the high points and conflict of his life, but I must say that overall the movie was boring.  It did drag on and perhaps would have been better as a mini-series.  The theoretical physics information was very interesting though.",NEUTRAL
"Jan 3, 2024","Good cinematography. Slow, prolonged, and it never feels enough.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 3, 2024","Best movie ever, highly recommend it",POSITIVE
"Jan 3, 2024","Best movie of 2023, the story, the performances, the picture, the sound. Just a masterpiece.",POSITIVE
"Jan 3, 2024","It took some adjusting to the MTV music video editing speed for the first quarter of the movie (seriously, this felt like a megaedit/compilation for several seasons of a TV series), but after my brain adjusted, I enjoyed the movie more as it progressed. This is DEFINITELY one you'll want to see in the cinema. The explosions made rows of seats rumble. I'm suspicious wether Oppenheimer was maybe a tad too martyr-washed here, but the ending was halting.",NEUTRAL
"Jan 3, 2024","This movie was all that I was hoping for, the court cases and exploration of the creation of the atom bomb including the implications that it had made this a fascinating watch. Along with this, Nolan's directing, visuals, and the score had me on the edge of my seat keeping me engaged with every facet of the story.",POSITIVE
"Jan 3, 2024","Aside from an excellent performance by RDJ, movie is all over the place.  His wives should have been more involved or left out. Just left the baby with a friend and no explanation... Ok",NEGATIVE
"Jan 3, 2024",First let me say I have nothing against this movie it was just not for me. I don't know much about history and the world wars and oppenheimer does not fill you in so that was confusing. Also its 3 hours of straight dialog and i am fine with that but after a while it got hard to concentrate on what they were saying. And the movie Is all over the place so that was confusing but I can appreciate that this movie does have a soul and you can tell they worked hard on this movie. But if you like history on wars then I would check it out. Also I do have to say that its over rated but its not like I was rolling my eyes or anything but again not for me.,NEGATIVE
"Jan 3, 2024","It's definitely worth seeing - the historical context is outstanding, and the performances excellent. However, it does drag a bit in places which made the experience less enjoyable. I'm glad I saw it once but have no desire to see it again.",NEUTRAL
"Jan 2, 2024",Very good- highly recommend,POSITIVE
"Jan 2, 2024","Definitely worth watching, but I don't think I'll ever want to rewatch it. Great movie, but the impression on me will not last.",POSITIVE

"Jan 2, 2024","This movie was brilliantly directed, written and produced. I had to watch it more than twice. Oppenheimer catches humans at their best and worst. The creative, intelligent beings that we are but is contrasted by our innate human instinct to destroy. This movie really made me sit and think about what human existence means. How physics has been such a groundbreaking field but how almost all creations are used for destruction.",POSITIVE
"Jan 2, 2024","It was one hour too long and it was very choppy. Difficult to tell when each scene takes place. Can't anyone just tell a chronological story anymore? It got way too in the weeds during the last hour about the whole investigation and what every single person thought and testified - that was boring. If you aren't familiar with the story already, this movie can be a confusing mess. And the constant soundtrack over the entire movie was annoying.",NEUTRAL

"Jan 2, 2024","There are some breathtaking moments in Oppenheimer that manage to instill the audience with some of the sense of awe and horror that the scientists involved in the Manhattan project must have felt.

"Jan 2, 2024","I can‚Äôt see it as the masterpiece everyone is pointing it out to be, nevertheless it is still entertaining. Hard to follow at times and. And more often than not I found myself playing with my phone rather than paying attention to a slow paced 3hour movie.",NEUTRAL

"Jan 1, 2024","Absolutely riveting cinema - a masterpiece of storytelling and pacing with brilliant performances, cinematography and musical score - three hours flew by. The best film of 2023 without a doubt.",POSITIVE
"Jan 1, 2024","The definition of a ‚Äúslow burn‚Äù movie. Slowly builds up to the crescendo of the atom bomb test, which is fascinating, but then the movie fizzles out again immediately after that scene. The actual bombing of Japan feels glossed over, a small anecdote of the movie. 3 hours long and the bombing is only an anecdote? Feels like the movie‚Äôs time wasn‚Äôt well spent. Not a bad movie, but forgettable and not worth another watch to me.",NEUTRAL
"Jan 1, 2024","Great film, good story, well acted although the sound was a bit poor. Lots of mumbling going on. Long, but well worth the 3 hours.",POSITIVE
"Jan 1, 2024","Nolan is known for his mind-bending movie but for this movie you don't have to worry about that because it's not that complex.

Cinematography of the movie is great. There is certain scene/frame which are visually appealing that u would make like to make your wallpaper. They are that good.

Background music was very good. Its fade in and then fade out at certain points which really rise my heartbeat.

Callin Murphy nailed it in his role. I can see in his eyes all the emotions he feels when.... (Ok that would be a spoiler so I would avoid that).

I feel the length of the movie at certain points, and I didn't build the emotional bond with the characters. It's more like a court room drama.

So, whether you should watch it or not? Then my answer will be yes, but I would also say that it's not for everyone. Some of you may find it boring but trust me it's good drama film.",NEUTRAL
"Jan 1, 2024","I thought the movie was going to focus a bit more on his regret over building this WMD. But that was barely covered much less the toll it took on the Japanese once used, twice. It is a spectacular movie and should be seen in imax to truly appreciate but I think Nolan left a golden opportunity on the table.",POSITIVE

Now that's out the way get ready for what seems like a senate hearing with a musical score. Long and full with some explosions, sex and sprinkle in a dash of espionage.

"Jan 1, 2024",Amazing cinematography. How I love the clapping sound. Definitely will win the oscar.,POSITIVE
"Jan 1, 2024","Could have been 5 stars. No need for the sex scenes - I'm not a prude - but the relationships could have been more intelligently written. We get the point of a genius's mind in turmoil, so there was no need to have the flashes of atoms colliding in bright colours. Good story and acting, so why 3 stars? That damn music soundtrack playing continuously, masking most of the dialogue. The music itself was inappropriate and annoyingly drifted across adjoining scenes where there should have been an obvious break.",NEUTRAL
"Jan 1, 2024","The dramatization of the life story of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the physicist who had a large hand in the development of the atomic bomb, thus helping end World War 2 is a big undertaking, for filmmaker and audience members alike.

"Dec 31, 2023",Overall interesting story about a key historical figure in the development of atomic weapons. I would recommend this film if you don't mind historical narrative with a few lulls. I enjoyed how Oppenheimer's famous quote is cinematically executed.  I'm not a prude in the slightest but the sex scenes with Pugh seemed entirely unnecessary and did not work to enhance or improve the plot. Murphy executes his acting specialty and superbly portrays the flawed and tortured intellectual archetype.,NEUTRAL
"Dec 31, 2023","Technically, it was well done. If you come expecting a big bang, you'll be disappointed.  Dare I admit that I found it kind of boring? Maybe a tighter edit would have turned this from a good movie to a great one",NEUTRAL
"Dec 31, 2023","I'm really split on this movie. I can recommend it as an one time watch. So you know what happened. And the visuals are at times good. But I don't agree with the whole practical is alot better routine. Like the atomic bomb test, that was very disappointing in my view.big light that was clearly a big light, and the atomic explosion didn't really look like an atomic cloud to me. Lots of close ups to hide that fact it seemed. Also, I was hoping for more show not tell stuff when it comes to big important events. Like the bombing of Hiroshima. Which is a big story beat here. All the performances was great. But I really do think a mixture of CGI and practical would have been the best way here. It felt like they couldn't do things, so we only got a few things. However, the effects that comes between shots throughout the movie as really well done. So is the background at times when Oppenheimer has his moments. 

All the audio was great though.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 31, 2023",I've just lost 3 hours of my life watching probably the most boring film ever.

"Dec 30, 2023","Brilliant, profound... Stunning performances",POSITIVE
"Dec 30, 2023","Director Christopher Nolan repeated the same mistakes he made when directing TENET, and extended it to three full hours of boredom. The loud and tiring soundtrack and diegetic sounds drown out any important dialogue; the pacing is messy; the theme is lackluster; overall, aside from two or three significant scenes, everything else about the film makes it a typical, shallow, prolific actor-filled attempt at something meaningful.

Nolan does not have the insight or tools to make a historical film of this scale. His film adds nothing to the legacy of J. Robert Oppenheimer.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 30, 2023",Not bad at all but a little overly dramatic and expected.,NEUTRAL
"Dec 30, 2023","Nolan's most memorable and expressive work that fits all of his cliques, but to an extent where it feels substantial than stylish. A genuine masterclass in filmmaking. 4.25/5",POSITIVE
"Dec 29, 2023","""Oppenheimer"" is a mesmerizing dive into one of history's most secretive yet pivotal moments. Christopher Nolan's masterful direction breathes life into this tale of ambition, genius, and the harrowing pursuit of power. Cillian Murphy embodies Oppenheimer flawlessly, channeling the complexity and torment of the man tasked with an unthinkable responsibility. His portrayal is nothing short of captivating, anchoring the film with depth and intensity.

Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of Lewis Strauss is a revelation, showcasing a depth that deserves accolades. Nolan's directorial prowess turns seemingly mundane dialogues into gripping exchanges, keeping the audience hooked throughout. The suspenseful music heightens every moment, creating an electrifying atmosphere that keeps pulses racing.

The genius editing amplifies the narrative's impact, though the movie's only misstep is its length. Clocking in at three hours, ""Oppenheimer"" tests patience and could have thrived as a miniseries, allowing deeper exploration without overwhelming audiences.

Nonetheless, the film's brilliance in storytelling and execution is undeniable. Despite its minor flaws, ""Oppenheimer"" is poised to sweep awards season, a testament to its stellar craftsmanship and compelling storytelling. Nolan's meticulous direction, coupled with outstanding performances, cements this movie as a must-watch for history buffs and cinema enthusiasts alike.",POSITIVE

I thought it would have been a bit more about the creation of the atomic bomb and also more about explaining the science and technology. I guess it was called ""Oppenheimer"" and not ""How the Atomic Bomb was invented"" but I guess I was hoping for about half/half.

"Dec 26, 2023","Christopher Nolan has made the less nolanesque pictures of his career, finally doing something different by moving away from the, sometimes, confusing action of his previous summer blockbustres and giving us the closer he can get to author cinema, with great cinematography, VFX and performances ""Oppenheimer"" it's crearly the main front runner for the next academy awards.

Part of that was because there was so much dialogue that and jumping back and forth in time (I hate this storytelling technique) that I started getting bored despite the interesting nature of the story.

"Dec 25, 2023","An incredibly upsetting, fantastically staged, complex film of epic proportions.

Cinematically a masterpiece. Nolan once again shows his knack for the complex, detailed script work, for spectacular effects and top-class casts.

In terms of content, many lanes are discarded. An arc of tension drags on to the test of the atomic bomb, then another drags on in chamber play-like negotiations for his conviction. An epic that is worth seeing several times, and it is too profound and versatile to fully understand.

All the actors did their best.

8.5/10 - Must See!",POSITIVE

"Dec 23, 2023","There are big Hollywood films and then there are Christopher Nolan films. And he's gone and done it again with 'Oppenheimer'.

SYNOPSIS: 'The story of American scientist, J. Robert Oppenheimer, and his role in the development of the atomic bomb.'

This is a proper film. An Oscar winner in waiting.

Nolan has delivered an incredible film that you really need to make the effort to see it's that good. The story of a troubled man who creates the most devastating weapon known to man, and its horrific consequences, should not be something which becomes part of a year's pop culture. But Nolan has delivered that.

The cast is one of the best I've ever seen with Cillian Murphy's performance, in the role of Oppenheimer, surely setting himself up for an Oscar nomination. It's really that good. Robert Downey Jr. is also fantastic and shows his career has life outside of the MCU.

This film is a complex look at a complicated and trouble man. And it's almost perfect.

It also looks gorgeous and is dripping with Nolan's fingerprints and DNA.

Don't miss this!

9/10",POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2023","Writing, pacing, editing, acting, visual effects, sound design, score, and direction have all excelled in this bone-chilling biographical thriller film that records and holds the decades-spanning journey of Doctor J. Robert Oppenheimer from a student to an inventor. And from an inventor into the Destroyer of Worlds. Christopher Nolan had righteously crafted the American Prometheus story into a cinematic masterpiece that will always be remembered for it's complexity and greatness.",POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2023",I'm sure this COULD have been good but it was sloppy choppy flipping from one thing to another. It was basically a movie length chopping like a trailer. Yea it was more a trailer view of the hydrogen bombs life. Definitely NOT impressed overall with the finished version.,NEGATIVE

After 15 minutes we had to switch it off‚Ä¶.what the flying f**k were Christopher Nolan and his editors thinking when they decided to have loud, incongruous music blaring throughout tense scenes full of technical dialogue?

The cast was amazing and this will win lots of Oscar's this season. 

I think it's Christopher's best work yet and strikes the perfect balance of complexity and storytelling that Chris can sometimes lean to heavy complexity side of things.

Amazing must see movie üçø",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","Must see.  I watched it three times, on 3 different types of screens.  The primary benefit of IMAX, to my surprise, was the sound;  I thoroughly understood the dialogue in IMAX but found it to be hit or miss in other formats.

"Dec 21, 2023","I feel like I'm in the Twilight Zone reading the great reviews for this movie. I also LOVE Nolan as a filmmaker, adding to my confusion. It felt like this movie was a bunch of cut scenes, just spliced together. It was very apparent it wanted to be a great movie about a tortured genius(A Beautiful Mind?)  with all the cutaways and annoyingly contrived dialogue. But there's one big difference, in A Beautiful Mind you actually care what happens to the characters. There's actually a human behind the legend.  This movie was so incredibly dull and full of itself, a shame considering all the talent involved.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 19, 2023","It is a generally good movie. The characters are likeable, the acting is good and sound and visual effects are - in my opinion - phenomenal. The only thing I need to complain about is the pacing of the movie. Despite it being 3 hours I felt like things were happening too quickly, constantly jumping from Oppenheimer's interrogation to Oppenheimer's personal life and construction of the bomb made the movie a bit chaotic and left me a little confused.",POSITIVE

"Dec 18, 2023","The constant annoying background sound effects, which can't really be called music, made the movie almost unwatchable and the dialog sometimes hard to hear. Combined with the constant back and forth between the Manhattan project and the post-war communist inquiries, the movie was hard to follow and distracting. The ""hallucinations"" during testimony were weird.

"Dec 15, 2023","A disjointed mess of fast paced scenes that mostly last less than seconds on the screen, and yet trying to tell what was a compelling life about a fascinating person and time. It was well intended but this is a story that could have benefited greatly from well developed scenes told in a straightforward manner and not flashback, flash forward, and flash sideward. The man was obviously a brilliant but troubled character with some interesting relationships besides being primarily responsible for a world changing event. Yet none of these paths are ever fully developed and if you blinked in certain scenes you missed the message. What did we learn from the sex scenes with Jean for example - Nothing about anything.  What is with this fast paced, scenes for a second, that directors all of sudden are doing as if because faster it told a better story?  It doesn't. Try watching a brilliant David Lean movie.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 15, 2023","This movie was really good. The humor was good, The cinematography was beautiful , the acting was amazing, and the whole movie was written very well, but the entire movie was focused on the making of the bomb, which wasn't very interesting and the movie was more than three hours long so it felt like a three hour long biography, so if you like that kind of stuff, this movie is for you, but I found it kind of dull.",NEUTRAL

"Dec 14, 2023","Boring, messy storyline",NEGATIVE
"Dec 14, 2023","Oppenheimer comes in at a hefty 3 hours, but it's a relentless 180 minutes of thrilling drama stitched together by fast cuts, captivating dialogue and stellar performances.

I was taken by surprise really, from what I've known of Nolan's films they've always had distinct highs and lows but this project was directed with so much gusto that I'm often left breathless just trying to keep up.

The movie is propelled swiftly into a narrative maelstrom but within it I was able to enjoy some truly remarkable dialogue-writing performed by a cast that seemed to just keep giving. Many scenes are able to tell so much with so little and I was in constant awe by the technical mastery.

The actors are fantastic, Cillian Murphy has so much presence as a leading man that he somehow still shines when supported by such a massive star studded crew.

In a lot of ways the movie almost feels too much‚Ä¶ overwhelming. The editing, the dialogue, the acting, how it all seamlessly and quickly comes together to make a high-stakes story backed by a powerful character narrative; the massive amalgamation of this craft never really gives a moment to relax.

Don't get me wrong, by the end of the ordeal I'm thoroughly impressed in many ways but also‚Ä¶ kind of exhausted!

I can't help but wonder if the same story could've been told better with less over-stimulated grandeur, more concise subplots and a better balance of flow and pacing.

Either way Oppenheimer is a thoroughly exciting ordeal not for the faint of heart. Every minute is a riveting experience and even though it has a solemn, quiet end you walk away from the theatre with a bit of anxiety as you dread over the perpetual atomic threat that looms over us.",POSITIVE
"Dec 14, 2023","I have to say...I lost interest mid movie. That's pretty hard to do when you're in the theater. It was well scripted and beautiful acting.

"Dec 13, 2023","Oppenheimer has Christopher Nolan written all over it. Every speck, from the writing, cinematography, and visual effects to the editing and score, is precisely on par with what one would expect from a Nolan-directed biopic. Cillian Murphy carried the film as the genius behind history's deadliest weapon and outshined his costars, who were outstanding in their own right. It's been a while since a movie with a daunting runtime utilized every minute to fully realize its story without dragging on needlessly. If only they had a few spare minutes to show the ramifications of the atomic bomb on Japan to support Oppenheimer's stand on the creation and usage of such a weapon and increase the emotional impact of the film. Even if not by merit, Oppenheimer is one of the best movies released this year and might get lucky enough to snatch the Best Picture award at the Oscars.",POSITIVE
"Dec 13, 2023","Absolute perfection. This movie masters the concept of ""morally grey"" Particularly in its examination of Oppenheimer and the country he represents. This movie does not paint him as an angel or a devil, rather as a man consumed with his work and the consequences of it. It is neither gung-ho patriotic like old 80s movies, nor is it unbearably nihilistic and cynical as a majority of modern productions are. It gives you his choices and the consequences and lets you make up your own mind rather than shoving a forced conclusion down your throat. In short, Christopher Nolan is a master and Cillian Murphy is Oscar-bound",POSITIVE

"Dec 12, 2023","Half an hour too long, the courtroom drama felt heavy by the end. For Americans aware of the details of the Communist witch-hunt years it probably made more sense. To a European I wasn't quite sure why he was on trial despite all the evidence. The self doubt was played well and Murphy handled that with panache. Pugh's naked boobs were a bit gratuitous and unnecessary I felt, jarring a little with the rest of the film. And when right at the end Oppenheimer is given the award, just as Einstein had predicted, it came out of the blue, with no explanation of how opinion must have changed over the intervening years. So yes, a brilliant film. Flawed though.",NEUTRAL

"Dec 9, 2023","They promoted this movie as amazing WW2 storytelling of a world-changing event. I'm an avid WW2 and history buff, literally have hundreds of books just on WW2. I was expecting a deep dive into the creation and mechanics of the Manhattan project, with some personal insight into Oppenheimer. But, it just felt like a dizzying story of personal chaos and moral dilemma. The nude scenes were ridiculous, unnecessary, and added nothing meaningful to the movie. Cillian Murphy is an incredible actor. But this movie did an injustice by not fully showcasing Oppenheimer's brilliance and leadership. Equally important is how his work saved millions of lives on both sides. Japanese surrender rates were always very low. The Battle of Okinawa there were 110,00 Japanese defenders, only 7500 surrendered. War is horrible and grotesque. Oppenheimer's project saved one million American lives by not having to  invade Japan. Plus 3-4 million American wounded, also the losses for our Allied partners like Britain. Japanese casualties would've been enormous, estimates of 10+ million Japanese killed and 30+ million wounded, many of which civilian. Nolan is a Brit and he did the Dunkirk movie very well and paid tribute to British troops in that battle. I was expecting him to repeat that level of respectful and accurate storytelling in Oppenheimer. But this time for an American WW2 perspective, and bring this incredible wartime story to life. A critical project that changed the world should've been conveyed more respectfully, and accurately.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 9, 2023","ehhhh idk; i get it. the story's fine & the cast is stacked, but it's entirely too long & everyone talks like there's a baby sleeping in the next room; it's incredibly quiet & monotone from beginning to end. every character acts/talks the same. maybe it was to my detriment that i waited to watch it at home vs the theater - however part of me thinks if i were to see it in the theater i would've fallen asleep - because i ended up multitasking through it & not paying 100% attention, maybe i ruined it for myself. but i was bored af. obviously my review doesn't mean anything in the grand scheme since everyone else apparently loved it, but i'm not on the hype train.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 9, 2023","Very good film, although I was a tad disappointed the characters were out of focus. I understand to film on film instead of digital makes focusing a bit trickier but it was a tad distracting for me.",POSITIVE

"Dec 7, 2023","Christopher Nolan truly showing off his final form with this movie. such a perfectly pieced together film that lets its cast shine in full force. i would say that most of this cast's best performances are in this. it's such a tragic story that Nolan somehow makes entertaining for three hours straight. honestly the runtime didn't wear on me at all, because it's so damn good and deserves its runtime. 
  the score is some of the best of the year if not ever. the visuals of this movie are too die for, i need to buy the 4k for this asap, i can't imagine how good that looks. i've only seen three Nolan movies but this may be my favorite. i just can't fathom how much i enjoyed this. if you can't tell by now this movie wipes Barbie in my opinion even though i had loads of fun with Barbie. one last thing, can we all thank Nolan for putting Devon Bostick aka RODRICK FUCKING HEFFLEY in this movie?!!! and you got Dane DeHaan, Rami Malek, Jack Quaid, Josh Peck, Alex Wolff, Florence Pugh and much much much more. Nolan was just going ham with this cast.",POSITIVE
"Dec 7, 2023","I am clearly not among the majority with my review, but I found that the storyline wandered too much, which led to a watch that took much longer than needed. And did the Skinamax worthy sex scenes really add anything beneficial to the movie, other than filling screen time. I waited for months to see Oppenheimer, because the subject matter has always intrigued me, and you can imagine how excited I was for the release date to arrive. Well, I was very disappointed with the movie and I have one thing to say to Chris Nolan. Can I please have my $20.00 back?",NEGATIVE
"Dec 7, 2023","The subject matter was not appealing, and it took me a while to get round to seeing it. However, as a bio and semi documentary this was a very impressive piece of film making. It never seemed long, and the multiple time shifts, and episodic nature of storytelling were always clear and interetsting.",POSITIVE

"Dec 6, 2023","Masterpiece! A film that can be compared to Citizen Kane, 2001, Vertigo, and Lawrence of Arabia. Moves at the staggering metaphorical pace of colliding particles. Nuanced acting from over eighty speaking roles, a score that articulates every mood and character change, and a return to mostly simple and compelling in camera effects.

"Dec 6, 2023","Like most, I found the topic to be engaging, and the treatment mature and even compelling.  As a period piece, it was meticulous and educational, too.  And as human drama, the flawed characters were endearing and revealing.  

On the downside:  it's long.  Often disjointed.  Sometimes overly ambitious, really trying to address the obvious:  the bomb(s), but also WW II, decision making, secrecy and Communism; scientific na√Øvet√©.  Sex and love (well, as a period piece...).  Many interwoven, and not interwoven elements colliding and competing for screen time.  Afterwards, I learned that some elements and characters got the Hollywood thing:  added to hold the story together.",POSITIVE

"Dec 5, 2023","I really enjoyed this one. The acting was fantastic, perhaps top 5 cast I've seen. The directing and writing is incredible, as we are used to with Nolan movies. My only real gripe is I wish they would have made it PG-13, so it could be shown in history classes in high school. It would have been so easy to remove the F-words and not show nudity in the Tatlock scenes. Nudity and F bombs don't add anything to film, so that was disappointing, but great film.",POSITIVE

"Dec 3, 2023","It wasn't just a good film, it was masterful. The photography, the script, the acting, the special effects, often practical, everything came together perfectly. The incredibly accurate historical references and their very special ability to entertain, even if in a documentary. The experience of watching every moment is almost indescribable, and it will certainly be a film that, in the future, I will watch once, twice, three, and many more times. I'm suspicious when I say this, because I'm a big fan of both Cillian Murphy, who plays Oppenheimer, and the eccentric but surgical director, Christopher Nolan, however, this one who appeared on this year's posters is certainly a heavyweight in films, which I enjoyed as much as, if not more than, the revered director's ""best work"" (Interstellar). If it were me, a simple evaluator, to describe such a work in a title, I would call it ""Christopher Nolan's Silent Orchestra"".

Final Score: ""9.6""!",POSITIVE

The whole cast of actors is incredible, have to say, even the best they could've chosen, it's just the direction of the film most of the time is strange.

The humor was good, The cinematography was beautiful , the acting was amazing, and the whole movie was written very well, but the entire movie was focused on the making of the bomb, which wasn't very interesting and the movie was more than three hours long so it felt like a three hour long biography, so if you like that kind of stuff, this movie is for you, but I found it kind of dull.",NEUTRAL

I've grown tired of your style and won't be watching anymore movies directed by you.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 1, 2023","Commendable performances that manage to salvage an otherwise disappointing directorial effort. The cast is powerful and convincing, immersing the audience in the characters' experiences and emotions. The actors' commitment to their roles adds depth and authenticity to the film, creating a connection.
Unfortunately, the downfall lies in its direction. Despite the stellar performances, the director fails to provide an engaging narrative. The pacing feels uneven, with scenes often lacking a clear sense of purpose or direction. The storytelling lacks focus, making it challenging to fully invest in. Nolan's choices in terms of visual style and overall tone distract from the performances, leaving the film feeling unfulfilled.",NEUTRAL

I was excited to see this and it blew my expectations out of the water. 10/10",POSITIVE
"Nov 30, 2023","A grossly overrated film. The only people praising it are either physics lovers or Nolan fanboys who worship the very earth he walks over. According to me, Nolan's films have been becoming less engrossing with time and the only good ones were Inception and The Dark Knight. The first half was mildly entertaining with a few wow moments celebrating Oppenheimer's genius but the second half was stretched and prolonged almost entirely featuring the trial. Nolan couldn't seem to find enough of Oppenheimer's life to fill in the blank spaces of the movie. Personally visual spectacle moments of the explosion and mushroom cloud do not matter if there is no story which keeps me engaged. Cilian Murphy's performance is overrated and was a recreation of Scarecrow with those dry lips.",NEGATIVE

"Nov 30, 2023","Oppenheimer (2023)
Yes, to paraphrase another review,  this is essentially just 3 hours of people talking, albeit with a who's who of Hollywood A list actors.

The pacing is incredible, and the 3 hour runtime flies by; achieved by making this less of a biopic and more of a political/ courtroom drama.

I didn't expect much going in, to be honest, as based on the runtime, I'd expected a slow, plodding affair with excessive backstory. I should've known better.

The only complaint I have is there wasn't much emotional weight to this film; but then again, given how much the protagonist tries to distance himself from his emotions, maybe that was the point.


Ludwig G√∂ransson's hauntingly simple sounding, yet insanely difficult to perform, score fits perfectly.

9.2/10, A-",POSITIVE

"Nov 29, 2023","I was actually looking forward to watch this movie. Unfortunately I have to say I was rather disappointed when the movie came to an end.

One of the most impressive projects ever undertaken filled with scientifical challenges and performed under immense pressure.

That is what the movie should have been all about. Unfortunately it is not. Instead all the science, challenges and achievements are just glossed over and we are feed three long, boring, hours about political machinations and his sex life.

That is not what I was expecting and it is definitely not what I wanted to watch.

Trust Hollywood to turn science into a bloody soap-like drama.

Christopher Nolan is definitely not a person that should be tasked with making a science or history movie. His Dunkirk was underwhelming to say the least and Interstellar was both a poor movie and a joke when it came to science.

"Nov 27, 2023","I have always had an interest in quantum mechanics, physics, and the harnessing of nuclear energy for both power and weapons. So this movie was pretty much made for me. I had a lot of anticipation for it. Christopher Nolan does what he always does; he creates drama and excitement through beautiful cinematography, music, and storytelling. This movie was pretty much exactly what I expected; which was a slight letdown, as I felt like it could have surpassed my expectations with a few adjustments. The movie does about the best you can to dramatize equations and theoretical physics (which usually just takes place in a boring manner). It does a decent job of wresting with the moral dilemma of creating (and using) the weapons, but I do wish that this was expanded upon more. I also think that the russian/cold war themes were unnecessary; I would have rather had more time spent on the lead up and consequences of the actual usage in Japan. This was not explored nearly enough in my opinion. But all in all, the movie does a great job of showing the process and drama of that time period, and what it meant to be the first to create a terrible weapon.",POSITIVE

ChatGPT translation:
The film, in my opinion, conveys a tangible truth through exceptional and innovative editing, as well as superb segmentation. If the horrifying feeling resulting from the atomic bomb explosion were also tangible at the end of the story, undoubtedly the rating and lasting impact of this cinematic work would reach its peak.",NEUTRAL
"Nov 26, 2023","Intense, cerebral, well-casted movie about the mental and emotional toll the invention and planning of the atomic bomb took upon principal developer Robert Oppenheimer during WWII's famous Manhattan Project.  This movie lends itself more as a psychological study of what it cost him, (and the other scientists), when their calculations were realized, and they'd created an unfathomably powerful novel weapon, and helped knowingly loose it's destructive power upon the world, with the awareness that they would abdicate control to the military and eventually the AEC, as a 'new kind of wartime overwhelming defense tactic' to defeat Hitler.  

Militarily, there were no easy answers at that time, only slightly less awful choices to be made.  I don't envy any of them, as their ethical and moral struggles were intensely personal, profoundly painful, and very conflicted.  

This movie shows the private and personal, as well as the professional toll this event had on Oppenheimer, specifically.  It cost him a great deal, and he was never easy with the outcome.  When he voiced these concerns during the McCarthy Era in the 1950's he was labelled 'Un-American', and a possible 'communist sympathizer' before he was drummed out of the project by less thoughtful government hacks.   

Not a lot about 'The Bomb' or it's destruction, but more about the damage it did to the designers and creators along the way.  Well done, thoughtful take on the choices we must make to achieve peace in the world.",POSITIVE

"Nov 25, 2023","The best film of 2023! Christopher Nolan has done it again with his latest release of Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer is a mind bending epic biopic of the father of the Atom bomb. Now please note this movie might not be for everyone because it is extremely dense with heavy dialogue and stays true to the real life story in life of Oppenheimer. Those who are expecting an action extravagansa will be sadly disappointed. I really enjoyed the visual journey that this film takes you on and it is amazing to me that Nolan used zero CGI shots in this film. This star studded movie showcases some amazing Oscar worthy performances from all of it's Leads with Cillian Murphy, Roberty Downey Jr., and Emily Blunt. Even the smaller roles bring all of their A games. I got the opportunity to watch this in 70mm Imax and when I say this is truly how Nolan wanted you to see it as intended, I mean it.

I was so excited but unfortunately I was very disappointed  I don't want to persuade anyone not to watch it. I'm just curious to what other people think.

Completely insane visual sequences were supposed to convey emotion when it was already obviously conveyed by the actors own expression.  The atomic explosion was unrealistic even with mountains of stock footage available.  Way too long.

"Nov 23, 2023","As a huge fan of C Nolan I was completely disappointed with Oppenheimer.  I was very excited to see it and even ensured I had perfect centre seats at IMAX for the viewing.  Unfortunately I found the movie incredibly (almost surreally) boring (and I should note that I am a big history buff) and almost fell sleep with the incessant chatter that runs the entire movie.  Even the ""exciting part"", the actual bomb experimentation, was ho-hum at best (I really don't see why this movie needed IMAX treatment at all). I sat through the whole thing but quire frankly regret doing so in hindsight (that being 20/20).  
Being an obvious outlier (along with Mr. Logan) in this opinion is something that astounds me even more than how dreadful the viewing experience was for me (kudos for the hype and marketing that has done a supreme number on this one for sure).

"Nov 22, 2023","Total mess. Constant jumping between storylines and flashbacks feels overwhelming. It would be fine if every such episode was adding to the story and was interesting to watch, but most of those sequences feel out of place and disconnected from each other. The dialogues are rushed, like they have been edited to include as many words as possible per minute which leaves an impression of shallowness while trying to look very meaningful. It's unclear why such a style (or editing) of dialogues has been selected for a slow paced historical drama like this one. Wouldn't this movie benefit more from somewhat slower and better edited conversations that carry a bit more emotions and meaning? That's a disaster for a movie that is relying on dialogue sequences so heavily, and is basically built around them. The music and other sound effects are constantly over-the-top and are distracting from what is going on. ""Oppenheimer"" is trying to present itself as something significant, deep and meaningful, but fails to do so and instead strikes as something rather shallow and pretentious. To make it even more dull - Cillian Murphy only has one facial expression. I could imagine him playing a detective in some not-too-expensive neo-noire movie or TV show, but trying to portray a nuclear scientist... meh.",NEGATIVE
"Nov 22, 2023","For the love of god, someone petition Christopher Nolan to make more science orriented films, cause from where I'm sitting it seems like he's the only one who gets the final product as close to the genuine artifact as possible.

Just endless throwback conversations with her...blah, blah, blah.  Then the movie is mainly about the trials and tribulations he goes through to get the bomb made.

"Nov 21, 2023","I saw Oppenheimer in VMAX (we don't have imax in Australia, and the only 70mm screen in Brisbane is tiny) and I cannot stop thinking about it. This movie was STUNNING. ‚Ä®‚Ä®Oppenheimer is both an immense technical achievement, and an intense, mature drama. The trinity test sequence is possibly one of the most thrilling, nerve-racking scenes of the last 10 years, and I barely realised I was holding my breath and squeezing the arms of my chair, until my Apple Watch gave me a high heart rate alert. That was definitely a new experience for me. ‚Ä®‚Ä®Lacking any real poor performances, every actor brought their A-Game and seeing continual ""that guy"" actors appear throughout was really fun! Cillian Murphy was enthralling and completely believable as the complicated, confused and tortured Oppenheimer and is surely a shoo-in for best actor, Emily Blunt was excellent in the few scenes she was given to really shine, and Robert Downey Jr was electric as Lewis Strauss. 

The ending left me in an emotional and existential puddle on the floor after I was finally able to loosen up my body and relax.

"Nov 19, 2023","Overall it was a captivating film and there's no shortage of praise for the things it does well. So I'm mainly gonna talk about the negatives. The movie is surprisingly very fast-paced, in fact a little too much so because so much dialogue comes at you very quickly and it's difficult for a casual observer to follow without having prior historical knowledge of Oppenheimer's life. 

In typical Hollywood fashion the film goes a bit over the top in terms of trying to dramatize and ""make cool"" events which were in actual fact very dry and mundane (administrative hearings and interviews which would bore you to death if you watched the actual footage). Also, there are some really explicit sex scenes and sexual imagery which are totally unnecessary and ridiculous. They tried to make everything about these events sexy and epic. Well, Cillian Murphy is indeed sexy. But Oppenheimer wasn't sexy. He was basically a frail, mentally ill nerd. So there's a bit of disconnect there between the film and the actual events in that respect. 

Finally, I think perhaps the greatest failing of the film is that it doesn't depict any of the destruction of the bombs on Japan. Oppenheimer was haunted by his creation because of its destructive power, but they didn't establish its destructive power on actual human beings to any significant extent.",POSITIVE

"Nov 19, 2023","Oppenheimer is one of the best Christopher Nolan professionally made films. Everything from the cinematography to the acting, the story, and the score is a masterpiece.  This is not a family movie. It is a deep character study of Robert J. Oppenheimer and will stay that way. Nolan's Oppenheimer is precisely why we go to the cinemas. It was a phenomenal experience at the theaters on my behalf, especially in IMAX format.",POSITIVE

"Nov 17, 2023","""I am bewildered by the reviews this movie has received. Honestly, I can't fathom how everyone seems to have a different opinion. I watched it with a group, and everyone found it confusing, dull, and ultimately unrewarding. Most were simply counting down the minutes until it was over. The same disappointment occurred with the Barbie movie. It's starting to make me question the reliability of these reviews. Oppenheimer had the potential for a fantastic storyline. It would be interesting if people could share their thoughts after watching the movie, but I must caution anyone considering it.""",NEGATIVE
"Nov 17, 2023","Despite the movie being a niche genre, Oppenheimer is able to captivate and hold the attention of audiences for the full lengthy 3 hours. Beautiful narrative that was taken from real world events and going deep into the psychology and motivations of not only Oppenheimer but also those around him. Beautifully acted by every actor in the movie, with fantastic cinematography.

There are a few scenes I wanted to specifically mention. The Sex scene and the Trinity Test. The Sex scene felt so incredibly unnecessary, not to mention they dropped Oppenheimer's most famous quote in the middle of his sex scene which felt so off. Its really my only criticism of the movie. I honestly don't know of any reason why the scene is in the movie. However, the trinity test is the highlight of the movie that everyone is waiting for. Anyone going to see this movie has at least minimum knowledge of the Trinity Test through common knowledge. It builds up to it the whole movie, of course it works, but its still an incredibly suspenseful moment that is beautifully done.

Absolutely one of the best movies of 2023, and ranks high up there for my personal favorites.",POSITIVE
"Nov 17, 2023","Nasty, gross, and boring.",NEGATIVE
"Nov 17, 2023","Another great movie by Nolan. Music and visuals were amazing. However, I believe the parts explaining that Oppenheimer was not communist were pretty long and included some scenes that became boring after a few minutes, and the movie had some unnecessary nude scenes which were not needed at all. The explosion scene gave me chills, scientifically accurate sound delay. It was nice to experience that in real time.",POSITIVE

"Nov 17, 2023","Why was this made for Imax? Did it really need to be 3 hours? Not visually appealing at all. Editing was the workhorse of this film, as well the the ""Nolanesque"" plot style. If I never watched this again, I wouldnt be upset.",NEGATIVE
"Nov 16, 2023","Great Movie but bad final, never seen the big ban",POSITIVE
"Nov 16, 2023",It was good but too lengthy of a film to me considering what story is being told. Some of the female characters where not as nuanced as they could have been. Not uncommon in Nolans films. Perhaps some really interesting parts leading up to it's culmination with the production of an atom bomb should have been included instead of some seemingly less important parts. However this might be redeemed considering that this isn't supposed to be a historical depiction.,NEUTRAL

"Nov 14, 2023","Film Review: Oppenheimer (2023)

""Amateurs chase the sun and get burned..."" a fearful line for filmmakers
But to an experienced director like Christopher Nolan who clearly shows us how he is similar to Prometheus who stole fire from the gods and gave it to man. Nolan Gives us this amazing cinematic achievement. The film is the biopic to Dr Robert Oppenheimer and how he creates his greatest and most deadliest weapon in history, the atomic bomb.

The casting is phenomenal. One can not really fault that. Everyone brings excellent and memorable performances. From the frontman Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer himself along with Florence Pugh as Jean Tatlock, Emily Blunt as Katherine Oppenheimer, to the talented robert downey jr as Lewis Strauss and my personal favourite Benny Safdie as Edward teller. A special shout out to the set designers and the costume departments the early to mid 1900's style to give them various feelings of being in the past eras were truly exceptional.

The editing is my most favourite part of the film, although the pacing of the film felt rushed like they had to quickly show you scenes and press on to the next scene quite rapidly at times. It was a lot to digest the first time watching it. However I cannot fault the beautiful cuts between the scenes of the film and the shots of B-roll of various chemical water visual effects with lights etc that really added a layer of immersion to the feelings of science and chemistry. The excitement one gets when they are performing experiments and finding unique and new discoveries. It showed me there are still interesting ways to transition between scenes and shots.

One cannot but think the film has been a tad over ""hollywoodised"" about the man who created the atomic bomb. Similar to rocket man or bohemian rhapsody I understand some biopics have decided to dip into the more fictional waters for a more captivating story. Understandably otherwise it would probably end up as a documentary on the history channel. I admit I did not really read the history books. My knowledge prior of Oppenheimer had pretty much come from the hilarious parody youtube rap battle of history between Marvel's Thanos and the atomic bomb scientist Oppenhimer. After watching the film I felt like this biopic was somewhat glorified to a man who created a devastating weapon of mass destruction . However, with how the story was told. It seemed to be if we didn't build it first the enemy would have first. A classic tale of ""for the greater good"".

Overall I really enjoyed the film. My only personal minute problem was the confusion with names for the characters, trying to remember whose who again for it switches back and forth from the monochrome courtroom scene to the past colourful events yet to happen. The courtroom refers to everyone by their last name while in the flashbacks everyone was referred to by their first names. Maybe that's just me but I was honestly confused as to who they were discussing again. Regardless, the film was exceptional and the ending was good, however I did feel very sombre to the thought after that I just witnessed the creation of the atomic bomb and knowing something that devastating was created in this world. Good thing I saw the Barbie movie afterwards.

The soundtrack is a perfect complement to the visuals, enhancing the emotional impact of the narrative. The carefully curated music not only underscores the historical significance of the events depicted but also serves as a powerful emotional anchor that resonates long after the credits roll.

The storytelling is where ""Oppenheimer"" truly shines. The director's ability to weave together multiple narratives seamlessly is nothing short of brilliant.

In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" is a triumph of filmmaking that deserves all the accolades it receives. It's a powerful, poignant, and unforgettable journey that cements the director's place as a visionary in the world of documentary filmmaking. Don't miss the opportunity to witness this cinematic gem ‚Äì it's a true masterpiece that will stand the test of time.",POSITIVE
"Nov 12, 2023","The narrative structure is awful, a hodgepodge that doesn't delve into anything. A good director making a mess. Only the costumes and set design are saved.",NEGATIVE
"Nov 12, 2023","Throughout this Wikipedia like but still compelling biography of the Man and the McCarthy era, I kept thinking, I've see this before. But where? Of course...Strauss is the Salierii to Oppenheimer's Mozart. Nice try, Nolan, but minus half a star for that. Otherwise, a thoroughly rewarding film.",POSITIVE
"Nov 12, 2023","After watching Oppenheimer I couldn't help but feel that although the movie is hailed by many as a masterpiece, I failed to grasp why. 
It is certainly a movie that amazed me, however as it so happens with most Christopher Nolan's movies it lacks a heart. 
It's elegant as all of Nolan's movies are and it gives the audience a nostalgic trip to old the old Hollywood way of making movies, but somehow lacks feeling, albeit honest. 
I can imagine that such an epic would -as so many others before it- can curb feeling over structure, but I believe it to be more due to the cold and logical creative sensibility of it's director.
Nonetheless, it is quite a cinematic experience to behold, hence my 4 stars.",POSITIVE
"Nov 12, 2023",I enjoyed the acting and the storyline but I agree with other critics that said the movie spent too much time trying to prove that Oppenheimer wasn't a communist. After a while it got to be a little tedious.,NEUTRAL

"Nov 12, 2023","One of the best movies in the past years. The cinematography is top notch, the soundtrack helps keep the momentum and the emotion of the movie. And the main plot and action while obvious I believe it helps us remember about the consequences of our own actions and the fact that no matter which are your intentions (good / bad) people will always find a way to counter or approve you. Just like life. Ups and downs, good and bads. Great movie. Top 10 of all time for me.",POSITIVE
"Nov 12, 2023","When people become film critics it must be that their more natural and intuitive response to movies gets skewed. Or they review them using other parameters than - was this story told in an effective, enjoyable, honest way. Because I read some of the film critics reviews, and their perspective puts it in the context of - hard to describe it - maybe film history, film ""language"" and some of it I admit I don't exactly understand with a quick reading. But I can tell you that Oppenheimer's dialogue was stilted and unnatural and rushed and too often tried too hard to be profound, many scenes bore almost no relationship to what occurred moments before and after, the music tries too hard to pound into our heads at a volume that nearly causes permanent hearing loss ""THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT MOMENT"" and nearly every second of the 3 hours was like that. Oppenheimer's overwhelmed wife literally gives their child away (when just a few minutes before she was married to someone else) and then a little while later she's portrayed as a model wife and mother with not an iota of explanation. It was pretentious, overly manipulative, stilted, and every character lacked depth (except Matt Damon tried hard  - thank you Matt). It was the culinary equivalent of kids' breakfast cereal. I almost walked out early but I just couldn't help thinking that SOMETHING interesting must happen in the end, with all the hype. But it didn't.",NEGATIVE
"Nov 12, 2023","Overrated big time. It's a decent drama but overblown with dialogue like it is an Aaron Sorkin movie. Definitely Nolan's most boring flick. It's also very scatter-brained, constant time line juggling and scene juggling very annoying.",NEUTRAL
"Nov 12, 2023",Loved this movie! Christopher Nolan always delivers!,POSITIVE
"Nov 12, 2023","Top cast, top acting, well writen story. It doesn't get any better than this. Movie that will mark a decade for sure. Nolan never dissapoints, and is surely becoming one the most influental directors of 21st century.",POSITIVE

"Nov 12, 2023","This is a great movie! You have to pay attention because there are a lot of flashbacks and The movie includes glimpses into the future, but it does not thoroughly cover the details of the bomb-making process, which, in my opinion, is a minor downside. Like the people that got radiation sickness and whatnot.",POSITIVE

"Nov 11, 2023","Although not as excruciatingly self indulgent as the abysmal 'Tenet', this is a slow, long, unfocused and rather dry movie with the now trademark Nolan hard to decipher dialogue.

"Nov 11, 2023","Amazing movie, both visually and for the story it recounts. A must see at the movie theatre kind of film. The actors are all outstanding. The only negative issue is that only the main characters are fully developed, and all the background or secondary characters are sketched at best. Overall another masterpiece from Nolan",POSITIVE
"Nov 11, 2023","True Cinema, a Masterpiece. Few come closer, certain moments you forget to breathe, realize you have chills all over, see History unfolding through a perfect soundtrack. This is the type of art that lives forever, as long as forever is...",POSITIVE
"Nov 10, 2023",I thought I was going to see a movie about the Manhattan project. What I got was some sort of disjointed series of flash back images seemingly from the memory of a schizophrenic that's only tangentially related to the development of nuclear weapons. The fragments of this story all flowed together about as well as a river of glass attempting to crest Donner pass.,NEGATIVE
"Nov 10, 2023",The film ended up being a polemic about vanity and jealously with little or no mention of the losses in Japan. I was disappointed that the story devolved into this space. and not the morality issues. If the intention was that man is pathetic in his jealously towards others then it succeeded. But this film only worked when it was focused on the mission.,NEUTRAL
"Nov 10, 2023","""Oppenheimer"" emerges as a cinematic triumph, boasting stellar cinematography that elevates its visual narrative to an unparalleled level. The meticulous attention to historical accuracy weaves a compelling storyline that aligns seamlessly with real-world events. The ensemble cast's performances are noteworthy, breathing authenticity into the characters, complemented by a captivating soundscape that enhances the overall viewing experience.

However, the film grapples with a notable downside‚Äîits extensive three-hour runtime. This lengthy duration poses a hurdle to the movie's rewatchability, a crucial factor for sustained audience engagement. Despite the movie's undeniable brilliance, the reluctance to revisit such a time-intensive piece may limit its enduring appeal.

The silver lining lies in the film's undeniable impact, underscoring the dedication of the actors, the prowess of the production team, and the immersive quality of its storytelling. While ""Oppenheimer"" might not clinch the title of your favorite, its cinematic merits and historical resonance position it as a formidable entry in the realm of filmmaking.",NEUTRAL
"Nov 10, 2023","Oppenheimer was an incredibly well acted movie by the entire cast. Murphy will absolutely be nominated for an Oscar for this. The movie itself is amazingly good and a story that needed to be told, but it was a little long. I think the movie needed to decide what it wanted to focus on and go with it rather than try to stuff Oppenheimer's entire life into the movie.",NEUTRAL
"Nov 10, 2023",Chris Nolan is truly a one of a kind director. One of the most compelling movies I've seen this year.,POSITIVE
"Nov 10, 2023","My father served in WW2, and parts of this movie are misleading.   Personally, I think it was terrible to drop a bomb like this, but the production of the movie.  This movie could have been done 10 years ago when more veterans from WW2 were alive and had some input.",NEGATIVE
"Nov 10, 2023","It's a fine movie, but severely lacking emotion. It's about highly interesting subject matter and well-made and supported by an impressive cast. Therefore, the 3-hour run time did not become an issue for me. But I believe that in a few years, like with most biopics, no one is going to be talking about this over-rated film much anymore. 

There's nothing special about the film's structure, so you won't see any of the innovations that Nolan's work is famous for. In fact, it's just an old-fashioned biopic told in flashbacks that has the same usual issues for that genre: a shoehorned struggle in the subject's life (the hearing/conflict with Strauss), taking liberties with the facts (e.g., the meeting with Truman, who certainly had reservations about dropping the bombs) or serving complete fabrications (e.g., the conversations with Einstein) to tell a sexier story. 

Storywise, I didn't find the hearing to be working well as the framing narrative/conflict because it was too much about the far less interesting Strauss character. Other directorial choices such as showing Oppenheimer naked at the interrogation table are just cheap. Worse, it carries one of director Nolan's trademarks by being too blockbustery and pretty much devoid of any deeper exploration of human emotion, e.g., Dunkirk has the same issues. We're not learning anything more detailed about Oppenheimer apart from the big gestures. We're not getting a closer look about what kind of man he was other than that he's conflicted about having created the bomb (expressed with graphical overlays and threatening sounds) or that he's very sad his ex died. A good example is that in its three-hour running time, we learn little about his family life. He interacts with his children for literally just a few seconds on screen. It would be interesting to me to see how he sees his own family in relation to the development of this terrible bomb. In fact, was never emotionally moved or touched by anything shown on screen, it just feels more like a dramatized documentary.

The director also chooses not to show the effects of the weapon on a real-life city, maybe he thought it would be inappropriate. But this also ignores the victims, who are now just a footnote. 
Finally, on a small note, I found the Trinity test visuals underwhelming due to Nolan's, in this case, misplaced insistence on practical effects.

In conclusion, for me, the main interest of this movie is the subject matter (which was already a given) and the production quality. It's fine, but certainly not unmissable, nor a masterpiece. Just fine.",NEUTRAL
"Nov 10, 2023","Yet another great work from the master! Only he could make this film. The script was so to the point I couldn't take my eyes off the screen for a minute, not to mention the performances and the music, even though Hans didn't make it. 
I enjoyed every minute of it. And I'm still wondering how people could prefer the bullshit Barbie to this.",POSITIVE
"Nov 10, 2023","Sad to say this, but Nolan's Oppenheimer is underwhelming. The soundtrack during the entire film was very annoying -- it takes away from the conversations being had at any moment - how amateurish of Nolan. Oppenheimer's story is a great piece of history and this movie had ridiculous visuals and noise - for no reasonable purpose other than 'it looks cool' maybe(?), I really don't know. This movie has one of the best cast of any movie made in the past 50 years (like I needed another reason to love Emily Blunt!!!), but it can't save Nolans direction of an ""art piece"" instead of a higher quality film like Dunkirk or better yet, The Imitation Game (directed by Morten Tyldum).",NEGATIVE

"Nov 10, 2023","Interesting but the explosion that you were "" supposed to feel through the screen"" was pretty standard. Boring movie but good story",NEGATIVE

"Nov 10, 2023","BORING. It's a lame movie with old white men talking for 99% of the time. One disappointing explosion. It left everyone confused and failed horribly to explain what was happening.

"Nov 9, 2023","It was fine. Didn't need to be shot on IMAX whatsoever. It's a slow moving character piece that was entirely too long at getting the point across.

"Nov 9, 2023","The movie is 3 hours long and the (bg) music never stops for 2.5 hours. Whenever the music stops and you hear the enviroment you feel like you finally watch a quality movie. 
But then ''Youtube'' level of EDITING hits between each dialog exchange and the movie is ruined again. What do i mean by that? Let's say there's a dialog total of 10 sentences. There is not even breathing between sentences. Again, just like a Youtube video edit, where you cut the blanks just to have a faster speech. 
And the bad doesn't even end there. I know EVERY -ism and every scientific term they use. But that took my 40 years. I bet at least half of the audience have no idea what they listen for at least 2 hours. As a movie, it really FAILS to simplify-convert the story to the audience. 
The movie is not a movie. It is more of a documentary that's been over ''dramatized'' by terrible sound and amazing visuals.

"Nov 3, 2023","Yeah Nolan i get it, you have the biggest dongus in the room and only you value cinema for what it was, you are the last director of a sacred white lodge of directors, the great gran master of cinema, the direct discendent of the Lumiere Brothers, your ego is endless as your pipi. 
What i can say? Great film, near perfection, but i hate the cheeseburger  propaganda.",POSITIVE
"Nov 3, 2023","Courtroom structured movies are a cop-out at this point in film history.  We've seen enough of them.  Tell everything in flashbacks, OK. The Oppenheimer character, as written, is two-dimensional and his ""conflicted"" morality is cartoonish. The real man was clearly a lot more complex. The chaotic editing attempted to breath some life into this movie, but only served to create a ""Bayhem"" effect, belying that there was nothing real going on underneath.  I wonder what Oliver Stone would've done with the same material... or Scorsese for that matter.  Hell, while not a Tarantino fan, I'd rather see what he'd so with this story.  Maybe Tarantino would have a Japanese beauty parachute in to Los Alamos for a revenge fantasy ending like in Inglorious Basterds or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.  Note to self: frenetic editing doesn't make up for poor writing.",NEGATIVE
"Nov 3, 2023","Caught my second epic within a week, this time it was Oppenheimer. If I had any lingering doubt it was extinguished, Christopher Nolan is a genius.
I don't know what his magnus opus will be, he's still 53 years old so hopefully his best is yet to come, but if he left off from here, he's left some legacy.
If he's not already viewed as the equal of contemporaries of Steven Spielberg and Ridley Scott, he will be now.

I was blown away at the quality of the music score in Oppenheimer. We (me included) bang on about our favourite rock albums, but without these composing geniuses, these movies just wouldn't carry the weight of the visual and audio experience they deliver.
As you sit there, the sound pulses through you to give you an audio experience to compliment the visual and cerebral senses, as the story unfolds.
While he didn't have his usual musical score counterpart in Hans Zimmer (Interstellar), (Dunkirk), (Inception) and collaborated once again with composer Ludwig G√∂ransson (Tenet).

At 3 hours, a movie needs to keep pace. The editing suite is one where magic also has to happen. I couldn't even guess at the amount of footage they'd have to work through, and in order to achieve the continuity required to keep this moving along and the viewers engaged.
And it wasn't just the music score that hit the mark, it was the silence. (you'll know it when you see it) Once again, he collaborated with editor Jennifer Lame (Tenet).

And you don't achieve the visual brilliance required without once again collaborating with equally brilliant cinematography from Hoyte Van Hoytema, (Interstellar), (Dunkirk), (Inception), (Tenet).

As far the acting, full marks for casting. Cillian Murphy & Robert Downey Jr. might have delivered the best acting in a role of their careers. And Emily Blunt, apart from being a stone-cold fox, matches them for on screen presence.

Yes it's long, but this cinematographic masterpiece never felt laboured, it's a story as important as any in history and it was faced with the weight of expectation, but how it delivered.
Amazing. What I love about film is the same as when I first sat transfixed in a theatre as a young lad, it picks you up and the World stops while you become engaged in what unfolds before you.",POSITIVE

"Nov 1, 2023","Nolan, along with the best cast he's ever assembled shows what it's like to harness his genius vision and shed light to a story that is historically pivotal in the molding of our current political climate. Chilly. The movie is about as chilly as Cillian Murphy's crystal blue eyes on the massive IMAX screen I had the privilege of watching this cinematic experience on.

There is an eerie disposition that consumer you if you are well aware of the magnitude the moment in time this movie highlights. The quick cuts of atoms and sparks of highly combustible particles amounts to an overwhelming feeling of awe. The cheers of happy Americans knowing the bomb successfully exploded on Japan and not knowing what devastation it caused is the most sobering dichotomy of the entire film. Success, hand in hand with perished innocents, will develop a pit of disgust in the stomach of any movie goer with the proper wherewithal. 

It's a must see for any movie aficionado, but it can very well be overlooked by the casual movie goes due to the lull caused in the second-half of the film that transition to a hyper-fixation on the documentary-esque approach it encompasses. 

Overall, 4.4/5. This score could very easily increase with a second, thirds, and more than likely fourth viewing of this cinematic masterpiece. Nolan redeems himself after the muddled Tenet debacle. Must watch!",POSITIVE

A truly surreal experience about the world we're living in and the horrifying possibility of a doomsday. This movie has a very good chance of winning Best Picture and Best Director at the Academy Awards.

As far as Cillian Murphy is concerned, I wholeheartedly hope that he wins the Oscar for Best Actor because he has absolutely killed it in his role as the father of the atomic bomb.

"Oct 22, 2023","As a person that loves historical films this movie should've been an easy walk in the park for me. Cillian Murphy plays J. Robert  Oppenheimer, the inventor of the atomic bomb. It's also nice to see Robert Downey Jr play someone that's not Iron Man. Combine two of the best actors with one of the best directors ever (Christopher Nolan), I should've liked this movie more than I did. While the cinematography by Nolan and getting to see the bomb explode is great, that's all I could really enjoy about the film. There's a lot of unnecessary scenes in here, in particular Oppenheimer's (Cillian Murphy) relationship with Jean (Florence Pugh) doesn't need to be there. Another huge problem I have with the film is that it is simply too talkative and has an unnecessary runtime of three hours. Luckily, Murphy's acting, combined with Nolan's directing keeps me engaged enough to sit through the movie without being bored out of my mind. Overall, getting to see the making of the atomic bomb was interesting but the film could've easily cut some scenes and nothing would've felt left out. With that being said, I still think the tunnel has more light in it than dark.",NEUTRAL

"Oct 17, 2023","Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" finds the director in top form bringing his knack for gigantic scope and human drama together seamlessly.  An all-star cast like I've never seen assembles to tell this story which ponders morality and scientific advancement with equal measure.  The film features a great deal of dialogue, much moreso than his other films, and with a 3 hour runtime there is a danger in losing us but Nolan is aware of that and succeeds at keeping us rapt.  The editing team is largely to thank for this, moving the film along at a pace that mostly clips steadily fast.  The sound steals the show from Cillian Murphy, playing the largest part in the film.  The score is sweeping and elegant and the sound knows when to be delicate and simple just as it knows when to test our ability to withstand loud noises.

"Oct 15, 2023","I have now seen Oppenheimer four times.  I originally saw it in iMAX but the last three times have been in a regular theater. I never intended to see it 4x's but the opportunities arose and I absolutely didn't mind.  As I was telling my husband this evening (after the fourth time seeing it), I think it's the combination of the science (I'm a high school astronomy teacher), the ensemble cast, Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr.'s antagonistic relationship and the relentless pace that make for an event rather than ‚Äòjust a movie.' Christopher Nolan is a master at casting - as seen in all of his other hits but this one, to me, is special. Seemingly, everyone involved was expertly chosen and every actor, no matter what the part size, came with their A-game.  Certainly Murphy and Downey deserve accolades but Blunt, Damon, Hartnett, etc‚Ä¶just incredible!  The score stays with you long after the credits. I know there has been some controversy over the absence of the results of the atomic bombs in Japan but I was just as moved in the movie as I think I would have been if these images were given more time - in fact, the way it played out allows the mind to imagine the worst and Murphy's internal angst is felt fully (he's just a phenomenal actor - period.). This movie will be remembered for decades to come.  Btw‚Ä¶I did read the book prior to seeing the movie for the first time and I'm glad I did. It's worth reading (and a rather easy read) for all the background information.",POSITIVE
"Oct 15, 2023",Once again Christiphor Nolan shines and makes an unforgettable movie expierence. From the the way the plot progress to the soundtrack this is a great biopic of the somewhat infamous Oppenheimer.

"Oct 13, 2023","Oppenheimer, is an epic cinematic journey that redefines storytelling. Written and directed by the BRILLIANT Christopher Nolan, the film is a masterclass in the art of cinema. Cillian Murphy's portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer is nothing short of mesmerising, and Robert Downey Jr. shines as U.S. Atomic Energy Commission member Lewis Strauss, to be honest all of the actors play their parts well.

Nolan's screenplay weaves a captivating narrative that takes us through Oppenheimer's remarkable career, from his groundbreaking studies to his pivotal role in the Manhattan Project during World War II, and his eventual fall from grace during the 1954 security hearing.

Visually, the film is a treat for the senses, thanks to the exceptional cinematography by Hoyte van Hoytema. The use of IMAX technology immerses the audience in the world of Oppenheimer, enhancing the entire cinematic experience. The sound design further elevates the film, creating an immersive journey.

I'm a fan of Nolan, (who isn't, especially with a career filled with remarkable films) but for me ""Oppenheimer"" stands out as (one of) Nolan's crowning achievement. It's a cinematic rollercoaster that leaves a lasting impression, evoking a range of emotions that will stay with you long after the credits roll. This film is a testament to the power of storytelling and the art of filmmaking.",POSITIVE
"Oct 13, 2023",Nolan's Oppenheimer feels like he copied and pasted information from Wikipedia onto his movie script and started filming.,NEGATIVE
"Oct 13, 2023","""Oppenheimer,"" a highly anticipated film with an all-star cast, offers a deep dive into the intricate life and work of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the man behind the atomic bomb. Directed by a visionary filmmaker known for his grandeur, it's no surprise that ""Oppenheimer"" was shot using Imax cameras to capture its sweeping narrative. However, as I watched the film, it became evident that this decision didn't always serve the story well.

One glaring issue was the choice of locations and settings. Many pivotal scenes in ""Oppenheimer"" were confined to small rooms or tight spaces. While this approach might have been an intentional choice to convey the tension and secrecy of the project, it did little justice to the expansive capabilities of Imax cameras. In these close quarters, the Imax format felt somewhat wasted, leaving the audience craving the breathtaking visuals it's known for.
Imax cameras are renowned for their ability to capture vast landscapes and epic vistas with unparalleled clarity. Unfortunately, ""Oppenheimer"" missed several opportunities to make use of this potential. Scenes that could have benefited from the Imax treatment, such as outdoor research facilities or expansive desert landscapes, were notably absent or underutilized. 
In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" is undoubtedly a noteworthy cinematic experience, but the choice to use Imax cameras in settings that didn't fully leverage their capabilities is a curious one. While the storytelling and performances are exceptional, one can't help but wonder if a more conventional cinematographic approach might have served the film's intimate and often confined settings better",NEUTRAL
"Oct 13, 2023",It's most overrated movie that you think,NEGATIVE

"Oct 13, 2023","Great movie! A masterpiece. Great acting, effects and sound effects. I didn't feel time passing by, even though I believe that the movie becomes more interesting once you have at list a little knowledge about some historical events.",POSITIVE
"Oct 12, 2023",Wow.   I was so engrossed in the film that I didn't notice how long it was.,POSITIVE
"Oct 12, 2023","I believe that Christopher Nolan successfully encapsulated the life and the struggles of J. Robert Oppenheimer in a 3 hour movie. The movie is historical drama with many scientist taking part in the Manhattan project to built the first ever nuclear bomb The Fat Man

What I like the most about the movie is the use of practical effect to imitate the explosion of a nuclear bomb it was both awe inspiring and terrifying. The cast were amazing and extremely dedicate trying to emulate the character. For example 
Cillian Murphy starve himself to look just like him and Robert Downey Jr was unrecognizable. The use of black and white to highlight certain moments was phenomenal.

The dislike of the film is the fact that it could have ended at the trinity test. I personally don't prefer non-linear storytelling but what  else can you can expect from Christopher Nolan. One weird thing is that famous Oppenheimer quote was said before a sex scene.

Despite the shortcoming it's a great movie and I would recommend to anyone who is patient to watch the film",POSITIVE
"Oct 12, 2023","Oscars on its way ,cilliannnnnnnnn.NOLAN IS SUCCESSFULLY THE DIRECTER WHO WE CAN TRUST",POSITIVE
"Oct 11, 2023","Skillfully shot, great acting... the only problem is the writing. It tries to tell a story, but it continues to stop into an Avengers-like series of Big Brains so Nolan can show off how smart he is.

Also, it's in a format which basically doesn't have an appropriate projector so unless you went to a couple of theaters, you saw a cropped movie. Somebody should tell Nolan that when you make a commercial project, part of the job is making sure people can actually see the movie.",NEUTRAL

Some of the time skips caused some confusion, but it was overall a great movie that I will definitely watch again.",POSITIVE
"Oct 11, 2023","This movie is something that I think no one has come close to making. As a fan of Nolan, even with his most confusing films (I'm talking about you TENET) I was excited to see the direction Nolan would take with history, he had done it in the past, but that was Dunkirk, not just some guy. However, Nolan found the best actors for the job, Cillian Murphy should get the Oscar, he plays Oppenheimer with such talent, and the supporting cast all get their fair share of raw emotion and brilliance in their respective acting. The film may be long, but the setup for the Trinity Test has never made me more stressed in my life, the suspension still sticks with me to this day, and with Nolan's mission to not use 100% CGI, I was blown away by how they made some of the shots. The music and audio may sometimes be hard to hear, as is with most Nolan films, but I didn't find it intruding as I watched the film. Also going off of the music, the soundtrack of this movie is stacked, and the swelling of the music is one of my favorite parts of the entire movie, Ludwig Gorranson feels like he's on the way to becoming the next Hans Zimmer. This review is getting too long, so I'll end here with this, don't let anyone who says ""It's too long"" or ""Too much talking"" or even any small negative of this movie make you not want to watch this film. You need to watch this film, period.",POSITIVE
"Oct 11, 2023","Oppenheimer was an instant classic of a film. Nolan really honed in his filmmaking both narratively and stylistically for this one. This story could have easily been a long drawn-out bore if executed the wrong way and given the all the scientific exposition involved. It isn't and it flies for a 3 hour film. Nolan cuts the film in such a way that it feels like a fast-paced ride neatly balanced with the emotion of Oppy's personal life, the drama of creating the deadliest weapon ever to have existed, and gorgeous imagery of fission and the atom at a microscopic level ( which felt like it was almost haunting him throughout the film). I was constantly blown away at the caliber of talent that showed up in the most trivial roles, which Nolan is known for doing and really levels the playing field for every actor involved. I won't be surprised if multiple actors/actresses are nominated for their supporting roles here. I also love how he sticks to shooting on film and using miniatures in lieu of CGI. All these things bring that much more authenticity to this film. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and watch it on Imax. It's an experience as much as it is a movie. ü§Ø",POSITIVE

The movie brings the topic to the table once again. The dangers of this project have never died and is still a threat to humankind and all other life.,POSITIVE
"Oct 8, 2023","To say that I have many complex and conflicted emotions about this film is an understatement. The narrative was not at all what I expected but still made for an unnerving, edge of your seat watch. 

The pros:
- A much more emotional film than expected, ""Oppenheimer"" unfolds as a tragic and surprising character driven story whose takeaways transcend time. 
- Tremendous acting from nearly every member of an all-star, ensemble cast, notably Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr, and Emily Blunt. Cameos from Gary Oldman and Tom Conti steal the show. 
- Quality of costumes, hairstyles, and makeup made you feel as though you were really living in the time period alongside the characters.
- Sound and cinematography of the bomb detonation scene was masterful.

The cons:
- Too much of the plot explored the details of Oppenheimer's personal life drama and the inquiry after the war. At times I felt the work of the scientists in the development of the bomb was more of a subplot.
- Excessive timeline jumping made the story confusing and hard to follow.
- Dialogue was often difficult to understand due to the speech patterns of several characters as well as the tendency of the background music to be louder than required.
- Number of characters felt excessive with most of their appearances feeling rushed and underdeveloped.
- Nudity scenes felt forced and were inconsistent with the rest of the film's tone.",NEUTRAL
"Oct 8, 2023","This was so good. There was some over-acting, and I thought there would be more buildup about the actual building of the bomb. I read that Nolan wrote the script in first person as Oppenheimer, which is so cool. It paid off in the form of a very intense character analysis:",POSITIVE

"Oct 7, 2023","The topic it too important and Nolan's film does not do justice to it. The film pace is too fast, there is no place to breathe, the explosion is underwhelming, and unlike other Nolan films, there really isn't much to think about when you leave the theater. Actually I could not remember much of it at all due to the frantic pace. It felt like watching cocomelon. The subject of dropping the bomb on innocent civilians (I know it hurts to read this) is not shown in picture, but through a weird scene in the theater. This is def the worst Nolan film for me and I'm baffled by the praise it received.",NEGATIVE

Many of the characters that were instrumental to the making of the bomb are never really identified or followed up. Louis Szilard, for example. No follow-up of the other characters at the end of the movie. 

I thought the sound and visual effects were a little cheesy. And there was hardly any explanation of how nuclear fission worked, nuclear fusion, or the two different types of bomb.

The black-and-white only half works, but it looks great in IMAX. We really get to know Oppie thru the great acting by Murphy and all the details Nolan put in the script. If you're in the IMAX theatre and you are keeping up with all the dialogue on the edge of your seat, definitely a 4.5 star experience!

Cillian Murphies performance was great, he did a bang up job, really the bee's knees. All the celebrity cameo's weren't just cameo's either, they actually had somewhat important roles in the movies.

"Sep 29, 2023","I am writing this as someone who knows very little about science and didn't even know who Oppenheimer was before coming into the theater. The movie was extremely interesting, and I think it's only real downside is the amount of characters, and if you're like me and you do not know who all these people are, you're going to be confused. Funnily enough tho, it was this confusion that made me WANT to watch the movie a second time, and then eventually I decided to go a third. This is the only piece of fiction that has ever made me go to the cinema three times in a row, let alone a three hour long one. I think the most insane thing for me is that it didn't even feel like a three hour movie, because I was so intrigued throughout. I'm giving it a 4.5/5 because I think there were some points where it could have gone faster ( I also wasn't a fan of the sex scenes - except for the vision sex scene in the small court room, that one was brilliant). For a documentary/biography style movie, it was surprisingly jaw dropping and anxiety inducing from start to finish. Amazing cinematography, perfect cast, and a brilliantly rewritten ""story"" of the father of the atom bomb. Couldn't recommend this more.",POSITIVE
"Sep 29, 2023","Christopher Nolan is a genius. Everything from amazing imagery to emotional scenes, this movie delivers on its promise to be one of the best of the year. Oppenheimer could be analyzed for days on end, much like Nolan's other films, the depth and deliberate choices make for an excellent story-telling experience. Seeing the bomb go off for the first time is much like how these scientists felt about the experiment, at first it is a thing of beauty and marvel, and then the pressure wave hits and reminds everyone of the danger that has been released upon the world. Worth watching this spectacle of a film more than once.",POSITIVE
"Sep 29, 2023","A fantastic viewing experience lessened only by running an hour longer than needed, a hallmark feature of Christopher Nolan.",POSITIVE

"Sep 29, 2023","truly fantastic film, it's exactly what I expect from a cast like this, formidable actors, it's right that the film lasts this long at least you understand the story well. I really liked the suspense of the speech with Einstein which they kept secret until the end",POSITIVE
"Sep 29, 2023","I must‚Äôve seen a different movie from everyone else because this was a boring, snooze fest. I about drifted off several times and every time I did, Nolan would throw a loud jolt to bring me back awake. My friend kept nodding off as well. The performances were alright and it was a cool ensemble cast, but that doesn‚Äôt make up for the crappy script. Many of these scenes were repetitious, I heard too much talk about communists and communism and most everything said about them was repeated ad nauseum. The most interesting character is killed off before half the movie is over. They made Albert Einstein look like a goofball that I couldn‚Äôt take seriously. The bomb was the only good part. And it didn‚Äôt last long despite everything else being drawn out far too long. When I left the movie I was just very disappointed. Cannot believe all the hype for whatever I just watched. ",NEGATIVE

"Sep 27, 2023","Oppenheimer: A marvelous insight into modern history.

As a history buff, and someone who thoughrougly enjoys learning more about modern history Oppenheimer was an appealing film to go and watch. Oppenheimer is a historical drama and thriller directed by Christopher Nolan and featuring Cillian Murphy, Florence Pugh, Robert Downey Jr. and Emily Blunt. The intention of the director was to tell a cautionary tale from the perspective of the American theoretical physicist, Dr. Robert Oppenheimer. Nolan describes the film as ""how the personal interacts with the historic and the geopolitical"". Released on July 20th 2023, the film brilliantly describes the minor and major details of Oppenheimer's life. 

The overall acting and performance in the film is superb. However, Cillian Murphy does an extraordinary job at portraying the character of Doctor Oppenheimer. For example, there is a scene of Oppenheimer giving a speech to a crowd after the bomb had been dropped and killed a large number of the Japanese. He clearly communicates to the audience his characters inner doubts about having created the bomb. As he speaks to the crowd with conviction about the great bombing, the viewer can interpret from his expression that the way he truly feels about the bombing does not correlate with what seemed a strong-minded speech. I certainly believe that no one else could have filled the role of Oppenheimer. Due to Murphy being well known for his role as Tommy Shelby in Peaky Blinders, we know that he is an expert at playing the role of historic or modern historic characters. Although there was no acting in Oppenheimer that I strongly disliked, I felt that they could have cast a different actor to Florence Pugh for the role of Jean Tatlock. Pugh's acting to me felt borderline cringeworthy. Pugh is more suited to her more innocent roles like in Little Women. Personally I believe  that an actress like Samara Weaving would have been a better fit when I think back to her acting in The Babysitter. Weaving has an uneasy and edgy quality to her acting that would perfectly suit the role of Jean Tatlock as Jean is the character that initiates the affair between herself and Oppenheimer.

As we already know, Oppenheimer is based on true events. This makes it all the more exciting to watch as we know that what unfolds in the film has taken place in real history. When analysing the plot of Oppenheimer, The way the producers have used the combination of the narrative and sound helps to tell the story in such a frantic yet captivating way, that it almost becomes a thriller. For example, there is a point in the film when Doctor Oppenheimer is giving his speech to the media. In this scene the audio fades in and out and the visuals become blurry and begin to flash. This use of effects in the film create a tense and chaotic atmosphere in order for the audience to experience the scene from Doctor Oppenheimer's perspective. This is clever as it keeps the audience  engaged and provokes our realisation of Oppenheimer's state of mind.

A three hour film, some have commented on its length and typically, I am all for a good slow paced and lengthy film or series. Slower paced films have a greater build up to the climax of the narrative and results in a more profound impact on the films audience. However, I found that in the beginning of Oppenheimer there were parts that lengthened the narrative unnecessarily and I admittedly found myself checking the time to see how long I had been in the cinema for. A film critic named Bob Grimm articulates my feelings exactly when he says; ""Nolan has made a good-looking, well-acted movie about the father of the atomic bomb, Robert Oppenheimer‚Äîbut it feels a bit bloated at three hours"". 

Oppenheimer's target audience is mostly male and leaning toward more mature or senior audiences too. However personally, I would recommend this film to someone who can appreciate modern history and has a deep understanding of it. Aside form that, I would recommend it to someone who can withstand a three hour movie and has an interest in politics and explosions. I definitely would not recommend the film to someone with a short attention span as the beginning of the first half of the film is slow. Oppenheimer is R rated meaning that individuals under the age of 17 are advised to be accompanied by a parent. There are moments of coarse language, sexuality and nudity, however because these are very few and only brief parts of the film, I would recommend that the age restriction is 16 years old at the lowest. Oppenheimer is a great film depicting the complicated details of Oppenheimer's life and the road to developing the atomic bomb. I rate this film highly and believe it deserves the attention is has attracted over the past few months however, would give it a rating of four out of five. This is only because of the length of the narrative which for some could take away from being able to fully immerse ourselves in the film. Although I do not think this should be a deal breaker because once the film reaches its climax, it is a true  gem. This film is incredible and a great eye opener into modern history.",POSITIVE
"Sep 27, 2023",Was a great way to tell the story,POSITIVE
"Sep 27, 2023","Really really good movie. Very interesting choice making use of swapping of black and white film throughout the movie. Don't see that done very often these days and most often it doesn't seem very well executed. 3 hour runtime is a touch unjustified in my opinion with a lot of the middle portions of the film being more padding than anything. That said, this movie does very well at creating a very breathless feeling. Watching the initial test of the nuclear bomb during the film created a feeling not many movies have successfully done. Overall, good movie, interesting subject matter for the most part but trimming it down maybe 30 minutes might have been for the best.",POSITIVE
"Sep 27, 2023","I love historical fiction and have seen this movie 6 times, gets better each time. I see it!",POSITIVE

"Sep 27, 2023",Well done. Excellent acting. Felt content was well covered.,POSITIVE
"Sep 27, 2023",The use of color and black and white filming helped to show the struggle he experienced battleing with his beliefs.  The overall experience could have improved greatly with the removal of 40 minutes of commercials before the movie started. I can understand why theaters are struggling to fill the seats. In hindsight I should have rented it from a streaming service.,POSITIVE

"Sep 27, 2023","Listen, right off the bat I want to say Oppenheimer is great. It's a solid movie. It's got a solid premise. It's got great visuals. However, there is absolutely NO reason for the movie to be 3 hours long. It's overkill. So, no, it's not Nolan's best work. It's his most innovative work, yes. I would even say it's his most filmmaker-y film, yet. However, the script could use a couple once overs as the story does drag, but disguises itself as ""Nolan Flare."" I see you, Nolan. I see you.

Where I have the most difficulty, however, in writing this review lies in this one question, ""How do you make a review on a product that is just good overall, barely anything wrong, just nitpicks? Especially when others have already done it and done it well."" Here is what I have found, the Oppenheimer type has finally died down, it's time for me to say something.

I think I wasn't pulled into the spectacle that was Oppenheimer because I was already there. SO many reviews and video essays on the importance of Oppenheimer and the message it yields. Yet, I was sitting in the theaters thinking, ""Welcome to the apparently exclusive club that is being evidently self-aware of how the world has been operating this entire time. WELCOME, NOLAN!"" To me, I just thought Nolan was hitting points we have already been discussing. Turns out, that wasn't the case, seemingly at all. Turns out, the world was oblivious to the fact that humanity's worst enemy is, indeed, humanity (less dramatically: human greed, not really humanity as a whole). I knew this since I was about 12 when I started observing people and chain reactions in behavior for screenwriting and storytelling. So, yes, the visuals were great, but I understood the message and wasn't at all ""wow-ed"" or _floored"" or ""perplexed."" I simply agreed with it as it should be.

So, I understand others wanting to give it a perfect score, but you have to look at things realistically. The ""no cgi"" was indeed harmful during some emotionally heavy moments (yes, I am talking about the Atomic Bomb‚Äìslightly underwhelming); the script was a little too ambitious; and retina characters weren't needed absolutely at all, nor did those characters do well, surprisingly (yes, I am talking about Florence Pugh). Don't drink the Nolan Kool Aid, unless you want to, then by all means, ENJOY IT ALL!

In the end, Oppenheimer really is a great and creative film. It's definitely a must watch. It put a smile on my face pretty much throughout all of the film; I just think it's way too long for little to no reason. What do I say? There are just a few script factors that hold me back (plus that underwhelming atomic bomb, YIKES) from giving it a perfect score, but it and Nolan deserve a long-overdue Oscar for Oppenheimer. Hot take & thesis: Oppenheimer is just another ""good movie"" to add to the history of ""good movies.""

Oppenheimer gets an 8.7 out of 10.",NEUTRAL

"Sep 26, 2023","I usually enjoy historical movies and biographies but this movie was utterly boring and a bit scattered.  The character development was pretty weak and even though I recognize some of the characters from a historical context you never really feel any sort of connection or empathy with any of them, particularly the main character.

"Sep 26, 2023","The best film of the year without a doubt.
Oppenheimer is the most thrilling biopic film I've ever watched and probably ever will. Nolan transfers his energy from creating thrilling set pieces in his other movies into the dialogue scenes here which possess an oscillating sense of tension in them.

"Sep 24, 2023",I'm interested in the history surrounding Oppenheimer but there was too much switching going on between characters making it difficult to follow.

I didn't want to watch because I've never liked Cillian Murphy as an actor, too up himself, but he really does a fantastic job. Respect. 

It does show what a bunch of bullies the USA are, but watching that in films won't change anything.

"Sep 24, 2023","Christopherb Nolan is reputable for his way of synthesizing and presenting information.
This movie however is a genius in character presentation of right thread trapeze portrayal of characters, pretty well known to history.
The liberties he has taken to weave this portrayal is spell binding.
I thoroughly enjoyed the character of Oppenheimer played so well by C Murphy, as he succeeds in bringing his madness in scholastic pursuit to a tremendous reality only to regret the tremendous cost.
He struggles as he almost believes why suffrage that comes his way is rightfully his karma.
Hats off to this amazingly intricate screen play and beautiful weather if characters. Excellent movie!!",POSITIVE

A well crafted film with real star power and an interesting plot, with a story I otherwise would not be interested in as well as a character I have no allegiance with, Oppenhiemer somehow manages to change both these issues rapidly with strong story telling, interesting characters and A grade filmography.

Not to mention everything following the bomb seemed insignificant, vastly inferior, and excessively drawn out. The films climax seemed completely misplaced.

"Sep 18, 2023","Nolan alla prova definitiva dopo il non completamente riuscito Tenet, costruisce un'opera mastodontica, definitiva.
""Oppenheimer"" √® uno dei progetti pi√π ambiziosi mai creati, immenso in ogni suo aspetto, ambizioso a livelli incredibili.
Il tanto parlato 70MM Imax √® il primo indicatore della portata dell'opera e non si pu√≤ dire che sia un errore.
La qualit√† dei dialoghi, la veridicit√† di ogni scena rispetto alla reale storia, l'immensa ed infinita qualit√† del cast e la perfetta scelta di intermezzare i lunghi dialoghi con forti suoni ed immagini spettacolari volte a non far appiattire mai l'emotivit√†; tutto √® riuscito.
La differenziazione tra le sequenze a colori e quelle in bianco e nero √® molto sottile ma una volta capita aggiunge un ulteriore punto di vista.
Per poter comprendere a pieno tutti i dettagli del film sarebbe necessario rivederlo diverse volte; certo rimane il suo culmine con il test sulla bomba, una sequenza tanto spettacolare quanto emotivamente piena di significato.
Un'opera che fa bene al cinema e che permette di conoscere anche un pezzo di storia recente molto importante anche per i risvolti dei nostri giorni.",POSITIVE

Watch it also on a regular cinema screen for the intimacy which allows one to feel the emotions expressed by the characters.

E non parlo solo della fotografia, indubbiamente su livelli colossali, ma parlo della storia, delle performance degli attori, del dolore e della passione che si percepisce con un solo sguardo diretto in camera.
Tre ore per dipingere uno dei quadri antimilitaristi pi√π bello e struggente che abbia mai visto.

There was too much meaningless talking attended by a lot of dramatic music, but hardly any real drama.

"Sep 16, 2023","Slow and drawn out, for someone who has already explored and studied the making of the trinity bomb makes the movie extremely uninformed on the true details of the effects and aftermath. 
Walked out the theatre 20 mins before the movie could end. Literally couldn't watch anymore",NEGATIVE
"Sep 16, 2023","The movie has no arc. All events lie flat with little depth. I will say that it is very professional but again the characters simply feel flat. 

All that glitters isn't gold.

A much, much older crowd might have a better time watching the film but the truth is the vast majority of us aren't physicists so the film can give the illusion of quality but in reality the whole mess just feels like one big vague event with no real emotional complex. 

Not a bad try but nothing from this is actually memorable. I believe this movie gets praised simply because people don't understand what's happening but it gives the impression that something important is happening so they feel like they owe it praise out of fear it will somehow subject them to ridicule. 

There are far better movies out there with not as much praise. Simply looking and acting like you know what you're doing seems to be enough for 90% of the crowd. As I said I appreciate the professionalism but very little about this has the human element that makes a movie relatable and worth watching.",NEGATIVE

"Sep 15, 2023","I went to this movie without any expectations but I still left disappointed. It's a confused movie with no clear beginning or end, confused about which story to follow and how. 
**[SPOILER] If we divide the movie into about 3 equal parts, in the first hour of the movie there is a quick Oppenheimer intro, this part is a bit biographical, but it's very choppy, in the form of reels videos that don't really connect... I think after we've been led to believe what a genius Oppenheimer was by these cut-out videos, we finally get to the main event, which is the construction of the nuclear bomb. Here the events are treated with a little more emotional depth, but still mediocre. The dull elation after the first successful attempt, Oppenheimer's (very short and shallow) ethical questioning and agonizing... None of them leave a mark, not even on the actors, and the intended emotion is not conveyed to the viewer. The last hour is a different matter. Here Oppenheimer is presented not as the main character, but only as a figure, and in contrast, it tells the story of Mr. Strauss, who crosses paths with him, his desire to be appointed to the country's prestigious institution and his ego battle with Oppenheimer. It tells this story, but we don't understand how this anger, this lawsuit, end up being at this point. [SPOILER]**

For this movie to be a meaningful movie without giving up this plot, I think it should have been 6-7 hours long OR maybe it was necessary to compromise on one of these 3 parts and make the whole movie focusing on one of them.
Here we seem to be watching the results of a director who is so good that nobody can say ""maybe you shouldnt do this"". Having seen it in 70mm, the visuals were a revelation. But it's as if Nolan forgot about directing and editing while he was masturbating to the technical aspect of the movie... Somebody should have said to Nolan, ""Do what you want to do with 70mm, but let's not jump between time periods here, let's not make unnecessary plot twists here, let's stay focused on one thing here"". Nobody did, and if they did, they couldn't get him to listen. The result is a waste of resources and opportunities, a movie that only saves itself from being mediocre due to the fact that its very interesting from the technical aspect, a movie that saves the rest of its fate due to its actors, but a movie with a lot of flaws in both script, editing and directing...
Those who want to go and watch it just because it's from Nolan shouldn't tire themselves too much. Instead, they can just sit down and watch A Beautiful Mind, watch the Imitation Game, watch the Theory of Everything; watch other Nolan movies but stay away from this one. Only if you're an analog lover or a technical geek, this might be an enjoyable experience for you.",NEUTRAL

"Sep 13, 2023","Do factually-based films garner intrigue solely over its subject, or mainly based on who's telling it? Christopher Nolan's directorial skills come across as experimental, magnificently scaled and artistically compelling as his growing mastery remains consistent. His latest feat separates from his original works as he goes from portraying certain allegories to fully working off the facts in an embrace, though of course the visionary's original taste still manifests in interpreting those facts under stellar depictions. The subject of focus is cinematically introducing, whilst revisiting, the father of the atomic bomb J. Robert Oppenheimer, based off the 2005 biography ""American Prometheus"" ‚Äì titularly referring to how the mentioned god brought fire down to man then eternally punished.

During World War II, Lt. Gen. Leslie Groves Jr. appointed physicist Oppenheimer to work on the top-secret Manhattan Project, purposed in building a bomb that would defeat their enemies before another strike could happen. Oppenheimer and a team of scientists spent years developing and designing the atomic bomb, eventually coming to fruition in 1945 as they witness the world's first nuclear explosion. More-so an academic beneficiary over theoretical lengths with dangerously forewarn calculations that positioned the event as forever changing the course of history, it's framed under political pressure that decides Oppenheimer's placement, but that weight is the least of his haunted conscience.

Normally, not much would've been approached towards the subject alone if remain unheard despite the felt ramifications originated from the depicted period's weaponized achievement. More likely if it were a documentary with an angle that would intrigue. Leave it to renowned storytellers who sought and envisioned the value these stories possess by relevancy reflected upon the current, timely associated climate, especially if it regards fact-based pictures poised to remind towards preventing history repeating itself. Not only did Nolan directed at his finest when enlarging the dialogue-driven debut ""Following"" amidst his specially-scaled spectacle of grand practicality and minimized digital interference, he's written the screenplay with pressurized earnest. One thing to really acknowledge regarding the taut script is that Nolan took the unique approach of writing it entirely in first-person surrounding the eponymous perspective, therefore interpreting those conversational flows under adjacent to his worldbuilding knack. Just telling it from Oppenheimer's viewpoint enables us to identify the ethics in the figure's cautious pursuit then shaken abstract thoughts, particularly when the teachable concept beneath concerns creating a new world in a fiery flash. Curiously, similar to his other mainstream breakthrough ""Memento"" ‚Äì which he largely revisited in ""Tenet"" structurally-wise by exaggeration ‚Äì Nolan cleverly used differential shading just to identify narrative shifts between opposing stances that prepped the political thriller afterthought in post-climax with recognizably stylized turns gripping tensely. Considering how lengthy it became and under the particular focus, it's told the whole story by necessary means with minimal flexibility that doesn't disrupt.

So far, the only directorial credit when he didn't write is ""Insomnia"" as Nolan tends to deliver complex communication with exceptional flow of ideas that would both fuel the awe-spiring grip and convoluting senses, as well still finding complications in maintaining the synergic pacing. As evident when further elaborating those conversational points that may be deemed as unfamiliar upon the conceptualizing buildup that runs on as threatening tediousness, they classily formulate in a heightening matter for the involving imagery that stunningly serves under a delicate balance of the worldbuilding root. Art cannot be rushed, so patience nearly delivers with proportionate results, especially by justification when emphasizing the scale of it all. This is typically one of Nolan's defining traits as he urges realistic set pieces so the film's sequential events can be convincing enough to feel the gravity, especially when self-required to replicate its main event of evaluating the bomb and capture all its explosive glory as primary immersion. Both Nolan and his frequent collaborator cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema managed to express the very gravity to the point of enveloping the audience feeling the tension with resonated anxiety, followed by second collaboration with composer Ludwig Goransson also contributing to the weighing tension throughout by continuous unique induction via thickening score.

Amid the practical apparatus replicating the ideal realism with the narrative weight taken into serious consideration, the film boasts an impressive cast finding their mesmerizingly, ethically performative peaks with organic chemistries. Cillian Murphy, in his sixth film with Nolan and finally leading, define his best by genuinely delivering a sharp tour-de-force performance as Oppenheimer with such exceptionality and an expressive psychological connection spiritually grasping how haunted his conscience was. Significantly, Emily Blunt portrays Katherine Oppenheimer with fiery empowerment, Matt Damon charismatically carries the stress of the Project as Leslie Groves Jr., and finally Robert Downey Jr. enhances his caliber in a complicated, as remarked, supporting actor role as Lewis Strauss, chairman of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission with a grudging hold on the politics surrounding Oppenheimer. Gravitas is key idealistic in these performances, which is a typically encouraged expectancy whenever watching an intelligently deep Nolan-esque picture with gentle approaches, bold convictions and strong dynamical pacing while regarding the looming stakes in the story. You can feel Nolan's own defined perfection in his craft, but it's the excellent ensemble cast that substantially interacts in lively fulfilling the given structure's narratively created platform, which spirited the connective experience watching it with eased captivation ‚Äì though tediously hinted if gets lost in the lengthy conversation without a firm grasp.

From ""Following"" and ""Memento"" to ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Dunkirk"", with ""Tenet"" a bit of a convoluting step-back, Christopher Nolan's latest ""Oppenheimer"" continues his estimable, fine craft as he once again converted a factually-based source material into his own recognizable angle. Interest initially piqued during his previous production, there couldn't come a better time to visualize this story, with an emphasis in its meaning and significance as it's ominously linked to some explosive outlets in today's climate with a harrowing realization by prophesized, or even as mentioned calculated, connection. We may receive a dreadful reality check over the origins and sharing Oppenheimer's eventual sentiment, particularly his readable expression and thought process in the powerful final moment, it neatly caps off what's an accumulation of a visionary, artistically epic mastery as the lengthy biopic deftly strengthens its thrilling grip with outstanding imagery and mesmerizing performances. As we're in the second half of 2023, the awards season is inching much closer, this film deserves to be a worthy contender for the best in presentation and talented showcases. (A-)",POSITIVE

There was clearly research done on the characters in the movie, and everybody did a good job acting.  I'm actually pretty big into history, too, but it just wasn't that great of a story to begin with.

And for all the people talking about how cool the explosion was, that was the meh-est thing in the movie.  I know it was a practical effect, and that's probably why it looked so lame.  Oh, cool, you blew up 10,000 tons of dynamite or however much it was.  That doesn't mean it looks like a nuclear explosion, much less an impressive one.

It was after that, that I gave up and walked out.  I just didn't care about the people in the movie.  I already knew there would be the standard denunciations of McCarthy-ism, and I just didn't care where any of these people ended up after that.",NEUTRAL

There are moments where the audience is built up for catharsis and poof: he just doesn't tip them over. He's a technically brilliant director who just needs a nudge from someone - a producer, editor, cinematographer  - to remember there needs to be something that sinks into the audience. The irony is that RDJ managed it in his scenes, and Emily Blunt in the not-trial did it, because they are supremely skilled actors who were able to breathe that element into those scenes. Murphy is brilliant but couldn't carry that for Nolan because he was Oppy who was emotionally crippled by his brain. That gap in Nolan's toolkit was very noticeable. I would almost say Ron Howard needs to pull him aside and go through Apollo 13 frame by frame with Nolan to show him how to move from skilled to maestro of the biopic.",NEUTRAL

Its cast is fantastic and Cillian Murphy is the best option to play Oppenheimer but without a doubt for me the golden performance of the film is that of Robert Downey Jr. The bad thing is that sometimes the film becomes heavy and about 15 or 30 minutes They can be cut and the last point (the biggest failure of all) is how extremely cold the sex scenes that appear are and it gives the impression that they are two robots since they do not show humanity.",POSITIVE

"Sep 10, 2023","The only part of the movie that I thought was interesting was the actual making and exploding of the weapon at the end. The first part of the movie was filled with a lot of boring talk by professionals in physics, math, etc., often while holding drinks in their hands.  Many of these professionals were either talking snarkily to each other or behind each others' backs,  or telling each other just how brilliant they are. There was some unnecessary nudity, showingOppenheimer as an adulterer.   His wife was seen as being extremely stressed fom taking care of their little baby and how they had to give him to someone else for awhile.  What, no nannies available?   I have known professionals and physicists who would not have denigrated their peers in the way this movie shows.  In my opinion a mostly boring holywood mess.",NEGATIVE

I definitely recommend this movie if you are a history buff, love Christopher Nolan films, enjoy politics, or love a good story!",POSITIVE
"Sep 9, 2023","The story here is not as much about the scientists making the bomb, but the red scare period of the Cold War.  It was really painful to watch what was done to the brilliant Oppie post-war, even if you didn't know he wound up teaching grade school kids. Robert Downey Jr. is definitely in the Academy Award zone for his turn as Strauss in this film, as was Cilian Murphy and Emily Blunt.  For some, the jumping around from the color story to the b&w later period might be confusing and annoying, but it's worth sticking it out to watch all the brilliant cast do their thing in telling this tale. I did need ear plugs for the super-loud parts.  No joke.",POSITIVE

"Sep 8, 2023","Since my three children and I highly admire the movie director Christopher Nolan, we watched Oppenheimer last week. Because this film was highly anticipated, we're looking forward to watching it in theaters.

Despite being impressed by the climactic explosion scene, I found the film underwhelming. 

First, I'm not sure what the director intended to convey. Did he want to change people's thoughts about the scientist? Was he eager to show the fanatical McCarthyism? Or did he want to discover the secret about the atomic bomb? Anything among these wasn't quite hitting the mark for me.

Secondly, I didn't appreciate its running time. It could be better if it were shorter.

Last but not least, as a fan of Florence Pugh, I found she was exploited improperly, especially sexually.

I have seen no Christopher Nolan films just once; however, this one might be the first, unfortunately.",NEUTRAL

"Sep 8, 2023","It's a great movie, don't get me wrong. Great actors, great cinematography. But Oppenheimer didn't credit
160 VFX artists just to claim it's a no CGI film. A lot of hard work was put into this movie from dozens of artists, just to pretend like VFX was never used and erase their trace in a form of credit.",NEUTRAL
"Sep 8, 2023","Oppenheimer might be Nolan's most focused movie since Dunkirk, complete with his usual flourishes that both help and hurt his lavish biopic. This is a film that I suspect most will enjoy more if they do a little research on Oppenheimer and The Manhattan Project before seeing the film, as important sequences in the film actually never happened. This also isn't helped by a rapid passage of time that's not properly explained, and a story that jumps back and forth in time that makes what should have been a straightforward film needlessly complicated. 

Despite these issues, Oppenheimer delivers on every other front. Every performance in the film is excellent, and I can definitely see Cillian Murphy getting a Best Actor nod at the Oscars next year. Composer Ludwig Gorranson's violin based score perfectly encapsulates every scene in the movie to the point where it was a major highlight for me. Returning cinematographer Hoyte Van Hotyema lavishly shoots and frames every shot of this film, turning it into a visual treat especially in larger formats.",NEUTRAL

Alas, they may as well just have shown me a 10-minute printed summary, because most of the dialogue was so muddled and murky that all I got was the general gist of it. I had been warned by friends that they ""couldn't understand"" most of the movie, but I assumed the issue was the technical subject matter, not the sound quality. Instead, it reminded me of ""Games of Thrones"", which I abandoned in its second season for the same reason. I'd LOVE to know the reasons ""Oppy's"" characters did what they did, but I don't have the time to go read the book.

"Sep 7, 2023","OPPENHEIMER - BOOM
This film is a happy marriage. One between the reality of historical facts and their intertwining within an amazingly dramatic cinematic presentation. This film's reported success, not withstanding the juggernaut of BARBIE, is heartening on a lot of important levels. It has had to overcome some considerable obstacles: a significant portion of the dialogue deals with theoretical physics, it's runtime is a whopping 180 minutes, it has no car chases, fist fights or explosions ‚Ä¶ sorry, scratch that last one - it's all about explosions. Perhaps the biggest hurdle it overcomes (that warms the cockles of this old heart) is that it's grounded in history; a 78-year-old history. When I first read about its development, I was a doubter. I've continually read that interest in historical events is on the wane more with each generation but, then comes OPPENHEIMER to prove me wrong. I'm so very glad.
On to the film. Many documentaries and books have covered the biographical connect the dots of Oppie's life. However, it took the consummate conviction of Christopher Nolan, one of our preeminent directors to write, direct and produce this film. The facts are all there but Nolan reveals the humanity, commitment and luck that fleshes out, one of the world's most morally complex achievements against Japan ending WWII despite the surrender of Germany. Still the dropping of two bombs on civilian targets is hotly debated to this day.
The film lives in the gray areas of this accomplishment. It exposes the infinite complexity of the man. It deals with the innumerable trials and tribulations of herding the greatest minds of science toward a shared, horrible goal. And while portraying this it ingeniously allows you to appreciate the various common, and contradictory perspectives of the people in this true mission impossible.
Cillian Murphey, while familiar is not only the spitting image of the real Oppenheimer but he uniquely encapsulates the gravitas of the man. He accomplishes this through a soft spoken, logical, almost inhuman detachment of the actual events. Murphy allows us to see the straddle of Oppie's psyche between dispassionate observer and consummate leader participant. It's really an amazing bit of acting. Each of the large supporting cast is pitch perfect with a particular shoutout to Robert Downey, Jr. He's the bad guy - the all too real Lewis Strauss. But credit to Nolan it seems he found a way, aided by no small amount of age-appropriate makeup, to rope in Downey's typical exuberant tendencies into a deft projecting of the jealous, ambitious vitriol of the real-life person he portrays. You almost want to hiss at the screen in the end.
The film is almost divided in two parts. The creation and building of the bomb the first but once it's dropped, despite what it accomplishes the downfall of Oppie begins. This is the story of Oppenheimer of which few people are aware. His life's arc is revealed in his going from Time Magazine's Man of the Year to shunned communist sympathizer overshadowing his later life.  For those students of history, that parallel arc of glory to disrepute is not dissimilar to that of Winston Churchill. Both are tragically similar. 
I've consciously avoided using success as an adjective describing the development and use of the bomb. Anything snuffing out the lives of +100,00 civilians defies that definition to my mind. However, it's impossible to argue against it succeeding in ending the war and thus saving countless U. S. soldiers' lives. That after all was its ultimate intent. Nolan doesn't make an argument one way or the other. He leaves that up to the historians and us.
As a follow-up whether you see OPPENHEIMER, I highly recommend to you another historically based movie that never gained the credit it richly deserved. THE IMITATION GAME is on Netflix. It deals with the cracking of Germany's Enigma code ‚Äì which also helped end WWII in another historical fashion.",POSITIVE
"Sep 7, 2023","Best work of Nolan. Best work of Cillian Murphy. Not my usual type of movie, but fascinating enough i dared not to blink for 3 hours. Watched it a second time today, still fascinated.

Nolan really nailed this movie and I learned a lot of new things about it so it's a win win for both I guess",POSITIVE

The complex theme of a Cold War, a race for world dominion, the use of classical and dramatic music, the CGI, the actors...chills, literal chills, I got goosebumps several times, and trust me, it's rare!
This movie doesn't go with the usual bad Vs good, because the main result is messed up and rotten from the beginning.
It's a rush in time, to see who gets the possibility to rule the world, and doing so, possibly, destroying it.
I must say the movie is very complex (after the three hours I got a mild headache üòÖ) and it may not be suitable for everyone, but it's worth a shot if you like deep, emotional stuff.

"Sep 5, 2023","Oppenheimer is good... in fact it is quite good! I believe it is the most assured movie Christopher Nolan has ever made in his career. It doesn't mean it is my favorite movie of his, but here you feel he is in full control of every dimension of his movie at the same time: narrative, style, acting and technical aspects. Technically, this movie seems perfect - everything is in perfect harmony with everything - but there's a lot of information going on-screen and it is a movie that demands you to be focused. The movie switches from a narrative line to another: the central storyline, which tells the story of Oppenheimer and how his personal and professional life have led him to the creation of the atomic bom; then there's Lewis Strauss' public hearing (the black and white parts); and then there's Oppenheimer's hearing when he's a lot older than in the central narrative line. It's a lot and it is a movie that's not for everybody, but it's a great movie for me.

So, the movie starts giving the audience context about Oppenheimer's early academic life, early personal life, his ventures, his ambitions and his ideals, but (unlike most biopics) all these elements that are presented are later revealed to be highly relevant somehow. For all means, Oppenheimer is not a cool good guy and Nolan understands that, so he makes him an highly charismatic character in order to get the audiences sympathy and then casts Cillian Murphy - a great actor able to deliver a very internal performance under the surface of a man almost made of steel - which shows his genius. Thanks to the way he writes Oppenheimer and thanks to Murphy's presence, Nolan is able to tell a story about an unpleasant man and engage an audience. It's good writing work and it's good directing work, yet this is Cillian Murphy's movie - front and center - and he excels here! It's a magnetic central performance that exudes charisma but relies on a nuanced approach and a very sad heart that carries the movie during its 3 hours running. Here, Murphy delivers the best performance of his career topping his work in 2005's Breakfast on Pluto with an acting turn that contrasts completely with the later one.
The rest of the cast also deliver very strong work, specially Robert Downey Jr. as Lewis Strauss - it's refreshing to see him being back to non-MCU movies in such style. As Strauss, Downey Jr. seems to delve into the mind of the character and absorve all his mannerisms while simply eating the Nolan dialogue. It's a juicy part and the actor uses every second he is on the scene to remind us how (and why) he was considered one of the best actors of his generation. Another big turn comes from Emily Blunt as the typical suffering/supportive wife with a drinking problem - it is by far one of the most conventional (and unchallenging) performances Blunt has ever delivered in recent years, but hers belong some of the best scenes in the whole movie. Blunt could have done this part in her sleep, but she elevates the material and the character and delivers a small acting gem here. Matt Damon and Josh Hartnett are also quite good here and Bennie Safdie gets some room to shine also.
Technically, Oppenheimeir is as great as Nolan's previous big productions, but it all feels way more polished. The production design team did a great job recreating many places and situations that feel quite authentic and historically accurate. The costume design is lovely and the aging makeup is also good (it quite reminds me of A Beautiful Mind's work in this department, actually), but the gold goes to Ludwig G√∂ransson AMAZING score - in fact, I think the score is what actually keeps this movie burning and alive, which helps keeping the pace and help the audiences to be immerse in the 3 hour running. The sound editing and mixing are outstanding and I still feel my room shaking during the Trinity test scene. Great use of visual effects as you can expect from a Nolan movie.
But Oppenheimer also tries to go further the biopic narrative. It manages to offer a perspective about guilt, grief and how dark ambition can be, even for the man who achieves his goals. It's something I think Nolan has never done before: offering moments of introspection and morals. There's a scene full of symbolism that makes a clear point about what Nolan wants to say the world about war and destruction in name of politics. He doesn't totally succeed for me: I consider that scene to be ""too well crafted"" for me in the way it offers so many visual elements that don't chanel the message the director wants to deliver. Yet, I understood what he meant when I came home later.

So, in the end, Oppenheimer is perfectly crafted and it features a complex and dense narrative that's completely bearable thanks to great acting and an amazing score, but... this is a movie with a lot to tell and it tries to be a bit darker than it actually is.  It offers a vehicle for audiences to think about how evil Man can be to its own kind and how political power and political ambition are a menace for our own kind. So, a very good movie in a very traditional way, but with some technical groundbreaking elements that elevate this one. One of Nolan's most solid films ever, but can't top my favorite of his yet.",POSITIVE

"Sep 5, 2023","An utter monstrosity of story-telling, a meandering circle-jerk in which the most convincing protagonist is the bomb itself, in hopes that it might explode prematurely and put viewers out of their collective misery. Kudos to the extensive list of excellent actors, however, for handing in notable performances (Robert Downey, Jr. proves yet again that he is one of the finest in his field). It's a pity that these performances were wasted on such an incoherent mess. And while it's one thing to wreck a film in the editing suite, it's unconscionable to do so and still take an eye-watering three hours of screen-time to do so. If Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and the entire Cold War were not evidence enough of the horrors of the Atomic Age, then ""Oppenheimer"" is the final proof needed that humanity never deserved such a comprehensively ugly fate.",NEGATIVE

"Sep 4, 2023","All Time Classic. Really the only issue is the editing is really good but it can be a bit jumpy and hard to follow at certain points mainly because it gets sooooo wordy and dialogue heavy especially in the stretch before the bomb is about to go off when they go on the spy game subplot. That could've been cut because of how overloading it is with information similar to the whole runtime of something like All The Presidents Men. It does get a bit complex and jumpy when they jump between the Cold War H Bomb and the building of the A Bomb but it's done well enough where I follow it. But it definitely is something you need to pay attention too. Especially the final 30 minute Political Drama which is very involved but not as bad as the spy plot because it's spread out more and more visual. Even when this does get bogged down in dialogue details it ramps it right back up with drama and tension instantly. Outside of that everything else is masterful. RDJ is incredible in this and the best thing but Murphy is amazing as well. The dialogue is really good also and despite it being dialogue heavy at times in ever found it boring or unnatural. I do wish Blunt had a bigger part because it feels like she can just disappear at times but she's good. I love how a third of this is in black and white and distinguishes the H Bomb Plot from the main story. The buildup and actual explosion is amazing and worth the 2 plus hour buildup. I do wish sometimes the slower scenes popped visually more instead of just constant rack focus shots with serious dialogue. But there acted super well, very interesting, and the rest of the shots more than make up for it. This gives a honest real look at who this man was. His faults, his gifts, his accomplishments, downfall, and the consequences of his actions. It is a film that thrills, challenges, dramatizes and makes you think. Everyone should see this once.",POSITIVE

"Sep 4, 2023","It's somewhat unbelievable that a movie about one of the most compelling and fascinating events in history could be as undramatic and dull as ""Oppenheimer"". Most of the film are face-closeups - there are very few long, slow, beats that allow the viewer to enter the world of this story. So this means there is endless exposition. Add to this the trite and cliched dialogue, and the result is an incomprehensible story, with one-dimensional characters. I think it would be more interesting to read the book on which this movie is based, or better yet, stream the documentary, ""The Day After Trinity"" on Criterion.",NEGATIVE

"Sep 4, 2023",Movie was good but not what I expected.  It didn't go into a lot of detail about the Manhattan project bomb design.,NEUTRAL
"Sep 4, 2023","How do I review this movie?  It was well shot, well paced, well acted and a compelling story of reality that has so many parallels to the wonderful Imitation Game. But it also felt out of order, unfocused and anti climactic.  

I am very open to the anti-climactic part being on ME.  I realized I was hoping for a movie about the Manhattan Project.  It wasn't it was a story about Oppenheimer (the title probably should have been a giveaway) but I thought it was just focused on Oppenheimer's activities and management of the project.  The project is certainly prominent in the film, but it was not the driver of the story. 

The main drivers were his infidelity and love of a woman he could not be with, his ""at the time"" not uncommon flirting with communism, and others not-uncommon flirts with fascism, when we were not so tribal and pigeon holed in America, and the scientists dismay that the weapon wasn't enough for the military but they wanted bigger and worse.  Though a compelling argument is made that the bomb DID stop major war.  Deaths from war are minuscule since then compared to prior. 

.My biggest issue was simply that to me, the story climax should have been the successful test of the bomb.  Having that occur near the end of hour 2 with an entire hour to go, didn't sit well with me.  Another film I will watch again now that I know how it goes to see if it hits me differently.  

Also, if you are a massive Florence Pugh fan like me, it is never wasted time to see a film with her, in any capacity. 

The post-",NEUTRAL
"Sep 4, 2023","The most disturbing thing about this movie is it isn't disturbing. It's entertaining, with good actors I will conceed. But it is a sanitized, gutless portrayal of the building and dropping of the atom bomb(s). Complete with a few jokes so our audience doesn't get too depressed about the subject matter! Sorry, but old Oppie isn't getting my sympathy like Nolan wants. Less than 5 minutes is spent on the ""description"" of the effects of dropping the bombs - no, we couldn't possibly be shown the footage of Hiroshima - much to disturbing for the audience I guess. What a huge missed opportunity. Too bad someone like Edward Berger didn't get to direct this.",NEGATIVE

"Sep 4, 2023","COMMON OPINION (and I say 'common' because more than half of the audience was ASLEEP, as confirmed in other theaters as well).

A LENGTHY FILM, almost akin to a documentary, which is nonetheless based on a book rather than the actual historical events or genuine statements made by Oppenheimer.
Complex character names, frequent flashbacks ‚Äì if you lose focus for even a minute, you risk not comprehending anything (scientifically, the maximum attention span is 30 minutes).
To alleviate the (male) tedium, they included 20 minutes of nudity.
The trial didn't matter to anyone.
We're discussing 2 WAR CRIMES that could have been easily avoided, yet in these films, they are portrayed as life-saving decisions (I wonder what people in Japan will think).
After hours of anticipating the Trinity explosion, the bang seemed underwhelming, to the extent that many in the theater remarked, ""They failed the test."" We expected far more special effects.
Given that we were, after all, in a war, they could have at least depicted the scene of the bombs being dropped.
In conclusion? Cinematically and in terms of performance, it was impeccable.
Would I watch it again? NO.
Would I recommend it to everyone? NO.""                                                         
IN iITA: POPOLAR OPINION (e dico popolar perch√® pi√π di mezzo cinema DORMIVA cosa confermata anche in altre sale).
1) FILM PROLISSO quasi un documentario che cmq si basa su un libro e non sulla storia o su vere dichiarazioni di Oppenheimer. 
2) Nomi complicati, doversi flashback, se ti distrai 1 minuti poi rischi di non capirci nulla ( scientificamente la soglia dell'attenzione massima √® di 30 minuti).
4) Per rimediare alla noia (maschile) hanno messo 20 minuti di tette. 
5) Del processo nn fregava niente a nessuno.
6) Stiamo parlando di 2 CRIMINI DI GUERRA tranquillamente evitabili e che in questi film vengono presentati come mosse salvavita.( chiss√† cosa ne penseranno in Giappone).
7) Dopo ore di attesa dell'esplosione di trinity il botto √® sembrato ridicolo tanto che molti in sala hanno detto ""hanno fallito il test"". Ci si aspettava molti pi√π effetti speciali. 
8) Eravamo cmq in una guerra potevano mettere almeno la scena delle bombe sganciate.

However, I found this film terrible

Maybe its a new way to shoot movies which went over my head but what I saw was essentially a 3 hour montage 

The orchestral music was over done in every scene and no atmosphere was allowed to naturally develop through dialogue or character interaction.

There was no sense of character development outside of hearing facets of Oppenheimers sexual endeavours; it was referenced purely for shock factor and we saw no real insight in to any intricacies of the character. Also Robert Downey Jr was a villain? Maybe, maybe not but he ended up outcast at the end of the film based on misplaced jigsaw pieces that were scattered throughout the film, some scenes in black and white, some in colour. Not sure why this was as the film had little linearity. 

Other characters were mentioned in different scenes but due to the mish mash of over done visual spectacle I found it difficult to remember anyone's name apart from the protagonist, Albert Einstein, and the president  

5 minute scene after 5 minute scene had a vague reference to maybe something historically true with the aforementioned orchestral music accompanying some emotional crescendo with one of the ""stars"" of the film which in itself told no story what so ever

"Sep 3, 2023","The sex and nude scenes were totally unnecessary especially as shown.
Other than that the movie was quite intense depicting Oppenheimer's internal struggles. Don't know how over done they may have been. There was some level of jumping around in first 1/3 of movie and little difficult to know what the timeframe was. I was not aware of all the typical political garbage that happens to people who are called on to do something that ends up being judged negatively out of convenience. It was well played and ignored much of the other ""fallout"" caused by the A-Bomb, but then it was all about him and dealing with it all.",POSITIVE

"Sep 3, 2023","I don't know why there's so much hype around this movie. I love historical movies. This was very hard to follow. You aren't sure which scene is past, present or post atomic bomb.

"Sep 3, 2023","the script wasn't really very good, some of the cast felt hamfisted in there as their typecast or too obvious of a cameo. some parts were a decent thrill, but it seemed overly focused in clumsily namedropping historical figures, and the third act drags quite a bit. i would not watch it again, even if i like the 28 days later guy a lot. there just wasnt much to the film other than a bunch of competing egos, and it felt like something that would only be impressive to someone highly impressionable. i'm not sure exactly how accurate all of the film was, but both barbie and oppenheimer were just kind of boring.",NEUTRAL

Movie showed his life from when he was in college learning stateside and abroad, His minimal connection to communism, his inner struggles to make the first atomic bomb, to the terrible way he was persacured after he spoke out about continuing on with bigger and more destructive bombs. See this and you will have a great understanding on what had to happen in order for Oppenheimer to become famous.",POSITIVE
"Sep 1, 2023",Very disappointed. Movie is far too loud - actually painful. Not just loud but after an extended period of quiet a  sudden blasting sound that made you jump out of your seat. The audio problem was not just the volume many conversations drifted in and out of hearing or were just mumbled. The movie itself needed a lot of editing - it was much too long. Many characters were introduced with little info of who they were .The shifting of time just added complexity to an already confusing story. Very poor direction and editing..,NEGATIVE
"Sep 1, 2023","After waiting restlessly for two years I finally watched Christopher Nolan's epic.

I don't even know where to begin. I'm still in awe of what I have just witnessed. Christopher Nolan has the power to suck you right into his world and grabs hold of your attention, due to this I was reluctant to move from my seat and refused to blink. This three hour long epic was so engaging and this feat is only possible because of only one man and he is Christopher Nolan.

The screenplay was just too fricking amazing and I would say a huge improvement from TENET's, the film did surprise me in so many scenes. The film has many great actors but only a few scenes, in spite of that owing to the excellent screenplay all of them get their chance to shine. The last 15 minutes in my opinion were brilliant and the ending was just extremely scary.

Coming to the performances everyone was just fantastic! Mainly Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr and Cillian Murphy. Emily Blunt comparatively had fewer scenes but in this one scene which comes towards the ending, Emily managed to shine in those 5 minutes which called for some cheering in the theatres. Robert Downey Jr was just too good, he was able to portray the different shades of Strauss with ease. Due to the fact that we haven't seen much of RDJ  in the last 10 years except for as Ironman in the MCU the audiences has forgotten what a brilliant actor he actually is. Cillian Murphy was just extraordinarily and he was born for this role. He was able to capture Oppenheimer's physicality as well as his mental state of mind extremely well. He managed to externalise his inner struggles which was marvellous. Now give this man an Oscar that he deserves.

This film is a hard hitting drama on the surface, but I found it to be something close to a horror film. A horror film about the atomic bomb and how it was created. There were so many scenes that scared me and I had an increased heartbeat. The part that scared me the most was the fact that it was real and that this weapon of destruction still exists, the destruction of the world is in our very hands.

In the end all I can say is that this film deserves to be watched in the theatres and shouldn't be missed by any chance.",POSITIVE
"Sep 1, 2023","Exceptional. Not an action movie by any means, this is an involving, captivating and enthralling character study about one of the most important men to have ever lived.  The dialogue was difficult to hear at times, but that may just have been the cinema we were in. I saw it in full 70mm IMAX in Manchester and the experience was unforgettable. The cast and performances were first rate. The images and soundtrack could not have been better but you need to go into watching the film knowing this is not an action movie with a big bomb at the end. Can't wait to see this again at home on 4K blu ray. Another masterpiece from Chris Nolan.",POSITIVE

Plus, it explains how biased America's capitalistic government were so extremely biased to any people who showed socialist and or communistic tendencies as well the disregard for Jews and people of color in the late 30's and 40's and the dirty politics to achieve their goals. Its characters are made of very popular middle-aged stars who made some spectacular performances in this movie, which should get best Picture of the Year.",POSITIVE

Oppenheimer is a great film about a man whom it seems not a lot of people really knew. A story of controlling the energy that can destroy the world. We are witnessed to destruction, betrayal, love, and sadness. We see men yell at each other as they try to control a power they can't comprehend.

"Aug 31, 2023","Christopher Nolan narra en este drama el ascenso y ca√≠da del f√≠sico Robert Oppenheimer, autor de la bomba at√≥mica que fue lanzada en Hiroshima y Nagasaki. Se trata de una buena pel√≠cula con una historia interesante sobre este f√≠sico que alcanzo la fama por crear una poderosa arma destructiva, pero tras arrebatar varias vidas lo dejo con un sentimiento de remordimiento que lo atormento por el resto de su vida. Es una pel√≠cula bien escrita y dirigida con actuaciones aceptables. Claro que debido a las 3 horas de duraci√≥n y la cantidad de di√°logos que tiene puede ser pesada. Toda la pel√≠cula relata el proceso de la creaci√≥n de la bomba durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial y como Oppenheimer tuvo que despu√©s lidiar con graves acusaciones e incriminaciones tras oponerse al uso de su descubrimiento para fines militares. Es una historia de un hombre que descubri√≥ algo poderoso, pero que en manos err√≥neas puede ser peligroso para muchas vidas humanas. En gran aspecto es una historia tr√°gica de un genio prodigioso que quedo maldecido por su descubrimiento. Oppenheimer es una fascinante pel√≠cula hist√≥rica sobre la mente detr√°s de uno de los eventos m√°s catastr√≥ficos en la historia de la humanidad y como esta mente brillante quedo condenada por ello.

"Aug 30, 2023","This film prominently features highly regarded male actors, accompanied by a limited presence of esteemed actresses such as Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt, who portray characters that align with Christopher Nolan's tendency for charismatic yet volatile female roles.

Criticism of Nolan's portrayal of women has been persistent over time. These female characters often possess an alluring and intelligent demeanor, yet their narratives often end tragically‚Äîreminiscent of the marginalized and ill-fated wives in ""The Prestige,"" ""Inception,"" and ""Memento.""

In contrast, the role of Florence Pugh, an exceptional talent within her generation, is regrettably constrained to moments of emotional distress and nudity. Her character, Jean Tatloc, a politically influential psychiatrist with her own compelling backstory, seems underutilized. Similarly, Emily Blunt's portrayal of Kitty, Oppenheimer's belligerent wife, primarily involves offering encouragement to her husband or displaying frustration towards her crying infant. Her sole redemption moment involves an engagingly acerbic exchange with one of Oppenheimer's adversaries.

The film progressively revolves around heated discussions among white male figures within boardroom settings. This focal point not only marginalizes other characters but also positions white men at the forefront of the narrative, relegating other perspectives to the periphery and classifying them as mere distractions or collateral.

However, a glaring omission is evident in the film's historical context‚ÄîJapan. The absence of any substantial focus on Japan in a narrative that centers on Oppenheimer is not only glaring but ethically concerning. The film's neglect of the Japanese perspective renders it morally incomplete, particularly considering it purportedly presents Oppenheimer's perspective on the trauma he experienced.
Moreover, Nolan's treatment of renowned figures like Einstein and the exclusion of John Von Neumann's involvement in the Manhattan Project underscores a concerning oversight in the film's historical accuracy.

The film's tendency toward over-dramatization is evident in its portrayal of Oppenheimer as an unparalleled force in history, capable of deciphering the intricacies of the strong force. This characterization borders on the risible, and its audaciousness aligns with the self-absorption often attributed to Nolan.

The film's final act places undue emphasis on Oppenheimer's security clearance and endeavors to evoke a sense of moral empathy for a man who played a central role in the deaths of thousands. This focus on portraying Oppenheimer as a victim seems misplaced, as historical accounts suggest he grappled less with his moral responsibility and more with personal entitlement.

Rather than addressing the experiences of those who endured war crimes, the film places undue importance on the emotions of those who contributed to such actions. Biographical films that prioritize the perspectives of instigators, especially when told predominantly by white men, prove inadequate vehicles for recounting narratives of imperial aggression and genocide. These narratives inevitably sideline critical aspects of history, limiting the storytelling potential.
Throughout the film, a sense of pretension prevails, reminiscent of Nolan's reputation. The filmmaker appears to have succumbed to his own acclaim, reflected in the film's execution.

While the film's success can be attributed partly to riding on popular trends and the loyalty of Nolan's followers, its critical shortcomings remain evident. This is not the kind of film that warrants repeated viewing. Claims to the contrary may stem from an attempt to project intellectualism rather than a genuine appreciation of the film's merit.

The movie is plagued by significant flaws, primarily stemming from its writing. Regardless of the visual and auditory elements, the inadequacies of the script are undeniable. Dialogue rarely engages, character development is virtually non-existent, and the plot proves insipid. Even the inclusion of A-list actors cannot salvage the screenplay's shortcomings. Hollywood tropes designed for Oscar-worthy performances make an appearance in the film's final moments, emphasizing the film's inclination toward self-indulgence.

Regrettably, the film's perspective remains fixated on the experiences of a privileged white man. The movie refrains from offering insights into the internal lives of the Japanese or depicting the mass casualties inflicted upon them.
The film's neglect of the Trinity test's repercussions on Indigenous and Mexican-American populations is an egregious omission that denies the audience a complete understanding of history.

The film's disregard for the plight of those affected by the Atomic bomb fallout is starkly apparent. Families spanning generations, still grappling with the consequences, continue to seek justice from the U.S. government.

Furthermore, Oppenheimer's deliberate choice to detonate the bomb over United States citizens in New Mexico, neglecting the option to do so in Tennessee, underscores the film's lack of acknowledgment regarding this racially charged decision. Such oversights contribute to a narrative that distorts historical realities and sustains a heroic portrayal of Oppenheimer despite his morally questionable choices.

In conclusion, the film's pretentious perspective aligns with its director's persona. Its success can be attributed to strategic associations and a dedicated fanbase, but it fails to overcome its significant deficiencies. The narrative's shortcomings, coupled with its historical and ethical omissions, underscore the need for a more comprehensive and sensitive approach to storytelling.",NEGATIVE

But how is it possible for scientists, politicians, and various bureaucrats to really talk in that way??? Clearly, I realize that this type of interaction between characters makes a story digestible and engaging, which would have been too boring otherwise, especially considering the extremely long duration. However, the work really loses credibility because of it and ends up becoming ridiculous. I also point out, following the same line, the excessive visual effects typical of Nolan, especially in the first part, when the young Oppenheimer ""sees"" and ""feels"" the macroscopic reality, represented by luminous flows and the like.",NEUTRAL

"Aug 30, 2023","I mostly liked it a lot. I think it helps to have some background information going into it. For example, knowing something about the Manhattan Project is helpful, especially knowing that there were leaks to Russia. It also helps to have some idea of the Red Scare, the McCarthy era, and how far the US went to limit free speech at that time. The movie makes a lot more sense in its historical context. 

One thing I didn't like about the movie - I had a hard time at first following the flashbacks. They were not in chronological order and I didn't know anything, going into the film, about what Oppenheimer did after the bomb was created. In my mind, the introduction of Strauss came too soon for me to catch its significance. But maybe that helped create suspense, not knowing who had betrayed Oppenheimer.",POSITIVE
"Aug 30, 2023",I thought it would be presented in a story line like Pearl Harbor was.  This is just a documentary with no good storyline and suspenseful music blasting for 3 hours.  Literally the best parts of the movie are all in the trailer.  Watch the trailer and there is no need to go to the movie.  If you want a storyline and action I recommend that you don't go to this movie.  If you want to sit through 3 hours of facts presented in a documentary style than you might enjoy it.  The background suspenseful music was too much for too long and I found the entire movie distasteful.,NEGATIVE

Bad writing, poor (or no) editing, and obviously WAY too long. Worst movie score ever recorded - it completely drowned out the nearly whispered dialogue.

"Aug 29, 2023","It's okay as a biographical.  It is too long. Much could have been cut effectively such as the nude scenes which added zero to the story. The soundtrack is awful.  The actors' voices get muffled by the musical background which gets so loud at times it becomes foreground. The actors also mumble and whisper, especially the Oppenheimer character who is a weirdo.  The story did not make emotional sense to me.  It's about scientist nerds who are wrapped up in their careers so they can't see the forest for the trees. Theses geniuses were planning to make a bomb they knew would murder tens of thousands of people and worked on it for years, and then, guess what? they felt bad after it was dropped.   Oppenheimer was definitely a security risk and later on in his career he was not given security clearance. That made perfect sense to me.  But hey, he was accused of hanging out with commies, which he did, but that has become very popular these days. Cry me a river.",NEUTRAL

"Aug 29, 2023",I loved it.  The movie really captured what was going on behind the scenes.  In one scene a German scientist told Oppenheimer to go to Goettingten and find more scientists. Goettingten is where my parents were born.  They were teenagers at the time.  They came to the United States in the 50's to get married and raise a family. That really moved me.  Highly recommend everyone should see this movie. It will definitely enlighten them to what was happening behind the scenes.,POSITIVE
"Aug 29, 2023","Go for the Atom Bomb, stay for the sex and politics",POSITIVE
"Aug 29, 2023","Oppenheimer - 10/10. There's a line in Jurassic Park that kept resonating with me while watching this movie. Its the line Ian Malcolm says in the movie during the lunch scene: ""Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should."" And thats the gist of this movie. Its a cautionary tale, a political one (by far Nolan's most political film), a epic and tragic look at a complex human being that has changed (for better or worse) the course of civilization. Oppenheimer has changed the way war is conducted now, even if that never was his intentions. Nuclear warfare is now as prevalent as ever, and Nolan's last hour or so of the film is dedicated towards giving a warning to all about the dangers of making the next big bomb. Each hour feels like a different movie (the first hour feels like a traditional biopic, the second feels like a tense drama, and the last hour is a surprisingly thrilling political drama). Its excellently directed, acted, produced, written, and conceptualized for the screen. If you're not a fan of talkie type movies, then avoid this movie because you will not appreciate it. But if you're a cinephile, you will love this. This is a master who has honed his craft, and delivered a masterpiece. And that atom bomb testing scene? If you watch this in IMAX (and by all means you have to, its the only way to watch this), then, brace yourselves. Because its outstanding!",POSITIVE

"Aug 29, 2023","Very good, I loved it",POSITIVE
"Aug 29, 2023","Yesterday I saw Oppenheimer for the 4th time - that's something I've only done with a handful of films. Twice in IMAX and twice in regular 35mm print (regular cinema screening). As ever with Chris Nolan he treats his audience with the utmost respect under the assumption that they can keep up and are intellectual enough to understand what is going on on screen (of which there is an awful lot to take in). Reactions to the film have been largely positive but there are people (Logan Paul for instance) who have said they walked out or found it boring simply because of the fact that the film consists largely of men in rooms talking to each other in meetings and board rooms. I think this perfectly highlights certain peoples over-prioritisation of form over substance. Yes the film is largely dialogue but it's about as rich in substance and significance as it gets. The screenplay is one of the best I have ever seen - it takes something pretty special to make an over 3 hour film feel like 2 hours thats almost entirely devoid of action and instead filled with dialogue.

The next thing I want to talk about is Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer - wow wow wow. A career defining performance for the ages. Mark Kermode said ""If Cillian Murphy doesn't get nominated for the best actor Oscar for this performance I will eat my hat off"". The film lives or dies on his performance and is largely from his perspective - the script was actually written in the first person (and also unusually written on red paper which I think is befitting for a film dealing with such harrowing subject matter). What I loved also is the use of IMAX cameras which instead of being used to show truck flips, WW2 dogfights and hospitals being blown up like in his previous films, it is being used to focus on something much more intimate and complex - the human face. Cillians performance is so brilliantly nuanced and varied that this film HAS to be seen on IMAX to be fully realised - expect to see Hoyte Van Hoytema getting an Oscar nomination and possibly a win in Feb next year (depending on what else comes out between now and then). 

There are plenty of other things about this film I could talk about ad infinitum like the brilliant score (I've been listening to almost non stop since it came out) and the beautiful imagery that used next to no special effects - it was nearly all done in camera!). The ensemble cast gave amazing performances too, particularly Robert Downey Jnr, Emily Blunt and Jason Clarke. My only gripe was the sound editing - it was occasionally a little too loud  (particularly in IMAX) making it slightly difficult to make out at times what they were saying. I feel almost as stunned as I was when I'd seen The Dark Knight 15 years ago because this is what Chris Nolan does - you don't just watch his films in the cinema and go home and that's it - they leave the cinema with you. They have tremendous staying power and Oppenheimer is the best film he's made since The Dark Knight (in my humble opinion). 

The actual substance of the film, the meat, the nitty gritty is what I'm most interested in sinking my teeth into and indeed I suspect I will for quite some time. We live in an ever changed world as a result of the Manhattan Project and Oppenheimers work on it. The genie is out of the bottle as mankind will forever be able to unleash the power of the atom and destroy itself - there is no going back from this. The man is fascinating in that he was a walking talking paradox - he invented the atomic bomb with the intention of saving the world from further bloodshed during WW2 at the risk of destroying it. As he famously said, quoting the hindu scripture the Bhagvad Gita: ""Now I am become death, destroyer of worlds"".

One final thing I want to talk about before I sign off on what initially was intended as a Facebook post and has now become something of a university dissertation (thank you if you're still reading this!) is Chris Nolan himself. If you love cinema (and no I don't mean Netflix, Amazon Prime and streaming services), Chris Nolan is one of the few shining beacons of hope cinema has left. Cinema lovers out there need to get behind him and pay to see his movies as he intended - on the big screen (and its great to see it taking as much money at the box office as it has). He really is so so precious (as are a handful of other directors like Tarantino, Bong-Joon Ho, Dennis Villeneuve) and paramount to the survival of cinema where everyone seems to be streaming everything rather than going to Blockbuster to rent a DVD (or VHS in my day!). I had the good honour of meeting Chris in 2017 outside the IMAX screen in London's Science museum and one of the things that struck me was how present he was - he was totally focussed on me and what I was saying which is rare for people of such high profile. I think this is perhaps the ultimate advert for staying present, staying true and living in the now because that's all there is. If you are focussed on process over outcome (a future goal in the ether which detracts you from the present moment) you will invariably be successful. If Chris' increasingly spectacular resume of films isn't testament to that then I do not know what is.",POSITIVE

"Aug 29, 2023","This 70mm viewing as my second watching of Oppenheimer was phenomenal. The film started out shaky as first, but the color and quality was magnificent, contributing to the rustic and historical portion of the film. This second viewing also was better because I could pay closer attention to details of the supporting characters and how Oppenheimer's ""slight"" interactions with him were not so slight in the grand scheme of his security hearing and Straus's cabinet hearing. Overall a great film, would recommend multiple viewings.",POSITIVE
"Aug 29, 2023","Semplicemente sublime, un capolavoro tirato fuori dal pi√π incredibile dei cappelli da parte di Christopher Nolan. E' un film che ti cambia, che ti fa pensare, dal punto di vista di chi lo guarda √® emozionante. Le 3 ore passano tranquillamente grazie anche al modo di coinvolgere lo spettatore durante tutta la pellicola. Essendo un film sulla storia c'era il rischio di trasformarlo in film lungo e noioso, al contrario il regista √® riuscito a portarci in un piacevole viaggio sia dal punto di vista del fisico Oppenheimer sia dal punto di vista di Lewis Strauss. Qualit√†, effetti speciali, fotografia e regia al top, per non parlare del cast; Cillian Murphy spettacolare, da oscar. Da non sottovalutare anche la prestazione di Robert Downey Jr., di Matt Damon e di Emily Blunt. Noi abbiamo effettuato la visione di Oppenheimer, in IMAX e non c'era assolutamente modo migliore di goderci questa pellicola, stiamo parlando di cinema allo stato puro, con tutto il comparto tecnico spinto al massimo. Qualit√† dell'audio e dell'immagine sublime con delle trovate cinematografiche che rimarranno indubbiamente nella storia del cinema. Secondo noi a mani basse uno dei migliori film degli ultimi anni, ovviamente superconsigliato.

Simply sublime, a masterpiece pulled from the most incredible of hats by Christopher Nolan. It's a film that changes you, that makes you think, from the viewer's point of view it's exciting. The 3 hours pass easily thanks to the way of involving the viewer throughout the film. Being a film about history there was a risk of turning it into a long and boring film, on the contrary the director managed to take us on a pleasant journey both from the point of view of the physicist Oppenheimer and from the point of view of Lewis Strauss. Top notch quality, special effects, photography and direction, not to mention the cast; Cillian Murphy spectacular, Oscar-worthy. Also not to be underestimated are the performances of Robert Downey Jr., Matt Damon and Emily Blunt. We have made Oppenheimer's vision, in IMAX and there was absolutely no better way to enjoy this film, we are talking about pure cinema, with all the technical sector pushed to the maximum. Sublime audio and image quality with cinematic gimmicks that will undoubtedly remain in the history of cinema. In our opinion hands down one of the best films of recent years, obviously super recommended.",POSITIVE

"Aug 29, 2023","A visual feast for the eyes that retells the story of the father of the atomic bomb with the utilisation of now perfected story devices that were just beginning to sprout in Nolan's other movies like Momento. Whilst the films more surrealist elements may be lost on some it definitely helps to make this movie feel more inspired then it otherwise would be and helps to give us insight into the thought processes of the characters minds using the premise of show don't tell to its fullest extent. 

While some performances leave a bit to be desired others are fantastic and the cinematography and direction is on point, even if the pacing does slightly falter towards the films climax right before the big punch of revaluation at the end. 

All in all if you want to see a movie for its visual flair or are a Nolan fan then you're going to love this, and even if you're not you'll probably find something to appreciate in it.",POSITIVE

Also, the women characters (only two), though played by actresses who did all they could with bad roles, were portrayed as uniformly unhinged. I would not recommend this movie. Save your money and your three plus hours.",NEGATIVE

"Aug 29, 2023","Mind intriguing and moral bending with an excellent cast to support it all. There should be general knowledge about the man, the people he worked with and also the trails and the politics revolving around it. Otherwise it can be a little hard and confusing to follow at times. It has interesting characters who are very well acted, creatively structured storyline, pleasing set design, really great score and sound design that gets you immersed into tense and chilling moments. The movie's just unnecessarily long. Lots of scenes that drag on a little too much without offering enough, which also makes the movie lose its momentum over and over again. It works as a biography a bit better than it works as a movie.",POSITIVE
"Aug 29, 2023",This movie has absolutely no action what so ever.  It's a 3 hour debate.  Not my cup of tea but to me this movie was beyond boring.,NEGATIVE
"Aug 29, 2023",A bomb from one of my favorite directors. I would have walked out if there was more keg room.,NEGATIVE
"Aug 29, 2023",A very complicated and important story told in an understandable way.  Great acting.,POSITIVE
"Aug 29, 2023","Oppenheimer is Nolan's best film. The directing is great and the writing grabs your attention. So many actors in this movie and it's insane how many share the screen together in such short amount of time.

Cillian Murphy plays his role so well and the way he portrays the character is different and yet interesting. It's emotional especially with how he sees things and how he acts with his eyes.

Robert Downey Jr. is the one who really stood out to me the most in the movie. His acting is the best ever of his career and he stole every scene in was in. Don't be surprised if he gets nominated for an OSCAR and maybe even wins it.

The color and black and white works real well on how the story is told. Even with the use of the practical effects that Nolan always uses. The testing scene of the H BOMB with the silence is one of the best in film and captures so much emotion without a word

Only problem i had with the movie was the run time. You can take off about 20-30 mins of the movie and it is still just as effective if not better.
 
Once we see the test happen with the H BOMB and know what its being used for and how. The movie could have ended there and I would be fine with it. I don't think we needed another 45mins on the Security hearings

I see Oppenheimer being nominated for lots of awards. Especially for lots of Oscars, about 12-14 nominations. It will def sweep the technical categories. Nolan might finally win his OSCAR

Is the movie worth the hype. Yes it is, if you like biopic films and enjoy history go see this movie. If you don't want to sit through 3 hrs then just wait. But its a movie that should be seen.

The movie did remind me of AMADEUS (1984) quite a bit. Because in AMADEUS it's suppose to be Mozart's movie, but Antonio Salieri is the main focus. In Oppenheimer. Strauss is the main focus more than Oppenheimer.

The movie will keep you thinking a few hours after it is over. Oppenheimer is and will be a movie that will be talked about quite a bit in film history even 100 years from now. For its directing, acting, writing and biopic.",POSITIVE

"Aug 29, 2023",Just awful. It dragged on. A guy three rows back fell asleep half way through it. I kept wondering when it would get interesting but it never did. Just the old blacklist tripe very old and the Einstein connection was weak and just not developed. The whole film lacked heart and his moral crisis was muddy and pedantic. A long three hours that would have been better told in 90 minutes not much action considering you had World War Two as a backdrop but you never see any of that. Such a missed opportunity. I am truly surprised but the score. I talked to the other 15 people in the theater and all were bored,NEGATIVE

"Aug 29, 2023",Excellent movie.  Great acting compelling story.  Brings up the lesser known part of Oppenheimer's life when he was accused of being a communist.  3 hours went by quickly.  Highly recommend for both history buffs and those that aren't.,POSITIVE
"Aug 29, 2023","Powerful, beautifully acted (Murphy and Downey Jr especially provide award worthy performances) and yet due to the almost forensic direction I felt slightly detached from proceedings in its post nuclear detonation, political aftermath second act. It's never the less an important movie which is absolutely worth watching, asks important philosophical questions (but doesn't ram any answers down the viewers throat) and deserves the critical love that it will doubtless receive due to it frankly being far superior to the vast majority of big budget movies being made today.. I'm looking at you Barbie..",POSITIVE
"Aug 29, 2023","Anyone of a certain age needs to be aware that much of the dialogue borders on inaudible. The Director does not do sound re-takes for ""stylistic reasons"".  Also something to do with 70mm cameras being noisy. An inaudible movie also lacks style? I guess sub-titles would have been an insult but they would have made the experience much more comfortable. Also wonder whether there was a need for a narrator or some such so we were clearer on things (eg was that Heisenberg as he flashes across the screen? what was the timeframe for Bohr getting to the US? what are these committees doing? who was Strauss?).  Felt as though you were expected to ""go with the flow"" rather than really track the detail but I may not be the best judge, as explained.
But good to see a proper movie as a change from all the juvenile fantasy stuff.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 29, 2023",Good movie but complicated. A little hard to follow with so many characters and lots of jumping around. Too long.,POSITIVE

"Aug 28, 2023","Christopher Nolan's direction turned what could have been a dry and unimaginable production into an inspired film that was visually interesting and insightful into the life of one of America's most complicated historical figures. I loved the juxtaposition of the different parts of Oppenheimer's life but how they all were connected.  Cillian Murphy gave a stellar performance of the title character, showing his slightly different shades in subtle ways. The whole cast was terrific, especially Matt Damon and Robert Downey Jr, who made what could have been a 2-dimensional villain into a mess of contradicting feelings.  Tom Conti gave a delightful portrayal of Einstein who shared thematic words that summed up the film nicely.  As well as Gary Oldman's Truman's humorous but honest take on the president that dropped the bomb.  Five Stars.",POSITIVE
"Aug 28, 2023",Didnt feel like a three hour historical docu-drama.,POSITIVE
"Aug 28, 2023","It  was way too long!!! If you are not in tune with history it may be hard to follow. Best supporting actor Robert Downey Jr., Best screen adaptation, Best costumes for oscar nods. Possibly  getting nominated, Cillian Murphy for best actor and Emily Blunt for best actress.",NEUTRAL

"Aug 28, 2023","Film maestoso , sicuramente non un capolavoro come annoverato da molti ma sicuramente tra i migliori fino ad ora di questo 2023. Murphy calamitante nell'interpretazione e probabilmente candidato all'oscar . Deluso da Downey Junior poich√© la sua interpretazione ricorda negli atteggiamenti, nel modo di parlare e interagire un po' Tony Stark (mi ha dato questa impressione). Colonna sonora di G√∂ransson maestosa che non fa rimpiangere l'onnipresente Zimmer. Film da vedere pi√π volte per cogliere tutte le sfumature e i dettagli come sempre celati nei film di questo grandissimo e divisivo regista di nome Nolan.",POSITIVE
"Aug 28, 2023","I think the movie was marketed more as the workings of the Manhattan Project but ended up being more about the political aftermath. I saw a lot of people walk out in the 2nd hour. The younger generation was expecting something else, they needed to understand the politics at the time in order for it to make more sense.
I'm rating it a 4 because I actually liked it as I'm a scientist and know the politics of it all. I love long movies!",POSITIVE

"Aug 28, 2023","There should have been the means and ways to condense this story down to 2.5 hours... alas, even though it was too long at 3 hours, it was great!  It was enlightening to see the story about the production of the A bomb and the character of the times as the USA committed to this effort.  Also so glad to have a ""perspective"" shown of the efforts of the communist movement in those times.  Both Communisim and Socialism are horrible lies - and Capitalism at it's extreme is very deceptive.  Pray we find our country once again based upon the Constitutional basis of Equity and fairness across all Human rights.",POSITIVE

"Aug 28, 2023","Loved the history, disliked the sex and nudity because it did not do anything for the plot and could be eliminated without hurting the experience. Sexual content was ill placed without reason, especially the scene at the table conducting Oppenheimer renewal security clearance. His sexual mind fantasy in this scene was a silly and confusing fantasy during a serious section of the plot. Lastly, the 3 hour movie to show history was about 50% too long.",NEUTRAL

"Aug 28, 2023",I enjoyed the movie.  I felt that it was more of a history lesson than entertainment...but I am glad I went.

"Aug 28, 2023","Some of the dialogue was hard to hear/understand, but overall it was a great experience. We were very impressed with Robert Downey's portrayal. My wife and I were a little disappointed by the gratuitous nudity, but it was better than many other, current movies.",POSITIVE

This one did an outstanding job of detailing the struggles Oppenheimer had during the post war years.  Something I didn't know much about.  I choose a 70mm film IMAX venue hoping to see the best representation of the movie.  I wouldn't necessarily recommend choosing this over a digital theater after viewing many scratches and defects in the film.  See in in digital format.",POSITIVE

"Aug 28, 2023","The noise level was a bit heavy when seated in C3 and 4. Otherwise, seating was fine, an important factor given that the movie was 3 hours duration. 
The movie was is very thought provoking, the cinematography's inclusion of explosions used to convey different meanings connected to the story line, the presentation of historical information tied to Los Alamos, the Manhattan Project, the in her workings of America's physicists' community of the 1930's  1940's, 1950's and the ties to World War Ii Europe is relevant as background  to today's geopolitics.

"Aug 28, 2023","My only criticism is how weirdly the communist lover character is depicted. I have to think that a lot of footage was cut out - footage that would have explained why she is so important to the main character that he has an all out breakdown upon learning of her demise.  All that is depicted to the audience is what appears to be not much more than a sexual affair, so the lack of character development is noticeable. I feel bad for the actress who spends most her screen time with breasts bared, and is relegated to being a side-story to explain Oppenheimer's accusation of being a Russian spy. In an otherwise brilliant film, this short-coming was kind of hard to ignore. It was a major flaw for me - but if we take that away I would def say the film was great. Great casting, the excellent performances almost eclipsed the a-bomb scenes, which were fantastic. Starts out a little slow but pays off if you stick it out.",POSITIVE

"Aug 28, 2023","Where Tenet failed to rescue post-pandemic cinema, Oppenheimer (along with the very different, eye-wateringly successful, Barbie) may well have succeeded. Christopher Nolan has made a three-hour film, partly in black and white, historical biopic that is mostly men in rooms talking, that grapples with huge moral, ethical and historical issues and turned it into one of the megahits of blockbuster season. In the process, he's rebooted the biopic genre, one of cinema's most creatively moribund genres, an achievement it's hard to imagine any other film-makers taking on. 

Two often quoted issues with Nolan's work - a perceived emotional coldness, and poorly served female characters  - are worth touching on here. Emotionally this is devastating, daringly empathetic towards such a divisive and complex central character; the women are better written than in some Nolan films, the emotional cost to them of a driven, hero complex man spelled out in ways that may be questionable but certainly asks for thoughtfulness. 

Performances are remarkable; Downey Junior layered, Cillian Murphy magnetic and extraordinary. The whole cast is playing in the big leagues here. Technically it's a masterclass; editing, sound design, cinematography and much else working in concert. The almost omnipresent score is sensational; the pivotal test explosion scene is staged unforgettably. 

All in all a remarkable, extraordinary, propulsive and utterly gripping film that will demand reward repeated viewings. If it's my favourite Nolan, I'm not sure - but I suspect not; but it's more than likely that history will judge it his best and most important achievement.",POSITIVE

"Aug 28, 2023","Amazing film. I thought it was everything and more you could want from a Nolan directed biopic about the father of the atomic bomb. Oscar worthy acting throughout, great cast, great writing, great director. Glad to see Nolan still has it after the past few projects. I think people who had more knowledge of the Manhattan Project and the history of those involved probably got more from the initial viewing than those without. Although I feel as if the film did enough to explain to not frustrate or confuse the less knowledgeable viewer, such as myself. I did find myself googling all the names and reading for the next few days though! Which I hope translates(d) to others as well, because this is a history that must be remembered in order to avoid the same mistakes. I feel the film dragged a bit towards the end, but I also understand and agree the length was necessary to tell the full and complete story. Highly recommend and I will definitely watch again.",POSITIVE

"Aug 28, 2023","3 hour long biopic that surprisingly maintains it's pacing well throughout the entire run. Complimented with an incredible soundtrack, this movie gives the haunting perspective of the most important man who ever lived. Be aware that this movie is dialogue heavy, and is recommended to try your best to listen and understand what is being said. Some theaters have their audio fine tuned more than others. So before choosing an IMAX 70mm showing of the film (which you must see the movie in if you can), make sure it's a theater that people say is finely tuned. Good experiences I've had in terms of audio were at both Regal Irvine Spectrum (best), and the Regal Edwards Ontario Palace (second best). I personally did not have a good experience understanding the audio at Citywalk, but maybe the audio there got tuned better later. Regardless, go out and watch the movie.",POSITIVE

"Aug 28, 2023",Movie was good but I felt it was over stretched (could have been shortened by 30 minutes). This is definitely not the best from Christopher Nolan's filmography. I liked the visuals on IMAX screen and everyone in the movie have done a commendable job.,NEUTRAL

"Aug 28, 2023","This is a brilliant epic thriller written and directed by Christopher Nolan, the same master creator who gave us ""Inception"", ""Dunkirk"", ""Batman Begins"" (trilogy), and ""Memento"" to name a few. This film boasts of an all-star cast headed by the brilliant Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, and Robert Downey Jr.  The supporting cast (Josh Hartnett, Casey Affleck, Rami Malek, Kenneth Branagh, and Florence Pugh) is as formidable as the lead. Both Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey, Jr. should get an Oscar best actor and best supporting actor nominations respectively for their superb performance.

A friend says that he can't write women, but personally I think he cant write relationships of any type (friendships/love/etc).

"Aug 28, 2023",I thought it was a very in-depth look at the man who started it all.  Very interesting.,POSITIVE
"Aug 28, 2023",The story line building up to the atomic bomb was extremely well done. The build up to the trial and everything after felt like it was thrown up onto the screen. If you continued to watch the movie you would find things that you easily would have missed,POSITIVE

"Aug 28, 2023","What a mess. The story was hard to follow and to know who was who, what they did and why. The sound track was unbearable, overbearing and frankly insulting to the audience who should be able to tell what's going on without music to manipulate feelings. The use of color and black and white was also inexplicable and distracting. Agreed it's an important story but what a sloppy telling.",NEGATIVE

"Aug 28, 2023",So pleased to learn the truth regarding Oppenheimer.,POSITIVE
"Aug 28, 2023","Cillian Murphy was outstanding as was Robert Downey Jr. and the rest of the cast. Seriously, a story everyone should know about. You have to play close attention to the beginning but then it all makes sense. I think this movie will definitely win some awards.",POSITIVE

"Aug 27, 2023",The movie was excellent. Very in-depth of what happened. I thought the acting was excellent.,POSITIVE
"Aug 27, 2023",A historically accurate yet emotional retelling of the genesis of the Manhattan project.  Brings the full history of the Oppenheimer story to life without seeming like a documentary.  Too many great performances from an ensemble cast to mention them all.,POSITIVE
"Aug 27, 2023","Incredible movie that did well in exploring the complexity of Dr. J Robert Oppenheimer's scientific discovery of the atomic bomb intertwined with the political interests, nuances of war, tragedy of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, McCarthyism, and Oppenheimer's humanity; definitely worth the watch in theaters

Great performances by all the actors; Florence Pugh is a talented actress, but her character was so poorly written.

Some subpar directing choices (poor character development for secondary characters, should have showed Hiroshima & Nagasaki to drive home visually the loss of life and the cost of war, one dimensional female characters far removed from their historical counterparts, jagged pacing)

1/2 a star removed for the incredibly disrespectful, historically inaccurate and gratuitous scene with the sacred Indian text the Bhagavad-Gita that in reality inspired J Robert Oppenheimer in a philosophical setting; a foolish decision that one would think Christopher Nolan would be above
1/2 a star removed for objectifying scenes that contribute nothing to the movie's plot, have no grounding in history and are more of the same vulgarity that Hollywood normalizes",POSITIVE
"Aug 27, 2023","excellent movie, quite fascinating in the making of the bomb, the intensity of the brilliant minds involved, the dirty behind the scenes political intrigue.",POSITIVE

Cillian Murphy and Emily Blunt give excellent performances. The screenplay is well written. Christopher Nolan did a great job directing this movie. I enjoyed watching this motion picture because of the drama and history. Oppenheimer is a must see.",POSITIVE

"Aug 27, 2023","I'm not sorry to have seen the film, ""Oppenheimer"", but I found it too long, much too noisy, and the tightly edited conversations were somewhat hard to understand or follow. At some point, I want to read ""American Prometheus"", the book on which the film is based, in order to discover what was left out of or written into the biography to turn it  into an on-screen thriller.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 27, 2023","The spundtrack was bloody awful. Music overpowering dialog is an idiotic move. The story line was disjointed. I understand the use of flashbacks,  but this was merely confusing. Sorting out which characters were actually important was difficult. 

On the plus side, the facts presented seemed reasonably consistent with what I know tobe real.",NEGATIVE

"Aug 27, 2023","Epic storytelling about the life of one of the most important men of the 20th century. It compares with Lawrence of Arabia & Schindler's List. Nolan is a master of cinematic techinique to tell his story his use of sound and subjective point of view is dazzling. During the Trinity test sequence, you get caught in the suspence of whether the test will work that you forget your hisyory.  Every performance is a gem, especially Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. & Damon.  It is the best movie I've seen in years",POSITIVE

"Aug 27, 2023","C'mon. I went to the movies for literally the first time in years because I'm a history buff and was excited by what sounded like an exciting original film, not a remake, sequel or super hero schlock. I'm a Christopher Nolan and it had a great cast. 
But‚Ä¶the movie was bad. Boring, too long, trying way to hard to build drama with a blaring sound track to a crescendo of a couple Washington hearings? 
Ok. He was a communist who maybe/probably didn't outright give secrets to the enemy, but that was ambiguous. 

Also, the tendentious BS about him not technically be a card carrying member of the Communist party and maybe it be better to give the USSR our nuclear secrets because their our ally (lol) not our Nazi enemy. The big bazinga (spoiler alert) that JFK voted against confirmation of the bad guy I guess was supposed to be the cherry on top but fell flat.
Sorry - not a good movie for real history buffs looking for a nuanced look at a true story or a riveting movie. BTW - a big group of young people walked out of the theater I saw it at.",NEGATIVE

"Aug 27, 2023","Plays like a chain reaction, bouncing between past and present, actions and consequences. This is a blistering piece of filmmaking that's only flaws are small shortcomings from its gargantuan ambition

Elevated by Cillian Murphy's exacting performance, Nolan's biopic on the father of the atomic bomb is majestic and morally complex.

The cinematography is magnificent no worries when you have Hoyte Van Hoytema, capturing the awesome power of a bomb while also showcasing the vulnerability and flaws of the humans that created it.

Ludwig G√∂ransson Soundtrack is surreal it will make you on your toes.

For me it will always be Robert Downey Jr. And Cillian Murphy Performances that carried this movie everybody else was just ok.

It's not Nolan's best movie it will always be Inception for me but it's up there with the top, A great cinematic experience that you don't want to miss especially in IMAX.",POSITIVE

"Aug 27, 2023","Thumbs up for the technical aspects (a very good soundtrack and good visuals) and for the actings.
Nevertheless for me there was many downsides in watching this movie:
 - the nolanesque use of flashback-flashfoward in this film is overused and adds nothing to the story. I found it rather confusing and messed up (and usually i enjoy convoluted stories);
 - i think many aspects are treated in a rather superficial way: you never really get insight on the motives of why the main character does what he do, the psychological consequences lies inexplorated, zero scientifical-technical explanation (was this a ""science movie""? I had to find a 10 min youtube video to have more insights on the functioning bomb and understand the importance of the ""implosion tests"");
 - characters that you see 30 secs or that do not appear for like 1 hour and returns out of nowhere with crucial story developement;
 - the entire third act was to me useless and not interesting, so much that i wanted to leave.

This may be all subjective, but i really expected a whole different movie. At the end of the movie i left the cinema bored and annoyed.",NEGATIVE

"Aug 27, 2023","A film with incredible visuals, bombastic sound, deeply interesting character moments by a star studded cast, a few phenomenal sequences all while accompanied by a powerful score.

However, its story beats are not as interesting as it could've been with dialogue that rushes and a lot of ""telling instead of showing"" in the third act. The movie shines in moments of introspection and trauma with the titular character but the plot's focus takes away from what could be a stellar and more interesting film.

There's a masterpiece movie in here somewhere but it did not hit the notes story wise to leave a more profound impact. That being said, it is a well crafted film that moves you in certain moments. Just wish we got more of that and a deeper look into the philosophical side of this haunting moment of history.",NEUTRAL

Having done physics for over half a century I cannot subscribe to the images artistically put in Oppy's head as a student, but the linkage of math and music rings true.

"Aug 26, 2023","I thought I had walked into the wrong theater and was watching a trailer for this movie at first, the editing and pacing on the first hour or so is inexplicable to me. Breakneck introduction of characters, rapid scenes (many of which simply unnecessary), it's just a mess. There are some truly standout visual scenes and some historical insights that make it worth watching, but I genuinely considered walking out within that first hour, it was exhausting and not enjoyable. Beyond the lead -- Cillian Murphy absolutely saves this movie, and costars Florence Pugh, Blunt and Downey Jr. deliver really solid performances that somehow leave a mark in this shattered film  -- barely any character is sufficiently developed to form any real attachment, no relationship is fleshed out enough to matter. The focus of the film on this specific bureaucratic event was, in my opinion, a mistake. Overall, it is absolutely not worthy of the ratings on this page, of that I have no doubt.",NEUTRAL

"Aug 26, 2023","A wonderful film with great direction to keep my interest for 3 hours. The cross-cutting from black-and-white to color, past to present was terrific. The actors could not have been better. The only problem was the music - it was atrocious loud, bombastic, sometimes obscuring the dialog, and mostly unnecessary. Even though I lived through much of the period depicted in the film, and been to Los Alamos, I learned a lot from the film.",POSITIVE
"Aug 26, 2023","Excellent portrayals and unsentimental probing look into the career of the ""father of the bomb""
 Murphy I'd brilliant as Oppenheimer; Robert Downey Jr. is amazing as Admiral Strauss, his nemesis; everyone is great, plus small triumphs like Tom Conti as Einstein; Matt Damon as Gen. Groves.

It's great in 70MM IMAX but the story is intimate enough to be equally compelling in 70 MM without IMAX. In fact, if you only see it once, you'll understand the dialogue better in the non IMAX format. (I've seen it twice in each format Metreon 70MM IMAX and Kabuki 70 MM sans IMAX).

That said, seeing a movie like this on a three story screen with rip roaring sound is immersive. This film is well written, acted and edited to be an A+ film no matter how you watch it.

Run, don't walk. See it on a screen with an audience!",POSITIVE

"Aug 26, 2023","üáÆüáπ Un film definitivo, colossale e inimmaginabile. Per me √® tranquillamente considerabile film dell'anno e forse anche degli ultimi anni. Christopher Nolan √® riuscito a trasformare una storia vera che coinvolge tutta l'umanit√† in un qualcosa di mai visto prima. Oppenheimer √® pi√π di un semplice colossal, come definito da molti, riesce a far capire che quello che viene mostrato nella pellicola va a coinvolgere tutta l'essenza del nostro pianeta. Poich√© non narra solamente la storia di J. Robert Oppenheimer ma va a ridefinire tutti i canoni dell'umanit√† facendoci aprire gli occhi su una tematica che spesso e volentieri consideriamo distante ma che √® in realt√† √® molto pi√π atroce e vicina di quanto pensiamo. Il film comunque parla di Oppenheimer, noto fisico, considerato il ""padre"" della bomba atomica e lo fa splendidamente. √à fuori da ogni logica il tocco di Nolan nel riuscire a trasformare una storia vera in un thriller epocale, letteralmente pura arte sullo schermo. √à quasi impossibile fare paragoni su altre pellicole dell'autore, in quanto Oppenheimer va ad affrontare tematiche diverse, ma senza dubbio √® l'opera pi√π completa che il famoso regista abbia mai prodotto e diretto. Gli attori sono fantastici e ovviamente non potava essere altrimenti quando vengono tirati in ballo nomi del calibro di Cillian Murphy, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek, Matt Damon e Robert Downey Jr. Ovvio il ruolo da protagonista di Murphy rende la sua performance veramente incredibile e credo debba essere considerata in vista dei prossimi Oscar. Questo ovviamente non va a sminuire le performance degli altri attori, poich√© siamo su livelli molto buoni. La colonna sonora √® perfetta, veramente coinvolgente e talvolta incredibile. Si sentono tantissimo delle melodie che trasudano maestosit√† da tutte le note. Ovviamente questo √® un film che va obbligatoriamente visto al cinema e sul miglior schermo possibile, personalmente l'ho visto in IMAX e senza ombra di dubbio √® stata la miglior esperienza cinematografica che abbia mai fatto, un qualcosa di indescrivibile che va provato. Il posto che inizia a tremare, lo schermo sfruttato alla massima qualit√† e un audio spaziale hanno reso l'esperienza indimenticabile. Avevo gi√† assistito a film in sala IMAX ma devo dire che qui siamo su livelli enormi di differenza e perfezione. Oppenheimer √® un film che punta alla perfezione e ci riesce perch√© effettivamente questo √® un film perfetto che azzecca tutti gli aspetti cinematografici con anche qualche tocco di Nolan che va ad arricchire la visione della pellicola. Veramente un film mostruoso che supera di gran lunga gli ultimi del regista e ci√≤ prima della visione per me era veramente impensabile. Creare un qualcosa di cos√¨ bello e contemporaneamente affine alla realt√† sembrava un'impresa ma √® stato veramente un gran viaggio. Le tre ore non si sono fatte sentire e ci sono delle trovate verso il finale veramente iconiche che resteranno stampate nella mente delle persone. Veramente ed enormemente consigliato! Un qualcosa di mai visto prima. Grazie Nolan. Cinema allo stato puro.‚Ä®‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî---------------------------------------------------------------------------------üá¨üáß A definitive, colossal and unimaginable film. For me it is quietly considered film of the year and perhaps even of recent years. Christopher Nolan has managed to turn a true story that involves all of humanity into something never seen before. Oppenheimer is more than just a colossal, as defined by many, he manages to make it clear that what is shown in the film involves the whole essence of our planet. As it does not only tell the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer but goes to redefine all the canons of humanity by making us open our eyes to a theme that we often and willingly consider distant but which is in reality much more atrocious and closer than we think. The film, however, is about Oppenheimer, a well-known physicist, considered the 'father' of the atomic bomb and does so beautifully. It's out of all logic Nolan's touch in being able to turn a true story into an epochal thriller, literally pure art on screen. It is almost impossible to make comparisons on other films by the author, as Oppenheimer goes to deal with different themes, but without a doubt it is the most complete work that the famous director has ever produced and directed. The actors are great and of course it couldn't be otherwise when the likes of Cillian Murphy, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek, Matt Damon and Robert Downey Jr. are brought up. Obviously Murphy's starring role makes his performance really incredible and I think it should be considered in view of the upcoming Oscars. This obviously does not detract from the performances of the other actors, as we are on very good levels. The soundtrack is perfect, truly engaging and sometimes incredible. You can hear a lot of melodies that exude majesty from all the notes. Obviously this is a film that must be seen at the cinema and on the best possible screen, I personally saw it in IMAX and without a shadow of a doubt it was the best cinematic experience I have ever had, something indescribable that must be tried. The place that starts to shake, the screen tapped to the highest quality and a spatial audio made the experience unforgettable. I had already seen movies in the IMAX room but I must say that here we are on huge levels of difference and perfection. Oppenheimer is a film that aims for perfection and succeeds because actually this is a perfect film that gets all cinematic aspects right with even a few touches of Nolan that enriches the vision of the film. Truly a monstrous film that far surpasses the last of the director and this before viewing was really unthinkable for me. Creating something so beautiful and at the same time akin to reality seemed like a feat but it was really a great journey. The three hours were not heard and there are some truly iconic ending finds that will remain imprinted in people's minds. Really and enormously recommended! Something never seen before. Thank you Nolan. Pure cinema.",POSITIVE
"Aug 26, 2023",I would give this movie one hundred stars. Brilliant and human.  The script is tight and the acting is superb.  This is an old style classic.,POSITIVE
"Aug 25, 2023",There are some good scenes and dialogues but Nolan is always so pedantic that the movie lose his strenght. It doesn't  help that the music is omnipresent. It's exhausting and it turns into noise... This film would be much better if it was 2 hours long.,NEGATIVE
"Aug 25, 2023","I think the acting was terrific and it was an important story.  However, three hours was a bit too much.  Also, although the first half was supplying background to the actual dropping of the bomb, I believe the second half (Oppenheimer's fall from grace) was more interesting and engaging.",POSITIVE

"Aug 25, 2023","While Oppenheimer wasn't necessarily a BAD movie, I did find that it's editing made it incredibly difficult to follow. For the first 2-2.25 hours of the movie almost every scene was almost completely disconnected from the previous scene, it felt more like a 2 hour trailer than a coherent movie. 

Oppenheimer would have been AMAZING as a 2 part movie where each part could have been given the time needed to go into the details necessary to not only appreciate the man, but also tell a coherent story.

Overall, if you WANT to go to the movies to escape and don't feel like watching Barbie, Oppenheimer is a good choice; however, I don't think it's worth going out of your way just to watch it in theaters.",NEUTRAL

"Aug 25, 2023","Solid and dense historical-political film, rigorous and introspective biopic, based on the paradoxical story of the ""father of the atomic bomb"" who, in an attempt to save the future of mankind, collaborates in the invention of an instrument capable of destroying it forever; realizing that she had failed just as he had completed the greatest project. 
Based on the detailed biography of Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin (""American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy"" - Pulitzer Prize in 2006), Nolan breaks all linearity of action and weaves together three horizontal timelines (Science, Power, redemption) and two vertical blocks (divided by the bomb as the revelation of a new world order), and focuses on the complex, elusive and ambiguous figure of the protagonist; brilliant scholar willing to do anything for science but also a soul torn by moral dilemmas, ambitious but also vain and selfish, who never denied what he did and the reasons why he did it but also a torn and restless man faced with his responsibility and left alone in the face of the (chaos of) history and the conflict of men. 
Fascinating and refined on a formal and narrative level, the film reflects clearly, precisely and lucidly on the ambiguous relationship between Science, Ethics and Power and the manipulation of information. The elegant and well-finished style, as usual, goes well here (even more than previously) with the complexity and humanist scope of the subject matter. 
The detailed and layered density of the matter narrated by the film guarantees the viewer's emotional adherence; he is magnetically overwhelmed by immersive images and dialogues (many), by suspended and at times lyrical or dreamlike atmospheres, tense music and rhythm (in addition to the direction and the actors, scenography, photography, editing and soundtrack are also of excellent quality). 
Not everything is perfect (see some imbalances), but it is an effective and very successful film in Nolan's career. Robert Oppenheimer, played by a convincing Cillian Murphy (but also the rest of the cast ‚Äì including Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr., Matt Damon, Kenneth Branagh ‚Äì is very functional), becomes increasingly black and white, consumed by remorse and in search of redemption (""now I have become death, the destroyer of worlds""), and, closing my eyes yes and urgently questions us about our present (""physicists have known sin and from this awareness they will never be able to free themselves"") . 
The screenplay, very interested in the intimate analysis of the characters, emphasizes the inevitability of the historical fact (the invention of the first atomic bomb as part of the ""Manhattan Project"" in order to end the Second World War), without however deny that it has forever changed the balance of the world and even the moral reputation of the United States (after the success of the Trinity test, President Harry S. Truman orders the use of the atomic bomb forcing Japan to surrender). 
In the first part, the film looks like a visual symphony (decisive in this sense the use of special effects especially analogue and the use of 70mm IMAX film, especially in the image of the process of disarticulation of matter into pure electromagnetic radiation and particles of light ). 
In the second one instead it becomes more gloomy and tormented just like the soul and conscience of the protagonist when he pronounces himself against further nuclear research, in particular on the hydrogen bomb proposed by Teller, and is accused of acquaintances with the American Communist Party (and it is where Lewis Strauss played by Robert Downey Jr., President of the Atomic Energy Commission of the United States, involved in the investigation into his relations with Oppenheimer and alleged manipulation of information for mere personal ends also appears). 
Oppenheimer, long celebrated as the ""inventor of the atomic bomb"", passes to being crushed and marginalized/abandoned by Power, by the family, by relationships with the rest of the scientific community. The period before and after the explosion of the two atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki thus converge in a single moment, that of awareness of the weight of one's responsibilities. The circle closes (or remains open), the initial gaze that went beyond matter now goes beyond Time and still seems to observe the unimaginable, still presenting us in a disturbing way (especially today...) the invitation to perennial reflection about what happened and the nuclear deterrent you have, potentially and dangerously synonymous with mere destruction and general death. 
As also stated by Paul Schrader, Nolan's latest rich and powerful work is the most interesting, important and urgent film for the 21st Century, absolutely not to be missed and especially to be seen at the cinema. 
A curiosity: ""Oppenheimer"", as a film set during the Second World War, is the one to have grossed the most in the history of cinema.

"Aug 25, 2023","'' What do you want from theory alone?.....Zero would be nice""

""Oppenheimer"" is a cinematic experience woven by the skilled hands of Christopher Nolan. Rooted in profound theoretical explorations, it delivers a narrative that's simultaneously surreal and thought-provoking. The performances of Cillian Murphy and Jack Lowden are nothing short of Oscar-worthy, injecting life and depth into their characters that lingers long after the credits roll.

Ludwig Goransson's score is more than just music; it's an immersive experience that seeps into your bones, sending shivers down your spine. The sound design, equally robust, adds an almost tactile layer to the viewing experience, enhancing the film's emotional resonance.

Despite its substantial three-hour runtime, ""Oppenheimer"" never drags. Nolan's expert pacing, combined with the movie's spacious visual layout, ensures that every minute feels purposeful, making the journey through this cinematic voyage a smooth and engaging one.

The script carries shades of JFK's intrigue and The Social Network's sharpness, resulting in a unique blend that propels the story forward with a magnetic force. The fusion of historical backdrop and fictional narrative creates a spellbinding tapestry that captivates and challenges in equal measure.

In sum, ""Oppenheimer"" stands as not only one of the best films of the year but a defining work of the 21st century. Nolan's directorial finesse, Murphy and Downing's performances, Goransson's auditory magic, and the engaging script all contribute to a cinematic experience that resonates deeply. This film isn't just about theory; it's about the convergence of art, storytelling, and human understanding.

The early part of the movie was weak and confusing, but the narrative gained strength as it continued.  The R rating is deserved, but unfortunate.  Literally a couple minutes of nudity and simulated sex that were not needed to tell the story makes the movie unaccessible in theater to mature teenagers, who should have the opportunity to see it.  Does a good job of making clear how many people (at least academics) supported leftist/communist party views in the 1930s, yet some of them were essential to the Manhattan Project.  Also does a good job of showing how views on nuclear weapons were never simple for the people giving it serious thought.",POSITIVE

The only problems are that it's a bit too long not like an hour longer but more like it could have been 10 minutes shorter.
And some actors are wasted like David Dastmalchian or Rami Malek.",POSITIVE
"Aug 24, 2023","Just left the Greek premiere of ""Oppenheimer"" here in Chania, Crete, Greece. A long film ‚Äî that drags at times ‚Äî but definitely a film worth seeing for anyone who cares about the future of world civilization. The Ellinis theatre was packed ‚Äî and 90% of the audience were teens and twenty-somethings. The crowd burst into applause at the conclusion. I would love to hear if those who saw the film in American theatres saw so many young people in attendance. At any rate, I would say that it bodes well for the future of Greece that its young people take such an intense interest in a serious and significant film like this. A must-see.",POSITIVE
"Aug 24, 2023","Absolute masterpiece and a must watch. It tells the incredible but horrible life of Oppenheimer. The visuals are stunning, just what you expect from Nolan. The audio is impeccable to pair with it. The tension the music creates is thrilling and the explosions are so grand that you can almost feel them when you are in a theatre.

Amazing storytelling and one of the best movies in the recent years by far!",POSITIVE
"Aug 24, 2023",Overall I liked the movie !  I think it could have been trimmed by about a half hour.,POSITIVE

"Aug 24, 2023","A long movie about a conflicted man.  Good acting and special effects.  However, the story line was weak.  A lotta talking drama with no action, no humor to break it.  Should have just been a 1 hour documentary.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 24, 2023","Out of this world. I was so anticipating this movie and bought my tickets over a month early in order to get good seats at AMC Lincoln Square in 70mm IMAX to get the full experience. An IMAX setting really allows the film to just engulf you entirely.  I found the time hopping a bit confusing at first, but like any Nolan film the larger picture became more clear every moment.  I was blown away by the cast and everyone was fantastic. Cillian Murphy was on the screen for 90% of the film and was just outstanding.  The length didn't bother me and when the credits rolled at the end I found myself letting out a gasp of air because the movie did not skip a beat in my opinion.  Absolutely incredible and a movie that was made for the big screen.",POSITIVE

"Aug 24, 2023",I had difficulty hearing the dialogue.  It makes it very difficult to follow the storyline and keep up with who's who with a large cast of characters.  I will most definitely use the closed caption feature when I watch it from home in the future.,NEUTRAL

"Aug 24, 2023","Came in expecting to like this movie given the subject matter.  Instead, half the movies content was superficial to the storys significance and there were plenty of questionable directing choices from a well know director.  The actors did their best, but the first 90 minutes of the movie was largely unnecessary.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 24, 2023","L‚Äãemme tell ya whats good G,
‚ÄãNolan and his team put together an ingenious invention themselves when they managed to encapsulate the worldly Oppenheimer the man and his story in a 3-hour casing. Honest to the book, the story is represented as triumphant and tragic. This conflict is brilliantly shown through Cillian Murphy's performance as he endures Nolan's depiction of this already complicated psyche. We see the psychological shockwaves take their toll on the bomb's creator when the news of success comes in from Hiroshima. We are shown how a communist past was able to overshadow this monumental service he did for his country. The story revolves mostly around the hearing on Oppenheimer's security clearance, it is intense and gives us insight into how politics from within and outside media shaped his interrogation in suit and ties. If you are interested in how power politics can wield greater strength than an intellectual who has arguably ended all wars, you will enjoy learning from this kind of ingenuity also. This is for people thrilled about character and political chess moves and who see the fireworks as a plus!",POSITIVE

"Aug 23, 2023","I'm impressed by other one-star reviewers that say they fell asleep. How could you achieve such a feat? I knew after the first 45 minutes that this movie was a waste of time but my daughter seemed to be enjoying it so walking out was out of the question. I tried to go to sleep but alas, the sound was ear piercingly loud for 90% of the time.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 23, 2023",Very powerful and telling of the struggles to justify the Manhattan Project,POSITIVE
"Aug 23, 2023","Oppenheimer is an amazing movie. It isn't a movie about the atomic bomb, it isn't a movie about the war, it's a movie about the life of Oppenheimer. How he saw the world, and it doesn't have a right or wrong side. That's why you need to watch it multiple times. To see every single point of view. Oppenheimer has his flaws when he tries to interfere too much with politics by using his fame and how he is so self centered, how the government tries to take Oppenheimer down to stop him from having his opinion Nuclear weapons, etc. How scientists see that they have to be careful when they openly say something that the government doesn't agree with. It has these little details that just makes the movie complete. Truly a masterpiece... I have already watched it twice, once in IMAX and once in normal cinema and I will definitely be going a third time.",POSITIVE
"Aug 23, 2023","Also, as someone else stated here with regards to the film itself.... WHY the nude scenes? Not needed. They added nothing essential to the plot, and especially the drawn out conversations when they were both nude... WHY?
There were an awful lot of buzzed shots (where focus is not not sharp). I'm surprised they kept the AC on the shoot.
And the music.....a friend who's a film composer described it as ""sonic wallpaper"", and I have to agree. Should have let John Williams, or almost anybody else score it.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 23, 2023","The movie, tells us such a moving and explosive story.  It is sad to see him pilloried by the anti-communism Senator from Wisconsin  after all the sacrifices and achievements that Oppenheimer  gave to the US and the world.  He and the atomic bomb gave us the freedom and great country we are today.  
His sacrifice and public humiliation that was put upon him remind me of Plato and the Prophet Jesus.",POSITIVE

Not to mention the very odd multiple nude scenes that left me baffled as to why Im seeing breasts again? I really was contemplating leaving the last 30 minutes or.

"Aug 23, 2023","I saw Oppenheimer last night, and at 3 hours it was 2 hours too long. Boring, self indulgent, absurdly drawn out with little or no dramatic tension. All about boys, women's only roles to show their tits or get the washing in. The two female characters were actually scientistsin their own right, plus many women worked on the project but you'd be forgiven for thinking women only existed to support or pine over men. 20, 000 close-ups of Cillian Murphy's cheekbones to ensure the Oscar committee noted he starved for the role. Overacting left, right and centre. Kenneth Branagh's absurd 'somewhere in Europe' accent and Tom Conti as a hilarious ( unintentionally) Albert Einstein. Honestly it was terrible and I think all the rave reviews are a case of Emperor's New Clothes not wanting to criticise such an  'important film'. It'll win all the Oscars.",NEGATIVE

"Aug 23, 2023","Oppenheimer is a great movie about the development of the first atom bomb, a very important part of history that was fantastically explored in this movie. Cillian Murphy was amazing as Oppenheimer and Robert Downey Jr was incredible at playing the complex, controversial Lewis Strauss with a fantastic performance.
Oppenheimer is not just about the bomb. It is also about one man's lifelong journey as he struggles with his marital instability, his communism, his overwhelming thoughts of danger that could arise from the bomb, and his rivalry with Lewis Strauss.
Even though the movie is 3 hours long, it does not feel that way. Each scene has impact to the plot and character arcs of the story.
The ending is perfect, encapsulating every thought that Oppenheimer had and bringing it into a powerful and conclusive scene.
The cinematography was great. The choices that the filmmakers made really impacted the experience of the movie, such as the scene where Oppenheimer and his team do the final bomb test which is completely silent and perfectly dramatized.",POSITIVE

Happily I had watched the documentary ""The Bomb"" previous to going to the movie.

Furthermore the indecent sex scenes are completely useless and just proving once more the recipe ""Sex sells"". Why on earth??

I was astounded at how little politicians have changed, they were just as slimy back then as they are today!  Downey's performance was really an eye-opener and proof that he could ""act"" outside of IRON MAN - MARVEL.

Some of the main characters appeared like a comedy sketch imitation (Einstein) and the endless men in suits entering stage left to argue with other men in suits in a room before storming off stage right were just dull. The score was frankly bizarre too, appearing random and almost comical in its pacing and at times completely out of sync with what was happening on screen.

There is a bit of a slow start in the beginning but don't go into this expecting a ""Fast and Furious"", this is art in motion.

"Aug 22, 2023","The acting was excellent.  I didn't even recognize RDJ at first, and he's one of my favorite actors.  But the movie as a whole just seemed like it was more of Christopher Nolan's homage to himself than a thought-provoking piece on Oppenheimer or the morality of the development of nuclear weapons.  The film is sort of complicated jumping around on two different timelines (Oppenheimer's and the Commerce nominee played by RDJ).  But in the end, the story Nolan tells doesn't support the giant infrastructure of this movie.  It certainly doesn't support the 3+ hour length!  And why would anyone need to see it in IMAX?  For one explosion?  I also thought the character development seemed weak for such a long movie.  I still don't feel like I know the main characters much less the supporting ones.  Bottom line: Oppenheimer failed to hold my attention, i.e., I was BORED.",NEGATIVE

A absolute masterclass in film making from the adaption of one of the most if not most significant and important events in human history and translating it seamlessly and in a engaging way to the viewers.

Christopher Nolans masterpiece.",POSITIVE
"Aug 22, 2023","If there could be a director in Hollywood today capable of creating an epic as great as what Oppenheimer means, that is without a doubt Christopher Nolan. A director as extraordinary as he is determined in what he does, it is not surprising that he has achieved such greatness with one of the best films of 2023 and surely the best film of his filmography.

A biopic that is intelligently built by a sharp, thoughtful, captivating and highly tense script as we enter the heart of a film that is rightly considered the best political game written in recent times. Nolan hides behind a forceful thriller a film that plays deceit as a virtuoso politician who tries to position his name above all around him. Behind the creation of the atomic bomb is a bold story that knows how to set the pace and the times before two great characters who play to position his name as the great hero of the show.

For this, the director has the best Cillian Murphy of his career, who delivers what for me is the demonstration of an actor who has touched the Olympus and who is definitively established as the extraordinary actor that he is. Julius Robert Oppenheimer's performance is forceful, sincere, authentic and indelible, positioning the actor as the great candidate to receive all possible recognition in awards season. Not only does he deserve it, Robert Downey Jr. leaves as a precedent that he is a tremendous actor and that he can do everything in the cinema and you will not be able to question it; as well as a cast that no matter how small his presence is, no one is out of place like a Florence Pugh who, frankly, is amazing and that we only enjoyed a small part of this epic.

Ludwig G√∂ransson has simply created the perfect chords to accompany Nolan's mind with a soundtrack that does not disappoint at all and in which you allow yourself to feel the emotions with which he bathes each possible scene. The same can be said of Hoyte van Hoytema with his dreamlike photography and the size of the challenge he must deal with from color to black and white.

What Nolan has achieved is to recall the ancient epics of yesteryear that can be summed up in a film made by adults for adults, but made with all the breadth and majesty of those films made for children and adolescents. A film so thought out and dedicated with which the director demonstrates all his experience to what he is really passionate about, which is cinema.

Oppenheimer is an imperfect film that has its moments where you might like it less and some decisions that don't finish completely. That alone means that we are in the presence of an extraordinary film that is positioned to date as that auteur film supposed to be a great blockbuster, but that never releases the personal blood of its own author.",POSITIVE

"Aug 22, 2023","I didn't understand Oppenheimer the man or the scientist at all at the end of this 3 hour marathon.  It developed his human flaws, but gave me no sense of whether he was the scientific driving force of the Manhattan Project or a uniquely qualified administrator-leader of the project, or both.  Many historical inaccuracies and 50 stars on the flags when there were only 48 states underscores that this Brit can't tell an American story accurately. Way overrated, I'm going to read the book.",NEGATIVE

"Aug 21, 2023",Watched in London on the film's second weekend of release.  Wholly immersive experience.  Probably my favourite film of Christopher Nolan's - a deeply intelligent and complex work.  Cillian Murphy is outstanding.,POSITIVE
"Aug 21, 2023","First, this movie was way too long.  There were a number of scenes that didn't do much to advance the plot or increase my understanding of Oppenheimer, other than showing me he could be an arrogant, narcissistic person or a timid mouse.  For example, the whole scene with him giving his child away to be raised and then later regaining them without so much as an explanation.  Needed for the film?  I saw too many contradictions in Emily Blount's character and, to be frank, with Cillian Murphy's portrayal.  So, Oppenheimer is condescending to mousy depending on the day and the group? Didn't bond with either.  Robert Downey, Jr., whether you like his character or not, was absolutely awesome and the lesser characters (Josh Hartnett) do an incredible job.  Except for Florence Pugh, who seemingly was cast with just one goal in mind.  I got suckered into IMAX because the effects were supposed to be fantastic. They are overhyped--cool, but not to the point where IMAX was necessary.  My family who are Christopher Nolan fans loved this film because he cast his normal group of actors, but for me, the film took on a tough task and fell short.",NEGATIVE

"Aug 21, 2023","Oppenheimer is a very powerful story with great writing, acting, great production design, great editing/pacing, and great sound design. The scene showing the first bomb going off will blow you away! Get it? :-)
Go see it!",POSITIVE
"Aug 21, 2023","Amazing storyline and scripts, visual effects and sounds are a new experience on the history of cinema. Deeply disturbing and unsettling making the magnitude of the historic event palpable. Nolan truly showed an unappreciated potential for horror transmission. Will buy professional headphones and watch again and again and again.",POSITIVE
"Aug 21, 2023",Worth 3 hours. Complex story told well and completely. Acting was excellent. Robert Downey JR in particular deserves many awards.,POSITIVE
"Aug 21, 2023",It was so cool! Honestly didnt expect it to be that juicy at the end. I was SO mad for Oppi but it was so amazing to take a step back in time like that.,POSITIVE
"Aug 21, 2023","What we thought was going to be a film about experimentation, science and innovation leading up to one of the most historic events in world history sadly digressed into a witch hunt focused more on communism in America than anything else.

"Aug 21, 2023","""A CINEMATIC FINESSE IGNITES AN OUTSTANDING BIOPIC""
Nolan's nonlinear oscillation of Oppenheimer's story soaks one's mind and soul in itself. It fuses and motions through multiple faucets of oppenheimer's life whilst ensuring our wisdom of science and politics on point. Along with one's capable cerebral ability is required to enhance it deeply. His compelling written story traverses into several themes and is ushered by Nolan's direction to a three-hour long work of mastery. The moment you begin to assimilate this master work, you anticipate a flamed-steamy atomic explosion performed practically will blow your nerves off. The repercussions of this mass destruction are perceived with the dazed mind that one hurdles in the echoes of cries and pain. The breathtaking cinematography & a reverberating background score is an achievement closest to the molecules and sightseeing to world of oppenheimer's biopic, it gushes on the screen like a realization of magnificence of cinema and science. The monochrome segment dilutes with conviction of a great craft and revolves to set an intriguing conclusion. The Impeccable Cillian Murphy brings the character to life and so does every other cast suits up to fit considerably well. The trinity test is a place to set up Oppenheimer's regretful invention. The aftermath of success of triumph puts Oppenheimer on a trail that tries to subdue him and here's comes a time when one must stand firm for oneself. Oppenheimer has been left to live in remorse and guilt of his own creation that horrifies him like a death, and so does he says, ""Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds.""",POSITIVE

"Aug 21, 2023","The erratic jumping back and forth from the security meeting was a missed opportunity to simply follow the timeline and the introduction of people and events. Oppenheimer's visions where distracting and annoying. Physics and technology was dumbed down too much, especially Teller's proposal of a H bomb. Introducing some original footage of the test in Los Alamos and bombs on Japan would have added more gravity to the movie. Topic is great, actors are great .. clear miss by Christopher Nolan.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 21, 2023",Typical Christopher Nolan film... Music gets loud at points. Kind of long. Entertaining though.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 21, 2023","This movie was interesting, but doesn't deserve all the hype.  DEFINITELY not worth seeing in IMAX.  Christopher Nolan bragged about not using any VFX in the film... that was a mistake.  The atomic bomb explosion looked like a tiny gas fire.  It wasn't impressive at all and took away from the feeling of extreme danger that you were supposed to feel at that moment.  You see it and instead of thinking ""wow they are going to regret creating such a huge weapon"" you're left thinking that it doesn't look that bad and wont cause that much damage.  Some times directors need to get out of their own way ... this was one of those times.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 21, 2023",Great blend of science and morality.,POSITIVE
"Aug 21, 2023",Oppenheimer was WAY too long!  They could have cut the movie in half and it would have been excellent.  The story is interesting without Hollywood messing it up.  Too many distracting Hollywood stars too.  Matt Damon was distracting (they could have cast any actor in that role).  Freddy Mercury (Rami Malek)  made an appearance and was completely ineffective and distracting.  3 hours was painful to sit through.,NEGATIVE
"Aug 21, 2023",Definitely one of the best movies I had seen in my hole life. Great insight on the whole life of Robert. The hole cast is unbelievable but surely cilian and Robert Downey jr stands out. With no doubt a movie I'll recommend and I'll watch it several times more,POSITIVE

"Aug 21, 2023",Nolan has missed the mark heavily with his last 2 efforts (Dunkirk & Tenet) but OH MY DAYS has he come back with a bang.

"Aug 21, 2023","Part political drama. Part biopic. Part sci-fi extravaganza in the classic Nolan style.

"Aug 21, 2023","There were many things that made the movie not as good as I expected: poor writing, non-immersive acting from most characters & non-stop ear-deafening sounds among others.
However, what made this the worst movie I've ever seen in cinema is the editing which made the entire film feel like a three hour social media summary.

It was as if they refused to leave out a single scene, a singe line that was shot and just threw it all together with zero room to breathe. One fast-paced dialogue with loud dramatic sounds after another, non-stop, all the time for at least the first hour.

It made it impossible for me to care about a single character. 
Linear, non-linear, doesn't matter. I loved Memento, Citizen Kane etc. 
Oppenheimer was just poor storytelling, speedy cuts and loud sounds.

I'm convinced the only reason it gained the extraordinarily high ratings it currently holds is due to hype and Nolan idolization and in a short while people will look back at this movie and not understand how in the world it could have been so well-recieved.

I genuinely wanted to like this movie, but it was appaling.",NEGATIVE

"Aug 21, 2023","It was a bit long, but it was so great that long duration does not make it less beautiful.  Sound editing is amazing as always. It should be noted that though Nolan changed some parts of the story and kind of glorified Oppenheimer. This is not a concern though because Oppenheimer was a historical figure worth the attention but forgotten (or maybe forced to be forgotten), and Nolan brought him his fame again. We are lucky that directors like Nolan still try to give the audience the best cinematic experiences they could.",POSITIVE
"Aug 21, 2023","Normally, I find movies with morally grey characters to be a miss for me. However, with the case of Oppenheimer from ""Oppenheimer,"" I'd say that he worked out very well because let's be honest, if any of us were in his shoes, then yeah, at that point, we would all be saying that life is complicated. 

Granted, Oppenheimer was to blame for some of his more personal problems, but otherwise, he was just simply him. 

As for the rest of the film, I like that it included bits and pieces of humor to make up for the more dark, serious moments. I especially love seeing Albert Einstein get his time to shine. I usually only see him in cartoons. 

Do I highly recommend this biopic? Absolutely! Mainly because it features a morally grey character from history. So yeah, please give it a watch when you get the chance.",POSITIVE

I felt the weight the entire time I watched it and that affected me when bomb went off‚Ä¶ Cillian's eyes are something else.  LOVE historical period pieces and this one maybe the most important thing that's ever happened in history of the world so they drew me in.  LOVED LOVED the soundtrack.

"Aug 20, 2023",Allow three hours for an important film dealing with how in our lifetime man has managed to devise the ultimate weapon.  The dialogue which on the whole is excellent is however constantly being intruded upon by loud irrelevant music.  Films that do this are often a sign of profound insecurity on the part of the executive producers who must have felt it needed more punch.  It didn't.  Sometimes it intruded in vital areas of detail in the dialogue but despite this major flaw this film is very worthwhile.  Those who find the sex scenes also intrusive should bone up on their Hindu mythology especially Shiva.  That might help you understand.,POSITIVE

"Aug 20, 2023","I had low expectations coming off Tenet and thinking back to his last historical story, Dunkirk. Sadly, it didn't meet them. I thought this would at least be a good telling of historical drama but as in Tenet, Nolan seems to have lost the ability to actually tell a meaningful story and cares more about his latest ideas for cinematic tricks. The movie does conclude powerfully, in literally the last 10 seconds, but I can't forgive it for wasting 30 minutes of my life before that. I thought the movie was 3 star entertainment, an IMDB 6.7 until somewhere around that 2 hour 30 mark when I actually checked my watch -- something I haven't done in any movie whatsoever -- in who knows how long. Why was this 3 hours long? Why was this offered in IMAX? Not only wasting 30-45 minutes more than necessary but more of my money as well. And why does one of the most powerful directors of my time need to rely on inserting 10 seconds of doom to create an impression at the end of his movie instead of actually building a story with a meaningful plot (to the movie, not to history).",NEGATIVE

Three hours flew by, I never checked my watch once and I swear my eyes never left the screen. At the risk of sounding cliche, you really should see and hear this in a theater it is truly epic movie making at its finest.",POSITIVE
"Aug 20, 2023","I was never a fan of biopic mostly because, from their purpose, they have an inconsistent pace between main events of the person and some short scenes or characters that are mostly like a wink to the audience but doesn't do much in terms of developing the story. This movie succeeds mainly because of the pitch perfect direction of Nolan. By playing with the timeline, reorganizing the main events in a non-chronological way and giving us some amazing visuals, Nolan created a masterpiece.

Oppenheimer gives some complex question surrounding one of the deadliest attack in History, especially about the guilt behind this. A lot of characters shine here, which it's not surprising since the movie is stuffed with big actors.

It's still a 3-hours movie, and sometimes you do feel the weight of the runtime. There is also a shift of focus in the middle that make the movie looks like two different ones stick together (in a coherent way but as a viewer you need to re-adapt yourself to the second part)",POSITIVE

"Aug 20, 2023","A very uneven film. Absolutely great in parts, subtle, complex, though-provoking. But very long-winded and disjointed in others. Easily the first half of this overly long movie was not engaging.
The latter half of the movie came together beautifully. All the many issues, the war, the manipulations and machinations of the Strauss character, the moral conflict within the protagonist, Oppenheimer, his relationships with women, with himself, the anti-Communist era, all aligned to make a compelling drama in the end.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 20, 2023","My brain is on üî•
So much truth in such little space. 
Like a fission reaction. ü§Ø
Gentleness and Fear are not the same.
Yet they exist as two poles. 
One north, the other south.
In the middle.....
Is Truth.
Those who are gentle see the most truth.
They don't discover.
They don't create.
They don't formulate.
They observe.
In their stillness they see more.
The more they see, the larger the truth.
It's like meeting God.
You feel tiny.
You feel insignificant.
You feel like a vessel. 
You feel that you are simply a spout.
What comes out is not of you. 
What comes out is from supreme Truth.
It speaks for itself.
But then something happens.
The more Truth that comes out,
The more people who don't fully understand it,
Start calling it something wrong.
They start labeling it, warping it, contorting it, and fumbling it.
They're not inherently violent. 
They're simply not gentle, so they don't see it.
The more they don't see it,
The more it's miss-used, miss-guided, miss-understood.
The gentleness has become fear. 
And if Gentleness is the heaven of Truth,
then Fear must be the hell.
This movie is about showing a man's gentle nature and how this posture provided him the unique advantage to see truly powerful objective truth. Every scientist he recruited shared that gentleness. It's not a mystery why the most brilliant are the most fragile. Why every nerd is extremely quiet and awkward. This is not the problem, it's the sacrifice they make to be gentle enough to see the most beautiful truths in life. They are the warriors on the far North pole of the spectrum. They are light bringers. Zeus didn't chain Prometheus to the stone the first time Prometheus stole fire from the Titans and gave it to humans. Zeus quickly took the fire back and told Prometheus ""don't do it again."" But Prometheus was in love with humans, and his over enthusiasm to be as benevolent as he could, disobeyed Zeus and gave the fire a second and last time to humans. Zeus chained him to the rock because what he did was give a Truth to Humans so powerful, Zeus knew they would not be gentle enough to use it gently. 
If my future is truly blessed, I'm going to be a father someday. I imagine a gentleness I have yet to experience will suddenly birth itself in me, the way my child will be birthed into this world. What the mother gives away from herself and into the world, the world birth back into the parents a gentle-ness so strong it sees so much powerful Truth and that comes to them in the form of something God-like, in the form of a child, something called ultimate Love. People say we created the child, but I doubt we feel that way. We feel more like a vessel. A gateway. A passage by which a piece of God, in this child is walking thru. They are a new bright Fire being given to humanity. We've never felt so gentle, and our child is the most perfect gentle.
As time goes on, and the ungentle winds of the world blow across the landscapes of our children lives, they too will become less than perfect gentle. They will now have their own choices to make; to maintain their gentle nature, or to become less gentile and possibly at the very worst afraid. For in their fear we feel the most afraid ourselves. We fight for our children to revert back to a more gentle space. But in some cases our children have not yet found their strength, and in some cases they teach us more strength and more gentleness we've ever seen. 
I bring up children because we must face the reality that some of our children will not choose to live the path we hope they will choose. And this tragedy makes us face a choice - to act in a way of fear, fighting them and strong-arming them into our pre-planned decisions? - No doubt our motivations are pure. We only want them to revert back to the path we see as the most gentle. After all shouldn't we know best for them? Perhaps. Or we could act in a way that we be gentle. And by gentle we try to see their truth. We try to let them teach us something without them knowing it.  We be peaceful. In our peace, their Truth will have space and room to blossom and grow. It's our forcefulness, our lack of gentleness in handling our children that has created a fearful world. 
Remember, whatever you choose, your children will learn from. When our children start to act from fear, THAT is when we should be aggressive. Not AGAINST them, but WITH them, however we show them - there's nothing worth being afraid for. There's nothing powerful enough to force you to be afraid longer than you want to be. We must teach them to Conquer their Fear so they can forever have a life that is Gentle. A parent's job is single - defend against fear. Teach gentleness. If we do, our children will always find the Truth and humanity will be a gentle place.

"Aug 20, 2023","The story was an eye-opening look at a very important turning point in not only our history, but the world's. It was brilliantly-acted with an amazing cast of many recognizable actors, and the script was terrific, although complicated for most of us with IQs of less than 130 to understand. I did not give it 5 stars because I felt 3 hours was too long and they could have cut about 25 mins. out.

I loved Einstein's connection, especially at the end. The references from his past and present and how he could see the future was brilliantly done!  Many struggle with ""seeing"" an outcome or consequence so much more vividly than others when knowing all of the facts.  His emotion was spot on. His moral dilemma was so well written and presented. Robert Downy Jr was crazy good in his role also! It was the longest movie I have ever seen, and yet a not noticeable ""while watching"".

The whole Einstein bit seemed a bit overdone, and nobody would have missed it. 

The second half of the move is torturous to watch. You are bombarded by characters you barely know who are playing pivotal roles. The switching between b/w scenes and the current arc of the story is just irritating.

I suggest this movie to anyone above the age of 15-16 that think there aren't good movies left.",POSITIVE
"Aug 20, 2023",Awesome a must see Cicilian Murphy is brilliant really good acting.,POSITIVE
"Aug 20, 2023","A very difficult movie to rate. In terms of production, acting, and overall design-- the movie is stellar. Zero arguments there. After all, it's a Christopher Nolan movie and it shows with every shot. Give Cillian Murphy an Oscar, too.

That being said, there are several major flaws for me, personally. Firstly, the movie chronically lacks a sense of structure. You can pick a random scene from the movie, and you wouldn't be able to tell if it takes place at the beginning, end or the middle. This has nothing to do with the different timelines being shown simultaneously, as other movies have used this approach while maintaining a sense of beginning/middle/end in their story.

Secondly, there are serious pacing issues, especially in the last 40 minutes which could've easily been condensed into 15 or 20 minutes. It's not a boring movie -- by no stretch of the imagination, but the 3 hour runtime feels bloated.
 
Last, but certainly not least - it failed to elicit the emotional response in me that Nolan probably wanted. For the vast majority of the movie, I felt quite indifferent and apathic -- all while the movie was doing its best to be as dramatic (almost melodramatic) and serious as possible. As a result, it felt a bit pretentious and like the film is taking itself too seriously. I got the impression that somebody should've tapped Nolan on the shoulders as he was writing the script and told him ""It's not that deep, bro"".

Nevertheless, the character study of Oppenheimer is incredibly well done. By the end, you'll feel like you intimately know him, and I'd argue that his deconstruction throughout the movie is one of the best - if not the best - ever put to film.

The film also challenges your own morals and makes you question those of its characters, which was greatly appreciated.

Nevertheless, I feel like the focus should've been more on the moral / philosophical debate surrounding the atomic bomb, its far-reaching consequences on society, as well as the overall impact on Oppenheimer's psyche. But as it stands, Nolan - my man - you can't give me 45 minutes of court hearings and paranoid americans witch hunting for soviet spies and expect me to take the movie as dramatically as you want me to.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 20, 2023",Great movie. Little chaotic form of showing the story but it is a great movie.,POSITIVE
"Aug 20, 2023","I enjoyed that the movie showed the character of Oppenheimer as well as that of Strauss and Teller.
It is a history of Quantum Mechanics, with characters playing Einstein, Bohr, Heisman, Fermi, and Teller.",POSITIVE
"Aug 20, 2023","Prometheus, a Titan who defied Zeus by stealing fire from the gods and giving it to humanity,  symbolizes human advancement. As punishment, Zeus bound him to a rock where an eagle would eat his liver daily, only for it to regenerate each night.

Just as Prometheus brought fire and knowledge to humans, the character of Victor, in Mary Shelley masterpiece, Frankenstein,  brings life to a creature and plays with knowledge that transcends humanity's usual boundaries. 

Based on the 2005 biography American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, Christopher Nolan's movie also traces a parallel to the ancient myth, by chronicling the career of American theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer and his role as leader of the Manhattan Project, the same that brought the Atomic Bomb to life and culminated in the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing between 129,000 and 226,000 people, most of whom innocent civilians‚Ä¶ men, women and children. 

Whether you think dropping  the A-Bomb was a necessary evil or you believe the act was unwarranted as Germany had already surrendered  and it was just a matter of time before Japan did the same. Nobody can deny that both the creation and use of a weapon capable of causing mass extinction opened Pandora's box. 

War is always ugly and the end of a war that brought together capitalists and communists to rid the world of absolute evil was justly celebrated by whoever was against facism, but it must have been a bitter-sweat moment as the price of victory was incredibly high. 

And Nolan's movie covers this terrible Historic events with absolute  mastery. Exceptionally well crafted, technically perfect and visually stunning,  Oppenheimer is one of the best movies of my lifetime. As soon as the credits rolled and I left the room,  I cried‚Ä¶ and I cried more, and then cried again‚Ä¶ I drove home crying. I cried for Robert's pain, for his conscience, I cried for the world he created‚Ä¶ the one we live in. 

A true masterpiece, Oppenheimer was flawlessly adapted, masterfully directed, edited and acted. Audio is my passion, and the audio track is so fantastic that it tells a story on its own. It comes loud as hell when you least expect and it goes entirely silent when you do. With contrasting layers and inspiring sound textures that play with your perception. Unparalleled! 

In some moments, the movie works very much like a psychological thriller. What's really terrifying is not the bomb itself. There's nothing surprising about a bomb that went off over 70 years ago, but everything that surrounds its creation and deployment, all those gears moving ‚Äî vendetas, anticommunism, witch hunt‚Ä¶ a nation that have never really achieved the virtue it believes it has. 

And Murphy leads a superb cast. Robert Downey Jr. is a monster and Emily Blunt, the true Queen of England, Florence Pugh, Benny Safdie, Matt Damon, Gary Oldman, Kenneth Branagh‚Ä¶   Every single cast member is perfect.  Everyone!",POSITIVE

"Aug 19, 2023","Maybe I was spoiled by ""Fat Man and Little Boy"" ( which was good ).  This film was like that but crossed with ""JFK"" ( far too long and monotonous ).  It was ok right up until the bomb went off and then it just prattled on about Oppenheimer's security clearance and desire to influence arms control policy ( obliquely, there wasn't much of him actually doing this ).  However, maybe I just missed it because with 40min to go, I found myself walking out because I was soo bored by this point.  IMO, save your money and watch the former film instead.

Imagine watching ""Charlie And The Chocolate Factory"" but most of the film is about background checks and politics of Willy and the Oompa Loompas.

"Aug 19, 2023","On the rare occasions Hollywood delivers it's usually a Nolan flick. Shot on 70mm, it's on 11 miles of film with 11 miles more of beauty and an epic melodramatic and flat out horrifying soundtrack that surpasses anything Hans Zimmer could possibly do.

It makes you wonder how you would deal with such responsibilities of country verses people.",POSITIVE
"Aug 19, 2023",Oppenheimer is full with fire burning conversations an Oscar worthy performance from cillian Murphy and a jaw dropping atomic bomb sequence yet another great film by Nolan! Could have been like 15 minutes shorter though.,POSITIVE
"Aug 19, 2023","Oppenheimer was a really well thought out film that explored the build up to the bomb, his connection to Einstein, the aftermath of the completion of the bomb, and the aftermath of the bombing including the betrayal that occurred. The acting was amazing, but who would expect anything else with the cast. 
For me it was an emotional film in quite a few parts. Seeing his struggles and the effects of the bomb, was very intense.  Not to mention the lead up to the bomb gave me anxiety. Something that powerful being created actually instilled a fear in me while watching it. Nolan did a tremendous job. 
I know some people didn't like the length of the film but I thought it was great and didn't notice the time.  It allowed the intensity to be there surrounding the bomb, along with the character development. Loved it!",POSITIVE
"Aug 19, 2023","We saw it in a RPX theater which added to the experience with sound to compliment the outstanding editing in this film.  This was an important story, with layers worthy of discussion.  Fabulous direction, and great actors.  It was just too long.",POSITIVE
"Aug 19, 2023","Oppenheimer is one of the best if not the best movies I've ever watched. It doesnt have a lot of action ( shooting, fights etc.) and it focuses more on the building process and life of Oppenheimer. It has good dialoges, incredible scenes and I felt like I was Oppenheimer or in Oppenheimers perspective the whole time. I was so excited and nervous the whole time and the movie did a really good job portraying Oppenheimers life. Movie is a 100/10, MUST WATCH",POSITIVE

"Aug 19, 2023","It is not a bad movie, but it wasn't what I was expecting. Very disappointed since I was hoping for great dialogue, fleshed-out characters, and greater emphasis on the human drama and Oppenheimer's inner workings. We do get glimpses of it and they are great, but the constant jumping for periods and scenes prevents us from fully focusing on those aspects of the film. It was well made and Cillian Murphy's acting was great. However, it was more flashy than substance, and it reminds me of another disappointing character study: Joker. It didn't justify the run time since it didn't give enough time to develop characters such as Strauss. Why is this important? Well at the end of the film, we get to see major developments in Oppenheimer's life involving some of these characters but many get only a few scenes that last beyond a minute. This prevents us from getting the emotional payoff that was intended.",NEGATIVE

Unfortunately the characterisation is very shallow and the runtime is too long.

RDJ's performance is phenomenal, but the character is never fleshed out. Murphy's acting is also good.

The film doesn't put any effort into explaining the long winded boring political drama playing out.
It focuses too much on the politics, and then tries to fit in other narratives.

OK for a one time watch on a big screen, but skippable otherwise.",NEUTRAL

One of the most anticipated movies of 2023 and it didn't disappoint. I would like to say that the person must be fully prepared and switched on if he wants to understand the movie. Exceptional movie and great acting by each and every cast, especially Cillian Murphy and RDjr. One thing which I have noticed about casual movie goers that they were wondering what is happening. You are non attentive and then you are lost.

Oppenheimer is - with no doubt going to be one of the best movies in the history. Amazing cinematography, Exceptional acting and terrifying Soundtracks.

Cillian Murphy gave the performance of his life. Overall the movie üçø has everything.

"Aug 19, 2023","Outstanding! I can't remember the last time I saw a film that felt so sumptuous and driven by equal parts character development, plot and unpretentious nuance; it felt like reading a novel onscreen, full of detail and with a 3-hour run time that moved swiftly in and out of time and moral ambiguity. Not sure what other Oscar fodder will enter the arena, but Cillian and RDJ delivered stellar performances.

"Aug 19, 2023","I saw Oppenheimer in 70mm IMAX and it was completely worth it.  Chillian Murphy really brought Oppenheimer to life and Matt Damon and Robert Downy Jr did a phenomenal job with Gen Groves and Admiral Strauss.  The acting from the most minor characters to the headliners was excellent.

Christopher Nolan has been firmly cemented as one of the industry's top directors for years now and he did not disappoint.  All facets of the movie worked together to paint a picture of the Manhattan Project from its inception to the Trinity Test at the climax of the film.  Covering Oppenheimers life from his pro communist private life before being recruited for the Manhattan Project to his public fame after the end of WWII.

The use of full color film interspersed by black and white scenes to differentiate between the time jumps was well done and not jarring at all.  It was a brilliant way to avoid using on screen labels to tell the audience when and where they were throughout the film.

Overall, I cant recommend this movie more highly.  It's well done in all respects.",POSITIVE

All it needed was Cillian Murphy, Christopher Nolan, World War 2, and the atomic bomb, and it could easily claime the title of the best movie of the year. The scale of epicness in this film was truly unmatched. While some critics voiced concerns about the portrayal of Oppenheimer, citing its extended runtime and the background knowledge, and despite a relative not many of explosive action, I personally found immense enjoyment in every aspect of this movie. Being a history nerd, along with my friend, we loved it in every second of it. And this is 100% the second best film that Christopher Nolan has made.",POSITIVE

As a secondary teacher, I would have liked to been able to show this film to my classes but could never with these unnecessary sex scenes.  Every friend I have talked to has had the same opinion.

"Aug 18, 2023",This is THE most boring movie I have ever attended apart from Barbie.  After persisting for an hour I lay down on the cinema seats and went to sleep but was rudely and traumatically woken up every so often by an atom bomb going off. I think most people only went to see it because cillian Murphy was in it but he hardly showed any emotion at all and I didn't find him to be charismatic in the least. This was part of the problem that I didn't like or admire any of the characters in the whole movie.  There were just too many uninteresting suited men smoking and being bitchy with each other.  Even worse than Barbie.,NEGATIVE

This has a stellar ""who's who"" of a cast, with many surprising cameos and A-list actors in smaller roles. But Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt. Bob Downey and Matt Damon all put in stellar performances.

I don't think it's an Oscar caliber film, but the fact that there weren't a whole lot of decent films in 2023, it'll probably rack 'em up during awards season.

Final Grade: B -",NEUTRAL
"Aug 18, 2023","Absolutely the worst film I've ever tortured myself to sit through. We felt we were on a plane with screaming babies the entire time, me and my wife. We saw it in 70mm imax in Providence and it was beyond unbearably loud, over 90db vocals and we were in 2nd to the last row in the center. Throughout the entire movie, I'd say at least 75% of the scenes are completely out of focus and looked absolutely awful. I honestly don't think I've watched a movie that looked this bad on any screen in the last 20 years- since when I would use rabbit ears on a tube tv. 

As for the content of the film, the entire first half is random cut scenes of people talking in rooms and that is pretty much about what 85% of the movie actually is, a bunch of wasted time in rooms.
People like my wife, who aren't American originally, knew nothing about the people she was watching and who was who, and frankly, it took me the entire movie to get it myself. The cinematic scenes that apparently aren't cgi were kinda cool, but not much better than what many YouTubers put up that I watch regularly, on my 4k OLED screen which looks 10000x better than any and all scenes in this imax movie. Every single video I've watched this week on YouTube looked 100x better at least than this movie, and these people use tiny cams and record in 1080p or 4k and upload to compressed YouTube. Also, their content is 1000x more watchable than this mundane, dreary, screaming about nothing, boring, awful movie. There should have been an hour and a half cut from it, and an actually cool bomb explosion that didn't have a 9 minute delay from the cloud itself. There was maybe 3-4 okay scenes in the entire movie to me. All new movies are just absolutely awful I guess. 
Overall, this movie is the biggest waste of time I've ever had for such a monetary investment. We drove over an hour to this theater thinking this would be a cool experience, and we're leaving bored out of our minds, with tinnitus ringing in our ears, and actually shocked at how bad this movie was, and how truly awful it looked. I've actually never seen a movie that looked even 1/4 as bad at any theater in my life, and this is supposed to be imax? I saw Venom in fake imax 3d in Varna, Bulgaria years back and even that looked 3x better than this absolute garbage pile of a movie. 

When I found out the same director made man of steel, it made sense. That also is one of the most memorably boring movies I've ever tortured myself with. 

I now know to never trust the critics, as this was absolutely abysmal. On a 10 scale, I give the contents of the film a 1/10, and the cinematics a .07/10, and the focus a .0000000000000001/10.

I truly can't think of any movie that was this bad, ever. 

And the experience at the theater- abysmal. Absolutely do not torture your worst enemy with this atrocity.",NEGATIVE

Nolan delivered the best work of his carrer, the script is memorazing, painful, wonderful and tragic. 

Cillian Murphy is incredible, Emily Blunt is a strong, Trusting in her decisions and at the same time, wek for the family and brutal with all the situation around her. Very strong acting. Florence Pug shines, but not too much.

The reason for 3 stars was the TERRIBLE WORTHLESS soundtrack- it mucked up the dialog, people near us asked ""What?!""  all evening.  Apparently the director thought the story couldn't hold its own so he added irrelevant sounds (it didn't rise to the level of ""music"") for what purpose??

"Aug 18, 2023","Personal preference on this rating. Great acting. Focused story kept my attention. 

Appreciated and understood the need for flashbacks but, for me, there were too many... and they were nested at that.  

There were nude/sex scenes that, I think, were meant to show depth, or lack thereof, of emotion. To me they were extraneous. The story would have had the same impact on me without them.

The music seemed overdone and overburdensome. I think it was intended to build suspense and anxiety, and to underscore the raw significance and turmoil of ethics vs morality vs fear vs despair, etc. But many times I could not hear the words for all the loudness.  For me, I would have preferred a quieter score of dread with lots of discord and stretched tones.

Due to so many flashbacks and instances of inner turmoil, the movie, while covering all the key points and not belaboring them, seemed choppy.  

I would have given the movie a 4 or maybe even a 5 if it had taken a form closer to a documentary.  The serious nature of the topic and what was happening to people, followed by graphic examples of the effects of radiation poisoning, and the unsettled nature of it all was enough drama to get the point across - many times over.",NEUTRAL

"Aug 18, 2023","Amazing story, personal life and sacrifice, and 
persecution, and eternal implications are incredible. Interesting and sad life and entrails of destruction.

"Aug 18, 2023","In my opinion, the movie captured the essence of the Oppenheimer situation and the political intrigue behind it all as well as the duplicitous nature of the human political animal.
The ""science"" elements ( i.e., Quantum Mechanics) were an interesting adaptation for the non-scientific literate mind  If a viewer wishes a historical context for experiencing the film, may I recommend that a viewer read/scan https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Strauss and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppenheimer_security_hearing,

"Aug 17, 2023","On August 6, 1945, a strange object fell from a height of 10,000 meters onto the territory of Hiroshima, a city in Japan. A flash illuminated the sky, followed by a gigantic mushroom-shaped smoke rising on the horizon. Meanwhile, raindrops began to fall ‚Äì a dark rain. Within a matter of hours, 70,000 people were killed. ""Oppenheimer,"" directed by the acclaimed Christopher Nolan, is a film that aims to tell the story of the deadliest and most dangerous weapon ever created in the history of humanity, or at least that's what I thought. It turns out it goes beyond that; the movie presents a dilemma, a conflict of ideas, as we are dealing with a weapon of mass destruction.

The explosion scene (crafted practically, without CGI) is ingenious, and the sound direction amplifies a scene that is already stunning in its own right. 

I believe the film might become a bit tedious in the final minutes for some people, even though I remained focused and entertained throughout this 3-hour IMAX experience.",POSITIVE
"Aug 17, 2023","Overall, the film is good, but less than expected from the story and the director! I don't see any reason to narrate the events in a quick way or to present them without a commitment to the timeline, leaving the viewer unfollowed to merge, enjoy as wanted!

"Aug 17, 2023","The special effects are sort of worth it, but they interrupt the story at the weirdest times. Tons of great actors! Very little in-depth character development.

"Aug 17, 2023","A masterpiece for those who understand the historical context of the film. Even with its three-hour runtime, it has a quick pace introducing characters and themes, making it a little dense at times. The script and storytelling are brilliant and engaging. Nolan's ability to turn a biopic into a deeply emotional cinematic experience shows why he is one of the best. There were moments when my heart was pounding and I even had goosebumps. The cast is one of the most ambitious aspects of the project, even secondary characters were played by recognized actors. Everyone delivers excellent performances, and I can already see Robert Downey Jr. winning an Oscar for supporting actor. Visual and sound effects are captivating and immersive, even more so when you know the film does not have a single CGI shot. On top of all, Ludwig G√∂ransson's soundtrack shows why he can be at the same level as Zimmer if he didn't already convince you with Tenet. Overall, an extraordinary experience in which you can feel how passionate were the people involved in the making of the film. Every aspect of it shines and blends remarkably to result in an emotional journey and I am sure it will have a lot of rewatch value as is usual with Nolan.",POSITIVE

"Aug 17, 2023","Gosh, what a giant deception!! I wonder why Nolan, the director, didn't make it a 5 hour epic, so he could have even shown how often Oppenheimer ate cereal during his childhood and how often he crapped his diapers when he was a baby. Crap is pretty much the only word that properly describes this film. I won't even call it a movie as Nolan must have been a teacher in his former life and it was rather an endless, endless, endless history lesson. I could have just as well watched the History Channel. In fact, I have seen movies and documentaries about Oppie and the bomb before, but none was so lame and idiotic, with this one surely including the worst directing job of them all. How else do you explain that a flashback in black and white which is often used to show the oldest parts of the story, here shows mostly the most recent events. What a moronic idea. And why use any B/W at all? The whole idea of making Oppenheimer the victim of (this) history is also quite absurd as they all knew what they were building. And why invite so many famous actors who only appear for 20-30 seconds? Only to improve the title credits? The director's notorious jumps between timelines gets soon extremely annoying and after only 50 minutes I started checking the time again and again hoping for this bullshit to end. I rather watch Barbie again, even 10 times,  than 1 single minute of Oppencrapper again. 2/10 points, and that 2 only for the good make-up artist.",NEGATIVE

"Aug 16, 2023","What a colossal disaster!  

Unable to decide what facet of Oppenheimer's life to use as a dramatic fulcrum to keep us engaged for 3 hours, Nolan jams as many bits and pieces of relevant and irrelevant material as he can hoping we will hang in there to finally ""get it"". 

But sadly, there is nothing to get.  As the Army general in charge of the Manhattan Project, Matt Damon sums up this absolute train wreck in his very first scene, telling Oppenheimer to his face that he is a ""womanizer, arrogant, a diletante"" and more.  

In other words not a very likeable character, despite his acknowledged brilliance--which we never actually get to SEE but constantly hear about in case we forget 

The dialogue is so pedestrian, so telegraphed to be sure we do get it, that fatigue sets in almost immediately  

The ""all star"" cast tries its best to keep this dreadful film alive but can't. And the star himself is left to carry the film using facial expressions to convey every emotion that the film lacks. 

When we see him being hounded by McCarthyites he literally just sits there looking pained or speaking so quietly even his drunken wife tells him to grow a spine.  

Oppenheimer's fatal flaw is that it takes itself so seriously it's hard not to believe all the hype that it really is.

Even the much anticipated explosion scene is a dud compared to the pyrotechnics of similar blockbuster films.  

To make up for such a stunning lack of visceral emotion, we are talked to death about the radioactivity and numbers of people who died ad nauseum.

The ""agony"" of Oppenheimer and others who felt they had unleashed doomsday and wanted to put it back in the bottle comes across as antiseptic hand wringing 

Nothing really actually changes in Oppenheimer ..we all know what happens before the movie starts. And instead of showing us, as film should, how characters DO change, nobody really does. 

We are left with very little more than we began.  The whole three hours was like a low budget documentary, a pastiche, not a drama or even a ""movie"" 

What happened to all these people? Do we care?  I kept thinking if only Nolan had seen Apocalypse Now, Dr. Strangelove or even Argo, maybe he would have realized you can't  create tension, drama, passion, horror unless you show it.  

And that's why as a film, Oppenheimer is such a total failure.



Lurching from one decade to another, with no real connective plot, even the actual A bomb explosion is underwhelming.

Oppenheimer eventually becomes so incoherent, it's as if Nolan forgot what movie he was making.",NEGATIVE

They could have focused more on the debate on dropping the bomb. I was in Hiroshima once and went to the museum where I discovered how American propaganda made the victims appear as collateral damage. That it was like an experiment to see the impact this would have.  Instead of the communist story a more powerful duel story or end would be to focus on Japanese side in build up to the dropping of the bomb. Show normal people going about their daily business before it was dropped.   I think with lot of Nolan movies I never get a connection with the characters, very Stanley Kubrick, very stylish, but cold.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 16, 2023","This is CINEMA!!!! Absolutely fantastic film, although long it is definitely worth seeing and kept me engaged throughout. Performances extraordinary and gorgeous cinematography. Definitely still thinking about it and can't wait to go again. One of Nolan's best.",POSITIVE
"Aug 16, 2023",Not a clear story telling,NEGATIVE
"Aug 16, 2023","Nolan, you continue to prove to me that you are not the greatest director of the generation.

Don't get me wrong, there are fantastic moments and scenes, but that's all they were, moments.

The fast pacing and out-of-chronological-order does the opposite of building tension and anxiety. Instead it just makes the film a 3 hour montage of facts and feel disingenuous. 

This should not really have been a feature film, but instead a 5 hour mini series.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 16, 2023",Brilliant movie.  Exceptional casting.  Absolutely engaging for the full three hours.,POSITIVE
"Aug 16, 2023","The subject matter was fascinating. Performances were stellar all around, especially Scillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. I can see many Acadamy Award nominations coming for this film, it deserves them.",POSITIVE
"Aug 16, 2023",Great movie...got a little lost with who's who in the last 30 min.,POSITIVE
"Aug 16, 2023","It's the kind of movie that you need to see one time in your life but it wasn't that much good as I thought, still a good movie but mehhh. (You watch it one time and it's enough) clearly not a Must See",NEUTRAL
"Aug 16, 2023","Very good movie.  However, it is three hours long and most people in the audience seemed to be a bit restless toward the end.  The beginning was a little hard to follow but all in all a very good movie.  My husband  and brother went with me and we are all looking up Robert Oppenheimer.",POSITIVE
"Aug 16, 2023","Brilliant filmmaking. I am reading the book, and the film told a complex story so ably.",POSITIVE
"Aug 16, 2023",Great story about one of the most consequential decisions of all time.,POSITIVE

"Aug 16, 2023","A movie experience you truly wouldn't have gotten unless sitting in front of the big screen. Absolutely stunning and the whole cast gave Oscar winning acting. Glad the Movie stick to its title being truly about Oppenheimer. Before, During, and after The Manhattan Project.",POSITIVE
"Aug 16, 2023",Saw this twice. Much better than Barbie. The acting is phenomenal. This is one of Chris Nolan‚Äôs best movies and Cillian Murphy deserves an award,POSITIVE

"Aug 16, 2023","The history and acting was good, but all the dramatic, visual, and sound affects stunk. Really bought down the story.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 16, 2023",Tremendous film. Film making at its' best. Loved the color B&W mix. The critics are writing click-bate. It moves fast and intense so worth a second watch.,POSITIVE
"Aug 16, 2023",A bit slow and confusing at the first 1/2 but very good for the second 1/2. Enjoyed it.,POSITIVE
"Aug 16, 2023","Not what I was expecting it to be, after following the hype and the advertising campaign. The movie is very slow paced and dialogue heavy, which is fine, but I feel like they sold it as more of an action heavy film. I‚Äôm surprised at how underwhelming the atomic bomb visuals end up being, and was expecting to see more of the aftermath and use of these bombs considering the subject matter. But the film is more focused on personal and character drama. Which again, I like that kind of stuff, but it‚Äôs not what I was sold.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 16, 2023",The historical accuracy seemed accurate.,POSITIVE
"Aug 16, 2023","Great film!!!  Now we need a movie about the life of Richard Feynman starting with his time with the Manhattan Project!!!!!  There is a movie about his early love life. But, there is so much more to tell of this Bongo-playing genius. He is in the movie a couple times playing his bongo drums, and sitting in his car at the Bomb test. He felt the windshield would protect his eyes. He was the only human that day to see the bomb detonate without wearing goggles. If you don't know him, look him up. You won't be disappointed.",POSITIVE
"Aug 16, 2023","One of the best historical look into the rise climax and fall of the father of the Atomic bomb as well as not just suggesting, but saying we gave the power to destroy ourselves.",POSITIVE

Overall, refreshing release among the usual summer popcorn fare.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 15, 2023","The movie is long and I don't know how it could have been edited to be shorter.  There is a lot of technical information at the beginning that makes it a bit overwhelming, but the last hour moves, and makes it worth the time investment.",POSITIVE

"Aug 15, 2023","the story is fascinating and the acting top notch - especially Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt and Robert Downey Jr.     three hours went fast and the moral dilemma Oppenheimer experienced really resonated.    definitely worth seeing.",POSITIVE
"Aug 15, 2023","Excellent, well written, well acted and very informative on an important period of history.",POSITIVE
"Aug 15, 2023",I felt it gave me an important history lesson while keeping my interest in the story.  It showed a part of our history that I didn't know and would not have looked up to learn on my own.,POSITIVE
"Aug 15, 2023","The trailer is very misleading and would have you thinking the movie was about building the atomic bomb. Yes, this was a part of the movie, but there was far more to it. The first hour was slow and boring while laying the foundation to Oppenheimers political views and past. The final hour was spent on Lewis Strauss personal vendetta towards Oppenheimer. Similar to the beginning of the movie, it was intriguing but slow and boring. All in all, it was not what I was hoping for. The plot regarding the A-bomb was interesting. The rest felt like it should have been another movie. Lastly, the way the movie bounced from various times, places, and plotlines was complicated leaving me bored and exhausted. If I had seen it on Netflix, I would have stopped watching and found another movie.",NEGATIVE

"Aug 15, 2023","Awful. Too loud. The score is dreadful. Just endless pulsing. Oppenheimer was a quiet and subtle man, his story was about a moral dilemma. This movie is self-important- to quote the script. Emily Blunt is very good. Robert Downey is interesting.  Cillian Murphy is good.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 15, 2023","Well written story line, great acting/actors and music.",POSITIVE
"Aug 15, 2023","It's so good that it should expose Hollywood for it's crimes against fairness in forcing ""diversity"". Time pieces get a ""pass"" on the ridiculousness that is wokeness.",POSITIVE
"Aug 15, 2023","Didn't like the film at all. Boring. Too much close-up. The explosion was like ""meh"". I can't hear a thing. There're too many plots and dialogue about everything and anything thrown at me that I lose interest one quarter into the film. I love Christopher Nolan so I am giving him two stars just for being a great director but zero star for the film for zero entertainment value.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 15, 2023","With his latest entry, Christopher Nolan proves once again that he‚Äôs one of the best directors of our generation. Oppenheimer is a tome at three hours, but it doesn‚Äôt feel like it whatsoever. Scenes jump frantically, practically blinking on the screen for 20 or 30 seconds before abruptly moving on to another matter entirely. This framework seems perhaps, at first, to be an introduction to Oppenheimer‚Äôs train of thought, ping-ponging back and forth due to his genius. As the film progresses two things become clear: one, that the entirety of the film is sustained by this scene jumping anxiety and two, there are multiple timelines involved. When each timeline is happening isn‚Äôt immediately clear but becomes much clearer as the film progresses. It‚Äôs through the combination of these storytelling devices that Nolan springs his trap as viewers are enrapt by what is, essentially, a three-hour talkfest. But it‚Äôs through the excellent dialogue and the acting prowess of A-listers giving some career best performances that Nolan communicates these dense, science-heavy and, at least on paper, frankly boring ideas regarding the creation of the atomic bomb. Impressive cinematography aside, it‚Äôs the acting by greats like Cillian Murphy, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, and Robert Downey Jr. that makes the whole thing truly land, with Damon and Downey Jr. giving performances that will easily be Oscar-nominated. Damon plays Leslie Groves, the United States Army Corps of Engineers officer who not only regulated clearances for the Manhattan Project, but also oversaw the construction of the Pentagon in Washington. Damon‚Äôs take on the man is somewhere on the frenemy spectrum for Oppenheimer, both an obstacle to the doctor‚Äôs acceptance in the project, and an unlikely ally behind the scenes. Downey Jr. plays Lewis Strauss, an American businessman, banker, and member of the Atomic Energy Commission. Strauss ends up being an intriguing character because his motivations unfold as the film does. Overall it‚Äôs a challenging film, both in content and in pacing, but by the film‚Äôs conclusion those who have been attending will understand how all the pieces fit together.",POSITIVE
"Aug 15, 2023",Great!!! Suberb! Great movie!!,POSITIVE
"Aug 15, 2023","Overall bad experience. Theater is overrated with a small screen that is not worth the title ""IMAX"" and the seats were old. Film had visible scratches throughout the whole movie and the sound was unnecessarily too loud overpowering the dialogues. The film did not belong in IMAX.  Nothing special about it. The story was good and insightful but not Nolan's best film.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 15, 2023","Most people know about Oppenheimer's achievements, but little about the man.  This biography gave insight into the man behind the science, and humanized him.  His relationships, his politics, his family have been all but unknown quantities until this film.  My only complaint is the overuse of closeups.  I really liked this film as a completion of a portrait of an icon of WW2 and the Cold War.  He is every bit a brilliant man, warts and all.",POSITIVE
"Aug 15, 2023",An absolutely brilliant movie. Very well crafted for the people passionate about cinema and history. I was transported to the WWII era. I am not giving full 5 stars just because at some point at the end the story gets messed up and a little bit boring but that gets fixed quickly.,POSITIVE
"Aug 15, 2023","I was surprised by how underwhelming this movie was. 
* I didn't learn anything about the science underlying the bomb 
* I didn't learn anything about the political landscape 
* I didn't feel any emotional attachment to the characters. 

It's a lot of detailed interpersonal tit-for-tat grievances, but in a way that didn't tell me anything more broadly about that time in history, or even life more generally. 

There are so many ways this movie could have been good, and it just wasn't.",NEGATIVE

"Aug 15, 2023","A masterpiece. Every actor that was in this film gave it a push,a nudge, a smile, a tap at the exactly right moment. Robert Downey Jr. Had better be getting an Oscar for thus level of acting. He was magnificent. The entire film eas breathtaking and I was just overwhelmed by its artistic style and grandeur.
Go see it. It was just an unbelievable film.
Plus, it had Emily Blunt in it. She's an angel disguised as an actress.",POSITIVE

As someone who already knew a lot of his story, I was again hit with awe as I saw his life unravel before my eyes, but this time not in text, but in video.

In this case, I wanted to know how the War Department narrowed the target cities to Hiroshima and Nagasaki (we know why Kyoto was excluded!). I saw the movie with 3 other people, and we all agreed we would have much preferred a straight timeline to the confusing flashbacks and flash forwards. Also, the nudity added nothing to the story except an R rating, which was not essential to the plot line. Those were the only reasons I shorted the movie one star.",POSITIVE

"Aug 15, 2023","I don't watch a lot of movies, I normally think they aren't as thought provoking as books. This movie was great though. I personally don't like the narrative style it chose. Similar to the book ""It"", it goes back and forth between two points in time, which although I get a ""new"" narrative style, but it feels confusing at times. ""It"" didn't have that problem because the book was so long and the points in each point in time were sometimes hundreds of pages long, but Oppenheimer was long too. Long movies are different than long books. Long books, you look silly carrying around that big book, long movies, your foot falls asleep and your eyes get tired. It takes away from the experience, not really enhances it. You'll remember getting antsy at the 2 hour mark, googling ""How long is Oppenheimer?"", not how much the story captivated you. The end really took me though. They could've put anything on screen after Oppenheimer said he thought they did. In seconds I was thinking of what it meant for the human race to know something, and when, if we ever could, know everything. Moments before had me thinking about how the age of science this movie described really came to be, I thought of the novel Frankenstein (book is quite different, they hit on the same themes, but book is more about the scientific revolution and where the limit is on it, and the fear of creating a godless creature). Good movie. Not perfect, but nothing is. Best movie I have ever seen, but a grain of salt is needed because of the beginning sentence. Just because I don't like many movies doesn't mean I have a better taste.",POSITIVE

"Aug 15, 2023","Fascinating. Unlike his other blockbusters, the biopic can't rely on the fantastical, mind blowing elements of Nolans time-bending ideas and mystery - and yet, surprisingly it works all the same, while it leans into his typical forte of multiple story angles and stunning audio-visual escapism. The dive into Oppenheimer's (and his fellow scientists and project members) mind is harrowing and leaves audiences humbled by the moral questions left behind. Brilliantly portrayed roles and well mapped out storytelling add a lot to make the three hour long running time a theater visit to remember. One of the most intriguing movies I've seen for a long time.",POSITIVE
"Aug 15, 2023","Oppenheimer is undoubtedly the best movie of 2023. Christopher Nolan puts any doubt to rest that he wouldn't be capable of capturing a story of this magnitude. Cillian Murphy gives an iconic performance that intensifies each moment rolling along this breakneck biopic of J. Robert Oppenheimer.

"Aug 15, 2023",Confusing storytelling. Audio was largely unintelligible.,NEGATIVE
"Aug 15, 2023","Well executed storyline filled with contrasts between the celebration and terror of scientific advancement, a director with the power to unlock the key of world destruction but the inability to create a stable isotope of a family life for his kids and wife, and the theme that ""it's not always about you"". I found it beautiful and scary at the same time and left me very interested to learn more about the various scientists, the actual testing during the project and the long term effects on Los Alamos. The acting was downright nuclear with its powerful cast, and I walked in feeling worried I'd be looking at my watch ,but the entire time, I was locked in due to their acting, the cinematography, and the overall effect. Excellent way to spend 3 hours. Only downfall was the unnecessary 25 minutes of previews that insulted the movie's worth beforehand.",POSITIVE
"Aug 15, 2023","Brilliant historical account of the development of the atomic bomb and its importance in ending WW2.

"Aug 15, 2023","This is one of the best movies I have seen in awhile. See it in imax if u can, the sound effects and images are amazing.

"Aug 14, 2023",Not a Nolan movie as I was expecting. The movie is Too long and the narrative much short but hard to understand the timeline.,NEGATIVE
"Aug 14, 2023","Disappointing. The repeated nude scenes between ""Oppenheimer"" and his lover were tossed in like required punctuation, some as fantasies in public. Pretty much interrupted what should have been a taut story that already had points of interest far above common nude and sex scenes. Of course conservatives were the enemy, communists and socialists the heroes. Go figure. The fantasy sequences became redundant and ridiculous. A sham tactic of having very low sounds, quiet moments kept being smashed into by ridiculously loud music and sound effects to intentionally startle the audience. All it did was make me want a refund. 1.5 stars only for some of the supporting cast.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 14, 2023","Oppenheimer is a incredible film that talks about the World War II and the construction of atomic bomb. The sound track is nice, the characters are very good and the plot is interesting.",POSITIVE
"Aug 14, 2023","Part of the problem with this movie was the bad audio in the theater where I saw it in IMAX: it was surprisingly difficult to understand dialogue (not usually a problem for me), I think because the music and other sounds just overwhelmed it.  Otherwise, I was disappointed in the movie, although it wasn't bad the last third went very slowly, seemed unnecessary and too long.  Framing the whole thing as Oppenheimer's story rather than the story of the atom bomb was part of the problem it was hard to care much about whether he'd get his security clearance or not when there are so many bigger issues to care about.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 14, 2023","This movie was so inspirational, telling the story of an american hero, that prior to this film had a story that was unknown to the american citizen.  Cillian Murphy is a tour de force.",POSITIVE

"Aug 14, 2023","Definitely one of the best film's I've ever seen and definitely a great cinema experience, cinematography was beautiful, the sound design was on point throughout the whole film, cillian Murphy deserves an Oscar for he's portrayal as Oppenheimer, you can tell that he really prepared himself for this role and let's not forget Robert Downey Jr.'s performance as Strauss, loved every moment he was on the screen and in all honesty the casting for this film was so on point, every cast member fit so well into their characters. Really loved what Christopher Nolan was able to do with this film and I really look forward to he's next project.",POSITIVE

"Aug 14, 2023","The story was so interesting. My brother and I fact-checked much of it after, and it really seemed very try to reality. It was such a slice of history to learn! The acting from everyone was also outstanding. I didn't even realize it was Robert Downey Jr. until after the fact. 

I actually was apprehensive about sitting through a 3-hour movie...so long (!)...but it needed 3 hours to tell the whole story. I have recommended this movie to many of my friends - it's well worth seeing, and very good on the big screen.",POSITIVE
"Aug 14, 2023","Was a bit fast paced for me to follow the time jumps and the multiple plot lines, but it was visually stunning and the sound...oh the sound! I think Robert Downey Jr. has an Oscar nomination for sure.",POSITIVE
"Aug 14, 2023","Chilled to the bone. The film demands a substantial investment of the viewer's time, but proves to be worth every second as it leaves us grappling with the the circumstances surrounding the creation of the atomic bomb and prompts us to consider the future of the weapon in the most dire way. The emotional weight of the film is embodied by the mental turmoil Cillian Murphy depicts in Oppenheimer so well.",POSITIVE
"Aug 14, 2023","Despite a slow first act and many gross historical innacuracies, Oppenheimer is a start-studded movie that will let you questioning why humanity can be so brilliant and so stupid at the same time, all encompassed in a visually spectacular feast, brilliant sound and a lingering sense of hope, dread and frenzy.",POSITIVE
"Aug 14, 2023","Really wanted to like it, but felt its storyline was choppy and hard to follow.  The timeline of events is not clear, so it'd be better if you already knew the historical background of the making of the A-bomb.  The special effects were okay but seemed a bit gratuitous. Very slow-moving movie.  Thought the acting was much better than the production.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 14, 2023","J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) war ein bekannter Physiker, welcher als der Vater der Atombombe gilt. Er leitete das Manhattan Project, in dem mehrere Physiker waren, die f√ºr den Bau der Atombombe wichtig war. Oppenheimer zeigt 45 Jahre des Lebens von Oppenheimer und fokussiert sich auf seine Folgen, nach dem Bau der Atombombe und seine N√§he zum Kommunismus. Dabei ist sein gr√∂√üter Widersacher Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), der Oppenheimer aus Rache schaden m√∂chte.

Oppenheimer ist der neuste Film von Christopher Nolan und ist richtig Star besetzt. Jede kleine Rolle ist gut durchdacht, sei es Mathias Schweigh√∂fer oder Gary Oldman. Alle sind perfekt getroffen und sind interessant, bis auf Emily Blunt, diese kann nicht besonders gut √ºberzeugen und ist als einzige nicht Ernennens wert. Cillian Murphy spielt Oppenheimer super und hat eine Oscar-Nominierung verdient. Wer den Oscar f√ºr den Film definitiv verdient hat, ist Robert Downey Jr. Er spielt den Gegenspieler von Oppenheimer so √ºberzeugend und brillant. Damit zeigt er auch, dass er nicht nur Iron-Man ist, sondern auch in ernsten Filmen noch zu √ºberzeugen wei√ü. Der Soundtrack und die Effekte sind ebenfalls brillant und es ist sehr spannend den Film anzuschauen. Der Bau der Atombombe bzw. die Z√ºndung ist nicht das Hauptthema, sondern es wird sich auf den Charakter von Oppenheimer fokussiert.

Oppenheimer ist ein sehr gute Biopic und man interessiert sich mehr f√ºr das Thema nach dem Film und will sich mehr damit befassen. Der Soundtrack bzw. der Sound und die Effekte sind fantastisch und haben einen Oscar verdient. Wenn man hier einen Film erwartet, welcher Actionreich ist und es viele Explosionen gibt, wird hier entt√§uscht sein und den Film nicht m√∂gen. Wenn man einen Film sehen m√∂chte, der den Fokus auf die Charaktere und die Folgen f√ºr Oppenheimer.

"Aug 14, 2023","Many reasons why Oppenheimer disappoints despite all its marketing.  Ridiculous volume level.  Too long.  Indecipherable physics and science.  No history of war or why dropping of bomb on Japan was deemed necessary.  Way too much about McCarthyism and panic about communism.  No real scenes or aftermath of the bomb dropping.  Too many characters to keep up with, often confused with accents.  Gratuitous breasts and sex scenes. No explanation for final medal that Oppenheimer received.  Acting of course was tremendous.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 14, 2023","The movie itself was really good. However, I had purchased my tickets about a week in advance. When my father and I arrived at IMAX, we were informed that the 70mm showing wouldnt be shown (I think due to projector issues). Bummer, but it happens, and we drove almost an hour to see it specifically for that reason. Then the movie started and the audio was off-sync by about a half second. They attempted to fix it during the movie, which only worked for about 5 minutes before it lost its sync. Which made it hard to follow who was talking during important scenes at times. Like I had stated, the movie was great, which is why Im giving 5 stars.  The theater unfortunately dropped the ball.",POSITIVE

The cast was well appointed but I felt a little bogged down in their dialogues as they mumbled through at times and in others were lost to the overly enthusiastic sound management. Overall, I found this to be an enjoyable film that validates the question of moral responsibilities often overlooked by those whose job it is to safeguard the freedoms and liberties that are frequently taken for granted.",POSITIVE

"Aug 14, 2023","I enjoyed this more than I did Tenet. I still don't rank it with Inception. The build-up to the Trinity test was done well. The acting was good, but not as mesmerizing as it was hyped to be. The music was overly dramatic at times. (I actually think this new composer doesn't make melodies as strong as Zimmer or Williams.) I would like to watch this again, because there were so many characters and so many names, that I wasn't always quite sure who they were talking about. And I hated how Florence Pugh was used here. Absolutely hated it. Jean Tatlock was actually a very educated woman with strong political beliefs, and Nolan thought she was only worth portraying as a piece of meat on our screens. It was totally disrespectful to the actress and the character she was portraying.",NEUTRAL

That would have changed the narrative and the objective of this. Those who try to criticize this movie for not depicting the images of real attacks... should see this movie. Some idiots say the film glorifies the bombs in Japan.... Absolute nonsense. 
This is a biopic about the scientist... It captures everything from the point of view of Dr. Oppenheimer. This is brilliant film making. I really hope this film get what it deserves in terms of praise and accolades. Hollywood needs movies like this.

Murphy is brilliant as Robert Oppenheimer in his strongest cinematic performance since The Wind That Shakes The Barley. Nolan captures Oppenheimer's brilliance, flaws and moral quandary well. The atom bomb is presented as one of the highest points of human mastery of our universe. From the perspective of human advancement, one leaves the cinema wondering if progress is even worth it.

"Aug 14, 2023","A truly epic film. The first two thirds of the movie, culminating in the Trinity tests, is brilliant. The depictions of the generation's best minds was wonderfully cast- I thought Safdie as Edward Teller was in particular a great contribution. The removal of sound from the Trinity tests was a genius way to display the tests- I mean how else are you going to capture to noise and fury? A WW2 movie that isn't really about the proceedings of war is novel.

I do not think it is a perfect movie or even necessarily the best of the year. The scenes with Pugh are gratuitous, in particular the bizarre scene in the interrogation room with Pugh mounting a naked, unreal Murphy is so out of place it stands out. While the script for the most part is brilliant, Nolan does occasionally revert to cheesy clich√© (""break a leg"", ""try not to blow up the world""). The issue of ""will Japan surrender if we test the bomb and show them its destructive power?"" is breezed over without meaningful discussion. The decision to not show the bombs actually drop in Japan is a glaring omission; there is even a scene where Murphy is viewing images on a projector of the destruction, but the movie never shows the horror of what Murphy is looking at. The last third of the movie which revolves around the Senate confirmation vote for Strauss, while brilliantly acted by Downing Jr. and Malek, is the weakest part of the film in terms of contributing to themes or plot and the film probably would have been better wrapping up the character study of Oppenheimer in a different way.

I fell asleep multiple times before walking out just 2 hours in.  Looked it up and found the don't even detonate a bomb on screen.  So glad I left.

"Aug 13, 2023","Oppenheimer is Nolans Magnum oppus. I know I am late to the party but this movie is simply Incredible! I am Blown away.

Starting off with the production design and sound: If both of these do not get nominated at the oscars then we might have a problem. Just like Barbie, Oppenheimer has a fantastic production design that just is filled to the brim with detail and care. and this is the Loudest film I have ever seen. When I got done another theater that was playing it was rumbling. Then when the quiet moments came it made everything even more empactful.

The Score: This is by far the best Score of the year. It made every scene better and the movie kinda just embraced it. It could be lighthearted yet Grim at times but in a new and fresh way. I will be listening to this creative and Loud Score on repeat.

Bomb Scene: I think I might have just witnessed one of the greatest scenes in the history of Cinema. All the lead up and tension I felt to get to this scene was insane. I was on the edge of my seat and when it happend everything was just quiet, almost like the world had stopped. Then when the sound came through I was simply speechless. The practical effects were mind blowing and you need to see them on the big screen!

Performances: First of all if Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr dont get nominated for Best actor and Best supporting actor then I will be furious because like the rest of this movie Incredible! Cillian Murphy became Oppenheimer. Just the look on his face in all of his scenes is truly sensational. He gave It his All and has gave my favorite preformance of the year. I loved seeing Robert Downey Jr in something besides the MCU where he really gets to shine ans show off his acting chopps more. He is menacing yet very gentle and I am glad they casted him in the movie. But I also have to mention Florence Peugh and Emily Blunt because they were very good too and stole every scene they were in. Last but not least Matt Damon, He was great as always. Everyone involved in this movie Truly gave it their all and felt needed.

The End: Simply all the build up to find out what Albert Einstein was going to say was just Amazing. It was haunting but true about how they will give you a medal and pat you on the back but what he did is unforgivable no matter how much they say it is. That was powerful stuff.

Final thoughts: Oppenheimer is one of the best films of our time. Christopher Nolan is truly an incredible filmmaker and this movie proves that. Everyone that helped and is involved in this movie gave it their all. Oppenheimer will make you think and leave you scared about the world we live in. I believe that this movie is important And movie everyone should check it out at least once in their life.",POSITIVE

"Aug 13, 2023","I knew the history of Oppenheimer and saw early documentaries on him. Technically the producers kept to the facts, but, and its a big but, they put endless sex scenes that were disgusting. It seemed like producers are more interested in pushing bullshit crap in their movies then they are history. It might as well have been a Netflix special where they have to fill the script with gay and lesbian sick crap. It did go all out with dizzying graphics that left you cross-eyed. It was a waste of money to me.",NEUTRAL

"Aug 13, 2023","After hearing all the hoopla about this movie, and being a fan of true stories and history, I thought I would be in for a treat. For me, the movie was way too long, and although well acted, it put too much emphasis on Oppenheimer's sex life, in my opinion. However, it was interesting, rather chilling and sad to see how it was decided which Japanese cities would be chosen to have the bomb dropped on them. One city was eliminated from the hit list because one of the men making the decision had a pleasant personal history with the city, so that particular city held happy memories and meant something to him. Too bad the other cities didn't. It did remind me that when people get to know other people who are different from them on a personal basis, they often see the humanity in them that they did not consider before.  One take away was plain to see, and that is war is truly hell.",NEGATIVE

"Aug 13, 2023","Really, we are supposed to cry with Kitty, his wife, at the end because his 1954 review by AEC resulted in the removal of his security clearance? By the way he cheated on her with several women and she knew of it and she was a communist, oppenheimer was a communist (came out as fact after the fall of the USSR in the early 90s) and his brother was a communist and his best friend Chevalier was a leading communist. He hired scientist Fuchs who was a Russian spy to be in the Manhatten project and through Harry Gold brother to Ethel Rosenberg and Julius Risenberg they sold all the atomic bomb secrets from Oppenheimers discovery along with sonar and other secrets to the Rusdians. Russians got nuclear capabilities as a result in 1949 and we rightfully executed the Rosenbergs (verified to be Communist Russian agents through USSR documents obtained in 1990) China became communist in 1948, we were fighting communism in the Korean War and people like oppenheimer, rosenbergs, hiss.

"Aug 13, 2023",This Movie was awesome. Very eventful and dramatic scenes Nolan really got the art down of reimagining the drama that was happening within this history and putting it to a well written out movie of the events that happened and the paranoia and that happened all through this time period. you dove into the mind of each person and felt what they felt. Cillian Murphy was mesmerizing the power of acting without saying any  words he drove this film all the way through. if you love History this is the one! See in Theaters!,POSITIVE

"Aug 13, 2023","Firstly, anyone who's not seen this biopic.. have a basic grasp on international politics, nuclear weapons and scientic aspects.

Otherwise most of the movie will go over your head. Saying that, if you do, like myself, you will enjoy this movie. Flawless acting from all cast members, the movie is abit cramped as it is a 3 hour film about Robert whole life. 
While watching the biopic, you realise that Oppemheimer may well be one of the most important humans in history. 
Nolan captures all that is important within his life and brilliantly, truly one of his best.

IMAX isn't necessary either.. no matter how much they try and sell it.",POSITIVE
"Aug 13, 2023","Nolan's best. An incredible and clever film about Robert Oppenheimer, that is less about bombs and more about personal experiences and trauma.

The sets, costumes, and even the smallest details transport viewers to the tumultuous era of the 1940s, where the fate of nations hung in the balance. The commitment to historical authenticity is evident in the recreation of Los Alamos, the secret laboratory where some of the brightest minds of the time collaborated to unlock the secrets of atomic energy.

The casting choices are not just about finding actors who resemble the historical figures they portray, but also about capturing the essence of their characters. The titular character, J. Robert Oppenheimer, is brought to life with remarkable nuance and depth by Cillian Murphy.

""Oppenheimer"" excels in its depiction of the scientific challenges and ethical debates that the characters face. The film takes its time to delve into the intricate scientific processes involved in harnessing atomic energy, presenting the audience with a clear and accurate portrayal of the scientific breakthroughs and challenges. This level of authenticity not only educates viewers but also creates a deeper emotional connection to the intellectual journey of the characters.

Ethical questions loom large in the narrative, as the scientists grapple with the moral implications of their discoveries. The film portrays these dilemmas with sensitivity and respect for historical accuracy. It does not shy away from showing the internal conflicts faced by the characters, allowing us to witness the torment of brilliant minds as they weigh the potential for destruction against the potential for innovation.

enthralling, mesmerizing representation of an era that I and my brothers were likely born of. My father was military and his job was ""classified"" so we never knew the details of events that shaped our lives. 
Excellent cast, beautifully filmed and directed. Oscar worthy in every respect.
I have been drawn to see it again and again, 3 hrs feels like a single moment in time.",POSITIVE
"Aug 13, 2023",Great sound experience.,POSITIVE
"Aug 13, 2023","Oversimplified. A movie that focuses more on affecting your senses rather than giving you time (and quiet) to reflect on the relative pros and cons of each character's perspective.

Very little focus on the science.
Rapid jumps and editing that never allow for a moment of thought or consideration.  Any lapse in visual movement or dialogue is necessarily interrupted by cacophony. 

A huge disappointment.",NEGATIVE

"Aug 13, 2023",Big fan of the film. Sick audio design and a divine performance by Cillian Murphy.,POSITIVE

"Aug 13, 2023",What a wonder representation to look back into history and see what decisions were made that made history!,POSITIVE
"Aug 13, 2023","In my opinion, it's Nolan's greatest film thus far, and my personal favorite movie in general. It's a very impactful visceral experience that makes you feel strong emotions of awe, concern and wonder. You think and feel about humanity throughout the film and it's difficult to stop thinking about these feelings after you leave the theater. The actors and story remind you what it means to be human, with people's everyday emotions and feelings like calm, hope, love, glamour, lust, sadness, empathy, jealousy, chaos and hatred. Yet you also feel the immense fragility of humanity due to our potential for barbarism, conspiracy and self-destruction at the level of the atomic bomb, while also feeling awe for our ingenuity, intelligence and glamour in our scientific and artistic pursuits in life. These contradictory feelings of the nature of human life are interwoven with each other and it makes you ponder how complex, beautiful, serious, grandiose, important and precious our lives are. The film is made all the more potent once you realize all of this, developing and using atomic bomb, and for the most part, happened, and this is who we are, and you are viewing, to some extent, reality, when you watch the bomb explode and observe the human circumstances arround it. Cillian Murphy does a great job as Dr. Oppenheimer, as do the others. I highly recommend seeing it in Imax to get a bigger screen and a louder Soundsystem to fully enjoy what I believe is a once in a lifetime achievement in cinematography, acting, soundtrack and sound editing.",POSITIVE
"Aug 13, 2023",I just didn't like that there's a lot of dialogue (long interviews in some scenes),POSITIVE
"Aug 13, 2023",I liked the acting and the visual effects for Oppenheimers mind.,POSITIVE
"Aug 13, 2023","Movie was way to long, damn near fell asleep and yet at the same time shit felt like it was moving in 3x speed. Hella famous actors and I didn't give a shit about a single one of their characters except for Oppenheimer and Robert Downey Jr (don't even remember dudes name that's how forgettable this shit was) only even remotely exciting part was bomb explosion and the trial at the end and even that felt like it was fucking pointless as the movie ends and has no fucking consequences on the characters. Overall most overrated overhyped movie of the year, only reason it's score is so high is cause hella famous actors and people don't know how to get Christopher Nolan's dick out they mouth.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 13, 2023",Too much dialogue and not enough action. It was very difficult to follow the plot.,NEGATIVE
"Aug 13, 2023","Too long, too boring, and it focused almost completely on McCarthyism.  I thought it was going to be an action movie, but it totally sucked.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 13, 2023",This movie was engrossing in a way that the unexpected creeps up on you as if it is unattainable. The science included in this movie is not only quintessential but a standard for movies of this caliber. I could not recommend Oppenheimer more.,POSITIVE
"Aug 13, 2023",Great behind the scenes details - what 1940s America did not know and what games the politicians have always played.,POSITIVE
"Aug 13, 2023","Very well acted and well told. Also very long, and the final third of the movie is the most emotionally involving. As someone who is pretty much the anthithesis of a physicist, I wish some of the science had been explained better.",POSITIVE

"Aug 13, 2023","Great job on the recreation of the homes, offices, desert scenes, clothing, etc..  the story was a bit hard to follow, but I had heard that before I saw the movie.  So I particularly paid attention to details.    A BIG OOPS that I caught was the night before the big test it was raining heavily.  Then he sai ""it's letting up, it's a GI for 5:59"".  Then the next scene showed the men putting mats on the DRY DESSERT.  Everywhere was totally dry!",POSITIVE
"Aug 13, 2023","Knowing my 11 and 16 year old grandchildren were wanting to see the movie, I was appalled at the graphic and unnecessary sex scenes in Oppenheimer. The fact that Oppenheimer was a womanizer who betrayed his wife and children in pursuit of his own selfish agenda could have been relayed without the multiple, close-up, detailed sex scenes. They were completely inappropriate for minors. I was outraged. This story has merit and there is certainly a place in history to tell it, but this was not it. The development of this historic, daunting weapon and the moral conflict it presents to humanity were lost in the amoral lifestyle infecting the true story.  Two thumb down. Do not take minors to see this movie.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 13, 2023",One of the best films I‚Äôve seen in years. Nolan sets up the story so well you are intrigued and entertained the entire film.,POSITIVE
"Aug 13, 2023","I don't have words to describe how wonderful is this masterpiece, very recomended to everyone that knows what cinema is",POSITIVE
"Aug 13, 2023","I love the movie, a rare movie without non-stop action, but what makes it great is the actors play.  
AMC simply destroyed enjoying  the movie  with the Dolby experience, which simply generates unbearable noise, but does not improve sound quality.  the special effects overwhelm dialogs, so these are hard to follow, the sound level is painful.",POSITIVE

"Aug 13, 2023","excellent film. Loved lead character the most. Did a great job. The conflict for Oppenheimer near the end for building something that could stop the war vs killing thousands of innocent people and destroying lands  was intense. Having read Bill O'Reilly's book, ""The Day the World Went Nuclear"" and ""Killing the rising Sun"", it really helped clarify so much of WWII that my dad fought in. The IMAX theatre in AZ Mills, the music was so loud I couldn't always hear the words spoken. GREAT FILM-sends a message and also presents WWII to young people.  Thanks so much!",POSITIVE
"Aug 13, 2023","Explosive!!!
A very well put together historical docudrama. A great cast and acting, cinematography, special effects, soundtrack and costumes all first rate. If you like science and physics you will enjoy this movie even more. It went a little overboard on the sex scenes however staying true to history I guess Mr Oppenheimer was oppenhorny. I would have liked to see a few more explosions, maybe an H-Bomb test which would have fit into the historical timelines. If you're seeing this on the big screen plan for a full three hours so I don't recommend any super big gulps. Enjoy!!!",POSITIVE
"Aug 13, 2023",Excellent! Definitely an Award Winner.,POSITIVE
"Aug 13, 2023",Great story and well acted!,POSITIVE
"Aug 13, 2023","Possibly the best movie I ever saw!! If you can pay close attention to it for 3 solid hours, I highly recommend it.",POSITIVE
"Aug 13, 2023",Telling the story through the lens of Oppenheimer's later life political challenges was unexpected but added a level of intensity that made the story come alive.,POSITIVE
"Aug 13, 2023",The sound effect presentation was so overpowering it was painful.,NEGATIVE
"Aug 13, 2023","Great visuals and cinematography from Nolan as usual. Acting is great, directing was good. Here again I wish Nolan, of whom I'm a huge fan, would use a co-writer or editor (Jonathan). The storyline isn't clear at times, and some of the impact of the story I think gets lost due to overly-theatrical effects (thundering foot-stomps, blinding white lights, etc,) used to portray Oppenheimer's traumatized state. It's a not very subtle; Cilian's acting was good enough to stand on its own without the effects being so dramatic. The movie could also have lost about 20 minutes without losing the story if it were more compact.

But I'm being overly critical because I like Nolan so much. Also, the digital IMAX theater that I saw it in was VERY loud (even normal dialog scenes were like listening to TV alongside someone very hard of hearing -- very loud), and the screen wasn't that big, even though it was the IMAX format. Anyway, it's a great story and film, and several Oscar nods for suire. Nolan's overindulgence in dramatics works when he's doing action films like Tenet, but here it's sometimes a bit much.",POSITIVE
"Aug 13, 2023",Best movie ever. Opened up my eye to what humans can really do if they just wonder. Great job Cristopher Nolan.,POSITIVE
"Aug 13, 2023","First, the movie was 45 minutes too long. While I was watching quantum mechanics I started to wi see what I was watching. I thought cinematography beautiful - acting terrific- the use of music to move it along brilliant. I am annoyed that this is 3rd Chris Nolan movie that I have gone to and can't hear half of the dialog. I find that extremely annoying especially since it is pivotal to the story. I also thought the congressional hearing about Strauss was too much. The film felt ""self important"" and didn't give a crap if the audience enjoyed it- so again I was annoyed with Chris Nolan grandiose attitude about himself. I think the movie would have been a bigger success if they cut out 45 minutes of unnecessary stuff that became confusing and bogged down the story.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 13, 2023","It's not often that a movie lasting just over three hours will not see you consulting your watch to see how much longer you must remain seated, popcorn notwithstanding. Oppenheimer is such a movie. The complex, mesmerizing, and touching story of the ""father of the atomic bomb"" is well-deserving of the positive reviews it had received (along with Barbie, but that's for another day). The storyline is hypnotic and the viewer is transported dynamically in time to the middle of WW2, the postwar nuclear threat, and the McCarthy era persecution that left an indelible scar in American history. 

The acting is outstanding with Irish actor Cillian Murphy delivering a performance that felt more like a documentary than a flick. His sincere personification of the lead character is flawless, and the same is true of Emily Blount (Kitty), and Robert Downey Jr. (Lewis Strauss). The interaction of all these historical figures, thanks to this awesome cast, is simply amazing and committed.

I don't know how many Academy Award nominations Oppenheimer will receive, much less how many it will actually win, but its contribution to the film industry will be certainly an atomic blast.",POSITIVE
"Aug 13, 2023","Awesome acting by Cillian,  good screen play and cinematography",POSITIVE
"Aug 13, 2023","I would have given this movie 4.5 stars if the volume turned down or removal of the damn music soundtrack in the first hour of the movie. You couldn't hear the dialog over the soundtrack. I know this is classic Chris Nolan ""Must have deep and overly loud engaging music at all times in the movie"" but come on. It was a really good movie if.... most of the soundtrack was removed.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 13, 2023",Go see it in 70mm. 100% worth it.,POSITIVE
"Aug 13, 2023","Great telling of an event that has changed so many lives, very well done !",POSITIVE
"Aug 12, 2023",Based on a true story - great details and realistic. I didn't remember all those details from history class.,POSITIVE
"Aug 12, 2023","This movie is easily the best movie I‚Äôve seen this year so far. Nolan never fails to amaze me with how well he makes a film. We are able to see the Americans view on Oppenheimer with them praising him for what he has contributed to help end the war with the creation of the Nuclear Bomb ‚ÄúTrinity‚Äù, but then we also see Oppenheimer‚Äôs point of view where he is conflicted with his creation that is the Nuclear Bomb. Not to mention Cillian‚Äôs performance was absolutely incredible as well as the rest of this star studded cast. This is easily one of my favorite films of all time. There is much more to see in this film, but this is just one of the topics that is included in this well made Biopic of the ‚ÄúFather of the Atomic Bomb‚Äù, J. Robert Oppenheimer.

"Aug 12, 2023",Very well done film - but didn't need three hours to tell the story.,POSITIVE

"Aug 12, 2023","Christopher Nolan you've done it again you legendary son of a Bitch. This was my most anticipated of the year and holy crap it did not disappoint me at all. This film was one of Christopher Nolan's biggest movie in my opinion. Everything from the grand story to the grand cast. The amazing sounds to the amazing visuals. The incredible cinematography to the insane visuals. This movie is just phenomenal, it ticks all the boxes. It is incredible how Christopher Nolan makes these films practically it really is just a well deserved break from the CGI heavy films. The cast again is phenomenal. Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Emily Blunt, Gary Oldman, but in particular Robert Downey Jr giving an Oscar Worthy performance and of course Cillian Murphy also gives his best ever performance.

"Aug 12, 2023","Ultimately tedious, and depressing. Three hours of the banality of evil and celebrity cameos. Almost no historical or cultural context -- tunnel vision -- but in addition, the main character's internal life never became coherent, emotionally or intellectually. The few women and children were, for the most part, nightmarish and two dimensional. At least three other new films I've seen this year were more thought-provoking and more beautiful.",NEGATIVE

"Aug 12, 2023","Seen it 3 times in iMAX theaters! Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece. The film stands tall this year, setting a new standard for storytelling and visual artistry. With Cillian Murphy delivering a mesmerizing performance as the titular character, this biopic transcends the genre, leaving an indelible mark on the world of cinema.
Nolan's signature narrative complexity is on full display, seamlessly weaving together Oppenheimer's personal journey with the profound historical events of the Manhattan Project. The film doesn't merely recount history; it invites the audience to immerse themselves in the moral and ethical dilemmas faced by Oppenheimer and his colleagues. Through its meticulous attention to detail and historical accuracy, Oppenheimer brings the past to life, making us question the price of scientific progress and the consequences of our choices.
Cillian Murphy's portrayal of Oppenheimer is nothing short of extraordinary. His ability to capture the physicist's inner turmoil, intelligence, and humanity is a testament to his acting prowess. Murphy's performance, in and of itself, is awe-inspiring, infusing the character with a captivating and emotionally profound depth. 
Oppenheimer is a thought-provoking film that transcends its genre. It delves into the complexities of human nature and the consequences of scientific discovery, leaving the audience with lingering questions about the moral fabric of our world. The film's dialogue is sharp and thought-provoking, inviting discussions long after the credits roll.
In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" is the epitome of what cinema can achieve. It combines remarkable performances, masterful storytelling, and breathtaking visuals, and an outstanding Oscar worthy soundtrack by Ludwig G√∂ransson, to create an unforgettable cinematic experience. Christopher Nolan's direction, coupled with Cillian Murphy's brilliant portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer, makes this film a true masterpiece. Without a doubt, Oppenheimer is not only the best film of the year but a timeless work of art that will be celebrated for generations to come.",POSITIVE

It was the quickest three hours I have spent in a long time.",POSITIVE
"Aug 12, 2023",Another movie where Hollywood lets its writers go rogue! Story has little to nothing to do with the bomb. The first hour is about infidelity. It's such a disservice to the real history of what's important it's insane. If you want to hear Hans Zimmer style music why they do cut scenes of black holes every 5 minutes go for it but I'm telling you the movie is fucking horrible and not worth 3 seconds much less 3 hours of your time.

"Aug 12, 2023","Oppenheimer was a very powerful movie.  It contained absolutely first rate acting and explored issues of nuclear war, moral responsibility, scientific ethics, and the challenges of being a conscientious objector.  It was long, at three hours, but the story line demanded it.",POSITIVE
"Aug 12, 2023",Too many editorial license screens where for the sake of a screen play story the director/producer/etc.  went in a sensational direction.  The inaccurate screen about President Truman was a gag fest.  Overall an entertaining movie - overly long though.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 12, 2023",We left before the movie ended as we were hopelessly lost on what was going on. The sound track was so bad...we could not hear the dialog over the music and often missed what was being said even without the loud music....what the heck??,NEGATIVE
"Aug 12, 2023",I wanted to like this movie but it was long an boring. It jumped around and was hard to follow. I was more about how Oppenheimer was used and then accused of being a Communist and very little about the development of the A bomb. If you really want to see an awesome movie about the subject rent the movie Fat Man and Little Boy. That was a great movie. I would pass on this one.,NEGATIVE

Could not be better",POSITIVE
"Aug 12, 2023","IMAX, recommended by Nolan, truly spoiled this movie: it was unbelievably loud.  If you see this movie, go for a conventional showing. Also arrive 30 minutes late as the trailers were truly disturbing and outrageous. Otherwise a very nice movie: some aspects a little counterfactual, and it would have been nice if some of the scientists were labeled. Ill watch it again on my tv.",POSITIVE
"Aug 12, 2023","This is an overlong snooze fest. The saving grace are brilliant performances from Robert Downey, Jr , Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Cillian Murphy is a one-dimensional Oppenheimer, and doesn't create interest. The direction is fine, but there are stodgy scenes that drag on forever. A cure for insomnia with brilliant actors.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 12, 2023","Finally saw it in IMAX 70mm, well made film. Performance from the cast was superb & pacing steady.",POSITIVE
"Aug 12, 2023",We loved the way the entire story is told thru the AEC hearing.,POSITIVE
"Aug 12, 2023","Great acting.  The background music/noise made hearing dialog difficult.  It was hard to identify different characters (except Einstein, of course.  But, the unseen bongo player had to be Feynman).  It would have been helpful if they had flashed a name up on the screen the first time each character appeared.  The story line moved back and forth which made it confusing at times.  Now, not a criticism of the movie, but the theater had the sound volume up WAY too high!",NEGATIVE
"Aug 12, 2023","OPPENHEIMER is the monumental work that cinema needed. Christopher Nolan has made the least 'Nolan' of his films, but nothing could be further from the truth, it is one of his best. The grandeur of every scene takes your breath away, where the anxiety generated by its visuals is one of the best experiences I've had in a movie theater this year. Cillian Murphy is the actor of 2023, but Robert Downey Jr. has a clean path to win 'Supporting Actor'. While I think I need another viewing to appreciate it even more, this film is going to stick in our minds for years to come.",POSITIVE

"Aug 12, 2023","The parallel editing and disjointed scenes, manipulating present time with past and future really annoyed me. I hate this film. It's so long. I don't feel anything for the main character. Music from beginning until the end.
Cillian Murphy was my favorite and that's it. 1 start only for him. I hate this movie. Pretentious. Nolan was too show he's smarter then anyone but actually he doesn't know what he's doing.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 12, 2023","Great cinemetography yet overdone, overpriced, and overly political. Went for an enhanced history experience, left paying $40 for Christopher Nolan's political opinion.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 12, 2023","Another epic movie from Nolan. Whilst the concept of time is less highlighted in this movie it is still present: the impact of men on the world. The decisions made in a mans lifespan (short) compared to their impact in the longrun. The impact on the psychic as well. What a man wants to leave as a footprint versus what the society decides what will be the memory.
The image of murphy close to the bomb trying to ""listen to the music"" behind the math and the silence during the explosion‚Ä¶epic
The performance of actors are scandalous.Murphy is at its best in line with the performance on peaky blinders and even better. 
The complexity of the movie are in the details-one of nolans best work",POSITIVE
"Aug 12, 2023","This movie has surpassed every expectation I had going into that theatre. From the beautifully executed performances and visuals, the historic accuracy is what truly stuck out to me. As did the main parallel between Strauss and Oppie. This film is a must watch, whether it's on TV or theaters. The whole world should take notice and be exposed to the strong, meaningful messages that come out this phenomenal film. This is truly a once in a lifetime film that Christopher Nolan has blessed us with, and a film that sends u off with a question that'll be talked about as long as men can talk . Truly outstanding and I believe this film will go down as one of the greats, and for sure Christopher Nolan's best.",POSITIVE
"Aug 12, 2023","The acting was quite good but the pacing was on par with someone with severe ADHD.  The director chose to pack as much dialogue as possible but with an emphasis on neurotic editing.  There were constant scene changes, dramatic sound effects and parallel timelines that left me with vertigo.  I'm not sure if they wanted the extra hour for historical accuracy or because half of Hollywood wanted a cameo.  If you do see it, wait for streaming so you can take a bathroom break (3 hours long) and you may wanna rewind some scenes because at some point, you will lose your place and your mind and will not know what the hell is going on.",NEUTRAL

"Aug 12, 2023",It added a lot of understanding to what was happening in postwar and mid century American politics.,POSITIVE
"Aug 12, 2023","Way longer than it should of been. The movie was honestly boring. The characters were unlikable. The bomb felt like a subplot. If Nolan had wanted to make this film r why not show the actual bombing of Hiroshima. It would of made the movie far more entertaining. After the test bomb went off it was another hour or more of sitting around talking. Everyone said the bomb scene was cool, but it was really just some fire, nothing really special. I like Nolan movies but as I say I the theater I found myself pleading for it to be over.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 12, 2023","Really well made. Historical dramas can go either way but this film stuck mainly to what could be verified as to what actually happened. Easy prediction for Oscar nominations in several categories including all the main ones, Best Film, director, actor, actress, etc.",POSITIVE
"Aug 12, 2023","This is a terrific film!  I hope that Christopher Nolan wins an Oscar for best film, and Robert Downey Jr. finally wins an Oscar for his acting.  It is an important film that should be seen by everyone who cares about the threat posed by nuclear weapons.  I read the book, American Prometheus,  which the movie is based on.

"Aug 12, 2023",It is a long 3 hour movie and life of Oppenheimer is done in a disjointed method with playbacks of his past in top of the present The making of Atomic bomb  is mainly on a superficial level without much of the emphasis of team effort originally portrayed better in Fat Man Little Boy by Paul Newman in 1989 Last hour is the more interesting part but people would not be interested in Oppenheimers story that much Robert Downey and Cilian Murphy give excellent performance Emily Blount role is superfluous and not well done,NEUTRAL

"Aug 12, 2023",Very powerful movie. A must see in the theatre for the full experience. One of the best leading performances I have seen.,POSITIVE
"Aug 12, 2023","Oppenheimer was everything you would expect a Nolan biopic to be‚Äî an incredibly well-laid-out story, an even more incredible cast, fantastic cinematography, and more. 

That final ""half"" star not being ticked by me is because of the intangibles that truly make a movie worth sitting down and watching‚Äî the experience while watching the film and the moments after you walk away and sit with them for a bit privately. 

This is not to say that I did not walk away feeling and thinking a multitude of things (Especially on a topic as large as the dropping of the first Atomic Bomb(s) and the implications that have had for our species), but through my reflections, it did, at times, make me nostalgic for other films that Nolan has put together‚Äî such as Inception, Tenet, or even Memento. 

I think it is worth the 3-hour run time, and if you are a fan of Nolan's work and overall history and film in general, just be prepared to not necessarily feel the same ""it"" factor you felt when leaving the theatre after Inception. Either way, I recommend going to the theatre‚Äî you won't regret it.",POSITIVE

"Aug 12, 2023","I went in knowing what I know by studying history. I left, vary upset and REALLY SEEING the world in a different light.

"Aug 11, 2023","What's all the hype. Tried too hard, used weird special sound effects and black and white to try and make it something special. It was OK. Not something I would go see again, but worth the ticket price.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 11, 2023","I read the book - so I was not in a real hurry to see what Nolan had done with it. I know he is a great Director, but his films are never my cup of tea, so to say.

But with this one, Christopher Nolan did a amazing job. He did a difficult thing, He brought a complicated book to life on screen. It is pretty true to the novel ""American Prometheus"" a tough thing to do I would think. Because of Nolan's care to the book, it is long, but well worth the time. 

Great cast and moves along well. I walk away very please - One of the better films of the year without a doubt. I believe we will see Christopher Nolan at the Oscars this year.",POSITIVE

"Aug 11, 2023","Jumped around a lot in true Christopher Nolan style telling multiple stories at once that inevitably come together in the end. Mountains of dialogue and really disappointing FX. It really is mostly talking for 3 hours - and the dialogue was pretty muffled.

I may watch it again but I was restless by the end and long done with it - 2 hours would have made it more enjoyable. It was building up to a clever ending but I just wanted it to finish - was too jaded by then to enjoy it.",NEUTRAL

"Aug 11, 2023","80% of the movie is in a meeting room, courtroom, or testimony.  There is one quick explosion.  
Take note that this is a very adult movie with a lot of serious high-brow conversation.
I think it's an average movie, very much overhyped.  Really doesn't need to be seen on the big-screen since it's just a lot of meeting rooms.",NEGATIVE

"Aug 11, 2023",Good Historical Account. Well made Movie overall. ,POSITIVE
"Aug 11, 2023",The movie was phenomenal! Don't wait to see it on the small screen - it's a must see on the big screen! Robert Downey Junior and Cillian Murphy should be shoe-ins for Oscars. The only 3-hour movie I've ever watched that never once seemed slow - felt like 2 hours long.,POSITIVE
"Aug 11, 2023","Solid biography with a good cast. Dialog a bit muffled at times and at times the sound effects were quite loud. I found the plot a bit muddled‚Äînot knowing who the characters were or their roles and the time jumps between present and past did not help with that. Probably not necessary to see in an IMAX theater. Politically, it underplayed the fact Japan was willing to surrender with the same terms before we dropped the bomb as they did after the bomb, so Truman and all those who advised him to drop the bombs on civilian targets are war criminals, in my opinion.",POSITIVE
"Aug 11, 2023","It was a real and very interesting story.  Oppenheimer was caught up in the science and proving what could be done, but the lasting moral effects haunted him for the rest of his life.  Our government was not nice to him.

The movie has caused me to learn more on the situation.  Im reading a wonderful book titled 109 East Palace by Jennet Conant",POSITIVE

"Aug 11, 2023",A good critical review of his mind while developing the A-bomb.,POSITIVE
"Aug 11, 2023",Visuals & audio were outstanding from the Imax 70mm theatre. Loved the wonder of this historical look into the race to get the atomic bomb before the Germans and Hitler. It's shameful how Oppenheimer was treated after the bomb proved to be successful. Just think of how history would have changed if the Nazi's had developed the bomb 1st.,POSITIVE

"Aug 11, 2023","I went to this movie expecting to see a historical account of the development of the Atomic bomb, but I learned nothing that was substantive or meaningful.  Unless they knew the story beforehand most people would probably not get much out of the movie. The dialog was very difficult to hear and follow. Shifting timelines served only to blur the realities of history. Acting was great, but the visuals were awful. A teenager with a smart phone camera and a few firecrackers could have done a better job of portraying the awesome power of the test explosion. 

I watched the movie on a Thursday night and the audience was sparse (about 25), but the the best way of summarizing my opinion of the movie is to note that that 20 percent of the audience left before the end",NEGATIVE
"Aug 11, 2023","I found it very difficult to hear many of the conversations.  I don't know if it was the audio quality of the film or the acoustics in the theater.  Personally, I have never really cared for films, nor books for that matter, that constantly are flashing back and then current, etc.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 11, 2023","Genuinely enjoyed Oppenheimer. Initially I thought the Barbenheimer hype was just a marketing ploy but certainly Oppenheimer is as good a film I have seen in years. Interesting and dramatic plot with a great cast and with enough political/historical sub plots to keep you engaged for, what doesn't really feel like, 3hrs+.",POSITIVE
"Aug 11, 2023","I saw a few negative reviews so wanted to share my opinion- I think this is Nolan's best work, and one of the best films I have seen in years. Nolan clearly borrowed heavily from the character development and audio/visual storytelling gained working on Dark Knight, Dunkirk, Inception and Interstellar. However, I think Oppenheimer stands apart. What negative reviews seem to be missing is this is a difficult story to tell- is there an equally captivating movie about such a complicated story? Nolan brilliantly weaves physics, politics, love, loss, triumph, fear and regret into a colossal tragedy, that somehow returns to a simple message. The performances by Murphy, Blunt, Damon and Downey Jr are superb, and Gary Oldman as an un remorseful Truman is haunting. I'll admit my first thought after watching was ""that's too much for American audiences to handle"" but I've been happy to mostly be proven wrong. Oppenheimer is a gut wrenching, tear jerking masterpiece, with an audio/visual experience that is rivaled by 2001 and few others. Unlike 2001 instead of classical music there is a unique score, which adds to the emotion of the film and downright disturbing ending. Hopefully many more people watch and rethink the world around us and our place within it.",POSITIVE
"Aug 11, 2023",Brilliant. I'm not a big Christopher Nolan fan. I like the Batman films but find a lot of his movies to be style and technique over substance. And usually with poor sound. Not this time. An excellent movie.,POSITIVE

"Aug 11, 2023","Such a great movie, on my seat the whole time.",POSITIVE
"Aug 11, 2023","Very long, time jumped back and forth. We were confused much of the time, in part because the music was so loud and the dialogue was muffled.  Much of the movie is focused on Oppenheimer's personality development and behavior, and is sad and depressing. We wished we could have learned much more about the development of the project. Really didn't care about his personal life to be honest, and as with much of what people say about others, it might not even be entirely accurate.  The best part was the actual test of the first bomb at Los Alamos.  We wish we had seen it at home so we could have had intermissions. Really did not need to be in Imax as we were told.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 11, 2023","Gravity and gravitas. 

Nolan's latest masterpiece captures gravity in its many forms. Yet it is the gravitas of Cillian Murphy and the stellar cast that keep this movie engaging throughout. Through the close-up lens we see the weight of the terrible task undertaken, the heaviness of dire choices. The soundscape too has a density, allowing Nolan to deftly use silence to devastating effect. I was unaware of the story behind Oppenheimer and the atomic bomb, so I won't spoil the surprise for those who are unaware. 

I marvelled at the visuals that conveyed both the complex scientific concepts as well as the emotions swirling around the oddly charismatic and deep Oppenheimer. The use of humour sprinkled in just enough scenes helped keep relieve the tension as my mind raced at the enormity of this endeavour. 

Gravity. The weight of consequence. Experience it for yourself.",POSITIVE

"Aug 11, 2023","The best broad-audience film I've seen in het past decade. Recommended to read into Oppenheimer before attending. 

It requires 100% of your attention (for 3 hours!), and like most Nolan films, it gets you to think. Think about moral dilemma's, personal relations, and historical (in)justice that's been done. And it does so beautifully. Absolute must see for anyone interested in history, science and morality. The film probably fares less on home-screens rather than cinema's due to the immersive sound effects.",POSITIVE

"Aug 11, 2023","It's not really a movie but more like a 2+ hour trailer/recap of some very long tv series that we'll never see (complete with aggressively intrusive, wall-to-wall music), followed by a 45 min finale episode where the themes of hubris and mutually assured destruction are repeated to a conclusion. Murphy and Downey are great but they're the only actors allowed to carry a scene or develop a full character. Plus some silly inaccuracies that feel insensitive if not inadvisable. Overall, it's less insightful about the subject matter than the tv show ""Manhattan"".",NEGATIVE

"Aug 11, 2023","It's good. Very well done from a production point of view. Definitely more artsy than dramatic. It's very much a typical Nolan movie in its good and bad parts. It could and should have been shorter, though, I found it very strenuous to watch from 8:30pm to 11:30pm. Minor Spoiler: Also, I think the atomic bomb exploding should have been closer towards the end as it feels like such an emotional climax that you get frustrated the movie isn't remotely over after it. Overall I'd recommend it and even watch again.",POSITIVE
"Aug 11, 2023","The story about Oppenheimer was so much more than I expected, as I haven't read the book yet. The way the movie intertwined past and future drawing to and away from the Manhattan Project and Trinity test as the central event reminded me of Dunkirk. The actors in this film continuously surprised, as I hadn't predetermine most of the cast. The IMAX picture was stunning. The message at the end given by Oppenheimer should be a reminder to all that there are still over 1,000 intercontinental ballistic missiles ready for deployment in the United States and other countries.",POSITIVE
"Aug 11, 2023","Just when I thought I had a mental grasp of what it must have felt like to be part of the Manhattan Project, Christopher Nolan fills in the gaps with an emotion I didn't know I could have without being there.

"Aug 11, 2023","Nolan's symphony to Oppenheimer set against the backdrop of a war and creation of the atom bomb; a devastating global reset; probably the most significant in history. A complex subject, a complex man, a complex time beautifully acted and directed.  A challenging, smart movie for anyone who likes to engage their brain!  Probably not the whole truth (it's still Hollywood after all) but certainly inspired me to uncover more about the man.",POSITIVE
"Aug 11, 2023",Absolutely incredible spectacle. This is Christopher Nolan at his best.,POSITIVE
"Aug 11, 2023","Amazing movie. Perhaps a bit to extense. is like watching 2 movies glued together, 1 of the creation of the atomic bomb and another (parte 2) of the politic consequences of that achivement, but still, an amazing movie, with a solid theme that isn't so usual in cinema nowadays. When watching it i felt that i was watching another mini series like chernobyl. Recomend it 100% both.",POSITIVE

"Aug 10, 2023","The sheer criticality that Christopher Nolan applies to this wonderful masterpiece of cinema. The masterful performance by Cillian Murphy has surely cemented his place among active lead men in American cinema. The love tension between Murphy and Florence Pugh adds critically to the story and allegations of how much of a womanizer Oppenheimer was. A beautiful story, must watch.",POSITIVE

I didn‚Äôt have to pee until about 2:35:00 and still managed to hold it until after the movie was finished, which felt like an accomplishment in and of itself.

"Aug 10, 2023","Very intense, captivating  movie, not just topic matter & special visual effects, but the quality of the acting, the sound/music component, & the way it was filmed. Many well known actors in film but they completely disappeared into character. The background music told a story of its own & complimented the scenes so much & well that I felt like I was watching a high paced action movie. Also lending to this action movie-esque quality was how the movie was filmed- short faced-paced but impactful scenes and seamlessly & effectively moving between different time periods.  I was glued to my seat the whole time (to my surprise) despite this being a historical piece about a well known topic which I expected to detract from my enjoyment. I was surprised (& sad) when the movie ended because I couldnt believe 3 hrs had gone by & I was so drawn in by the characters, music, & filming of this outstanding movie.",POSITIVE
"Aug 10, 2023",Loved the editing in this film they knew how to incorporate sound and vision where it compliments each other and the actors in this film also shined extremely. I took my two sisters then we another time with my friend and even the second time I lived it where I would even go again,POSITIVE

"Aug 10, 2023",This film is a masterclass in directing. Captivating story and characters told in a creative manner. Just starts to drag at the end.,POSITIVE
"Aug 10, 2023","Really didn't like it because it seemed so disjointed. Acting was good, but that was about all I can say for it. It was drawn out over 3 hours. They could have done it in half that time. My advice, don't bother, a waste of money as far as I'm concerned.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 10, 2023","While it doesn't have the action scenes you'd think are required to see on the largest screens, the wonderful cinematography here makes seeing this in a 1.43:1 IMAX GT theatre worth trying for. Whether it's IMAX 70mm or IMAX GT Laser, you'll enjoy the immersive world of 1940s Los Alamos and other locations beautifully captured by Hoyte and Nolan. The life of Oppenheimer is freshly presented and the entire cast is on form. I could easily see Oscar nominations for Blunt, Downey and the brilliant Cillian Murphy. Another home run for Nolan and his team, an even bigger win for the magic of film for those lucky enough to see this in IMAX 70mm, 70mm or 35mm.",POSITIVE
"Aug 10, 2023",SO great to see a none super hero movie that has me leaving the theaters wishing I could see it all over again for the first time. Christopher Nolan is a generational talent and hits hard with another banger. Also great to see RDJ in his bag for this movie and seeing him prove that he can do more then be Tony Stark.,POSITIVE

"Aug 10, 2023","I'm a history lover but didn't know much about the Manhattan Project. This movie is a crash course about how the atomic bomb came about and J. Robert Oppenheimer's role in it. Cillian Murphy kills it in the lead role. I also loved Robert Downy, Jr.‚Äòs part-he reminded me that he is a terrific actor. Don't go if you're thinking it will be lots of bomb explosion shots-it's about a man's remarkable life and the awful things governments can do to the country's heroes if they're imperfect (which they always are). The movie made me interested to learn more, so I've since listened to the book it was based on. Really good stuff!",POSITIVE
"Aug 10, 2023",The movies was intriguing and kept my attention throughout the whole running time. The characters were great and so were the actors. The one issue i had was sometimes i couldnt hear the characters all that well and the polictical drama can drag for about to long. For me it was an easy 4.8 out of 5. It was near perfect for me. Love Christopher Nolan.,POSITIVE
"Aug 10, 2023","I absolutely loved all the acting and cast, how the movie was made and the story. Very very well done. However the extremely loud music, often overpowering and interfering with the actors voices was most annoying and terrible! The music takes badly over something really good. It's a truly sad music match.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 10, 2023","Outstanding!   5 Stars
This film is not a superficial CGI bang bang car chase superhero waste of 2 hours of your life. 
This is a story of one of the greatest minds of the last 500 years and the reason the USA defeated Japan
AND Oppenheimers lifelong nightmare as the Destroyer of Worlds.
The movie helps us understand how humanity can destroy itself in seconds or not!
Oppenheimers paradox, believing in 2 opposites at the same time, creating the Atom Bomb and not wanting to use it affects every person living today.

The director, Chris Nolans, who should get the Directors Academy Award, use of black and white film to explain the timeline was perfect.  The sets and customs nailed it.
The writing was superb. All main actors and supporting cast gave extraordinary performances, a rarity in cinema today.  
Cillian Murphy as Oppy deserves Best Actor and Robert Downey Jr the Best Supporting actor. 
Oppenheimer is excellent entertainment with a message: we have a choice!",POSITIVE
"Aug 10, 2023","This movie played like a history book, with so much intensity and action. Three hours seemed like 30 minutes. I cant rave enough about how wonderful this movie is. Definitely a must see.",POSITIVE
"Aug 10, 2023","I was super excited for this one. But honestly it fell short. Cut scenes, cut scenes and more cut scenes. Einstein was a meme and I was almost laughing when they would just cut to him all of a sudden. Sex scenes were unnecessary to the plot. The RDJ trial was interesting if you like law and order but it just felt unimportant to the greater themes. Honestly wasted my money seeing this.",NEGATIVE

His films are a constant reminder of excellent filmmaking and acting!! Nolan and his entire team have made something extraordinary. If the question is, can a movie about a historical event be thrilling and suspenseful, Oppenheimer makes the answer a resounding Yes!! My husband is currently reading the biography on which this film is based, and he mentioned pretty much everything is exactly like the book! This film elevated my thinking, especially regarding the science of politics and the politics of science. Just so good! And please, give Cillian Murphy all the awards next season, my goodness!! Highly recommend this film! Bravo!! üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª",POSITIVE
"Aug 10, 2023","Intense, operatic, and charged energy all the way through. Did not feel the 3 hour run time, but the film does creak a bit in its third act. Exceptional performances abound, with Emily Blunt and Robert Downey Jr giving brilliant (and at times unrecognizable) portrayals. Every side character surrounds Oppenheimer, who while the very definite focus of the film, is more the vessel with which it seems every other person aims to propel their motivations. The film serves an admirable task serving as a science, personal, war, and political courtroom drama all at once. It surely must be Nolan‚Äôs most dialogue heavy film, but it amps every scene with a beautiful score, gripping set pieces, and Nolans iconic eye for photography and editing. Perhaps the biggest critique in a move like this is the somewhat less than convincing turn in the third act involving a key supporting character, which doesn‚Äôt fully payoff. Undoubtedly this is a cost of having to weave and spotlight so many different characters and threads together.",POSITIVE

"Aug 10, 2023","Christopher Nolan has held us in anticipation for nearly two years, and it has paid off!!!

I think that this is one of the greatest films I have ever seen on my 17 and a half years of my life. Cillian Murphy has filled the shoes of J. Robert Oppenheimer with gravitas. The remaining cast fit themselves right in to their real life counterparts.

Of course, I may be overselling this, but Nolan has used his nearly 3 decades of director expertise to craft an evocative portrayal of the mind of Oppenheimer. With this, combined with the greatest visuals ever, and the captivating and goosebump inducing score of Ludwig G√∂ransson make this movie the must see movie of all time.

Thank you Chrisopher Nolan!",POSITIVE

"Aug 10, 2023","A masterpiece of cinema, Christopher Nolan delivered with genuine sincerity and vigour. 
If Cillian Murphy is denied an Oscar for his haunting portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer, it shall be one of the great injustices in cinema history. The supporting cast was brilliant, especially Emily Blunt. I lost count of the ensemble cast of brilliant actors lining up for a few moments of silver screen time in this 3-hour journey that seemed to flash by. 
Imax certainly does justice to the vision of Nolan, from overwhelming visuals of the sub-atomic world and the expanded universe to the floor-shaking sound effects. The fast-cut scenes have an emotional impact when layered on unforgiving sounds. 
Oppie is a flawed and haunted man, a notion made quite evident from the beginning frames of the movie. He brings the wide-eyed wonder of a child as he journeys around the world in the quest for knowledge, meeting giants of physics upon whose shoulders our modern life rests. In a sense, he goes through a complete anti-hero's journey from naivete, to triumphal power and finally down to defeat, disillusionment and despair. All throughout, we see his constant rationalization and justification of his inevitable march towards becoming the destroyer of worlds. One is torn between sympathy and hatred for this deeply complex genius. 
There are so many cautionary tales in this movie, about moments in history when one could swerve in a noble direction instead of taking humanity to the brink of self-destruction. There are other lessons about the politics and machinations of power and the urgency of avoiding enemies through humiliation. The warnings of Einstein delivered throughout the movie hammer home repeatedly.

"Aug 10, 2023","Three hours flew by as you watch a brilliant man with a brilliant team challenging the boundaries of science while being challenged by the world. Projecting myself, feeling for him, wishing to be him and wishing to never experience his main all come about immediately.",POSITIVE
"Aug 10, 2023",Well made. Loved every effect. Fantastic story,POSITIVE
"Aug 10, 2023","Excellent movieseems pretty factually correct, with a little Hollywood drama and Loud music. Tells a back story about Oppenheimer that few people know. Does an excellent job in presenting the dilemma on whether we should have developed and used nuclear weapons, without really taking a side.",POSITIVE
"Aug 10, 2023","Saw this in the theatre, in IMAX format. Would strongly encourage to see it this way if possible. The sound design shines in moments where Nolan explores Oppenheimer's inner thoughts and the power of an atomic bomb. Surprisingly, given the subject and scope of the film, the lengthy run time goes by rather quickly. Some dialogue is muffled (per usual for Nolan) but it seems as if it may have been intentional in parts. It can be hard to keep all the names, faces, and relationships of the characters straight at times but this is a minor complaint for such a sprawling narrative.",POSITIVE
"Aug 10, 2023","Christopher Nolen is a superb director and I was amazed at how he told this story. The techniques of how the story was shot and edited really moved the narrative along even at a heavy 3 hour pace. Cillian Murphy, who I've seen in several other films was really spectacular and he is the real deal. Plus, Robert Downey Jr. was equally spectacular and was a superb foil to Murphy's Oppenheimer. Just a super film and nothing this year has come close...though that might be pretty easy considering everything else has basically been a Marvel movie. Definitely a MUST see.",POSITIVE
"Aug 10, 2023",The movie started off interesting with awesome sound effect and idea revolving around dieing star.  However the movie extremely boring and revolving around the politics that comes from people holding grudges over a genius who realized the he helped creat the armagedon weapon or at the least start of the possibilities and how he regrets it. It is not worth the time and compare to Inception this movie is showing us what may have happened in history as opposed to awe my brain with intelligence of a complex storyline.  Still not sure why audience would like this movie.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 10, 2023",The name of the movie is oppenheimer. Many of the reviews have discussed to take on the man. My view this wasn't a take on the man at all. He was the vehicle to discuss the complex issue welcome to mass destruction and I suppose in an ancillary way how valuable people are treated by governments that need them.,POSITIVE

"Aug 10, 2023",I really wanted to like this movie. I found myself nodding off about an hour in. The old film Fatman and little boy was a better film. I believe this was overhyped. It was better to watch it at the theater with the captions in order to keep up with what was going on. ,NEGATIVE

"Aug 10, 2023","OK. This was an unbelievable movie experience. This is the best movie Christopher Nolan has ever done. The acting is superb, great performances all round. BUT THE SOUND WAS TOO LOUD. WAY TOO LOUD. I even brought ER 15 earplugs and my ears were still ringing after the show and right now hours later. IT WAS WAY TOO LOUD. It was so loud the speakers were distorting. WAY WAY TOO LOUD.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 10, 2023","I am a Nolan fanboy (haven't watched Dunkirk so I'm a terrible fanboy at that) so my opinion is biased. 
But I thought this was amazing, great acting, great pacing, incredible story telling was on display in this movie. To me, at the basic level, what happens in this movie is boring as shit, just bunch of white men in a room discussing a level of science and math that I'll never be able to comprehend, and yet I was invest, I was glued to the screen. I credit Chris to be able to achieve this, his ability to tell this story was smart, well thought out, and incredibly well executed. 

Only negative I have is IMAX, this was the first film I've watched in IMAX and will probably be the last, it took about half an hour for my nausea to subside since the screen was so big so that hindered my enjoyment a bit. Still loved the movie but next time I'll be watching on a non-IMAX screen",POSITIVE
"Aug 9, 2023","Pros: Great film in terms of filmmaking, and seeing it in the IMAX 70mm was a great experience in terms of sound/visual quality. Also thought the acting was great all around so that is the 5 stars. It's not a depressing movie (all history is depressing) but it's just a heavy movie on a heavy subject matter. 
Cons: Wished Nolan had made more acknowledgements such as showing ""actual"" (or recreated) images of how the atomic bomb actually impacted Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as well as acknowledgements of the history of the Hispanic and Indigenous locals who's land were taken away from them for Los Alamos. It would have been better to also see some present day stats on who has how many atomic bombs because of this, as well as how Oppenheimer lived out the rest of his life (in short summary blurbs).",POSITIVE
"Aug 9, 2023","Great historical information, great cast.",POSITIVE
"Aug 9, 2023","It was a powerful picture, and so compellingly written and filmed. The IMAX experience was exceptional. A very thought-provoking story to start conversations about so many societal issues.",POSITIVE
"Aug 9, 2023","Excellent acting, well known cast, fascinating story based on true accounts.",POSITIVE
"Aug 9, 2023",Interesting story.  Good acting by all chacters. Seemed a little long during some of the technical discussions.  Our theater played the sound way too loud.  Parts of the movie were very uncomfortable because of that loudness.,POSITIVE
"Aug 9, 2023","This movie is just too long and not interesting enough - was tempted to leave multiple times - decided to wait for a grand finale that never arrived. It's a huge disappointment, not sure why there are good reviews for this. Extremely boring, long, repetitive, tedious - not recommended at all",NEGATIVE
"Aug 9, 2023",Movie of the Year. Watching it in the way Nolan intended was definitely worth the wait and effort.,POSITIVE

"Aug 9, 2023","Twice as long as necessary, with no reenactment of bombs landing on Japan. Little scientific detail and overly reliant on lengthy discourse on American politics. Overbearing and disconnected musical score crying out for Zimmerman's genius. Indulgent extended lines for so so many actors seemed excessive and killls the pacing",NEGATIVE

"Aug 9, 2023",Good flick.  A bit long but we found the historical references interesting. Made us want to know more about what went down.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 9, 2023",Christopher Nolan made a movie about one of the greatest crimes against humanity without ever giving the context of it's effect or it's victims and instead made the author of those crimes the innocent and naive pilgrim who became a victim himself,NEUTRAL
"Aug 9, 2023",It was an education on the Manhattan project for those of us that were born after that time period. The acting was superb and I see several Oscar nominations in the making. It was a quick three hours. I highly recommend this film.,POSITIVE
"Aug 9, 2023","The film was ok, the 70mm Imax experience was very good, but I was not happy with the theater. The screen at the King of Prussia, PA theater has a number of bad spots on the screen, so it looked like the actors had warts on their faces. They really need to repair the screen. There was also a light bulb on behind the screen which was very distracting. I can't believe that they left that light on for the entire movie.  Also, the popcorn was cold.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 9, 2023","The movie contained unnecessary sex scenes that could have been left out of the movie and lost any of the story. We, the public and Christians didn't need to know about his sex life. I and my two friends that were with me will not speak well, regarding the movie. Also, the dialogue was drowned out by the loud background music. The movie, overall, we thought was poorly done and didn't hold our interest so therefore, knowing your industry, it will probably be nominated for best picture and sound. From what I'm hearing the movie is not getting much positive ""Word of Mouth"".",NEGATIVE
"Aug 9, 2023","Dramatic foreboding, character development.  Change scene.

Top class performance as you would expect! Could have been so educational/inspirational towards the sciences instead of the plight of the working man.

Was watchable. Obviously will be Oscars for sure. So many esg ticks  üòÇ",NEGATIVE
"Aug 9, 2023",If you can get past the constant and highly intrusive music score you will find it an engrossing film.  It runs three hours.  I'm pretty sure 2 hours and 45 minutes of it have music intruding on what you're trying to watch and listen to.  I think it's one of the worst uses of music I've ever encountered in a film.,NEUTRAL

"Aug 9, 2023","Nolan did it again! He was definitely the man for the job. I couldn't think of anyone that would cover a documentary-like movie on such a complex topic better than him. The main actors were phenomenal and the way they delivered lines just hit the spot for me. I really hope for Cilian to get an Oscar, he definitely deserves one. The cinematography, sound, emotions, everything was there and only added to the quality of the movie. If you have a chance, definitely go and watch it on the big screens while you still can. It is an experience you don't want to miss.",POSITIVE
"Aug 9, 2023","Funnily enough, 3 hours didn't feel too long, but maybe a tiny bit too short. The real-life controversy surrounding Oppenheimer was even more complicated than this film suggests, painting him in a light that might very well be a bit too positive. I also think that this film should have dedicated more time to the controversy of whether dropping the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki was genuinely necessary or if the war could have been won conventionally and the bombs were dropped just for the sake of showing off. It's not like the movie completely ignores this idea but it's giving it a chance to breathe either. I still thoroughly enjoyed my time and was pleasantly surprised that a 3-hour film can not feel too long.",POSITIVE
"Aug 9, 2023","We were very impressed watching this movie.  It was kind of long, but it was worth every minute of our time.",POSITIVE

"Aug 9, 2023","This was one of the movies for which you want to stand up at the end and just clap for two minutes straight. I didn't know much about the history of the atom bomb, but either way, I really enjoyed the movie.

"Aug 9, 2023","This is a mentally intense movie about the man - his mind, his fallacies, his genius, and internal conflicts.

"Aug 9, 2023","Yikes... first of all, this movie was an hour and a half too long. There were way too many characters with foreign names to remember, couldn't even hear all the dialogue over the annoying music that played in every scene, and I don't get all the hype behind having to see this in IMAX. Half the movie is set in a tiny room full of dudes asking each other questions. If it's not one tiny room it's another tiny room with a different set of dudes asking each other questions. RDJ was the saving grace in this movie and the only reason it's getting one star instead of zero. Couldn't pay me to watch it again.",NEGATIVE

"Aug 9, 2023","The trinity test is one of the greatest moment and will be remembered in cinema history. Everyone was so captivated that there was pin drop silence in a fullhouse theatre no munching popcorn, no squeaky chairs nothing. That truly showcases the beauty of the movie.  It's might sound generic but literally all aspects were great and work together so well collectively to tell the story beautifully the visuals, the music, the cinematography... Best biography I've seen hands downs, being historically accurate while also being so much fun and captivating is truly the beauty of Nolan's direction. I'm not being a fanboy but Nolan deserves all the credit here, most of the story is about a single person and he's the person of focus most of the time yet Nolan manages to keep everyone hooked for every single moment of the 3hours. Even after the movie ended I just sat there till after the end of credits and not because the movie felt incomplete but rather because it's truly complete and you're just sitting there thinking through it knowing what a great time you had and acknowledging that's it the movie has ended.

I feel the critique mostly comes from people who lack some basic understanding of the history of The Trinity project , the war and some basic concepts of the bomb.

Would highly recommend to watch veritasium's yt video about oppenheimer which helps a lot.",POSITIVE
"Aug 9, 2023","Very well done movie. The acting was great with a spectacular cast. Captivating story, well directed.",POSITIVE
"Aug 9, 2023","An All-Star cast. Well.. absent was Bruce Willis and Nicolas Cage LOL. 

With a few books that detail much of the same in this movie. Nolan did have some artistic additions. However, some parts where you would think were artistic, where in fact well documented like the Truman scene.

It's a 3-hour movie and some folks from what I gathered didn't like the going back and forth in time. I had no problem with that nor did my wife. 

It is a very good movie very well done actors and actresses all doing their part with excellence.",POSITIVE
"Aug 9, 2023","Great, but not a masterpiece. Tension building leading up to the test detonation was spectacular, but the movie drags for the last hour.",POSITIVE
"Aug 9, 2023","As a writer/director, Christopher Nolan captured attention from his first film ""Following"" (1998), a spare neo-noir thriller, through his contribution to the Batman canon with the Dark Knight trilogy, to innovative mindbenders like ""Inception"" and ""Tenet"" and even historical epics like ""Dunkirk.""  ""Oppenheimer"" may be Nolan's best film to date.
This film is the biography of J. Robert Oppenheimer, ""the father of the atomic bomb."" But rather than focusing solely on Oppenheimer's time as Director of the Manhattan Project, Nolan offers a sweeping epic of Oppenheimer's career, from his early years in academia and left-leaning political circles, through his time directing the efforts to develop the bomb at Los Alamos, to his eventual undoing during the Cold War at the hands of a bureaucrat who was embarrassed by Oppenheimer at a Congressional hearing years before.  In telling this sweeping story, Nolan uses his typical non-linear approach.  (If fairness, he does employ black-and-white flashbacks to give the audience a fighting chance at keeping up.)
In his script, Nolan invokes a wide range of historical figures ‚Äì President Harry Truman, scientists Albert Einstein, Werner Heisenberg (go see the play ""Copenhagen""), Enrico Fermi.  But the film is at its best when it explores the genius and the foibles of its title character (a rail-thin Cillian Murphy ‚Äì TV's ""Peaky Blinders"").  Robert Oppenheimer singlehandedly transformed theoretical physics in the US.  But he also had the leadership skills to effectively manage a group of egotistical world-class scientists at Los Alamos.  Perhaps most important, Oppenheimer had the prescience to understand and lobby against the nuclear arms race he knew his accomplishment would unleash.  But Oppenheimer was also a voracious womanizer, painfully na√Øve about the political consequences of advocating for left-wing causes in the era of Joe McCarthy, irrationally and randomly stubborn and intentionally defenseless when facing a sinister bureaucratic machine.  Nolan addresses this complexity without criticism or judgment.
To convey this story, Nolan relies on much more than his screenplay.  The excellent score by Ludwig G√∂ransson (Oscar for ""Black Panther,"" Emmy for ""The Mandalorian"") regularly employs a disconcerting rumbling noise to denote impending personal disaster as well as the beginning of an atomic reaction.  Cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema (""Nope,"" Nolan's ""Tenet,"" ""Interstellar"" and ""Dunkirk"") creates visual imagery that, while metaphorical, is perhaps more impactful than viewing actual footage of an atomic reaction.  The use, and the elimination, of sound during the first atomic test is unexpected and inspired.  Finally, Nolan's quick cuts and energetic editing create an uneasy sense of cohesion.
Nolan uses ""Oppenheimer"" to do much more than detail the development of the hydrogen bomb.  He does more than effectively convey the full complexity of one of the most important figures of the twentieth century.  From my perspective, Nolan uses his narrative to make some significant, sobering comments about power.  He makes a compelling case that, while individuals and mankind are inescapably drawn to creating and using ultimate power, the arrogance and the singlemindedness of this pursuit simultaneously sow the seeds of our future destruction.
""Oppenheimer"" offers visuals that I'm still replaying in my head.  It conveys ideas that I'm thinking about days after seeing the film.  Christopher Nolan's latest effort may be the most technically complete film that I've seen in the past several years.  It's refreshing to see a powerful story and this level of cinematic sophistication in service of something other than a set of comic book characters.",POSITIVE
"Aug 9, 2023","This was an amazingly shot movie. Most if not all are practically shot without the use of vfx which I find quite amazing when visualising the thought process of Oppenheimer.

I recognised most actors even in small rolls which was quite amazing. Just shows that many actors wanted to be part of this amazing work.

Murphy puts in an amazing performance which so far I expect to do put him in contention for an Oscar for the leading actor position. I also suspect RDJ might walk away with a best supporting actor, if not he should definitely be on the nomination list.

All the actors did a fantastic job. The cinematography was amazing and the direction.

"Aug 9, 2023","Although bolstered by excellent performances and occasional moments of intrigue and excitement, the film is too fussily edited and bound up in its own narrative format to let the viewer fully engage with any of the many themes it presents. An overly bombastic score punctuates each scenes drama with a sledgehammer force that would have naturally occoured if the story presented had been told in a more linear fashion. The end result of the filmmakers drive to fabricate twists and turns and drama through the editing is an underwhelming, and at times, confusing biopic of an objectively terrible person. 

Also, the atom bomb looks like shit. It was the most evil invention ever created, and it looks on screen like close ups of a car fire.",NEGATIVE

"Aug 9, 2023","COM-PELL-ING

Nolan shows, once again, that he is one of the greatest story tellers and film makers of our time. The screenplay brings everything together and it makes a great job of making something that is stereotypically difficult to understand, such as a little thing as theoretical and nuclear phyics, as something that a general audience member could consume by explaining things via marbles and whatnot. On the contrary and simultaneously, Nolan masters the art of plot movement with high stakes scene choreography from different moments in time. 

The main cast completely knocks this movie out of the park. The main 3: Cillian Murphy as the titular character, Emily Blunt as Kitty Oppenheimer and RDJ as Lewis Strauss all KILL their roles. As someone who knew nothing about any of the real life people, I totally bought into what they were selling. Murphy embodies the anxiety induced by guilt in Oppenheimers endeavors. The prometheus comparisons are on par but I'll also include Icarus who flew too close to the Sun, his aspirations to create and evolve physics and truly create something that will change all of mindkind leads him down the path of faux glory and self satisfaction, he goes down this road with blinders on and, sadly, even when he knows he's gone too far, he keeps going. Murphy shows the complexity of man, especially for one such as a scientist who deals with the burden of the ability for change. His performance begs a character study on hubris and capturing knowledge is power, all of that leading to an academy nod would be some nice razzle dazzle as well. 

Emily Blunt holds her own atop this stacked cast, he acting ability is something I've always considered was underrated. She doesn't play a likable character but instead a strong and loyal one. You can tell that through her prowess that she would be someone who Oppenheimer would see as equal to in marriage. RDJ brings his charm and reminds people that he is great at playing real people just as well as himself in his roles. He's slick enough to be a villain and the audience not even know it. If the rest of the cast had been given more time to shine, then obviously the talent in this movie would have risen to the challenge, but at a 3 hour run time I'm glad we got we got for everyone to showcase the importance of their characters in Oppenheimers story. Honorable mention to Matt Damon for making General Leslie Grover, what could have been a single note annoying ass character, someone with layers and motivation.  

Ludwig G√∂rannsson puts his whole üêìin this music! The music makes what would be boring expositional scenes seem like essential and exploding (pun hella intended) climactic acts. The crescendos match the booms of bombs and makes you feel the anxiety that Oppenheimer feels. This, along with the fantastic sound design, makes you feel as if you are there in Los Alamos with the scientists and army people. The use of practical affects show that this form of art isn't dead and can be used efficiently in a realistic sense. I simply can't wait to see the special features to see how the explosions were done, Nolan really feels like he made a brand spankin' new movie with old school methods but still didn't reinvent the wheel. 

This movie is for the cinema lover, for a casual this movie could potentially come across as boring for the runtime alone, especially in a world of action packed superhero movies and Tom Cruise mind fucking stunt flicks. The music and practical effects are really what sold the movie to me as 5 stars, the story is filled with names and events that require you to remember with the quick cutaway flashbacks being used at a minimal rate. The pacing is fine until the 3rd act where there are a few twists that have you think while the story doesn't wait for you. Nolan gives an unforgivingly complex and riveting story of history that truly matters. 

Having this and Barbie in theatres at the same time reminds why cinema truly matters and that all good story telling needs is just good story telling, no matter the genre or medium. This movie was the fucking bomb (pun intended accidentally on purpose) üí£üî•",POSITIVE
"Aug 9, 2023","The greatest movie I have ever witnessed, but not an action nor adventure but intriguing, enticing, and most importantly fearful. And by fearful we see foreshadowing through the phrase, Now I have become death, the destroyer of worlds.",POSITIVE
"Aug 9, 2023","Great performances by everyone, lots of great actors, interesting movie.",POSITIVE
"Aug 9, 2023","Fantastic story-telling. Despite its length, the movie feels fast-paced. The acting is thoroughly superb. 
The last third, however, leaves a somewhat miscarried impression: Throughout the movie one cannot help but think that Nolan is completely in love with his protagonist. He seems to realize this and tries - especially in the movie's last third - to emphasize Oppenheimer's moral ambigutiy in this story. Unfortunately for Nolan, this attempt to provide depth, complexity, and shadiness to his protagonist fails to be convincing when every critic in the movie is sure to add that ""Oppie"" is, of course, ""a genius"" and ""the most important man in the history of mankind"".
It is still a great watch, for entertaining purposes, that is. But it is unsuitable, due to its overall positive potrayal, to act as a reliable basis for a public debate about Oppenheimer's moral integrity. Let's hope it will not be misused this way.",POSITIVE

"Aug 9, 2023","Rated X for sure. Wasnt necessary to have the sex scenes. Didnt go there with my grandkids to learn about sex. 
Thought it would a historical movie. Way to long of a movie. The sex scenes were very disturbing.. at least they should been under the covers. Did he really have sex at the hearing in front of his wife and with everyone watching? 
Disgusting ? Is this history?",NEGATIVE
"Aug 9, 2023","This was a truly awful 3 hours. Once you hear the violin you cant unhear it...no really it is 3 hours of butt clenching tension. Fast paced one line at a time, clip after clip after clip. My wife and I left the movie with tinnitus and headaches. I admit, I learned a lot but I never want to sit through this experience ever again. The actors were saying their lines and it never pulled us into the story, it just felt like actors saying their lines. Fast paced, over and over and over, constant violin back and forth tension, that butt clench and no release until the movie is over and then finally you get to use the bathroom to urinate and complain about how awful it was the entire drive home. I'm sorry, this movie sucks.",NEGATIVE

"Aug 9, 2023","Oppenheimer is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. I went into it knowing it would be decent, but I was slightly worried that it might be a bit slow and perhaps too long. As it turns out though, I couldn't have been more wrong. I have never sat through a movie of such considerable length without being even slightly listless or impatient. The movie had my full attention from start to finish. When I say it is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen, I'm not suggesting that this film is for everyone. However, I believe this work of cinema is worth viewing for everyone, regardless of their preferences in regards to genre, themes, political leanings, or their academic background. I intend to see it again before it leaves theaters and I will try to convince all of my friends and acquaintances that it is worth seeing. The subject matter of this film is of the greatest importance and it is very much worth deep discussions with oneself and others.",POSITIVE

"Aug 9, 2023",Interesting and boring at the same time! I really wanted to leave half way through but stuck it out. Could have left and not missed much. Way too long and way to repetitive. The acting was good but the movie as a whole way over-hyped!,NEUTRAL
"Aug 9, 2023",good movie about bombs,POSITIVE
"Aug 9, 2023",You MUST see it in iMax... Just not the same on a smaller screen!!,POSITIVE
"Aug 9, 2023","Oppenheimer is one of Nolan's weakest films. While the acting and photography were great (and I could hear every line of dialogue), the story was unfocused and was poorly paced. The nudity was wholly unnecessary and felt very contrary to what Nolan has stood for in the past. Robert Downy Jr. stole the show and gave a career-best performance, but his role was significantly larger than ever necessary in the film (it may even warrant its own movie!) If any one of the stories was individually the focus of this movie, it would have been much better; however, there were far too many to effectively tell in a three-hour movie. It is quite obvious that it is adapted from a book, since there are a great many extraneous details and storylines kept in. If you want to see a movie about the creation of the atomic bomb, this is not the movie for you.",NEGATIVE

"Aug 9, 2023",Movie was riveting.  Three hours flew by.,POSITIVE
"Aug 9, 2023",Sometimes it was hard to hear the dialogue due to the music being louder than the voices.  I‚Äôd like to watch it again with closed captions to catch all the things I missed.,POSITIVE

"Aug 9, 2023","What a fantastic film. Brilliant and bold and so striking with Cillian Murphy's always amazing acting and a script that encapsulates the story's tone while also being extremely entertaining and so thought provoking. One thing I particularly loved was the sound design and soundtrack. The music blended so well and the sound effects/directing was instrumental to the overall effect. What an amazing movie about something so critical to our history and society. It neither glorifies nor shames, merely putting in perspective the creation of the atomic bomb in the eyes of the creators. One of my top three movies, for sure.",POSITIVE
"Aug 9, 2023","A 3hr movie that never dragged.
Kept my interest the entire time.
Great job by the director and cast.

"Aug 9, 2023",Fantastic movie from beginning to end! The government is crooked and covers their butts! I pray for my family and the rest of the world that we never go through a nuclear war.,POSITIVE
"Aug 9, 2023","Saw it in IMAX and was glad for it although it was quite loud. Performances were nuanced and excellent. Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr owned it, but there wasn't a weak lesser character seen. A gripping story that flashes around in time, but was easy enough to follow, even if the actual events were so utterly horrifying and world-changing. Nothing silly or light in the monumental story of the bomb, nor in Oppenheimer himself. Was a bit worried about length of film but it goes by far quicker than expected. A definite must see for 2023.

"Aug 9, 2023",Didnt seem like 3 hours. Great film.,POSITIVE
"Aug 9, 2023","Overall I enjoyed the movie. Many great performances. I felt that the time devoted to the backstory about Oppenheimers wives was wasted. His so called Communist affilations through the women and his brother could have been dealt with more efficiently.  The movie could have gone heavier on the actual science and less on gratuitous sex. I'm sure 3/4 of the audience have no clue about fission, fusion, particle acceleration, uranium, plutonium or deuterium (heavy water). At least educate the audience on the rudiments of nuclear physics instead of showing meaningless T&A scenes. Like so many politicians today, Strauss was a narcissistic, self-aggrandizing rat. Some things never change.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 9, 2023","Everything Nolan does best, in one film.  A bit like Interstellar meets Imitation Game.  It felt like every scene was masterful. The acting by Cillian and Downey was outstanding. The breadth he got to on weighty subjects (physics, communism/cold war, an enigmatic Oppenheimer ) was impressive.  Only drawback like most Nolan films, was length and the roles he gives his female leads.",POSITIVE
"Aug 9, 2023",Maybe The Best Movie Ever Made.,POSITIVE
"Aug 9, 2023","Great movie, telling history that may not always be comforting.  It will win numerous awards.  I'm glad that I saw it, but it would be difficult to see again, given the emotional resonance and the issues that are still with us today.",POSITIVE
"Aug 9, 2023","Not for kids nor teens or anyone who needs roller coaster theatrics and supernatural fantasy action.   This is an American (and world) history lesson, dramatically reenacted.  Most people don't want to know how hot dogs and sausages are made....they just want to see them on the grill.   Oppenheimer had quite a lot of grilling in it, mentally and emotionally.   Looking back in time it's hard to know the prevailing political and social climate because we have evolved into disunity in America.   'Patriotism' is a dirty word to many of the self-serving, the narcissistic, and the divisive larvae slithering the streets now but 1940s Americans were overwhelmingly determined to overcome the Nazi shadow and the Imperial forces of Japan, the sooner the better.   Had they a clue about the danger of Stalinist Russia, who knows whether the British idea to attack Russia would have gained vast American support, especially with the confidence that came with the A-bomb.   This movie cemented one thing in my mind by it's end....Joe McCarthy was NOT a misguided crackpot.  Communism indeed had a cancerous effect on the weak-minded in America.   This movie delves into many of the political issues which have been swept under the carpet.   My one regret about this movie is that there was not an epilogue posted for the audience to read whatever happened in the sunset years of Oppenheimer, his family, Strauss and several of the other prominent figures in the movie.",POSITIVE

"Aug 9, 2023","compelling movie with a serious subject that inspires deeper thinking about the complexities of warfare from many angles excellent performances by lead actors and all secondary actors too film score is effective at heightening tension with few memorable melodic moments some plot ideas not easy to follow, yet the story comes across powerfully fundamentally saddened to realize that the truth is not always most important - that deceivers have and still are allowed to flourish unless/until good people with the utmost strength in character stand up to them",POSITIVE

"Aug 9, 2023",Thought there'd be more bombs going off. More action and intensity. Too long. Otherwise it was alright.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 9, 2023","The story of Oppenheimer is mainly about his personal torment over the overwhelming deadliness of the Bomb. Also, about his personal life good, bad & the ugly. While I thought finding out about his personal turmoil and life was good to know about - some might find it not entertaining. One thing that was rather annoying, was the loud background music during some of the movie - couldn't understand some of the dialog during those scenes. Thus a 3 star rating.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 9, 2023",A fantastic movie from beginning to end! A must-see on the big screen. Should sweep the Oscars!,POSITIVE

"Aug 8, 2023","Despite its 3 hour long duration, that doesn't mean the true fact about keeping more interesting and amusing with a quite dazzling perfomance, great direction from Nolan and well-crafted plot. What makes it a good film is not only the way to narrate the Physic world, which is completely relevant, but it respects the actual events; although in a dramatized-yet-figuratively manner. Truly a work of art for today's cinema.",POSITIVE

"Aug 8, 2023",I don't know if we can be trusted with such a film.,POSITIVE
"Aug 8, 2023","There are movies that are just movies, and then there are those higher than the rest that feel like cinema. Nearly every aspect of Oppenheimer feels like a masterclass in making history feel cinematic, aiming to give more than a retelling of a historical event. It's filmed incredibly well, has excellent performances from all of its actors, and feels like the movie has something very direct and real to point out to the audience. While some might not consider it the best Christopher Nolan movie they've seen, it will definitely stand out as a very good film when compared to many others. Oppenheimer is definitely a contender for one of the best movies you could watch in a long time.",POSITIVE
"Aug 8, 2023",It had alot of great people in it. It was very interesting historically,POSITIVE
"Aug 8, 2023",It was well done. The acting was exceptional. And it goes to prove that the government will do anything to discredit you. Enjoyed it.,POSITIVE

"Aug 8, 2023",I saw Barbie the same weekend.  That one was good for a few chuckles.  This one will stick with me for decades.  Such a privilege to watch a filmmaker like Nolan at the height of his craft.  Watched it digitally as all the film screenings in my area were front row only.  Hope to see a 70mm print before it is too dusty to screen.,POSITIVE
"Aug 8, 2023","Liked - interesting story, beautiful cinematography, strong acting 
Disliked- really long, slow at times",POSITIVE
"Aug 8, 2023","I'd say 7.5-8 out of ten overall
yes I'd recommend it but I wouldn't personally watch it twice
overall the story was REALLY rich in details - maybe too deep actually
visually and audio were great overall but he over used some of the bright lighting and it played a little cheesey at times on that
it should have been 30 min. shorter - I was squirming by 2.5 hrs - it's not a biography, its a movie - he needed someone to force him to cut out some stuff
the stuff in europe at the beginning could have been shorter
the deep dive into lewis strauss could have been cut out (mostly)
didn't need that storyline with this first love that killed herself (or was she murdered?)
I don't think he has done any movies that are based on actual history (always his own stories) so I think he struggled in finding the heart of the story and just decided to include as much as he possibly could - which made the movie feel bloated a bit. I don't think anyone at the studio was willing to tell the director ""NO"" and he would have benefited from some forced editing down of this very large story.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 8, 2023",It's great. I love how they showed Los Alamos and I won't even start on the VFX. 5/5 an absolute must watch.,POSITIVE
"Aug 8, 2023",Great historical movie.  The dialogue was difficult to understand at times due the the sound track.,POSITIVE
"Aug 8, 2023",Loved the movie since it had great acting and an actual plot.  I was concerned about the 3 hour length of the but it was well paced and the time just flew buy since I was totally involved in the movie.,POSITIVE
"Aug 8, 2023","Lots of noise about this but for me just a big meh, 1st off no movie should be 3 hrs any story can be told in 2hrs no need to hold us hostage for vanity reasons,

"Aug 8, 2023","Movie is top quality, amazing production and actor selection. I would've gave it 5/5 but the movie can be pretty hard to understand in the start and even at the end I was a bit confused. also doesn't have alot of action, It's a perfect movie for people who love history, recommended!",POSITIVE
"Aug 8, 2023","Movie is a tour de force - Ive seen it twice. Its a thriller and a piece of real history that shaped the world. Chris Nolan is a genius in creating this movie out of the Pulitzer Prize bio of J.R.O., American Prometheus.",POSITIVE

This was a huge and long story story, encompassing many years of historical value. I loved the movie but thought they tried to shove too much into 3 hours. 
All and all, an enjoyable 3 hour movie experience.",POSITIVE
"Aug 8, 2023","A 3 hour spectacle about morally corrupt men & they're the stunning cognitive dissonance it took for them to see what they could do - in a word: DiSGUSTING. Let alone the portrayal of women: 'The women of Oppenheimer. Boobs, babies and a bit of booze. Bring the washing in dear. They may as well have been blow up dolls.'",NEGATIVE
"Aug 8, 2023","I movie Oppenheimer covered his life before, during, and after the atomic bomb.  It gave a historic prospective of the Manhatten project.  The acting is solid with an excellent cast.  The story is slow to developer, and I thought the better part of the film was after the bomb drop.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 8, 2023",I loved it.  It was much better than Cats.  I'm going to see it again and again.,POSITIVE
"Aug 8, 2023","A competent, if highly stylized imagining of Oppenheimer's life, I had higher hopes for the movie since I've studied the man and the project in great detail, but perhaps my knowledge of the subject skewed my viewing experience, I still enjoyed it though.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 8, 2023","The best drama I have ever seen, had to leave a review. Masterpiece.",POSITIVE
"Aug 8, 2023","Very entertaining for most of the 3h and almost completely historically accurate.
But the timeline of scenes and flashbacks isn't easily understandable.",POSITIVE
"Aug 8, 2023","Despite its 3 hour runtime, Oppenheimer grabs you and draws you into J Robert Oppenheimer's life and what led him to become the father of the atomic bomb and the aftermath of WWII after little boy and fat man were used to help end the war. (it never got dragging for meüëç) 

Oppenheimer is portrayed to be a complicated man, a brilliant yet flawed person. In perhaps Cillian Murphy's best performance, he becomes Oppenheimer in our eyes. He eventually becomes someone that is against nuclear proliferation, so despite his contribution to its creation, he in fact realizes that it has a terrible and consequential impact on humanity.

The Oppenheimer cast is stacked! Downey, Damon, Blunt and Pugh, to name a few, plus the likes of Hartnett, Oldman, Malik and more familiar character actors fill the screen and sprinkle their magic in the their respective screen times. Perhaps the underutilized aspect of the actors is Emily Blunt who finally shows her mettle in the 3rd act during the hearing.

Nolan is truly a master at his craft. While there are a great many scenes in this movie to prove this, the one thing (SPOILER HERE) that comes to mind is when the testing at Los Alamos has finally happened... And then he does this visual magic without music or sound. Wow. Amazing. Seconds later when the boom finally follows, yowza, what brilliance! 

This may very well be Nolan's best work and I hope he gets an Oscar win for this. Kudos to the cast and crew for putting together this masterpiece. I'm not normally a biopic nor historical movie viewer but you just have to watch this. 5 stars.‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê",POSITIVE
"Aug 8, 2023","Two annoyances.  First, there was no need for the incessant music being pumped out that was supposed to elicit suspense.  Second, it should have been one hour shorter.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 8, 2023","Very enjoyable, especially if you're a history buff. It portrayed the nuance of the problem of the nuclear bomb quite well. I was expecting the film to have morals and views of today (such as: bomb is evil) painted all across it and therefore show the people as all evil, but it didn't. It showed the very wide range of opinions on whether a weapon of mass destruction is good to create, while still hammering down why the US even did it. To prevent Nazi Germany from doing it first. Great film. The three hours flew right by.",POSITIVE
"Aug 8, 2023","Nolan has done it again, he revolutionized the standard of films. Oppenheimer comprises excellent performances from each cast member, a plot that keeps you tense, and technological innovations that turn a film into an experience. Nolan has made a movie of men talking in rooms, with one explosion into a blockbuster and he is the only director that I believe could do it. I am not joking about the tense plot, my BPM was elevated during the entire Trinity Test setup and sequence.",POSITIVE
"Aug 8, 2023",There were some very slow segments. It was very long. Acting was very good.,POSITIVE
"Aug 8, 2023","Excellent plot, manages to hold you from beginning to end, so much so that 3 hours pass and you don't even notice. Magnificent performances, rare films of this magnitude produced today, I was already homesick.",POSITIVE
"Aug 8, 2023","Oppenheimer is a masterclass in writing, story telling, and cinematography. The biopic directed by the heavily respected Christopher Nolan is among one of the best movies to come out in 2023. Cillian Murphy is astounding and dedicates everything he has into his role as the father of the atomic bomb and has shown himself worthy of a best actor nomination and maybe even win. The cinematography of Oppenheimer is breathtaking and is deserving of the big screen taking a huge step in modern movie making due to the 70mm format the film uses. The movie never stops and is engaging from beginning to end revealing the triumphs and terrors that Oppenheimer unleashed into our world. Specifically talking about THAT scene, the scene people will be waiting for that is made without the use of CGI, it is jaw-dropping, terrifying, and transcending and will forever go down as one of the best cinematic moments in movie history. The messaging and plot are well tied in together and is done in a way to make it seem more powerful than audiences will expect. Although some people may be turned off by the 3 hour long runtime, Oppenheimer does not disappoint and will blow audiences away being put down as a cinematic achievement.",POSITIVE
"Aug 8, 2023",Great acting. Lots of dramatic tension even though there is little action. Very thought provoking.,POSITIVE
"Aug 8, 2023","Liked the movie, had watched a couple of documentaries prior to seeing movie which helped in that the movie jumps through the years without any reference, a simple date (year) on the screen would have helped.  Movie enjoyable and learned a lot about the Manhattan Project and Oppenheimer",POSITIVE
"Aug 8, 2023",Speechless.  Nolan & the legend J.Robert Oppenheimer üëè,POSITIVE
"Aug 8, 2023","Everything about this movie was brilliant, from acting to casting and cinematography. Cillian Murphy truly deserves an Oscar for this wonderful performance, honourable mentions to RDJ, Emily blunt, Jason Clarke and Matt Damon for their brilliant performances.

The ending was remarkable and the entire movie experience was something I'll never forget. Nolan yet again proves why he's one of the best directors around.",POSITIVE
"Aug 8, 2023","Oppenheimer shall be mentioned in the future as a ""Flawless Masterpiece"". I have probably seen  all the interviews done by the cast mentioning the fact that this is an immersive experience, never done before kind of work, but none of this is going to compensate unless you watch this in theatre. It feels that you went back to that time and watching the events unfold in front of your eyes. Probably one of the movies where I cried in the opening sequence during his hearing for security clearance. Every actor played their part to perfection. I know Cilian Murphy is one of the greats and this performance was his best, but honestly I was more excited for RDJ performance to play a character who was declared as a villain in American History, who after playing a superhero for almost 11 years, got a chance to stretch his acting muscles. This is the best work of Christopher Nolan. 
IN NOLAN WE TRUST....",POSITIVE
"Aug 8, 2023","Oh my goodness this movie is INSANE! It's worth the hype and finally I got a movie that I adore that'll win the Oscars justfully! Cillian Murphy and RDJ really deserve those Oscars, because they were so good! But Matt Damon, Dane Dehaan and Florence Pugh also deserve some nominations, they did a phenonimal job as well! Suprises to see Rami Malek and Gary Oldman as President Truman, didn't expect them in there! That ending scene, my god! Truely one of the best non-Marvel movies that I've ever seen, so go watch it yourself, but have good seats because you don't want to have migraine and neck pain because you've been looking up for 3 hours straight...",POSITIVE

"Aug 8, 2023","OPPENHEIMER is a narratively powerful, visually masterful work of filmmaking, certain to be in the conversation for major-category Oscars, Golden Globes and other awards next year. The casting is superb and performances unimpeachable all round, particularly Cillian Murphy in the title role and the always-watchable Robert Downey Jr. as Oppie's main political nemesis, Lewis Strauss. Kenneth Branagh is a pleasantly surprising casting choice as German physicist Niels Bohr, and Florence Pugh (BLACK WIDOW's Yelena Belova) is virtually unrecognizable as the ill-fated mistress, Jean Tatlock. Particularly timely as we reach the 78th anniversary of the first atomic bombing at Hiroshima on August 6.",POSITIVE

"Aug 8, 2023","This is Christopher Nolan's magnum opus in many ways, blending his cross-cut style he's been perfecting over the years, with the best screenplay he's ever written, the heaviest themes he's ever explored, and the hardest questions he's ever asked. It's a portrait of a real man that changed the course of history. The cast is perfect. Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Rami Malik, Gary Oldman, Alden Ehrenreich, and more make up this incredible ensemble all of whom are the best in this that they've ever been. This film showcases the full force of Nolan's talent as a filmmaker, all focused on one character. This may be his best work to date.",POSITIVE
"Aug 8, 2023","Oppenheimer is one of those few films that comes along in a lifetime that seems truly important.  Christopher Nolan, who directed the Batman trilogy, ""Memento,"" ""Dunkirk,"" ""Insomnia,"" ""Inception,"" and ""Interstellar"" has created his most compelling film ever.  With an inspired cast including Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr., Matt Damon, Rami Malek, and Florence Pugh, the film is a tour de force.  J. Robert Oppenheimer was a brilliant, flawed, and haunted man.  His work helped end the most brutal war in human history, but he also opened Pandora's box to the atomic/nuclear age.  He was laser-focused on his primary objective, yet struggled with his relationship with his wife and his friends.  This film should be the overwhelming favorite for at least a dozen Academy Awards.  I cannot think of another film that had a runtime of 3 hours yet left me wanting to see more.",POSITIVE

"Aug 8, 2023","Let's start with the good; Promotes important world history, overall acting is good and Cillian potrais Oppenheimer phenomonally. The movie was well made in terms of quality and tried some innovations.

The bad;
The incredible slow pacing with a three hour long movie with next to no historical drama and science it felt lazy and uncreative.

A lot of the scenes were lies and half truths to make the movie and characters more pretentious..  Especially how they managed to use and make Oppenheimer's most famous quote sound like something out of a really bad kinky adult movie.

There is a lot of jumping in time in this movie. I seriously believe Nolan did that to spice it up a very boring slow paced movie with a very bad result.

Florence Pugh's skills as one of our generations best actresses went completely to waste as her character Jean Tatlock was used only for irrelevant nudity and mostly irrelevant sex scenes. Nothing was even mentioned about her vast influence on the politics of the era as a psychiatrist while she was under the communist party.

Einstein and John von Neumann's involment has been brushed aside, pretending like their involvement in the project was minor when it's very likely USA would've lost the race to the Atomic bomb against Germany without them.

I don't know if I wanna touch on the ""wokeness"" because it's so silly, but I think it's important to stick to the history when you re-tell it. Not by adding black people and women to a 1930's quantum physics classes and on the manhatten project.

Summary; It's a movie filled with fantastic actors that deliver on their eind. Too bad the pacing is dreadful, the writing is horrible and most of the actual story is missing.",NEGATIVE

The acting was outstanding. Much of the characters and information I knew nothing about even though I felt I knew a fair amount going in.  Now I will need to do some research to find out how much of it was true.  Lol

I had no issues understanding the dialog as some had mentioned.

"Aug 8, 2023","Everything about this movie, from the scripts plot and architecture, to the choice of focus as a ""political"" intrigue drama confused with a WWII epic was as uninspired as films come. This movie is about as blah as blah can get but I'm just leaving a one star to counter the underserved praise this ""intellectual firestorm"" received.  There are essentially three acts: Oppenheimers beginning and communist flirtations , his emergence as a director and war hero, and finally the emotional ball of wax that accompanies his culpability, along with his role in political theater during a footnote in US history. The plot has aspiration but no direction, some pondering , the weight of  morality of nuclear war which is lightly dangled from time to time, but really no actual climax. Which is how you know the movie didn't match the hype. Even the nuclear detonation scene was somewhat hollow without any sense of proportionality or scale given. Movie will be forgotten about in less than a year , look forward to more biopics and movies based around scientists however this was not it",NEGATIVE

The movie piqued my interest so Ill research more information on Oppenheimer and the other major figures involved in the story.",POSITIVE
"Aug 8, 2023","I found this movie interesting, but difficult. Maybe it makes a great trailer for the book on which it is based (""American Prometheus""), but it is not a great movie. It takes an important man's life, or part of it, runs it through a blender, and calls it a movie. 

It is almost too fragmented and too out-of-sequence to be comprehensible, especially if you don't already have a certain amount of background knowledge about the history surrounding Oppenheimer's life. Two teens sitting near me walked out of the movie in the middle, and I was not too surprised. Meanwhile, perhaps partly because I live near Los Alamos, the movie held my interest. If you can follow the story, such as it is, there is actually some drama that has been wrung out of some rather dry and dusty events. Now I am interested to read the book. Maybe then I will want to watch the movie again.  

As a history lesson, the movie leaves something to be desired. It does not for instance really explain what uranium or plutonium are, or what is involved in mining or processing these elements. Nor does it directly show any of the documentary photos or footage of the aftermath in Japan. Instead, the horrible suffering is only hinted at through special effects and verbal explanations.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 8, 2023","I'm still mulling over how I feel about it in the grand scheme of other Nolan films. But there is no doubt that Cillian Murphy was brilliant and I'm fairly confident that he will take home the Oscar for his role. I wouldn't be surprised if Zimmer takes another one for best score. And I also think Matt Damon was at the top of his game.

The narrative follows a disjointed timeline jumping between the 20s - 40s, and early 50s when Oppenheimer was subject to McCarthy era witch-hunts (with a quick pitstop in the 60s before he died). 

I tend to find that biopics that hone in on very specific periods of time in a person's life work best. I think Oppenheimer proves how difficult it is to tell the story of a person's life in 2-3 hours. And as a result of trying to condense so much into such a short period Nolan has clearly had to make some tough decisions about what aspects of Oppenheimer's life story to sacrifice on or cut out entirely. 

The principal focus is on Oppenheimer's time managing the Manhattan Project Labs leading up to the Trinity Test in 1945.  it also deals briefly with his studies in the first third of the film. And then rushes through the aftermath of his work - the  dilemma for the scientists involved with reconciling the work they've done with its intended use, the tension between Oppenheimer and some of the other scientists on the program, as well as his role as a government policy advisor,  and the powerful enemies he made as a result of his strong role  in promoting a policy of (what would eventually become under Kennedy) Mutually Assured Destruction after WWII. It cuts out everything else about his life -  details about his time in psychotherapy, the years after his security clearance was taken away and what he did, it doesn't give much insight into his cushy childhood etc. And then at points, I felt, it sacrifices on narrative depth in each of the chapters so as to condense enough of Oppenheimer's life into the story Nolan wanted to tell.  

I also think the film under-utilized the talents of Emily Blunt (who plays Oppenheimer's wife, Kitty). When she does have her moment toward the end of the film it just sort of made me think that they missed out by not giving her more meaningful screen time (she appears quite frequently but has very little dialogue). That said, Oppenheimer's marriage to Kitty could probably be made into its own film. It seems to have been as complex as any individual character in the film. The film refers to Oppenheimer's numerous affairs. But it doesn't really spend any time  exploring Oppenheimer's role as a father and a husband. And only very peripherally touches on the impact of what being married to him must have been like (it suggests that Kitty underwent phases of alcoholism and depression). As well as the the impact of (what I presume was a very distant and aloof) kind of relationship he had with his kids (they're always screaming and crying whenever they're on film).

But don't get me wrong though. Overall, it is a very good film. It's visually stunning. It's tense. The pace of its editing is a masterclass in building suspense. And as I say Cillian Murphy is brilliant. I think when you have have a film like this which jumps between large spaces of time at the potential loss of narrative depth, it takes a really brilliant actor to draw out the subtleties and complexities of the subject. I definitely didn't leave this film thinking Oppenheimer was a straightforward guy. He was complex and Murphy captures it all so well in every gesture and facial expression. I left the film wanting to understand more about the subject.",POSITIVE

"Aug 8, 2023","Unfortunately, this is more about IMAX than the film. It will be a much better viewing experience on a small screen and with some old-school sound system. I expected that the IMAX screen and sound would play their roles at the A-bomb test, but the use of high volume music score, seat-shaking was continuous and often not apt. Intimate dialogue was often drowned out in music and noise.
Two horse-riders at Los Alamos with a storm in the distance sound like they are in a hurricane. BOOM! SMASH!
Three scientists in a tent having a conversation that cannot be heard because the soundtrack is amplifying outside wind. BOOM! SMASH!
Oppenheimer (trying) to talk to a woman at a party has to contend with swelling music until it is the LOUDEST BACKGROUND TRACK YOU HAVE EVER HEARD!
Scientist flicks a switch to start the A-bomb test ignition sequence that sounds like the slamming of the largest metal door that you can imagine! BOOM! SMASH!

There are great performances in this film and Robert Downey Jr is the true star.

I have two words for Christopher Nolan and his sound engineer, whoever he or she is, and those words are ""artistic restraint"". Just because you have IMAX technology doesn't mean you have to exploit it in every scene. BOOM! SMASH!",NEGATIVE

It does not pander to the audience, it isn't for everyone some may find it boring and unnecessarily long but this is a prestigious war drama and I does what it wants to do extremely well. The entire cast does amazing, my stand out being Emily Bunt (who btw is definitely not underwritten, she kicks ass in the third act), Rami Malek, Robert Downey Jr, and of course Cillian Murphy. Yes the ""I have become death"" scene was goofy to say the least but overall this is one of my favourite films of the year.",POSITIVE

I have to say, after seeing the film, I was underwhelmed by it on all levels.  I don't know what it was I was expecting, but what I got was dull/boring in many places, jumped around timelines too often, the conversations were difficult to hear thanks to Nolan's refusal to dub in better sound after the movie is completed.  Had I known most of the film would be based on congressional and closed door hearings perpetrated by an enemy of Oppenheimer with men just sitting around talking, I would have skipped the movie altogether.  AND WHY MAKE IT IN IMAX with so little material that would require a huge screen????  There was no action accept for the test of the bomb...there was supposed to be this earth shattering impact of the bomb...it wasn't that spectacular really, not even in Imax...  The film was definitely a parade of famous actors all of whom probably begged to be in this movie because they love Nolan's films and figured it would be nominated for Oscars...I don't see why it should be.  But for me, I don't get the hype really.  Watching a biography about Oppenheimer where his life is in chronological order would have probably been preferrable.  I don't get where the sex scenes/nudity was needed in this film either...  I love Cillian Murphy...but in this film, he was pretty emotionless throughout...  I personally wouldn't have watched it 1x thru and definitely wouldn't see it again.  Too long for what it was...",NEUTRAL
"Aug 7, 2023","Good story that should have been told in a better way. Too scrambly. Poor character development, I swear I only knew two characters' names and if one referred to another I kept thinking, ""wait...who is that?"" Too much dumbing down of some parts ...just messy. It's too bad because the story itself (when you could pluck it out of the actual movie) is very compelling. It had the great fortune of the behemoth of Barbie to raise its presence (and box office.) Reminded me of a made for tv movie with some expensive shots of stars and fire and stuff to make it seem smarter or artsy or something. Worth seeing to glean for yourself the (good) story.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 7, 2023","Non linear story telling did nothing due the plot, every historical reference was clumsy and heavy handed (oh look who it is, Einstein! You can tell because the wind blew his hat off and oh look there's his hair!) The RDJ subplot made no sense, the writing was lazy with constant telling instead of sitting, 0 character development: They literally have to spell out that Opp didn't have a spine in 45 and then did in 49, even though he does nothing different. You wouldn't even understand that it's a point of contention except his wife overdramticly tells him he's weak every so often to remind you that it's something you should be noticing and caring about. Florence Pugh's character is so terribly written the fridging was actually a relief. Absolutely nothing believable about their attraction, your just supposed to believe it because she keeps yelling at him for bringing flowers? Two stars, one for the pretty filming and one for the sound. The acting was great for what they were given, but no stars because it was completely wasted. If Cillian wasn't so good that he can act with his eyes you wouldn't have even known he was there.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 7, 2023","So, I went to watch this movie with my wife and 15-year-old daughter, hoping for a thrilling historical drama like 'The Imitation Game,' you know? But man, it got super awkward when we stumbled upon not one, but two unexpected sex scenes! Definitely not what I signed up for with my kid in tow.

I was really looking forward to the part where scientists create the bomb, but guess what? That was, like, just 20 minutes out of the whole 3-hour movie! The rest of the time was all about politics and digging into Oppenheimer's personal life. I mean, come on, I don't mind a bit of drama, but 2 hours and 40 minutes of it was way too much.

At the 2 1/2 hour mark, I was just praying for it to end. Don't get me wrong, the actors did an awesome job, and their acting was top-notch. But, man, the plot was a total snooze fest, all tangled up in politics and throwing in those unnecessary sex scenes.

I wish they had balanced it out better, you know? The scientific stuff was actually pretty interesting, and they could've explored that aspect more instead of drowning us in political blah blah. Also, cutting down on those awkward scenes wouldn't hurt either. It had potential, but the execution left a lot to be desired.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 7, 2023",Outstanding writing and acting. The make up artist should get an Oscar.,POSITIVE

"Aug 7, 2023",The movie was great and must watch for IMAX 70mm for the best experience.,POSITIVE
"Aug 7, 2023",Liked the black & white viewpoints.,POSITIVE
"Aug 7, 2023","Well, the movie is called Oppenheimer so I guess it's about him.

Yes, Oppenheimer was a complex character but that complexity has been reduced to a mano-at-mano with Lewis Strauss.

Yet, can his life really be just the kind of plot that I've watched in Zeffirelli's Amadeus? Is this then the story of a person about whom Nolan claims he is the most important person who has ever lived?

Oppenheimer will mostly be remembered as a scientist and Mahanttan's project manager in the first place. And that seems to have been forgotten in the movie. Nowhere was the Interim Committee mentioned (ultimately responsible for advising the president). 

Key people in Los Alamos (like Parsons, like Von Neumann) were overlooked whilst others got too much screen time (Teller for instance, of whom all scientists seemed to agree that he had absolute no value to the implosion project). Why implosion? What are the challenges of implosion? A key decision where Oppenheimer removed Seth Neddermeyer in favour of  Kistiakowsky as head of Metallurgy wasn't mentioned. Yet, this is probably the most important decision of the whole implosion-program.

Nowhere were the goals of Manhattan (drop a bomb on Nazi Germany) explicitly put forward, stemming from a letter written by Szilard and sponsored by Einstein. The late reluctance by the scientists and the tension it created at Los Alamos comes because they found that the bomb didn't need to be built (and certainly not used) since its destined target surrendered.

The movie also induces the assumption that there is a direct line from Trinity to Hiroshima. Well, no! Absolutely not. Hiroshima is Parson's brainchild. Nagasaki is Oppenheimer's. The only thing that connects both bombs is that they are nuclear. Their concept is vastly different.

Maybe it's a character movie in which a character is on trial. That could be. But then, sadly, as an audience, we were not even given 10% of the pieces of conviction.

Ultimately, what we got, is a lot of close-ups.",NEGATIVE

"Aug 7, 2023","Oppenheimer is a somewhat complex film, considering the characters and relationships involved.  I valued it more for its informational and historical value than its entertainment value.

"Aug 7, 2023",This movie utilizes the 'flashback' technique to tell the story.

So much for a relaxing and entertaining movie!,NEUTRAL
"Aug 7, 2023","Masterpiece. Well researched and accurate to its time, Oppenheimer will definitely be a must rewatch for me.

"Aug 7, 2023","This was a ""thinking person's"" entertainment. The flashbacks to non-sequential and several different events are a bit confusing. Sound at the beginning made conversations difficult to understand... about a third of the way it improved. I wished I'd known the final fate of Oppenheimer before seeing the movie. I came away from the movie not knowing if I liked it or not, but the next day, I realized I DID like it very much because it was so thought provoking. My husband didn't like it because he was distracted by recognizing actors from other movies and the flashbacks. I'd like to see it again to appreciate details I missed with the first viewing. I think the movie is more informative than entertaining... like a good history lecture.",POSITIVE

"Aug 7, 2023","Oppenheimer moved rather quickly through the story line. It was a bit difficult to keep up. There were flashbacks that did not make sense until later in the movie. There were too many really loud bangs and bright flashes to enjoy the movie. I walked away thinking, for me, it was over my head. The bombs exploding and the fire bombs did nothing for me. It was fun to see someone portray Einstein. But the characters were messed into the story line so well there was little delineation of them as the story moved forward. In the end it was good, but not good enough to see again.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 7, 2023",The sound quality of dialogue was bad.  Also The noise of the sound explosions was loud. Very long movie.,NEGATIVE
"Aug 7, 2023","~Christopher Nolan made a masterpiece.~

Is this the best movie Christopher Nolan ever made? I think so. This movie was a masterpiece. There wasn't a single scene I wanted to skip. I was too captivated by every part of this film. Cillian gives a performance that not only should bring him to his first Academy nomination but IMO should win him the whole thing. So did Downey. This was also the best performance by Emily Blunt, I think ever. Matt Damon was fantastic, and Florence was too. 
Loved the small roles of 3 Academy Award winners with Affleck being terrifying with just a little screen time, Oldman being unrecognizable and Malek stealing the last 20 minutes of the film. Hoyte van Hoytema once again made fantastic cinematography one of his best and Ludwig G√∂ransson ATE that score. I think it's one of the best scores in a film ever. Period! I have chills listening to those melodies even now. What a score. 
This film left a big impact on me and I wish Nolan and the crew all luck on award season. But I think that this is his moment.",POSITIVE

We really wanted to understand all of the dialogue; the nuances etc - we will have to wait until we can rent it and choose close-caption. Also the nude scenes were unnecessarily explicit and rather exploitative of the woman. Other than that, the film was excellent, the actors just brilliant. Robert Downey Jr amazes with his intensity in that character.",POSITIVE
"Aug 7, 2023","I enjoyed learning more about this history, and the acting was superb.  My only complaint was the soundtrack with loud background music, apparently intended to heighten the drama, but I found it to be annoying and tiring.

Cillian Murphy & Robert Downey Jr give the performance of their lives as their separate stories hurtle towards their controversial and cathartic conclusions in what must be one of Christopher Nolan's defining spectacles as a film maker.

It's confusing and not enough about the project itself and the science behind it.  The only cool part is the testing of the bomb.   And even that coulda been better.  Spielberg or fincher shoulda made this movie. Nolan is the most overrated director of all time.  He just throws up a script all over the screen.  He also always has music going on in the background which is super annoying.

I appreciated the B&W portions of the fil being true to the book and the color portions of the film being speculations.

"Aug 7, 2023",Hard to hear and follow in movie theater. Will watch second half at home with subtitles and google!!!,NEGATIVE
"Aug 7, 2023",So real and informative as well as sensitive to the toll the creation of this bomb took on all who were involved. Very emotional.,POSITIVE
"Aug 7, 2023",An important piece of world history.  Dramatic yet fact based.,POSITIVE
"Aug 7, 2023","Good cast but I found it too slow paced, hard to follow just felt like sitting through 3h of documentary reenactment!",NEGATIVE
"Aug 7, 2023","As I watched this movie chronicle the development of the Atom bomb, I was deeply struck with how world-changing this was. It was fascinating the biographical aspects of Oppenheimers life, the politics and the tension between building a bomb that could either save the world or destroy it. Also interesting was watching the team of scientists and their various contributions. The length of the movie did not bother me. I was engrossed the entire movie.",POSITIVE
"Aug 7, 2023",Great movie. A little long,POSITIVE
"Aug 7, 2023",It was a great way to see what it took to make the bomb.,POSITIVE
"Aug 7, 2023","The movie is essentially in 3 parts; his rise as a leader in Nuclear Physics, his leadership of the Manhattan Project and finally his political struggles.  The first two parts are fantastic.  The movie slows down in the third part.  It is an important movie and worth a watch.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 7, 2023",it is three hours of essentially dialogue,NEUTRAL
"Aug 7, 2023",Well done. Great job representing the complex man and modern political woke garbage! Very refreshing!!,POSITIVE
"Aug 7, 2023",Was below my expectations. Movie was too long. Could‚Äôve been edited. Should‚Äôve been 2 1/2 hours instead of three.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 7, 2023","Oppenheimer a waste of  3 hours,  can't make up their mind to a nuclear bomb creation, a tangled love affair, or a witch for a communist.  Enough of a topless woman and visit with Einstien to enrich a sad story.  The actors were good, but the story is very disappointing.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 7, 2023","Um filme que consegue fazer voc√™ viver a hist√≥ria, tens√£o do come√ßo ao fim, intenso e √∫nico",POSITIVE
"Aug 7, 2023",Great film. I really enjoyed it. Leave your brain on and appreciate the science. You don‚Äôt have to have a PHD to experience it.,POSITIVE
"Aug 7, 2023","I rated Oppenheimer a 3 star due to the fact it was too long , not the theaters fault. Could have gotten away with 2.5 hours.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 7, 2023",Kinda boring.  Both the people sitting on the right and left of me left the theatre in the middle of the movie.  I was thinking about leaving also.  Robert Downey Jr.  was the best actor in the movie.  Not enough sex scenes to jerk off too but too many to watch with your kids or parents.  I thought it was a dud.,NEGATIVE
"Aug 7, 2023","Director/writer Christopher Nolan again slingshots us from past to present to in-between in order to explain what matters to his protagonist.  He does so masterfully in this homage to several WWII-era Amerucanl-Jewish physicists, tearing off J. Robert Oppenheimer's moral bandaids as he goes from theoretical to very practical scientist over 3 film hours.  Although not really fast-paced, the movie never 
has you l looking at the luminous hands of your radioactive watch.  The array of name actors, some of whom have been too-long absent from our screens, do an outstanding job of avoiding charactures (sp?) of often-stereotypical roles I never knew that Oppenheimer was both a passionate moralist and a rabid slut-pig.  Thanks, Cillian Murphy, for all your mad bomber's facets.",POSITIVE
"Aug 7, 2023",Well written great acting. Its a long movie but it DOES build along the way. Walking out of the theater it really leaves you thinking about our future!,POSITIVE
"Aug 7, 2023",wonderful movie from beginning to end,POSITIVE
"Aug 7, 2023","It was a very historically accurate movie and a great story! It truly shows how scary it was. Working on the Manhattan Project. The last few scenes relate to modern day, and what‚Äôs going on now very well. I recommend this movie to all adults. Especially people from that time.",POSITIVE
"Aug 7, 2023",Excellent all around,POSITIVE
"Aug 7, 2023",I wanted to like this movie. My son is a physicists and I was so looking forward to see it with him. It was not for me. Not sure what I was suppose to feel but  I felt no connection to the characters or the story. I was bored. I wanted more of the science and the horrors of the bomb and less dialog. Less love scenes that seemed so ill placed.,NEGATIVE
"Aug 7, 2023",Very long. Lots of talk. Jumped around.,NEGATIVE
"Aug 7, 2023",Great historical representation in my humble opinion. Quick action with impressive talent in many roles. My lady and I really enjoyed it.,POSITIVE
"Aug 7, 2023","Excellently acted, directed, edited.  Just a fine piece of tactile filmmaking anchored by a towering performance by Cillian Murphy.",POSITIVE
"Aug 7, 2023","It was okay. It's an overrated movie for me. I give it 3 out of 5 stars. Had good moments, powerful moments but dragged too much at times with the hearing scenes which had me bored and disengaged. It's an okay movie, not as good as people claim it to be for me.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 7, 2023",Will probably win Best Picture and other Oscars. Didn't seem like 3 hours because it keeps you engaged.,POSITIVE

"Aug 7, 2023",Loved everything about this movie,POSITIVE
"Aug 7, 2023",Too long and boring. Jumps all over the place from time to time and the viewers have no idea when something is happening and whos who. No mention of the horrific result after the bombing of Japan. The movie shows Oppenheimer like hes the victim here?? Two sex scenes and nudity that make zero sense to the story and dont fit into the style whatsoever. Overhyped.,NEGATIVE
"Aug 7, 2023","Nice movie, I liked the story. Hard to follow at times and too long. Great acting in this show.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 7, 2023","It was about 30 minutes too long. The last part of the movie drags when it should have been ending. Its more about politics than science and it seems that there wasnt a definitive direction the movie wanted to take. There were a lot of characters to keep track of and jumping from different time periods was confusing at times. The acting was excellent, but better editing could have made the movie more interesting through the end.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 7, 2023",All of the performances were top notch. Robert Downey Jr really stepped it up from Iron Man.,POSITIVE
"Aug 7, 2023","IMAX 70mm is a must for this movie. Best way to experience the music, sound mixing, and not miss out on picture quality",POSITIVE

Acting was good.. picked up when the story moved towards the issues surrounding developing the atomic bomb.",POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2023",The trailer was NOTHING like the actual movie. There was very little about the development of the atomic bomb.... it was almost all about the politics surrounding Oppenheimer.,NEGATIVE

"Aug 6, 2023",Three hours of my life wasted. This was incredibly boring.,NEGATIVE

"Aug 6, 2023","A masterpiece. The performances are stunning, the scenes are powerful and intense. It is just incredible.",POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2023","Simply fantastic. I could not stop thinking about this movie for days after I saw it. It captures incredibly well the gravity, contradictions, motivations, and emotions around the development of the atomic bomb in the context of its time.",POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2023",Christopher Nolan has delivered yet another masterpiece that will no doubt have to questioning the power that us humans hold over the world.,POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2023","An incredible and riveting story. We were ""glued"" to the screen.  So many twists and turns.  Very enlightening
and incredibly sad.  Oppenheimer was so brilliant.  Excellent actors, too.",POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2023","Wow! Christopher Nolan has a masterpiece with Oppenheimer. Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. seem to sure to be nominated during awards season. The move keeps a steady pace and moves the story along all the while, making you feel that you haven't missed a thing. All of the supporting actors as absolutely superb and the story stays gripping all throughout. It's fantastic and three hours felt like half that. Absolutely worth the effort to see!",POSITIVE

"Aug 6, 2023",Sound is extremely loud!,POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2023","Totalmente cine , excelente actuaci√≥n.",POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2023","I was slightly disappointed with the explosion. It should have been computer animated, much bigger and more dramatic. With the explosion that they used, they attempted to make it more dramatic by zooming into the fire, but an atomic blast isn't like that. It's on a different level. The movie moved a little too quickly too despite being 3 hours long. I'm gonna have do watch it again as a few things slid past me. Overall, excellent movie, but not my favorite! I hope they come out with a follow up movie about bombing Japan and integrating that into the pearl harbor movie",POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2023",Oppenheimer was an excellent movie! The story was riveting and the audience was captivated for the entire 3 hours. I highly recommend Oppenheimer for your viewing pleasure.,POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2023","Eh. It was okay. I found it to be kinda drawn out too long, but maybe that's just me. I found most of the scenes except for the (spoiler, kinda) bomb being dropped, but it's worth a watch at least once, especially if you're into history.",NEGATIVE

"Aug 6, 2023",So amazing wonderful cast an incredible part of history so sad what the did to Oppenheimer,POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2023","This is a pure masterpiece. Everything about it just landed perfectly, like the cinematography, music, just everything! The actors fit the roles perfectly, particularly Cilian Murphy's outstanding performance. The highlight for me is the ending, which is the scene that wraps all the whole movie together. I had high expectations from all the hype this received and to say that they were broken is an understatement. Christopher Nolan did it again! Highly recommend seeing this.",POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2023","This movie was very long and mostly boring.  The entire story of the Manhattan Project is largely irrelevant to the the plot here (which is really just three oddly interwoven stories about Oppenheimer's affairs, his hearings to have his security clearance revoked, and Strauss' nomination as Secretary of Commerce).  The sex in the movie is gratuitous.  I honestly can't understand why so many people are giving this movie high marks.  It was 3 hours of my life that I will never get back.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 6, 2023",It was absolutely amazing I never once felt Bored throughout the 3 hour runtime it told an fantastic story with amazing visuals would recommend to anyone over 15 due to certain scenes but brilliant movie Flawless acting cillan Murphy was spectacular must see.,POSITIVE

"Aug 6, 2023","The movie was beautiful and well acted by the entire cast. That said, it really dragged on... up until the successful first nuclear explosion, it was good, the last was just... boring? Anyways I understand why it will win awards but I don't think anyone will be excited to watch it a second time.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 6, 2023",The acting was great. The story line was riveting. Seldom do I make it through a long movie without visiting the restroom. I never left my seat for three hours as I didn't want to miss one word or one bit of action.,POSITIVE

"Aug 6, 2023",A well-made bio pic every American over 13 should see. A great American/world history lesson wrapped up in great filmmaking and storytelling. Can't give it five stars because of its unnecessary length at 3 hours and some distracting stunt casting.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 6, 2023","Beautiful, Amazing Camera and great plot amazing scripts amazing actin Robert Downey Junior was phenomenal!!!",POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2023","The history was fascinating, and the hopscotch sequencing added depth to the story-telling.  The interspersion of the black-and-white scenes with those in color underscored the bifurcated nature of the tale.  It otherwise rates (at least) a full 4 stars (the chararcterizations by the lead actors were a bit too wooden, but probably necessary for contrasting effect), but I took off a half-star solely for the American flag glitch.  (The British-born Christopher Nolan can be forgiven, but that's what an editorial team is for.)  C'mon, guys...",NEUTRAL
"Aug 6, 2023",The movie was ridiculous. It wasn't relatable to young people. The young people will have no idea why the United States was messing with fission or Fusion. Young people will not understand why it was necessary to create fat man or little boy in regards to the threat from the Japanese as well as the Germans. The movie completely glossed over Mr oppenheimer's life prior to creating a bomb. And seriously was it necessary for them to show him having sex or fantasizing about sex during his hearing? It was ridiculous. Sorry I wasted my money.,NEGATIVE
"Aug 6, 2023",It's too long and really downplays the magnitude of the atomic bomb on history. Oppenheimer is a very flat character that just moves from scene to scene.,NEGATIVE

Our son and daughter-in-law, both work at a nuclear power plant as engineers. In fact, my son works at a Los Alamos in New Mexico. Found out a few interesting tidbits of information that I need to verify about Los Alamos. Overall, I really don‚Äôt understand what the point of the movie was. It seems like it was a whole team of people who made this atomic bomb and that Oppenheimer was engaged in making it with the hopes of stopping the enemy from making one too because they would realize everyone would suffer. Sounds like war games from the 80s. My husband is a huge history fan and he absolutely hated this movie. He said he found no redeeming qualities in it.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 6, 2023",The movie tells the true story of this who worked on the Manhattan Project and the toll it took on their personal lives. Great movie with a sad end.,POSITIVE

"Aug 6, 2023",Best movie Ive been in 5 years,POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2023",It was a great biopic of Oppenheimer. It gave me an insight into the man that is considered the father of the atomic bom. To see how he saw the world as a scientist. And how his struggling with the use of the bom and it's creation. A great cast and director,POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2023",A must see movie - there is history and then there's politics! Great movie/,POSITIVE

"Aug 6, 2023","I'm a big fan of Nolan but I have to say this film was utterly disappointing. The dialogue was unintelligible due the the poor execution of Nolan's classic jumping back and forth in time.

Don't believe the 5 star reviews. Save your money.",NEGATIVE

"Aug 6, 2023",Too long played out by a set of hand wringing self indulgent scientists and politicians. Played out for 3 hrs with a couple of bangs. It was raining.,NEGATIVE
"Aug 6, 2023","I watched Openheimer excited to see a Cillian Murphy collab with Robert Downey Jr and instead all i got out of it was 3 hours of wasted time. There were good scenes but none that made me go crazy for the movie instead it was more of a sciencey thing rather than what i was expecting which was a historical movie that was interesting and kept the viewer feel excited. I saw this after I saw Barbie and Barbie (2023) was actually good I hope Saw Patrol isn't like Barbenheimer where only one of them is good and the more ""mature"" one is less thrilling and less interesting and yeah. So in conclusion I don't want Paw Patrol to be better than Saw X in the end.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 6, 2023","self indulgent. awful sound design, i couldn't understand half the time. the story is interesting but poorly told. doesn't focus on the victims at all, which i personally find distasteful, but also bad storytelling. how can we understand oppenheimer's guilt without understand the impact the bomb had? at the end of the day, the film, just like oppenheimer, didn't take a firm stance. the film is a manifestation of nolan's ego, which is why i suspect he relates to oppenheimer.",NEGATIVE

"Aug 6, 2023","Fantastic movie and brilliantly acted! The fact that people are complaining about length or pacing is ridiculous. My only complaint would actually be that the beginning was a bit too choppy and fast but it calmed down after the actual building of the bomb commenced, and the ending was stellar. If you don't have the attention span to sit through, go see the Barbie movie instead.",POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2023","Boring, incoherent, uneven, bombastic, and loud are the kindest things I can say about this 3+ hour snooze. How does this director still have a job in Hollywood? What was this movie supposed to be about? Who was it supposed to be about? I've never suffered through such a bizarre film. The director is so insecure with his film making he needs to crank up the awful score at the end of every scene. He makes Spielberg look subtle. The story is all over the place and thinks it is being so 'clever' by never telling its' audience where, when or even why the scene is taking place. So the viewer is left guessing throughout the entire film. Not to mention the 'fast dialogue' that is supposed to impress the viewer by completely confusing them and not bothering to actually explain what a atomic bomb is, nor how devastating such a thing is. The arrogance of this director/writer regarding the subject matter and subject of this film is truly shocking.  

Save your hard earned money, save 3+ hours of your life, and avoid the Hollywood and little boy noise surrounding this dudd. Robert Oppenheimer is a fascinating subject and I am sure there is a good film to be made about him, his life, and his role in creating the atomic bomb. It's just not here.....no way close.",NEGATIVE

Everything from the story to the sound was spot on.

When people are curious why their government is not trustworthy and trusted they can refer to this and countless other documentaries.

It's only decades later if someone puts in the work to connect the truth and publish it in some form do we actually understand what happened.

"Aug 6, 2023","Christopher Nolan brings the story of Robert J. Oppenheimer and the invention of the atomic bomb to the big screen in his mammoth three-hour epic ""Oppenheimer"". After five previous collaborations with the applauded director, Cillian Murphy finally takes the lead role, helming a cast packed full of famous faces. Nolan takes audiences on an adventure through one man's life, switching between black and white and coloured film and between the perspectives of Oppenheimer himself and Lewis Strauss (portrayed by Robert Downey Jr.) 

Stretching across multiple decades, ""Oppenheimer"" opens in 1926 where we're introduced to a 22-year-old J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) as he studies at Cambridge. After narrowly avoiding poisoning scientist Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh) Oppenheimer continues his education, getting a PhD in physics and ends up becoming a professor himself. He soon meets his future wife Kitty (Emily Blunt), whilst also beginning an affair with communist Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh). When 1942 rolls around America finds themself involved in World War 2 with the Nazis appearing to have near-completed their own nuclear weapons program. Oppenheimer is recruited by Army General Lesley Groves (Matt Damon) to lead the Manhattan Project, and develop an atomic bomb. A top secret base is built in the deserts of Los Alamos, New Mexico with Oppenheimer assembling his own team of scientists to create the bomb. The events that follow will forever change the world, placing America in a new position of power and unleashing a whole host of new dangers. 

Irish actor Cillian Murphy takes on the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer and the ""Peaky Blinders"" star is an absolute revelation in the titular role, delivering a magnificent performance that is easily one of the best of his career. Murphy skillfully walks the line between Oppenheimer's loyalty to the U.S. and the myriad of moral qualms he must face along the way. He fully immerses himself into the role and the results are nothing short of incredible, adeptly anchoring the film and breathing life into this stellar character study. Murphy leads the massive ensemble cast who all give strong performances while bringing Nolan's screenplay to the screen. Robert Downey Jr., shines in his role as failed Secretary of Commerce Lewis Strauss, marking his second acting role following his 11-year tenure as Iron Man in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The two-time Oscar nominee gives a powerful performance that feels worthy enough to land him his third Oscar nomination in the coming awards season. Downey Jr. excels in the third act of the film in the scenes he shares with Aldren Ehrenreich (""Solo: A Star Wars Story"") which give audiences an insight into life and politics post-Oppenheimer. Finally, while only appearing in the second half of the film, Jason Clarke, who portrays Roger Robb, does a stellar job creating an unnerving and intimidating atmosphere for not only Oppenheimer himself, but also for the audiences watching his verbal tirades during numerous scenes.

The film tightly walks the line between being an informative biopic about the father of the atomic bomb and a dread-fuelled, thriller/horror. Its ghastly subject matter and chilling warnings about nuclear warfare allow audiences to understand the history, and the man behind this part of history, while also giving warnings that are eerily relevant to today's society and the present threat of nuclear warfare. Nolan skillfully weaves emotion and ethics through his portrayal of these historical events, creating an eye-opening depiction of this chapter of history that sends chills through the audiences. The British-American filmmaker once again asserts himself as someone who can deliver stunning feats of cinema again and again without flaw, making ""Oppenheimer"" the latest stunning edition of his applauded filmography. The film forces its audience to confront the sheer danger and destruction that occurred during this period of history and shows just how close these scientists came to potentially ending the world and the entity of mankind. ""Oppenheimer"" covers a myriad of heavy themes throughout its three-hour runtime, including loyalty to your family and your country, destruction of both one man and the entity of mankind, and the dangers of science. The themes blend together with the performances and stunning technical aspects to create a thought-provoking film that raises its own questions. 

Typical of Nolan's films, ""Oppenheimer"" is bolstered and bettered by its marvellous technical aspects on show throughout the film. Nolan reunited with Oscar-winner Ludwig G√∂ransson for the film's score after previously working with the Swedish composer on the score for his previous film ""Tenet"". G√∂ransson crafts a magnificent score that builds tension and dread in all the right places with a constantly changing tempo that reflects the tone flawlessly. Nolan's long desire to make a film about Oppenheimer translates into a stunning film powered by a compelling screenplay. His decision to portray some parts of the film directly from Oppenheimer's perspective, as well as write the script from his POV, is met with stellar results as it brings a unique look at one of the darkest chapters of modern history. Frequent Nolan collaborator Hoyte van Hoytema provides the film with gorgeous cinematography that makes ""Oppenheimer"" a visual feast and easily one of the best looking films of the year. 

Performances and technical aspects marry together in ""Oppenheimer"" to create a masterful piece of cinema fuelled by a powerhouse performance from Cillian Murphy. Nolan's monstrous affair tells the story of how one man and a group of scientists forever changed the world in 1945 from a makeshift town located in the middle of the Los Alamos desert. The culmination of people's work on the film results in a mammoth three-hour biopic that can easily be considered one of the best films of this year.",POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2023","For a film nearly three hours long, this leaves you wondering what more might you have missed by not having read the book that it was based upon.  Although obviously based on factual events, some of which filmgoers are familiar, the script, event jumbling, acting and styling of the movie still make it an outstanding adventure.  See it in the theater!",POSITIVE

"Aug 6, 2023","I don't think it needed the few explicit nudity scenes thrown in, they seemed mostly out of place in a somber, intense, thought provoiking movie...the point of Oppenheimer's emotional state, even sexually, could have been expressed, specifically without the ""chair"" sex scene during the mock trial.",NEUTRAL

"Aug 6, 2023",3 hours of a preview. disjointed filming. i think maybe that was just the metaphor for the whole manhattan project. but as a film it didn't work. too long for a story i already knew with very little extra information to fill 3 hours.,NEGATIVE
"Aug 6, 2023",Acting was superb. Story compelling and well-told. Oscar nominations should be plentiful.,POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2023","PROS Some amazing acting from the cast, Cillian Murphy, Matt Damon and Emily Blunt were particular standouts for me.

I did enjoy the dialogue content, but I hated its delivery (see below).

CONS Rapid fire edits throughout the entire movie made it very difficult to follow the storyline, I don't think more than 3 or 4 mins was spent on each scene - which was not enjoyable for a 3hr long movie.

VERY dialogue heavy - combined with the fast edits above, it felt like they were trying to cram too much into 3 hrs. And it's okay to have fast conversations in each scene, but then it jumps to the next fast-paced conversation scene, and the next and so forth. There was no time to digest the weight of what just happened or what was discussed!

Poor visual storytelling - the fast edits + dialogue heavy script combined made it feel like the cinema format was not properly delivered, and it felt like I was being TOLD what was happening, not SHOWN. Based on this, I probably could‚Äòbe just listened to this movie like an audiobook, and had the same experience. 

No emotive storytelling either - when I finally figured out Oppenheimer was a person (and the main character) I thought this would become an emotional story about his life, relationships, aspirations and fears. Instead, it felt more like a rapid-fire roll call of his personal and work resume - almost like a documentary. It also means there's no character development for anyone whatsoever throughout an entire 3 hr movie.

Strange sound design in some parts - there were some parts when the actors were speaking (eg Emily Blunt) and I had no idea what she saying, so much so it made me wish the cinema had included subtitles!! Surely I could expect more for a $100M movie?

Not a movie I'd watch again, and not understanding why this is considered a ‚Äòmasterpiece'.",NEGATIVE

"Aug 6, 2023","Visual Grandeur vs. Narrative Depth.

Despite the anticipation surrounding Christopher Nolan's latest work, the film might not meet all expectations. The grandiosity of the movie, driven partly by Nolan's stellar reputation and the extensive marketing, creates a halo effect that might be misleading.

The casting of Cillian Murphy in the lead role under Nolan's direction is a welcome decision, and his remarkable performance rightly takes center stage. However, the inclusion of over 21 celebrity cameos appears as an unneeded distraction, drawing attention away from the central narrative and undermining Murphy's role.

Concerns also arise around the film's pacing. From the beginning, it plunges into a frantic tempo that continues relentlessly throughout. While this pace might be fitting for certain plot elements‚Äîsuch as racing against the Germans/Russians‚Äîthe unyielding speed becomes disorienting. Quick scene cuts and often inaudible dialogue further contribute to the confusion.

This incessant pace, though potentially intentional, restricts the artistry's room to breathe. The audience is left with little chance to immerse themselves and ""feel"" the film. With an expansive budget and a three-hour runtime, the rush to include substantial footage feels more like an attempt to justify the spending rather than letting the narrative unfold organically.

Nevertheless, the movie's merits are undeniable. The visual splendor, combined with a beautiful musical score and Murphy's compelling performance, enriches the film's artistic value. Still, these qualities, as exceptional as they may be, do not suffice to label the work as a masterpiece.

The conclusion to be drawn from Nolan's latest creation is that, while there is much to admire, certain choices undermine its overall impact. It might not connect with everyone, especially those seeking a more cohesive and immersive cinematic journey. The film shines in parts but may disappoint viewers expecting more than a Hollywood spectacle.

Reflecting further, the true core of the story seems lost in the spectacle surrounding it. Nolan's name, the Hollywood cameos, the dominant score, and the grand IMAX visuals all contribute to the narrative receding into the background. The film's indulgence in cinematic glamour, though visually and auditorily thrilling, risks losing storytelling's essence. The intricate weave of characters, emotions, and themes gets overshadowed, tilting the balance towards appearance over depth. The result is a dazzling yet soul-unsatisfying movie that comes across more as a Hollywood extravaganza than a poignant human drama.",NEUTRAL

Best of the year or years since I saw Schindler's List. Shocking story of what happened. Really original film. The only aspect I didn't like was the actress Emily Blunt.

While I was pretty knowledgeable about WW2, I knew very little about nuclear testing. I find myself wanting to learn more about this part of history.

At least I won't have to build time into my schedule to watch this during award season before voting on performances.

I saw it in 70mm film, not IMAX. Given what I saw, it wouldn't make a difference to me. Film grain and scratches are distracting. The nostalgia factor of seeing a film on film is something that I got over quickly and I wished I chose a digital showing instead. Sound was ok. Cinematography left a lot to be desired.

I was confuse on how we got from the pseudo trial of Oppenheimer, to the congress hearing (in black and white). The music is fun and special. The length of the movie was a bit much for me, but it's hard to say what should have been cut. Oppenheimer was a complicated person after all. I give it 92%. Not a real documentary but clause enough to historical facts. Nolan was masterful in it's craft here. So did the majority of the actors. That made me think of Thirteen Days, in terms of acting performance.",POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2023",Hands down the best movie of the year. Well acted and thoughtful while also riveting. The four leads are standouts.,POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2023",So unnecessarily long. Could have cut out lots of scenes to make it more digestible. Also unnecessary nude scenes. Never understand those and never will. I felt as though I saw more boob than atomic bomb. This movie was a snooze and was weird,NEGATIVE
"Aug 6, 2023","A terrific film about the complex life of the J. Robert Oppenheimer, and his involvement in the development of the atomic bomb! Another triumph for Christopher Nolan! Grade: A",POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2023","This is a great movie and plays out a monumental time in history.  Though this ended a war, the creation of the A-bomb lead to careless nuclear testing throughout the country and lots of cancer especially in children.",POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2023",Seems American government has changed very little.,POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2023",Wonderful movie - Great story and wonderful actors,POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2023",Kept the interest moving along in such an intense film.,POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2023","Methodically done. Nolan's work is phenomenal. The frame with Florence and Cillian in the chairs , looked like a painting by Matisse. The pieces of flesh and skeleton's, of the Japanese, floating into the shot were artful and all that was needed. 
Cillian Murphy gives a stellar performance as Oppenheimer. He is focused and determined as the father of the atomic bomb. His eyes so full of light and darkness at the same time. How do you do that? Many accolades ahead. Also Robert Downey Jr was impressive. My favourite performance of his. Loved seeing him play this kind of role. All the cast brought the A game. This is Chris Nolan's genius! The script tells the story so movingly. The journey of a man 
who was needed then discarded A man so brilliant yet so unsure. A person of great passion yet very serious. It was all there in the script. Also the horrific power of this bomb It's  deadly force which was brought to life on the screen.  What could be ahead? Nolan's vision of The Manhattan Project is timely and thought provoking. A Master piece!",POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2023",Definitely deserves to run the table at the Oscar's this year!  Best movie I've ever seen and that's saying something!!!!,POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2023",It just astounded me how they treated Oppenheimer..  it amazes me how people in power can ruin  other people with their 1/2 truths,POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2023","Oppenheimer is the type of movie to have you root for the people who made the nuclear bomb. You leave the theater feeling unsafe. And it goes further than what was advertised in the trailers, where it's more about his life and what he faced after he made the bombs. It never gives a simple answer with twists throughout. This is a slow movie though so if you're not up to sitting in a theater for 3 hours watching people talking, then this might not be for you. This movie is about the characters, not about the explosions. It's an extremely interesting and compelling film. Great acting, it looks amazing. This is a must see film for everyone. It's better than Barbie, go watch it in theaters. 9.4/10",POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2023","The acting, visuals, directing, cinematography are all absolutely fantastic. The movie is far far too long and drags considerably because of this. Nolan overindulges and this should have been edited down to a much shorter movie. 

The story revolves around two court-like hearings, the development and science behind the atomic bomb is really not the focus of the movie. This makes the story very dry and quite boring.

The movie starts with interesting visuals when Oppenheimer is imagining atomic structures but this is dropped very quickly, why? I fully expected this to return later during the bomb test, showing us the steps of the explosion at the atomic level. Instead, there is a bright light and Cillian Murphy speaks those famous lines we all know will be in the movie. Then it's over. Then the movie keeps going, completely unnecessarily, for another hour or so.

Did this particular story need to be told? After seeing the movie, I don't actually think so.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 6, 2023",Engaging and engrossing. Never bored!! Highly recommend!,POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2023","Cillian Murphy and RDJr brought an acting class to this movie!  In depth story that utilizes color, b and w and creative uses of sound and explosions to create thought provoking piece.  Highly recommend, although some parts do go on longer than they should but nothing too egregious",POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2023","Why did they have those awful sex scenes in the movie.  It took away from the story.  They could have been showed talking without the nudity.
That's why I didn't give it 5 stars.",POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2023","This is absolutely a masterpiece, it's wonderful and complete. It's like a gift from god. It's an awesome experience. Congratulations to the director and the cast, the team; to everyone that make this movie was possible. Yeah, this is cinema lady's and gentleman's.",POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2023","Very good movie.  Three stories intervowen: Oppenheimer's life and its framing before The Manhattan Project, The Manhattan Project itself, and then his moral quandry and political fallout behind his legacy of being the father of the A-bomb, his association with Communism, and his expressed dubiousness of inventing thermonuclear weapons.

The movie lost a star because the stakes, triumph, and destructive power of Trinity were still understated even though the movie made the test a major plot point.",POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2023",Made a rotten tomatoes account just to rate this movie 5 stars. would rate it 6 if i could,POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2023","Very informative, a little slow going but still a good movie. Wish it gave more detail of what happened to him in the years he did not get security clearance. What he did before the truth was told.",POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2023",It was a great movie from beginning to end. Great plot.,POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2023",Oppenheimer consists of tremendous performances by multiple members of the cast along with breathtaking visuals that will leave audiences in awe. This film definitely lived up to the hype and is worth seeing a plethora of times.,POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2023",Film hopefully corrected the reputation of Oppenheimer. It could have been 1/2-3/4 of an hour shorter and still make the points.,POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2023","Great movie, just a little too long",POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2023",A cinematic masterpiece! The best movie Ive seen in years. Phenomenal cast and acting was superb.,POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2023",Historical interesting great acting but too long. Wish I waited to watch it at home,POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2023",I predict an Academy Award for Robert Downey Jr.,POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2023",Very interesting well done!,POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2023","Extremely good movie, that kept moving forward. It was a 3 hour movie, that did not feel like it. Very Good supporting cast.",POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2023",Fantastic. Time well spent on a quality film ‚Äîa rarity these days. Highly recommend. Cillian well earned an Oscar - incredible performance by him and this outstanding cast.,POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2023",Interesting story. A little long.,POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2023",Did not like hearing God‚Äôs name taken in vein. But then hollywood has become a Godless cesspool. Other than that the movie was boring.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 6, 2023",Cinematography was really amazing - the back and forth in history was really well done.  Great historical narrative of this time during World War II.,POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2023",Long and dry at times. Great acting,POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2023",Intense movie with great actors.,POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2023",We related to the timing since we were children listening to the Motorola during WW2.,POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023",The movie was excellent. Phenomenal cast and interesting story. BUT the audio was so loud as to be oppressive. Not so much the dialogue and the musical track. I had a huge headache after 3 hours of it.,POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","Saw it based on other good reviews Id seen.  However, I really didnt like this movie.  Kept jumping around in time, I couldnt tell who the characters were. And seemed to be no character development.   I just really didnt think it was a good script or story.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 5, 2023",Oppenheimer was a well made movie but cross cutting was terribly confusing. They spent way too much on Senate hearings Oppenheimer investigation. They could have easily cut 30 minutes from the film. The best part of the film was Robert Downey jr. although it took me most of the fin to understand his role.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 5, 2023","Bomb go boom, Robert slanging that cockenheimer",POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","It was a good movie if you understood all about atomic 
Bomb If you just wanted  to be entertained I give it a thumbs down. So I thought the acting was really good.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 5, 2023",Excellent documentary .,POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","Oscar worthy performance by Cillian Murphy.  Nolan employed his usual cast of character actors with great work by Downey Jr and Matt Damon.  Sometimes the score would drown out the dialogue, but that just may have been the theater.",POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023",Kept my interest from beginning to the end.,POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","Segunda guerra mundial, el f√≠sico Julius Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) dentro del Proyecto Manhattan, crea ensayos nucleares para construir la bomba para EEUU. Una vez ve creada reflexiona sobre su creaci√≥n y desde entonces su vida depender√° del uso de armas nucleares. 

NUESTRO GALACTUS

Wow, qui√©n iba a decir en aquella √©poca, los 40, que ya tendr√≠amos creado el arma m√°s letal y destructora c√≥mo ha sido la bomba at√≥mica, creada por J. Robert Oppenheimer, un f√≠sico neoyorquino de 1904 de or√≠gen jud√≠o. No s√© c√≥mo vivi√≥ esa experiencia el ser humano pero en la sala del cine la he vivido c√≥mo si fuera real con los temblores de las butacas. Adem√°s de que me toc√≥ reservarlas en la 2a fila. Con los pelos de punta hasta el final.

Christopher Nolan regresa a las pantallas despu√©s de Tenet para demostrar una vez m√°s que puede hacer lo que quiera, cont√°ndonos en este caso la biograf√≠a de Oppie (Cillian Murphy) y el monstruo que cre√≥ con el Proyecto Manhattan, lanzado en Hiroshima y Nagasaki en nombre de Harry Truman (Gary Oldman, el James Gordon de El Caballero Oscuro, obras maestras de nuestro Nolan), 33o presidente de EEUU, que acab√≥ con la guerra en 1945. 

TRES HORAS, PERO NOLAN HACE QUE NO QUIERA MIRAR EL RELOJ.

Sonar√° muy t√≠pico, pero es uno de mis directores favoritos hasta el momento, aunque a√∫n me falta mucho director por descubrir, pero me hace sentir algo diferente a los dem√°s, es t√°n perfeccionista con cada segundo de la trama. Sus historias me fascinan, crea de ellas una paradoja y las vuelve lo m√°s intimista posible. Nos hace pensar, reflexionar. Tratar temas que en nuestro d√≠a a d√≠a no cobran vida. Le puede salir mejor o peor pero su huella no desaparece y le reconocemos.

No quiero estropear la pel√≠cula con mis palabras. Pero cada vez que la veo me emociono m√°s. Nolan no solo nos trae una pel√≠cula hist√≥rica cuyo tiempo no abruma porque est√° perfectamente narrada. Es una reflexi√≥n de lo m√°s profunda sobre la moralidad de la ciencia y la condici√≥n humana a√±adiendo una banda sonora excelente que te hace ver las mismas visiones que tiene Robert, son incre√≠bles. Al salir del cine guard√© instant√°neamente la banda sonora en mi playlist. 

Y por si fuera poco, tambi√©n tenemos el lujo de presenciar actuaciones merecedoras de Oscar y merecidas de Cillian (Oppenheimer) y Robert Downey JR (Lewis Strauss), s√≥lo estos dos pueden protagonizar a estos grandes personajes que te obligan a adentrarte en ellos entendiendo todos sus puntos d√©biles y fuertes, los hacen cre√≠bles y conmovedores. Aunque los personajes femeninos no hayan tenido tanto papel en esta, tenemos a una Emily Blunt (Kitty Oppenheimer) poderosa, con unas reacciones faciales y frases fuertes, con gusto de presenciar. Lo mismo opino de la encantadora Florence Pugh (Jean Tatlock) que me ha hecho la historia m√°s amena cuando ella aparec√≠a. Pocos momentos pero fabulosos. 

En general, el reparto es brutal, hay int√©rpretes que no han tenido tanto protagonismo pero se nota que tienen que estar ah√≠: Rami Malek (David L. Hill), me encanta este hombre, Josh Peck (Kenneth Bainbridge), David Dastmalchian, Dane DeHaan (Kenneth Nichols). Y el gran Tom Conti interpretando al f√≠sico Albert Einstein, y muchos m√°s. 

M√°s pel√≠culas as√≠ necesitamos en el cine y presenciarlas con inquietud, que te lancen esas sensaciones c√≥mo hace esta historia, que hoy en d√≠a poca gente experimenta, a veces por obligaci√≥n social. Y se agradece, incluso emociona. Que bonito es el cine. Y c√≥mo lo echo de menos cada vez que salgo de √©l.

"Aug 5, 2023",Riveting performances and an in depth dive into Oppenheimer.,POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023",Amazing Movie!! Christopher Nolan deserves an Oscar for this film ! The whole cast is Amazing!,POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023",Not as good as hoped/advertised. Long. But a decent watch for sure. More documentary than entertaining movie.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 5, 2023",Movie was excellent!,POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","Epitome of acting, direction and cinematography. It's hard to express how great this movie was. So sad this generation will understand what this movie stands for. Waiting for more Nolan movie's.",POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","Just saw Oppenheimer, kept waiting for Tommy's Crew to deliver some hurt in the name of the Peaky Blinders. It was hard to get over that and one of the other characters was the man who Shot Jesse James. Hard to get over that. Not my idea of physicists.

The movie was too long. The political slant was also hard to ignore. I imagine the left loves this movie.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","Run, don‚Äôt walk. Go see it!! Best movie in years. WOW!",POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","Feels like the movie was written by a lawyer. How can you make a movie so boring and void of emotional impact? This movie is about politics. Not a single frame shows any actual impact the atomic bombs can cause. The guy who sat in front of me left in the middle of the film, my wife fell asleep and i was constantly thinking when does the movie start.
What a waste of time.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","loved it
very intense and informative the whole way thru
Cillian Murphy and R Downy Jr both amazing",POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023",Excellent movie - conflict between human Americans highly engaging and troubling,POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023",Great historical account. Excellent acting ensemble.,POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","Great movie! Great soundtrack, good acting and very historical. It's one of Christopher Nolan's best movies. I liked seeing a lot of established and actors that I haven't seen in a while in the movie. Definitely a must watch.",POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023",I saw it with my 47 year old son and we both found it entertaining and informative.,POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023",A masterpiece of film,POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","Though it was three hours, I was glad nothing was cut. Everything added to understanding the era, the man, the world he was in. The movie moved fast. I was never bored.  Even the science was understanable.
The only bad thing was that Robert Downey Jr and Matt Damon did not disaappear into their characters. You never forgot that it was them. The other actors were absolutely brilliant. Cillian Murphy was mesmerizing. Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh were brilliant. Even Josh Harnett, Ravi Malek, Kenneth Branaugh, Matthew Modine disappeared into their roles.",POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023",Ein absolutes neues Meisterwerk von Herr NOLAN. Der perfekte Film f√ºr den Unterricht !!!!,POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023",Incredibly made biopic. Can not recommend enough. I have seen this twice and already and still want to see it again.,POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023",Long movie with a lot of dialog. When Nolan wants you to feel something he turns up the volume to 11.  Seems overly indulgent.,NEGATIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","Reci√©n salgo de verla, no era lo que esperaba, tal vez le puse mucha expectativa. 
Pero, en mi defensa, eran Nolan y Cillian Murphy con tremendo reparto, no hab√≠a forma de no ilusionarse. 
La primera hora es infumable, no avanza m√°s, hay mucho palabrer√≠o cient√≠fico con excesivo dramatismo, como era de esperar. Soy f√≠sica, y uno no se pone as√≠ al escribir en un pizarr√≥n o al charlar con colegas, pero como dec√≠a, era de esperar ese dramatismo, pasa siempre en pel√≠culas sobre ciencia (como en La Teor√≠a de todo).
Luego se pone mejor, me emocion√© hasta las l√°grimas con el ""Now I Am Become Death, the Destroyer of Worlds"".
Aunque creo que podr√≠an haber profundizado mucho m√°s en la √©tica cient√≠fica y en el hecho de no sentir l√°stima por Oppenheimer, todo cient√≠fico que se mete en eso sabe lo que hace.
Definitivamente, no est√° ni en mi top 10 de Nolan.
Para pasar el rato est√° ok.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 5, 2023",Cillian Murphy is fantastic. RDJ as captivating as ever. The film doesn't feel as long as it is as Christopher Nolan takes you through brilliant plot of the Father of the Atomic Bomb,POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","""a few peoples laughed, a few people cried, most people were silent.""  ""i am become death destroyer of worlds.""

amazing movie if you fall asleep and or don't like it you're an idiot who only thinks mid ass fighting movies are good and are too dumb to realize good writing since you've numbed your brain with pure trash. 10/10 movie",POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023",Spectacular!! Cillian Murphy was magnificent!!!,POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","Certainly not for me. Though it was intelligent with an amazing cast, it was far too long and too boring to keep my attention. It felt to me that most if not all of this movie was scripted interviews and lectures. It was mostly talking while our main character stares into space. I was ready for it to be over an hour in, and still had two hours to sit through. However, with that being said, a lot of history was in this movie and it was a very educational film that was well filmed and directed.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 5, 2023",Phenomenal. Outstanding acting and a gripping story.,POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","This movie is unquestionably the best movie I have ever seen, It is truly a masterpiece.",POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","That movie totally blew me away. Great acting, great cinematograph, great directing. However, one needs a bit of curiosity in world history to fully enjoy it as it is mostly conversation based and pretty long",POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","I thought this movie was great. It's not for everyone due to it being 3 hours long. But, the acting was superb, visuals amazing, soundtrack comparable to Interstellar, and the story was great (some inaccuracies but it was still a fantastic watch.) I give it five stars, because as most five star movies are, this is definitely a must see.",POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023",I wasn't big brain to understand,POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023",Incredible acting for the most part. Well done,POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","The story is amazing.  The acting was superb.  But in my opinion the film was overdramatized, choppy, and contained unnecessary nudity that we didn't need to see.   The plot jumped around too much making it challenging to follow the numerous characters.  Sometimes a movie is more powerful when it's told in a simple straightforward way without all the artistic dramatization.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 5, 2023","I thought it was visually stunning, but I lost interest in the middle of the movie and came back toward the end.",POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","Masterpiece, top to bottom. Acting, Cinematography, Score. Just amazing. Better win Best Picture",POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","Room for improvement, but pretty good movie as a whole. Especially considering the length of it, any movie of that length has to be somewhat decent, otherwise it would quickly get bad reviews.",POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","There were parts that were too sciency for me, and I got lost. But that's just me, and it didn't impact the story as a whole.  Sometimes the musical score was so loud, that it was hard to hear what they were saying, so I may have missed some details, especially with different accents.  Lots of complex characters and stellar acting by everyone.  It was such a rollercoaster",POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","The best movie i've ever seen, 10 out of 10.",POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","Should win at least Best Actor award, and Best Picture",POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","Brilliant, beautifully paced, stellar performances. Very serious subject, sad. Don't go tired unless you're a history lecturer, you need to keep up. A masterpiece. Cillian Murphy owned it without overplaying it, perfect performance.",POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","Flawless cast and riveting detailed story about the events that would change our world forever. Its a long movie, yet a shorter film would not have been possible. A MUST see!",POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","Oppenheimer has been my most anticipated movie ever since it was announced. The hype going into this movie for me was absurd. Every single expectation I had for this was met and exceeded. Christopher Nolan's direction was astonishing. It blew my mind seeing some of the scenes he made. The writing was perfect and I loved the way how the movie jumped through time. The editing was incredible and it made every scene so much better. The sound design is what made this movie. It single-handedly made this movie stand out from any other Christopher Nolan movie I've seen. The bomb test scene is probably the most extraordinary scene I've ever seen in a theater. I need to see this movie again and again. I never thought I'd say this but it rivals Interstellar in terms of Christopher Nolan films. I'm genuinely astonished at how incredible this was. This is, without a doubt, the best movie of 2023 as of July 20th.",POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","Wow - we'll hear ""Oppenheimer"" several times at the Academy Awards next year!",POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","Great movie, VERY long, but moves at a really good pace.",POSITIVE

"Aug 5, 2023",The ultimate cinema experience,POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023",Fabulous job telling the story of a flawed hero,POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023",Nolan does it again. Oppenheimer has so many levels but is manageable for most viewers to follow. From the physics to the story behind each scientist involved. From the politics to the morality of building such a beautiful but frightening creation. It won't be everyone's cup of tea but can't deny it was brilliantly shot.,POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023",Outstanding movie Nolan's best to date,POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023",Such a great film! Cillian Murphy deserves an Oscar for this film.,POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","This movie really is a masterpiece. See it in IMAX if possible. The storyline, script, visuals, actors, sound and score are on point. I really can't think of a single critical thing to say about it, and even at three hours the time flew by. Memorable and worth a second viewing.",POSITIVE

Even better than Barbie",POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023",this is a really deep movie. makes you think,POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","Great acting. Great story.
The dialogues should have been more audible. Very difficult to follow the conversations with the constant background score (and without subtitles).
Whole movie has no positive note of background score/lighting. Ranging from serious to negative tone.",NEUTRAL

"Aug 5, 2023",imax 70mm full screen projection without interferance. reclyning seats with pre selection to avoid long wait. well producted film tells a story in a quick paced - thrilling fashion.  A few scenes could be removed to shorten viewing time. a must see in imax for honest movie experience.,POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023",Beautifully shot and sequences interspersed to keep it interesting but it was far too long and boring in the middle for me. Great cast too but just felt it should have been two hours or less.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 5, 2023",Easily the best movie of the year! Emily Blunt and Cillian Murphy was outstanding again as they were in Quite Place. The nudity was unnecessary but overall I give it a 9.9 out of 10. This will be a longtime classic unlike most of the movies being pumped out today which will be forgettable.,POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","This movie was 3 hours long and fascinating.  But the sound editing or the absence of ADR was such a terrible distraction.  There was LOUD music over much of the dialogue so that I missed relevant facts that prevented me from really knowing the entire story of Oppenheimer and his ultimate relationship with the government.  My understanding is that Mr. Nolan does not like ADR and so that is his choice, but I found it extremely annoying as did many of the other people in the theater.  I went back to see it a 2nd time (which I imagine many people will) and that should make Universal happy (and Nolan if he has points).",NEUTRAL

She's a great example of an intelligent strong woman. Especially considering the time she lived in during the early 20th century. In real life she played a very important part in the project, and made significant contributions in the fields of nuclear and particle physics.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 5, 2023","Loved it. Have now seen it three times. It's a must see in cinemas, the feeling of the score played on a cinema surround sound system and extremely beautiful shots on the big screen cannot be replicated any other place than at the cinemas.

"Aug 5, 2023",Very entertaining and educational,POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","It was a great story but could have been edited better and was IMHO too long.  The story in 3 acts felt a bit out of order and perhaps should have culminated with the Los Alamos test.  Aside from that, would very much recommend.",POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023",Although not action packed. Nolan was able to keep you on the edge of your seat with magnificent production and storytelling.,POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023",Another absolutely engrossing Nolan movie where he gets the best out of every top tier actor involved. Clearly actors are dying to work with him because it seems like every scene has another A list actor happy to say just one or two lines and give it their all. 3 hours moves and feels like 2. I wish Nolan would prioritize dialogue clarity a bit more in the sound mixing (though it's not as bad as Tenet and Dark Knight Rises) but otherwise another sensational movie only Nolan could have made,POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","The pacing was good, and as long as you go in expecting a biopic and not just a history of the Manhattan project, youll be pleased.

"Aug 5, 2023",I understood like 20% of it but it was still really good. Some scenes were unnecessary which is why I'm giving it a four star,POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","I loved this movie. Cillian Murphy was utterly believable the entire way through. Emily Blunt was fantastic and this was probably the best I've ever seen from Robert Downey Jr.  The pacing was excellent- Nolan pulls the viewer along and provides an intensity that you'd normally experience in an action movie or thriller. Combined with that you feel the struggle and anguish that came with creating a weapon of mass destruction and knowing what was being unleashed.

The story, the acting, the score and the visual effects were second to none. Christopher Nolan has once again achieved an incredible success and remains one of my favourite directors.",POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","Oppenheimer, a sort of biopic dedicated to the creator of the atomic bomb and director Christopher Nolan's obsession with time. Right at the beginning the film is divided into fission and fusion, terms that correspond as a timeline to Oppenheimer's story. In the first division we find the protagonist in his younger period in Europe, then in the USA and his involvement with the communist party and the Manhattan Project. Fus√£o, on the other hand, is related to the ""future"", differing by the use of black and white on the scene. At a certain point, this timeline will end up clashing, which I thought was an excellent idea, an excellent metaphor to follow when the film is about the life of the creator and father of the bomb, as well as its explosion itself.

The film is not mostly about the bomb, or a historical drama, or an autobiography, the feature works well as a character study, making the project more intimate and much more tense, however, without the great action sequences that some of the director's films bring. . We are faced with long moral, ethical and also social dialogues about the impact and the decision to use the material produced in the midst of a war scenario. The famous ""what if?"" in my view it is like a dome in the narrative. If the Americans didn't do it, the Germans could do it, or the Russians, one way or another there would be a big explosion.

Nolan and his team managed to create a real explosion in miniature, with elements that simulated the brightness of the mushroom cloud, and the footage was taken very close, the result of which was seen and felt on screen. And it's really mad at the moment.

Oppenheimer is a dense, mature, objective, intelligent film and an instigation to the most inappetizing productions for cinema. The atmosphere that the film creates from its beginning to its end is a mutation and explosion worthy of a bomb, while valuing the viewer's intelligence.

This Is Cinema",POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023",Tell don't show experience üëé,NEGATIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","Pace, complexity, nuance",POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023",Outstanding. It‚Äôs a 3 hour movie that feels like a 2 hour movie. In the best way. Must see.,POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","Only Christopher Nolan could take a truly fascinating story from history, and coat it in such an overwhelming thick layer of Nolan-ness to leave the viewer more bewildered than engaged.

Watching ""Oppenheimer"" felt like watching The Prestige, Memento, and Interstellar simultaneously: too loud, too jumbled, too long. Overwhelming spectacle but lacking actual intimacy with the characters. Typical Nolan, in other words.

There are some flashes of good moments. But the whole thing just doesn't come together in any coherent way for me. Somehow in three hours, Nolan didn't find time to get me to care about any of the characters *or* the focal events of the movie (two confirmation hearings). He tried to turn it into the Prestige or Memento and I just don't think it worked for this story.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 5, 2023",This movie doesn't limited itself within just a bomb blast. It didn't justify or discredits someone. They way it brings us inside the mind and thoughts of characters are deeply impactful. It's a movie to think about and even might give you some answer about yourself if you see it right and wise.,POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023",The storyline was fine. The nudity and graphic sexual behavior was totally unnecessary. Had I known it was in the movie I would have chosen another movie.,NEGATIVE
"Aug 5, 2023",Frenetic energy starts this film and keeps the pace going with an amazing score all the way to the end. Nolan has done it again.,POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","To start, I have seen Oppenheimer 10 times all in different formats ( IMAX, Dolby, 70mm etc) I believe this is Christopher Nolan‚Äôs masterpiece. He is running on all cylinders in very way. Wheee I was completely in gaged in the characters work, dialogue, production design, the score , sound mixing & editing . I believe this film will stand the rest of time and will be remembered as a classic & Nolan‚Äôs best work so far ",POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023",Slow long boring. Great acting but horrible horrible story and script. Slow slow slow. Wanted to leave before end.,NEGATIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","I really didn't want to go but glad I did. It was better than I expected. Not a lot of action, so you had to follow the dialog to keep up. The end of the movie was very similar to what is actually happening today with the Trump indictments.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 5, 2023","I haven't seen Barbie so maybe that's the one, but for me, this is the most overrated movie of this decade... absolutely zero reason to see it in Imax and my God I miss Hans Zimmer working with Nolan. Don't remember a single bit of the score. Which was such a big reason why Nolan's films held up so well",NEGATIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","Quantum physics. Not a subject that Im remotely interested in or understand. However thats not necessary to enjoy this film. The human elements of a genius are at work here. Loved that he, and many others involved in this project, struggled with the impact their work had on the world. We still have the effects of this today. Also loved that Einstein was in the mix.",POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","A Movie that is a neccessity to see. The last scene alone is just haunting.

Extremely well acted, extremely well composed, visually stunning, incredible sound product.

Just all round an incredible film.",POSITIVE

"Aug 5, 2023","GREAT MOVIE! I learned so much about that time in history, The movie was long, but kept you interested and at the edge of your seat.",POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","Fantastic movie. I went in with the expectation that I would like the film, but being 3 hours long that it would drag on at some point(s). This was not the case. Brilliant acting and tremendous writing kept me fully engaged and entertained throughout. The musical score also does a good job in setting the scenes. I saw it opening afternoon in a regular IMAX, the following week in a regular theater, and seeing it again tonight in IMAX 70mm - the format Christopher Nolan himself says is the best way to watch it. It's THAT good that I wouldn't forgive myself for not seeing it in this format.",POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023",Really great movie 10/10 would see it again you can really tell they did research about it before making the film,POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","Interesting narrative from Mr. Oppenheimer's point of view and his internal conflicts and contradictions. Superb use of images in contrasts with sounds/silences. I found however unbearable that it's entirely made of dialogues with a constant background music, as if it was a soap opera. Deffo not the best Nolan, as limited by a real history.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 5, 2023","To watch this movie you need to be interested in physics and history, so not everyone will like it. But I can say one thing, it's a movie worth watching. It is very interesting and valuable. I recommend this movie for anyone who is curious about how the most deadly weapon in history was created",POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023",The drama and complexity of the movie.,POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","IM TIRED Of movie companies and producers just making movie documentaries as well as some scenes were in black and white which I think knowbody is a fan of,and lastly the moive was way to long,A LOT OF people in the generation have short attention spans and know one can watch a moive for 3 hours,but the rest of the moive was alright.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 5, 2023",Just a well made movie from start to finish.,POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023",What a waste of cast and my time at the movie theater. By far Nolan's worst.,NEGATIVE

"Aug 5, 2023",Amazing to see in the 70mm codec!,POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","Volume was overall too loud, and had moments of intended shock by going from dead silence to a very loud sequence. Still, I feel that this movie is going to win awards for it sound design and editing.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 5, 2023","A cinematic masterpiece from Christopher Nolan. A great casting with immaculate performance all around. A perfect goal from the director after the disappointment from Tenet. Deserves all the hype. Anyone saying otherwise either didn't understood the movie or don't know how movies are made. 
The movie is no way perfect like others from the director but the positives outways the negative. 
Cillian finally gets the role he deserves. And other casts are great as well.",POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","Outstanding. Brilliant. Masterpiece. 

All the stellar actors in the movie were superb but if I have to choose from the bunch then it would obviously be Cillian Murphy and RDJ.",POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","This film is more of the same re-writing of history, in which we are supposed to believe that committing genocide on innocent people is OK if some people think it may end war.  Genocide is NEVER OK, and the rush to make the nuclear bomb and dropping it on innocent people in Japan was about world domination and racism, not ending war.    Yes, Oppenheimer came to regret his involvement later, but this may have had more to do with his persecution as a suspected communist by US authorities rather than true regret.   There is a legitimate question of whether Oppenheimer would have regretted anything if he was regarded as a hero by the US government rather than a suspect who gave away the nuclear secrets to the Russians.  Russia getting the bomb as well undermined US hegemony, which has always been the ultimate goal of the deep state, even today.    They talk about freedom and democracy, but when it comes right down to it, the US being on top of the world is all that really matters.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","I don‚Äôt understand all the five star reviews. I entered the cinema really wanting to like this. Instead I found it overwrought with intense, ceaseless dialogue and illogical editing. Monotonous and somewhat mind numbing. I wanted to leave a number of times but hung in there for perhaps some profound wrap up that never occurred. ",NEGATIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","Probably the worst film I can recall.  Excessive and unnecessary loud music.  I imagine the production/editing team must be Marvel Comic fans.

Pity the interesting subject matter was so badly treated",NEGATIVE

"Aug 5, 2023","Very good, very long",POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","Excellent movie, did not feel like 3 hours. Highly recommended",POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","first thoughts:
this is an incredibly horrifying movie. i am sad, and i am scared, and nobody seems to care. 

additional thoughts:
1. i believe people need to understand that when we try to play god, we actually become a god of sorts. that is a power that no one should have. 

2. i think that there is a lesson we all must revisit with this movie, a lesson as old as time ‚Äî that once fire catches, it catches quickly, and it is capable of casting both light and shadows.

final thoughts:
as people left the theater, someone said ""you should be happy."" remind me, again, what exactly it is that i should be happy about.",POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","Did not live up to the hype- so much jumping around and so much happening, yet felt like it dragged on. No emotional pull for any of the characters- overall a very big disappointment.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 5, 2023",I was so happy when Einstein appear and the name Heissenberg was mention,POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","The powerful narrative enhanced the suspense, direct and indirect characterization. The movie clearly explained the historical perspective of the time and had a twist at the climax that completed the story. Multiple award winner!",POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023",boring at the  beginning  but got better,NEUTRAL
"Aug 5, 2023","Well, to me, it was a great movie.. but is not the best movie of Nolan, and I also don't believe it is gonna be the best movie of the year. Will see. Is a historic movie, so I understand Nolan had to respect the story, but for me, it was too long. The last 1/2 hour was more for give some time to Robert JR (I suppose they both talked about the role and the time on the screen) but I seems to me Downey should do more in this movie, but early on.  put him until the end. It feels a waste of time. I guess it is because history is that way. but overall, I think it was a good movie. In the beginning, I felt I was watching the scenes of the movie, a beautiful mind of Russell Crowe. With that said, I believe the performances of all actors were top notch. my advice is if you get distracted easily, this one is not for you. You have to pay attention to keep the ritmo. Great job to Nolan, but to be honest, this is the first time i dont want to see a movie of him twice.",POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023",What I really liked about it where the stories of the Manhattan team that was assembled.,POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","What an incredible experience with 70mm. Not sure if I can justify the added cost and the 70mm benefits, I think it was an awesome experience but not sure if it was really worth it. Seeing it being on an actual paper film was neat though! Aside from that it's a great movie. Drama ofc but great story.",POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023",this movie sucks. it looks just a reshape of history and brain wash.,NEGATIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","Nudity and sex scenes unnecessary detraction from movie, making unsuitable for family viewing. Scene about poisoned apple possibly a lie and thus rather criminal to show. And the advertisements before the show were way, way, way too long and contained occultism and lude content which was something I deeply resent being exposed to, especially at the high cost of tickets.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","I had looked forward to Oppenheimer and wasnt disappointed. I thought it was well acted, extremely believable and true to history. The fact that his work was turned into a political weapon was tragic.",POSITIVE

Fantastically Written, Dynamic Edited and Powerful Historical Take Several Geniuses That Changed The World.
***
Writer, director and producer #ChristopherNolen created another triumph in filmmaking and I'll start this review with my only problem with the film ‚Äì the length. At 180 minutes long (3 hours) ‚Äì I barely made it all the way through ‚Äì however in the course of the first 2 hours at least 20 people in the packed theatre left and returned to relieve themselves. When movies in the 30's, 40's and 50's were made of this length ‚Äì intermissions were written in. Now because commerce wins over the experience ‚Äì even IMAX can't relieve your bladder. This is why I didn't give this film 5 stars. Unfortunately, being comfortable and not peeing in your pants is important to me.
***
About the film - #CillianMurphy does an award-winning performance as the oppressed genius Oppenheimer.  #EmilyBlunt portrays one of the confused wives of Oppenheimer. #MattDamon plays a military colonel who both hinders and eventually helps the cause of the heart of the story. #RobertDowneyJr pulls in an amazing ‚Äòbad guy' performance as egotistically driven republican senator that‚Ä¶.oh, spoilers‚Ä¶ Smaller but important roles went to great performances from both #RamiMalek and #KennethBranagh.
***
The story is about his life, colleagues and the realization of the world geniuses and their regret to becoming ‚ÄòGODS'.
***
With the cinematography by #HoytevanHoytema, the dynamic editing of the historic timeline and complicated script by editor Jennifer Lame and the accompanying signature heart-pounding score by #TheMandalorian's own #LudwigG√∂ransson ‚Äì this film is wonderfully entertaining.
***
Films these days are way to long. Do two-partners, add intermissions or read the script and cut and edit what isn't relevant to the characters or story. When doing epics ‚Äì never forget your audience. Great film ‚Äì you might enjoy it more in the comfort of your own home.

"Aug 5, 2023","If you don't enjoy history, documentaries, or facing the truth of our past, then you need to steer clear of this movie, I seen/heard alot of complaints exiting the movie from knuckle draggers, and mouth breathers that thought somehow this would be a JI joe type of film.

This movie was everything the trailers made it out to be, a man deep in thought, contemplating what he has done to the world and trying to justify it.
All the actors were amazing.",POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023",The movie kept me yearning for more,POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023",Interesting story around the lives who helped create the atomic bomb and fantastic dream-like visuals in the great mind of J. Robert Oppenheimer.,POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","Out of all of Nolan's movies, this one probably took me the longest to figure out how all of the different timelines fit together, but I think it is a very well made movie. Personally, I do think the insistence on not using CGI for the bomb resulted in something that was very obviously not a nuclear explosion. Still a good moment, but CGI could have improved it, imo. Visuals and score are top notch as always. See it in IMAX 70mm if you can! (or at least 4K HDR later)",POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","More about politics than the bomb,trailer way better than the film. Will probably win Oscars for performances but not a sign of an entertaining film. Also an hour to long.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","Too loud, too long. Technically well made except for the soundtrack, which played loudly in the background 99.99% of the time. For much of the movie I could barely make sense of what the characters were saying. I was getting bored after the first hour, but had another two hours to endure. Historically an important film, but history isn't always exciting.",NEGATIVE

"Aug 5, 2023",Absolutely phenomenal film. Christopher Nolan is a literal God at filmmaking.,POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","If I wanted to go deaf from a background sound track, I can think of lots of other movies to watch. The volume level of the soundtrack had my wife and I covering our ears repeatedly because of the volume at which the movie's soundtrack played was so loud it was painful. Then to make matters worse, the volume for the dialogue was low and difficult to make out. It's too bad they allowed background audio track to overwhelm the dialogue. Very unfortunate. Then let's add the faux sepia tone in the coloring, neither black and white nor color, which has been done way too many times. Can't imagine how this movie gets a 4 star rating in the Chicago papers. It sucked.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DONT BELIEVE THE HYPE. This movie was BAD, as in capital F effing awful. This was my birthday wish, to go to the flicks and I thought how could this go wrong, but man, was I wrong. Please don't trust rotten tomatoes. I can't trust them anymore. Everyone has given this pile of dog crap a good score. It doesn't deserve it. It was absolutely awful. Please believe me. It's over 3 hours of your life, you could literally be doing almost anything else and have a better time. If you're reading this to yourself or your partner and wondering whether or not you should watch it, please just know that I had to create a rotten tomato's account just to write this review, my first one, that's how Effing bad this movie was. Don't try it, I'm right.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","It is a good movie, but felt extremely choppy as they jumped back and forth between timeframes.  I would have liked to see more about the development of the bomb itself.

"Aug 5, 2023","I don't understand the rave reviews. To call it a masterpiece is pretty ridiculous. Too long of a movie thats drags through most of it. Based on the subject matter, I was looking for something more captivating. Decent acting but a boring film. Feel like I need to go see a proctologist now for the damage the theater seat did to my posterior.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 5, 2023",This movie is so longgggg and boring. I have no idea why there are any good reviews. They tried to hard and they could have cut out 1 hour of the trial and the movie would have been a thousand times better. Everyone in the theater was just happy to leave when it finally ended!! Don't watch this.,NEGATIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","The perfect anti-Marvel film... at last we got, hands down, the movie that Zoomers deserved, perhaps even a generational film event of the likes of Pulp Fiction and The Matrix. Oppenheimer lights up people's intelligence and curiosity instead reducing them to TikTok level as the blockbusters of the last few years have been doing.

But anyone regardless the age that has grown a brain and has a minimum of interest in history will love this, and this is also a pleaser for the scientists out there, and to them one major educational film about moral choices in the evermore-compromising STEM careers. 

I could only repeat the mild critic raised by others about the soundtrack being sometimes maybe a bit too much... but like it's being said at the start of the film during Robert's university years, you can't understand the universe properly without learning from the music. 

The editing is hectic, yet the back-and-forth doesn't look too confusing. At some point during that long mock trial that makes up most of the third act, I was wondering where it was going, how it would end, but then... BAM, out of the blue Nolan once again came up with a glorious, in-your-face conclusion, as answer to a mystery left open during the whole movie. Thumbs up for the storytelling.

After a few blunders in his last productions (Dark Knight Rises, Tenet... even Interstellar deserved a level of criticism for the whack storytelling), Nolan is serving us with a fine work of art of profound philosophical value, disguised as a blockbuster.",POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023",It was exceptionally accurate and sad .,POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","Yes, a must-see. A bit slow in the beginning, but comes together as it progresses. Some great special effects for Oppenheimer's surreal struggles with the realities of his work, and of course for the explosion scenes. And overall outstanding acting",POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","Excellent in every way and very thought provoking, especially in the times we live in.",POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","It was a fine movie until Benny Safdie attempted whatever dialect that was, and then Casey Affleck mumbled through another role, but other than that!",POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","It's a good movie, but is flawed. The sound carried the movie hard. But the interpersonal relationships take focus. Which isn't an issue, but there is simply too many of them for me to fully care. I also went into this expecting more discussion about theory and the process of building the a bomb and felt that it was lacking. It also bounced around way to much. Felt like a chore at times and for a movie that's already extremely long it suffers from it. I can't say I didn't enjoy it. Because I did, but this is definitely a movie that I'm gonna need a good 5 years before id feel like revisiting. Go out and see it, but temper your expectations.",NEGATIVE

Incredible cast, incredible cinematography and the sound in the 700mm IMAX was OUTSTANDING.

Instant 100% masterpiece of a movie. Cannot explain in words how good this movie experience was‚Ä¶which is exactly what is was. A true movie experience and it was just beautiful. 

There's suspense, drama, history, science, military wow, insights into how this incredible part of history happened. At the end we are human who cannot help ourselves..it's within our nature to build, create, explore..even if it means something awesome and terrible at the same time. 

Like Prometheus, Oppenheimer gave us fire.",POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","It was very well done and enlightening rather than entertaining. Refreshed some things I knew but learned many things I hadnt known. Cinematography was incredibly well done and the acting was superb, especially Cillian Murphy. Emily Blunt, Matt Damon snd Robert Downey Jr. were all exceptional. Dont miss this one on the big screen!",POSITIVE

"Aug 5, 2023",Great movie! I love historical movies.,POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","Highly overrated, all the characters except the the head actor feels very 1 dimensional. I don't like the peaky blinders actor acting, it always seems like he is on drugs or something.
The movie dragged out way to long, editing was horrible, lots of mistakes to fit the story. - why make everyone speak German in a Dutch school in Holland, Dutch is not German, why is everyone cheering when they just killed 200.000 people and does only the head actor have a moral sense? 
For a movie of 3 hours, I didn't feel connected to 1 character, it was watchable but that's it for me, if I wasn't in bios, I would have go to sleep after the first 30 minutes.",NEGATIVE

"Aug 5, 2023","Well produced, great acting, and insightful. Recommended.",POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","If you went to the movie to see a lot of dead bodies, you will be disappointed.  The movie is all about Oppenheimer, like the title, and how he got the job to build the bomb, how he built it, and what happened afterward to disgrace him and how that turned out.",POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","I was worried, as it is a long movie, but it totally held my attention. The writing is crisp and doesnt really waste a word. I agree that is is much more impactful on a big a screen. This isnt one to wait on for streaming.",POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023","If you grew up, huddling under your desk in grade school. This is the movie that explains it and the devastating effects of war. This movie, definitley gets you thinking!",POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023",Great. Movie and acting,POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023",Best film I‚Äôve seen in ages ‚Äîtruly outstanding on so many levels.

"Aug 4, 2023","I just watched it 70mm at Lincoln Square. To be completely honest about this movie, it was a huge disappointment and I feel like this film is overrated by people. It was a miss for me compared the fact that this was directed by Christopher Nolan. The direction of this movie was going a bit off and I feel like there were so many unnecessary scenes in this film. Some potential of the casts were hugely wasted in this film, and in my opinion this movie did ignore a lot of facts about Oppenheimer was a person who did not take responsibility for his consequences that he did to the world and being in denial about his doings throughout his life. 

People mentioned ""Barbenheimer"" a lot. I personally would say ""Barbie"" movie was more successful in many ways comparing to this film.",NEGATIVE

"Aug 4, 2023","This is Nolan at his best. Amazing storytelling, cinematography, music score, pacing, acting. Especially Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Junior really impressed me, the rest of the cast was also being very good. You would think that a three-hour film about the man who invented the atomic bomb would be too long, but it works perfectly and leaves you feeling that time just flew by. Some audio mixing isn't great in the first part of the film, with the score being louder than some dialogue, making it harder to understand some characters. This is the first time in a while that I could only think of the film after seeing it for a few hours. This is a masterpiece.",POSITIVE

That above is the only time I have laughed this entire time. I am half way through the movie and I want to swallow a bunch of pills to be so off my fucking head I forget how much of a waste of my life it is. 

If you want to be as suicidal as that one girl in the movie whose name I forget due to the amount of boredom leads to not knowing the name of anyone. I am bloody confused. I would genuinely prefer to stare at a fucking wall.",NEGATIVE

"Aug 4, 2023","It was exquisite. It gave a sense of reality and humanity. The drama, the scenes, everything was so heavy and almost pulled you from your seat. Every waking second of the movie made me sit on the edge of my seat and made me bite my teeth. It showcased the resilience in Oppenheimer and could also teach you a thing or two. Yet another masterpiece from Christopher Nolan.",POSITIVE
"Aug 4, 2023","Isn't sure if it's a historical drama or an exploration of one unique man's unique existence. Murphy gives Oscar-worthy performance, but the early years of Oppenheimer‚Äòs life and the relationships he has with women are not sufficiently explored and feel like an afterthought. Damon and Downey Jr. are better than solid in their supporting roles. Wouldn't watch a second time, unlike (almost) every other Nolan film of the past 15 years.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 4, 2023",Well done and well paced. Covered the story well.,POSITIVE
"Aug 4, 2023",I really felt like I was missing something and that is why it's rated so high.  Most of the scenes are dark and at times was hard to follow.  Good to see if you have nothing else to do I guess.  Not as all what I expected.,NEGATIVE

"Aug 4, 2023","I haven't been this bored during a film in years. Movies are supposed to entertain, Oppenheimer fails terribly at this. With at least a third of the film being completely unnecessary and every supporting actor coming off as a cheap cameo, it's a classic example of an overhyped director who gets way more praise than deserved and who quite frankly hasn't made a good film since Memento.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 4, 2023","Incredibly disappointed.  First, the volume and dialogue was very hard to hear and understand. And second, the pace, the timeline, and the names/importance/duties of the characters was awful.  Don't waste your money, see it at home where you can add closed caption, pause and rewind.",NEGATIVE

Il y a aussi beaucoup de timelines diff√©rentes et ce n'est pas tout le temps clair.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 4, 2023","Big, loud and long. Oppenheimer darts back and forth in time covering Roberts early studies, entry into the Manhattan project and the subsequent political fallout of the 1950s. The film assumes state of confusing tension throughout which results in a frustrating and often boring experience. Script lacked emotional depth (unlike Interstellar). Good acting, but I would have taken all Robert D J scenes out and replaced with Pugh (potential to bring in more of Roberts emotional struggle rather than esoteric US political history)",NEUTRAL
"Aug 4, 2023","Bad dialogue, bad pacing, and lets down the incredible and important story it is based on.

It constantly destroyed the immersion of the experience by having goofy and unrealistic interactions between characters, used a conventional, petrol-laden explosive for the Trinity Test, and jumped into key scenes without the context-setting they necessitated.

Baffled by the positive reviews and I don't think figures like Oppenheimer, operations like the Manhattan project, or the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki should be treated like that.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 4, 2023","Meh, it did not live up to the rave reviews.  Yes, it's better quality than most movies, and the dialogue was snappy and the pacing was good in most of it, but here are the flaws:
- Oppenheimer's character and motivations are not explored.  Why does he feel morally comfortable making the bomb?  Given the tensions with his leftwing sympathies, why does he always (according to the movie) come out in favor of loyalty to the United States?  The movie's answer to this is essentially to have Oppenheimer repeatedly give a confused wide-eyed stare.
- The plot issues about whether the committee that stripped him of his security clearance was acting correctly are tedious and ... I just don't care about the intrigue here.  There may be historians who are intensely interested in this, and take sides as to who is the villain in this story, but the ordinary person does not care.  This all culminates in the drama of someone not being named Commerce Secretary to Eisenhower, but really, do I care who is Commerce Secretary?
- Communist sympathies and the conflict with patriotism play a large role in the plot, but Communist ideas are never explored - were the Communists right, did they have a point, or not?  No one in the film seems to care.
- The film makes the revocation of Oppenheimer's security clearance the fulcrum of the overall plot, in the same vein as something like The Trial of Joan of Arc.  (You know the script, wicked biased judges, lack of due process, the true hero wrongly condemned, you the audience member are supposed to feel outraged.)  The only problem is the consequence seems so trivial - unlike Joan of Arc no one is going to burn Oppenheimer at the stake.  I can't care that much about whether he loses his security clearance in retirement.  Especially in a movie that involves the creation and use of atomic weapons that kill hundreds of thousands of innocent people, can we really get emotionally involved over the loss of security clearance?  The film seems to recognize the issue, and tries to build up the importance of the loss of security clearance (Oppenheimer's wife at one point laments that he will lose his job and they'll lose their home, my god they may have to rent for a while!), but still.
- The presentation of physics was simplistic.  The film explores the underlying physics only in the most shallow way.  Quantum physics is briefly described as the result of the fact that light can be both a wave and a particle.  That's all.  It was like the level of physics knowledge presented was designed to be easily consumed by most junior high students.  It would have been interesting for the film to explore more of the underlying physics.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 4, 2023",Disliked all the unneeded nudity and foul language. The story could be done without nudity and sexual situations.  The story itself was riveting and would have stood on its own without all the sexual scenes.,NEGATIVE
"Aug 4, 2023","I had not paid any attention to the 'R' rating and was surprised at the sex, nudity and language.  It was a good movie however.",POSITIVE
"Aug 4, 2023",If the atomic bomb detonation looked like an actual atomic bomb detonation and not a brick oven going off this movie would have earned my 5 star rating.,POSITIVE

Anyone who did not have a prior knowledge of Oppenheimer's life story would be confused by this presentation.  The nudity scene with his lover was totally unnecessary.  The depiction of the first nuclear test explosion was not realistic.  The science adviser was out to lunch that day.   A mushroom cloud would have been more convincing.

"Aug 4, 2023","Christopher Nolan's first biopic, an extraordinary 3hrs-long male-dominated magnum opus, is ostensibly about the creation of the Atomic bomb, until it pivots unexpectedly into an exploration of McCarthyism. Throwing you into the deep end right from the beginning with a typically Nolan-esque crisscrossing of a bunch of different timelines and flashbacks, the genesis story of the Manhattan Project during the WWII is intertwined with 2 post-war hearings, one in 1954 regarding the security clearance of Cillian Murphy's Robert Oppenheimer where his left-leaning politics and loyalties are being questioned, juxtaposed against a more public one in 1959 to confirm Robert Downing Jr.'s Lewis Strauss as Secretary of Commerce. Not content with just wrangling an enormous cast of (mostly) white men talking science into a watchable, let alone engrossing, film, Nolan further demands his audience's attention and cerebral engagement by fragmenting the linear narrative structure so that he can re-align them later for a bigger impact. After an 'info-dump' first hour, edited like a trailer, introduces us to the various components and characters, the mid-section settles down for a tightly paced and more conventional historical account of his work leading up to the Trinity test before it gallops into the last hour where various narrative strands and themes of the film coalesce into a poignant and revelatory denouement which wrestles with the ethical quandaries and personal toil his achievement has on a conflicted Oppenheimer and the world at large. Perfectly calibrated with Hoyte Van Hoytema's superb cinematography and Ludwig Goransson's stirringly effective soundscape of a score, Nolan's film is emotionally tense, breathtakingly beautiful and technically brilliant, but its humanity lies in Murphy's still and intense internal performance where extreme close-ups of his expressive face further communicate Oppenheimer's complex emotional contradictions, and a sublime stand-out supporting turn by Downey Jr..",POSITIVE
"Aug 4, 2023","Excellent editing, phenomenal sound (the silence between the light of the Trinity explosion and the arrival of the shock wave is perhaps the greatest moment in the history of cinematic sound, settled as it is between the wildly different, but equally tumultuous noises of suspense and release). Hard to pick out a stand-out actor, simply because everyone seems to be all-in, although Cillian Murphy is clearly playing at considerable depth, and getting deeper as Oppenhiemer ages. Simply one of the finest films ever made - which is remarkable given it's length and the fact that much of the action takes place in small rooms.  Can Christopher Nolan continue this trajectory? If so, what could possibly be next??",POSITIVE
"Aug 4, 2023",Needed more science and less McCarthyisim. What was the Question??,NEUTRAL

As a baby boomer, it illustrated the absurdity of duck and cover drills at school in case of nuclear attack that we had to participate in.",POSITIVE
"Aug 4, 2023","Couldn't bring myself to speak for 10 minutes after the film.
Had me immersed from the first raindrops to the last, and I could find no fault. Such compelling acting from the entire cast, especially Murphy and Downey Jr., and captivating score by Goransson which really added to the intensity of the film. Nolan's usual non-linear approach works really well with his adaptation of 'American Prometheus', and every scene (including nude scenes, which I believe were supposed to convey Oppenheimer's openness to Tatlock and later how this is exposed at the trials) is crafted to serve a purpose.

The visual effects were astounding, especially considering that reportedly no CGI was used. The horror sequence in the hall scene was the most intense thing I'd seen in cinemas (besides Cillian's blue-eyed stare), and the use of sound throughout made it all the more profound.

"Aug 4, 2023","Amazingly accurate and horrifying portrayal of the consequences of the atomic bomb as well as the life of Robert Oppenheimer. I'll refrain from giving it a five star review as it is certainly not for everyone. A basic knowledge of world war 2 is pretty much needed in order to understand this movie.

"Aug 4, 2023","AS ,any epic is, it did run a long time.  But there was NEVER a slow spot you didn't need to pay attention to.

All the fallout after the bomb was made was much more of the story than I had ever thought.",POSITIVE

"Aug 4, 2023","√ìtimo filme, tem muitos di√°logos, alguns longos, mas uma coisa que esse filme conseguiu me prender, foi a quest√£o das teorias, mesmo que explicadas bem por cima durante as 3 horas de filme, mas √© uma coisa simples que te prende e te faz ter prazer em assistir, por mais que expliquem bem por cima, a quest√£o da rea√ß√£o em cadeia, part√≠culas e etc.

"Aug 4, 2023","The plot enjoys a high, classy quality (a particular feature of Nolan's movies) with a fluent, thrilling, and amusing development of the film's sequence of events. Notably, production ascertained a creative usage of the soundtrack (from dainty to vigorous notes) to intensify the final outcome of events. Perhaps, the weak spots of this movie deal with the accuracy of some historical events, not to mention the reliability of some of them.",POSITIVE

"Aug 4, 2023","This movie was too long and boring. I'm not saying it because I'm not into history or science. This felt like a 3 hour history lesson with tense classical music. Imagine this film WITHOUT the score! It would put most people to sleep. This release should have been the director's cut not the theatrical version. They wrote in way too much backstory for Oppe in the initial scene. A lot of the drama felt stretched and artificially inflated. The bomb detonation was underwhelming. I went for the ""Shot With IMAX Cameras"" selling point and I felt like they should have gave the budget to another movie.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 4, 2023",Did well at exposing the political divisiveness behind the initiation of atomic warfare.,POSITIVE

"Aug 4, 2023","It isn't as though Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer isn't without merit.  Cillian Murphy is fantastic in the lead role.  Robert Downey Jr. does a great job as the film's antagonist.  The rest of the cast is uniformly solid.  The story is fascinating, a tale that needed to be told.  Many of the production values are top-notch.  However, it has some faults.  The music score is often deafening and mostly unnecessary, especially since it drowns out much of the dialogue.  Even when not drowned out, some of the dialogue is inexcusably unintelligible.  Most frustrating is the final 45 minutes or so of the film, all of which could have been replaced with a brief written epilogue to sum things up.  Those who slurp up Nolan's movies will love Oppenheimer.  Others should proceed with some caution.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 4, 2023","Superb acting, gripping score, gorgeous cinematography and focused direction that keeps a 3 hour film compromised of hearings and discussions on physics very compelling. But I'm simplifying the story because there's much to this modern classic. Just take in Albert Einstein's stern warning while Ludwig Goransson's 'Destroyer of Worlds' slowly builds to a shattering crescendo and we end with horrific images of what could be. After that, I guarantee the film will stay with you long after you leave the theater. Just beautiful!",POSITIVE

"Aug 3, 2023",The cast was exceptional with their portrayals of the characters.,POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023","Thinking person's Cold War film, really. Dialogue heavy, so you have to pay attention or you may miss something. The non-linear narrative may not work for everyone, but we all know this is how Nolan makes his films. Therefore, we need to be ready for it. The acting was top notch, although Emily Blunt deserved more screen time. Same for Florence Pugh, really. So, there's a lot of mansplaining in this film, so to speak. Maybe that's a reflection of the subject matter's eras, but in a modern world, it is very noticeable. It doesn't detract from the quality of the film, but perhaps it makes us think that the film could have been a lot better if done differently. Either way, highly recommend this film for informative, intellectual, and thought-provoking ideas about humanity and science. Probably a lot of lessons in here about AI, too, using the idea expressed in Jurassic Park: The scientists were so concerned with whether they could, they didn't think about whether they should.",POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023",This movie is one of the best movies of this year,POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023",I watched oppenheimer today and all i can say about it was a very enjoyable experience the movie was great from start to finish cillian Murphy was a great character to play oppenheimer the only problem i had with it was the 3 hour run time but that doesn't knock any stars of it in my book final conclusion bomb go boom üí£üí•,POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023","If you like watching biography of someone you probably studied 50 times in school, complete with screeming babies and insignificant conversation. This is for you.

"Aug 3, 2023","Exquisitely filmed, and wonderful to see in the original iMax format.  Sound is generally okay however there are segments ranging from a few seconds up to a few minutes in duration during which the sound volume becomes very noticeably increased to levels that I found to be physically uncomfortable and annoying, a very unfortunate distraction from my enjoyment of the otherwise most thrilling parts of the film.",NEUTRAL

"Aug 3, 2023","Well it was not hard to choose  what to watch this weekend. 

Oppenheimer seems to be densely daunting at first to understand given its complicated background of science  but fortunately it is not treated as such. Its technical marvels ventures on the humanity of the man conflicted with guilt, ambition and politics surrounding his important decision. Some say it fell short to explore the moral  intricacies far more detailed than it should, but a 3 hour biopic  had given some justice for me.

I could appreciate the film from its attempt to make things visceral, cinematic and relentlessly making me feel the shock of an explosion or a mini heart attack. It has succeeded. This is a normal thing to look for, but deep down the film suddenly makes sense in the end.  With the atmosphere of this film created,  it is an important narrative, that needs to be known and It was compelling.  I will not even mentioned the actors portrayal's, in this film,  fondly familiar and extremely talented. Just beyond  what is expected. 

Although it can be taxing admittedly at some point, you will remain at your seat, at the end.

Truly, It will leave you shaken, mainly because you have asked yourself with the question, "" will it destroy the world?

8/10",POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023","This movie is shot beautifully, the acting is outstanding, subject material is interesting and even the three hour running time wasn't a drag but it sadly falls short of greatness.  I wondered why as I was watching. 

At the end of the day to tell a story that has this level of complexity, with its multiple plot points and large number of characters, and slice it up for non-linear reassembly made things confusing and left footed.  It didn't need to be.  Yes...this is how C. Nolan likes to spin a tale but in this instance it was a distraction, which pulled you out of the moment and messed with the flow.  

While I would recommend it to friends it is a frustrating movie to watch because there is so much potential.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 3, 2023",Another brilliant film by Christopher Nolan he never fails to amaze with his movies,POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023",Oppenheimer was an amazing movie with great acting and an amazing Cillian Murphy but the ending dragged on for a very long time with the trial scene but Christopher Nolan has done it again!,POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023","Thought that a three hour movie would be dull but it wasn't.  Complicated but not dull at all. I'll be researching more on the subject since I wasn't born at the time and had little interrest. 
I read about Los Alamos years ago (The Girls of Atomic City) but nothing about Oppenheimer.",POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023","An incredible feat of cinema.  I would have never guessed that a three hour biographical movie would be so enthralling.  From the script to the performances to the practical effects, everything is top notch and keeps you invested each moment of the film.  If I could find one fault it would be that the last act is somewhat of an anti-climax compared to what came before. I expect this film will clean up at the yearly award shows.",POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023",Absolutely amazing! Loved it!,POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023",Was better the second time.,POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023","Oppenheimer is a masterpiece. It is a film that is both epic in scope and intimate in its character study. Christopher Nolan has crafted a work of art that is both visually stunning and intellectually stimulating.

The film tells the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the physicist who led the Manhattan Project to develop the atomic bomb. Nolan does an excellent job of capturing the complex personality of Oppenheimer. He is a brilliant scientist, but he is also a deeply flawed man. He is driven by a desire to use science to solve the world's problems, but he is also haunted by the knowledge that he has created a weapon of unimaginable destruction.

The film is beautifully shot. Nolan uses his trademark long takes and sweeping camerawork to create a sense of awe and wonder. The film is also very well-acted. Cillian Murphy gives a tour-de-force performance as Oppenheimer. He is ably supported by a cast of talented actors, including Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, and Robert Downey Jr.

Oppenheimer is a film that will stay with you long after you have seen it. It is a film that is both important and entertaining. It is a film that everyone should see.

Here are some of the things that I particularly liked about the film:

The performances: Cillian Murphy is absolutely brilliant as Oppenheimer. He captures the scientist's brilliance, his charisma, and his inner turmoil with equal measure. Emily Blunt is also excellent as Oppenheimer's wife, Katherine.

The visuals: The film is visually stunning. Nolan uses his trademark long takes and sweeping camerawork to create a sense of awe and wonder. The film is also beautifully shot in black and white.

The story: The film tells a complex and fascinating story. It is not just a biopic of Oppenheimer, but also a meditation on the nature of science and the consequences of nuclear weapons.

The message: The film has a powerful message about the dangers of nuclear weapons and the importance of using science for good. It is a film that is both timely and important.

Overall, I highly recommend Oppenheimer. It is a film that is both entertaining and thought-provoking. It is a film that will stay with you long after you have seen it.",POSITIVE

"Aug 3, 2023","This is going to be a short review as I've already given up 3 hours off my time. I didn't realise I was going to watch a pissing competition between two egotistical men.

A missed opportunity to explore the ethical issues which was barely touched on with more time spent on Pugh tits. The 30 second scene where Blunt handing a few tough questions didn't in anyway make up for the lack of female character building through out the film.

oppenheimer appeared more rabbit in the head lights than erratic genius. This was a one dimensional and self-indulgent film. Sorry guys this film was basically Oscar beat.",NEGATIVE

Oppenheimer can get convoluted after the first two hours, relying heavily on extensive dialogue instead of events pushing the narrative forward that, if missed, makes the viewing experience tedious.

That said, the first two hours amount to some of the most impactful sequences in cinema in the past few years. I was genuinely holding onto my seat with my heart pounding in some moments.",POSITIVE

In a world where movies are comedic, throwing punches, and overuse CGI, this movie was very refreshing.",POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023","""Oppenheimer"" is much more than a movie, it's an experience, it leaves you wondering and wanting more.",POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023",This movie was terrible.  They should've put a little more focus on the Manhattan project such as the Hanford site that supplied the Plutonium.  It's an extremely long and boring three hours.,NEGATIVE

"Aug 3, 2023","Excellent movie. Very powerful and thought provoking!! Acting, staging, music and production were all superb. Would see it again!",POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023","An accurate biography of Robert Oppenheimer. The story of Trinity is one few have studied, but a great backstory to World War II.",POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023",It was too long and draggy at times.  The acting was great though.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 3, 2023",This movie just didn't resonate with me. I'm sure its good for the right person but it just isn't for me.,NEGATIVE
"Aug 3, 2023","Powerful, leaves you with the what ifs",POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023","Despite its lengthy run time, Oppenheimer seemed to fly by. Bolstered by stellar acting, the movie seemed to capture the reality of a decision made by a number of old, white men, living far from the consequences of their actions.",POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023","The best biopic I've ever seen -- magnificant, thought-provoking masterpiece.",POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023",It was hard for me to follow.  I liked best the trial,NEUTRAL
"Aug 3, 2023","Such a masterpiece, especially the music!",POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023",Superb acting and script. Best movie of the year!,POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023","Absolutely incredible movie, starting with the whole entire cast that did a fantastic job. Several actors should be up for awards for their roles in this one. Next was how Nolan directed the movie. From the incredible images to the sound editing really making you feel like you were there. 9.5 out of 10.",POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023","Oppenheimer is a biographical film about Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), an American theoretical physicist, best known as the Father of the Atomic Bomb due to his significant contributions to the development of the atomic bomb during the Second World War. Adapted from American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, the film covers a broad range of events that happened in Oppenheimer's life and is especially interested in his involvement in the Manhattan Project and its consequences on his life.

Oppenheimer is a stunning masterpiece. I do not use this word lightly, and director Christopher Nolan's latest work certainly deserves it. With almost no reservations, Oppenheimer is Nolan's magnum opus and currently the film of the year for me.

Score: 10/10

"Aug 3, 2023",Amazing movie! Even for someone who has a very limited attention span. I can't even describe in words how good this movie is was!,POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023",Epic Nolan film must see,POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023","Good movie, I recommend checking it.",POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023","I was leery about sitting through a 3-hour flick, but this one held my attention right from the start. I knew much about the invention of the atomic bomb, but the details I didn't know were presented well enough that non-scientific folks could easily understand. It was sad to see how Oppenheimer went from US hero to disgraced citizen, all due to he and his wife's supposed ties to the Communist party, and his wish to see arms control discussions pre- and post- bombing of Japan. Stellar cast and great cinematography.",POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023",A masterpiece indeed.,POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023","Loved it, and it made me want to research more about him and that time period.
So well acted and filmed. I was skeptical of the length (3 hours!) but the time flew, it was so good!",POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023",People overvalue the movie because of Christopher Nolan and the casting. I do not believe it is such an amazing film as many say.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 3, 2023",Fastest paced 3 hour movie I've seen. Incredible acting and an accompanying audio that demands for the movie to be seen in the cinema. Nolan utilizes incredible performances from his lead actors and creative methods to paint Robert Oppenheimer in a light that helps better understand him.,POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023",Creative way to tell a true story .. included the dilemma and soul searching,POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023","Great movie, harrowing story. Great performance from all actors and actress.",POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023",O filme √© t√£o bom que voc√™ mal sente as 3h passando.,POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023","Great acting, great story, but very complicated when it comes to analize physics. I swear, Nolan won't ever ever get rid of physics and the concepts of space-time, EVER. But that's not what I disliked from this movie, in fact, I'm bad at understanding cientific concepts and I need a whole hour-class for it, MINIMUM, but, I liked how Oppenheimer and the rest of the experts explain everything related with atomic energy and whatsoever, it's so captivating and they of course are seen as pioneers with a lot of intelligence and powerful aspirations, you know that they know what they're doing already. What I didn't like, was what happens after Trinity: The Oppenheimer accusation. There are so many dialogues, that it's impossible to understand everything the first time, and I hate that, but anyway, I'm quite satisfied yet impacted to know better now about the story of this physicist, and everyone that was related with him, clearly.",POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023","The time shifting was somewhat difficult to follow yet, it tended to highlight the lack of factual basis for his treatment and how he was used, chewed up, and discarded.
The very personal nature of the scientific relationships was intriguing. I was fortunate enough to have had a high school physics teacher who was there and involved so, the names were familiar.",POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023",The movie is just so great. I watched it on theater yesterday and I love the small detail and the amazing soun effect. I can't imagine how awesome if someone watch it on special theater that have IMAX 70mm film,POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023",Good movie. Pay attention,POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023",Too long!  More of a documentary then an entertainment piece. Like watching CNN for 3 hours--Boo!!,NEGATIVE
"Aug 3, 2023","If I could give it more stars, I would! While there have been some criticisms regarding aspects of the whole story about Los Alamos have been leveled, this was a story essentially designed to tell the story from one man's perspective and how it affected him. Do not let the the three hour length deter you - it flies by. Acting is fabulous and the audience is drawn into wanting a relationship with many of the characters.",POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023",The way the sound came in and out was not pleasant! Too much time at beginner mnemonic my for development. Not a good movie. Documentary is better.,NEGATIVE
"Aug 3, 2023",It was a great movie.,POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023",Long winded and very drawn out. Would have been better if it were an hour shorter.  Background music and noise was uncomfortably loud all way through movie so difficult to hear the dialogue. A waste of 2.5 hours of my life.,NEGATIVE
"Aug 3, 2023","This is arguably Christopher Nolan's best work. The best part is knowing that most of it is practical effects and not CGI. I didn't fully  understand it the fist time (yes I've watched it more than once) but this is Christopher Nolan  we're talking about...you're not supposed to get it the first time. Still, great movie, must watch.üëå",POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023",Some may feel as though this movie is hard to follow and understand. I thought it was perfectly done. The exile of CGI gave it an amazing purity. The acting was unlike any I've seen in quite some time. And as always Nolan gave us some of the best audio + cinematic synergy I've seen.,POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023","The story was interesting but the movie was about an hour too long. A lot of time was wasted with weird symbolism, and annoying flashes. There was no footage of the actual bomb that was dropped. Just all of a sudden they're reading a headline that it had been done. I'm sure it was meant to symbolize after all their work they just had the headline as well, but as movie goers it would have made the move more interesting. Way too much skipping back and forth between time. I absolutely hated that. Overall, I have not recommended it to anyone who has asked. It's a shame because I was really looking forward to it.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 3, 2023","Overall, a realy good film. There are great characters with wonderful cinematography, the second act really pulled through and seeing oppenheimers visions of the particles was wonderful. As the movie progressed you saw less and less of those particle scene as Oppenheimer moves further from science and more to politics. One major criticism I hold though is the run time, the first two acts pulled through as a good introduction and an amazing second act, but the third act felt like a drag and could have been edited further. Additinally florence Pugh's character felt a bit unnecessary and could have less screen time as it didn't seem to add much to the story until a very brief point made towards the second half. ",POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023",It was good story telling but it dragged on for to long,POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023","Typical Nolan's way of a movie. Excellently captured every actor's actions, the noise üëåüèΩ",POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023",Guess Im not into history movie if thats what this was.  Honestly it became boring and I almost got up and left.  Way too long.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 3, 2023","you have to know your facts when you go into this movie.  Even if you do, they don't do a good job explaining who's who so it's hard to follow/know exactly what was going on.  IT was well done though.  I would wait for video so you can pause and rewind and watch in 2 sessions.  too long also.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 3, 2023","Characters were not fully developed, there was too much jumping forward and backward in time, and it was too long. I was very disappointed.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 3, 2023",I think this is the best Nolan‚Äòs Film yet because of the visual and the how the story is being telling and how Nolan is trying to communicate to the audience,POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023",Sensational! The performances were so great. Cinematography was great. Soundtrack was great. This movie must win the Oscar. ‚ù§Ô∏è,POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023",Really well made! Def worth the price of admission.,POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023","I usually love Christopher Nolan movies, and was excited to see Oppenheimer, but I found it disappointing. The storytelling lacked focus and perspective, making its length fatiguing. There was a lot of dialogue, which wouldn't have been a problem in the hands of a more capable writer, but detailed, lengthy dialogue isn't Nolan's strong suit. It was wordy, clumsy at times, took itself too seriously, and was constantly backdropped with orchestral strings for the entire 3 hours.

Then there's all the boring hearings. You're telling the story of the creation of the atomic bomb, but you make a Senate confirmation and backroom hearing the centerpieces of the story? It felt like Nolan was trying to do his own version of Oliver Stone's JFK, but failed.

Even the expected climax of the movie was a bit of a dud. Once the explosion happened, I was expecting it to either wrap up or explore the regret of what he'd done, but most of the remaining time is spent on boring inside politics and reprisals against Oppenheimer.

On the upside, this was one of the best performances of Robert Downey, Jr.'s career. Even though I found the hearings to be a bizarre and boring misstep, Downey really delivered. I just wish it had been in a different movie.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 3, 2023","I LOVED THIS. For the whole last hour I was on the edge of my seat, and I was tired after sitting through 5 hours of movies so i was impressed it kept my attention. Despite the 3 hours I would definitely watch this again. The build up was incredible and the actors blew me away. 10/10 must see.",POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023","Far too much political intrigue, pretentious dialogue scenes of back and forth verbal fencing and not enough substance on the science of the creation of the Atom Bomb and it's repercussions (although touched upon). Great use of sound for effect but overlaid too much in dialogue scenes reminiscent of Dunkirk. The more the story developed the less I cared to know about Oppenheimer unlike other biographical films where at the finale your wanting to know more. Disappointing but maybe worth a rewatch at home on a lazy Sunday afternoon.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 3, 2023",SOUND it is horribly badly mixed and LOUD Christopher Nolan is a brilliant director and I'm a big fan of his work and support his work because I like real cinema not CGI stuff but in this movie she should fix some stuff before the blue-ray come out.,NEGATIVE
"Aug 3, 2023","The movie includes some brilliant, well filmed moments. Shame that they are swallowed up by so much tediousness. Not as bad as ""Tenent"" but far from Nolan's best works.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 3, 2023",Some mild fanservice. The most entertaining thing about this movie as a piece of art- is watching how the vast majority of public dissent around it (being not enough scenes of nukes) runs perpendicular to the entire point of the movie.,POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023",Truly Peak Cinema. Christopher Nolan just cant miss,POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023",A 3 hour movie that leaves you wanting more‚Ä¶,POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023","Really quite poor. Was expecting a cinematic masterpiece, in reality it's a biopic and not a great one.

The main thing this movie is missing, is more bomb. Aside from the test explosion, we see nothing, I mean seriously, show the windows in texas cities that were blown when the test happened, show the bombs actually being dropped on Japan, show something that actually relates to them being used and the fact that the war was actually happening at the time. 

Also, maybe admit that the bomb wasn't even needed, the japanese were ready to surrender and dropping this bomb was essentially murder.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 3, 2023","Absolute cinematic masterpiece! The cinematography, the suspense, the objective vs subjective telling of the story, the emotion, the unfolding of events, the truth coming out; it can only be described as beautiful in a morbid kind of way. The story of a great physicist during an era of war and destruction as told by Christoper Nolan and the Cast of Oppenheimer; what more could you possibly ask for?",POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023",It gave very interesting insights into Oppenheimer's life and his accomplishments to build the bomb.,POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023","The soundtrack was so damn loud that I almost walked out of the theater even though the story itself was very good. I went with four friends of various ages, and they all said the same thing!!",NEGATIVE
"Aug 3, 2023","A masterfully crafted piece of cinema that transcends a historical pic about the atomic bomb, ""Oppenheimer"" addresses the man beneath the hat, depicting leadership, genius, and flaws, all while not shying away from the moral war within.  Nolan strikes again with stunning visuals and tense cinematography, while teaming up with Goransson to deliver a soundtrack that makes you as unsure as the scientist on screen.",POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023","Phenomenal. Engrossing from beginning to end with a marquee performance from Murphy and cast. The biggest compliment I can give it is that after 3 hours, I could have done another 3. Watch it, and go to the cinema for it for god's sake.",POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023","Saw this in 70mm in Manchester, VUE printworks on the 28th of july 2023 and OMFG! it was the best movie i have seen!",POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023",Nolan at his best. Story was stellar but the visual and sound effects were amazing. Best score in a long time.,POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023",Words wouldn't do this film justice...just experience it.,POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023","amazing movie, casting was spot on! the story was great. love it",POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023",Great story that set the record straight!,POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023",Horrible. Would give it less stars if I could. Too much dialogue. Fails to tell a story visually and ends up creating a jumbled mess. ,NEGATIVE
"Aug 3, 2023","Well paced for a 3 hour movie! It looks like it's a fairly accurate portrayal of his life. I did think Nolan favored the anti-atom bomb dropping on Japan side. They avoided any discussion of the other side, and they used gimmicks to sell their views. This is a complex debate, and both sides can make decent arguments. To leave this debate out is propaganda.",POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023",Very boring and too long.  Took a story that could be interesting but focuses on things that are not.  Checked my watch a lot during the final act.,NEGATIVE
"Aug 3, 2023",this movie was very interesting and kept my attention the whole time. I would definitely recommend it.,POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023","I didn‚Äôt like the movie because it went on to long but it‚Äôs my fault for watching insidious before it recommend it by the way, I probably could have been more patient if i didn‚Äôt. Now on my review as I said it went on to long and it felt like forever I was falling asleep in the first 45 min and I came with my mom,uncle,aunt and my uncle fell asleep in the first 45 min I didn‚Äôt completely but he straight up fell asleep wouldn‚Äôt recommend and I saw a lot of people rating it really well but I‚Äôm giving it a 2 and half stars because it at least was decent also we left 1:50 in. ",NEGATIVE
"Aug 3, 2023","It was worth watching once, but I doubt I will watch it again. It was a bit confusing at times, with many characters who were not well introduced. I frequently didn't know the names of some characters or what their position on the project was or who they were politically. I also thought this would have more focus on the development of the Bomb and Oppenheimer's inner struggles with morals/ethics, along with some political issues involving communism. However, the main focus was political and the anti-communism struggles. I never felt like I got to know Oppenheimer or any of the other characters very well. Also two serious problems with Regal theater Woodstock : 1. Seating chart was a scam. I chose two seats, dead center, with 4-5 empty seats on either side. The actual seats IRL were off to the left, with only one seat further left. That was fraud. I will not trust the seating chart in the future. 2. Sound Volume was WAY too loud. The loudest sounds hurt my ears and distorted heavily from speakers being overdriven. Even normal conversations sometimes distorted from overdriven speakers. A lot of times I could not understand what characters were saying. Not the worst movie I've seen, but heavily disappointed.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 3, 2023","Great movie, definitely see it in film if you can!",POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023",Poor sound quality. Would be better with subtitles.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 3, 2023",The acting was pretty good. The story was a bit hard to follow at times. The nudity was completely unnecessary. ,NEGATIVE
"Aug 3, 2023",did it have to be 3 hrs? probably not. it was indeed a good dramatization of a historical figure that's complex enough for a movie,POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023","Unarguably the best movie of the year. Chris Nolan is the MIT of movie directing. This one movie director doesn't stop to amaze me. Cillian Murphy graduated from Dr. Craine to Dr. Oppenheimer. Matt Damon's 2nd straight good movie of this year, both Robert Downy Jr. and Emily Blunt were so good too. I do sincerely hope this movie bags a few oscars in the major categories, instead of some unassuming Launder mat movie like last year. I did feel it was bit too long, but storyline comes around towards the end to justify lengthiness of the plot. Overall, what I lost in intellect while watching 'Barbie' I regained by watching 'Oppenheimer'.",POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023",So overhyped  and didn‚Äôt need to be 3 hours long at all. There was one big explosion,NEUTRAL
"Aug 3, 2023","Ugh!  Three hours of close ups and whispered profundities in dodgy accents.  Are we to believe nobody ever had a normal conversation with old Oppenheimer?  Constant underscoring often made mumbled scenes impenetrable.  Great costumes, scenic design and cinematography could not make up for the melodramatic script and schmacting.  2 stars",NEGATIVE
"Aug 3, 2023",Simply beautiful. Music and all!,POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023",Masterful storytelling! Wow!,POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023",Left me in total emptiness after watching it. One movie every human being should watch.,POSITIVE

"Aug 3, 2023",It was a really good movie.,POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023","incredible acting, visually astounding, but probably 30 minutes too long. some scenes were absolutely brilliant, while others dragged on. such gaps could have been filled with content highlighting the victims of oppenheimer's creation in some way, which was a huge missed opportunity (and by some standards, an obligation)",NEUTRAL
"Aug 3, 2023",Amazing cinematic experience and wonderful score..  Movie never slowed down.  3 hours were like 1.  Highly recommend,POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023","It was interesting and well made, but dragged on too long",NEUTRAL
"Aug 3, 2023","We loved everything about this movie. We especially appreciated the cinematography and unique ways the story unfolded. Some people said it was hard to follow, but not for us. Also, we didn't notice how long it is because we were really into it. We were surprised when it ended. Paying for IMAX was worth it.",POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023",Story is really chopped up. You can follow it but with all the cameo characters it is hard to tell the good guys from the bad.  Film is not so much about building the bomb as it is a character study of Oppenheimer and his adversaries.  Acting uniformly good. Direction slow paced,POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023",Left me speechless. Absolute insane film. Christopher Nolan does it again! Imax 70mm was 10/10.,POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023","They could have cut an hour out of the movie if they didn't have so much focus on all of the discussions about trying to cut out the Jew who created the bomb. It is important that people know how many amazing things the Jews have created, but we got the point of all the discussions. Other than that, the acting was great, and the movie was great. Just a bit too long",POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023",Superb acting and directorship. Just way too long. Could have been reduced to 2 hours instead of 3 .,POSITIVE

"Aug 3, 2023",Great movie. IMAX experience was poor. Did not like the 4:3 format and the sound was marginal.  I think a modern digital experience would have been much better.   Constant dirt on lens showing up on picture was truly annoying.  Would not go back to an old imax theater ever again.,POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023",Fabulous cast. Engrossing. thought provoking.  Never realize it is such a long movie.,POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023",Very serious movie with significant implications of this planets future.  Unfortunately politics plays too large a role in leaderships quest for power and can override that which is good for mankind.  Great acting!,POSITIVE

"Aug 3, 2023",Enthralling story with spotless acting.  No great technical detail (bummer).  Too long,POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023",The Best movie in this year so far. The bottom half let me have another level enjoy.,POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023",unbelievable production. Christopher Nolan did a fantastic job bringing Oppenheimer to the big screen and telling this remarkable story. 10/10. There were definitely a couple controversial scenes compared to history but overall it kept me on the edge of my seat.,POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023",Honest back story of the the man who helped developed the bomb & his path before & after it's development. His drive to develop the bomb before the Germans & his moral objections after it's development.

"Aug 3, 2023",I really could've used subtitles for this movie. So many times I couldn't understand what they were saying and I thought it was just me but getting with other people who have seen it they couldn't hear it well either. I think I missed maybe 40% of the dialogue and spent most of the movie just trying to put together what was being said. That along with crazy editing and a RDJ story line I still have no idea why was in there or what was going on with that seriously just ask people who saw the movie. No one can answer lol everyone says it's good but everyone agrees with everything I'm saying. Music phenomenal. Acting is great as well. Good movie but it's not great. Not til I can watch with subtitles because the sound and spoken word is bad.,NEUTRAL

"Aug 3, 2023",Interesting almost-documentary movie.  Kind of long.,POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023",It was enjoyable and educational.   Actors in the movie were a great fit for their roles.,POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023","It held my interest, while not an action film despite the tease about the bomb, lots of scenery and interaction with the actors.  35mm.

It starts at the end with a committee hearing to revoke Oppie's security clearance. Since the committee looks back on his contacts and things that went on over his life, it flashes back.  While back there is weaves in what else was happening.

I would have liked to hear more about Oppie as a person, and his life, and the science, but the book does not either.  The book is more chronological, noting Oppie's left wing contacts and refusal to name folks who may have been a security risk. So even at this point one knows this is a major part of the book (and film).

The science is really lacking, at one point they discuss doing a hydrogen bomb, which the movie claims would need a regular atomic bomb to detonate.  I thought the book said it would require the acquiring of heavy water, which would take too long.  Besides the science, this is where Oppie made at least one scientist unhappy.

In passing it mentions there were concerns about making the bomb, but not really discussed until after WWII and the development of the Hydrogen bomb.  The movie is even more brief than the book on this part.  The movie seems to blame Strauss for this witch hunt but the book seems to point to a larger desire to get rid of Oppie by the defense industry.  Too bad the movie did not read opinion of the one casting the designating vote.

I did fall asleep near the start probably the food and 2 beers I had.  After 2 hours I was sort of ready to go, but thought this was the good part of the book.

I would recommend, but you will probably enjoy it more if you are not expecting too much.  I forgot my ear plugs but did not need them.",POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023",Movie kept me engaged all 3 hours! I was nervous!,POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023","It's a masterpiece. The soundtrack, the plot, and the individual performances are outstanding. I loved the way it explored and showed the characters' perception of the events and their psychology. It is a long film, however, it keeps a fast pace, so you don't ever get bored. The images, colors and accurate setting combine perfectly to give the viewer a deep experience while watching it. I recommend it 100%.",POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023",Its one of the years best films. Real history. Christopher Nolan made a best director. And Cillian Murphy did a best performance. IMAX 70mm film is perfect.,POSITIVE

"Aug 2, 2023",I saw this 2 weeks ago and it completely rolled me. The rest of my day was a blur and even when I tried to watch another movie that night nothing could compare. It's quite special when a film stays with you for as long as this one did with me. Potentially one of the best films I've seen in my entire life.,POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023",The story was fascinating but if I wanted to see a porno I would have gone to see a porno. There was no need to show Oppenheimer screwing his mistress or sitting naked in chairs having a discussion unless they wanted us to see the dimensions of her nipples which played no part in the plot/story. I would have given it a higher rating but these scenes really put me off.,NEGATIVE
"Aug 2, 2023",Love the movie was very interesting I recommend it 100%,POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023",The acting -superb.  The writing - intelligent. Loved it!,POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","Filme bibliogr√°fico que n√£o d√° sono, √© interessante e bem trabalhado as linhas temporais e hist√≥rias. Sem falar na fotografia que est√° LINDA!",POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","LIKES: It's an incredible story, whether it's made into a movie or not. 70mm BIG IMAX screen. Usually I'm fine with watching things on a 40"" TV, but this movie should REALLY be seen on the big screen. Great acting by Cillian Murphey and R Downey Jr.. Heck, I didn't even recognize Downey. Performances by everyone else good as well. Good graphics, not over blown.
INDIFFERENT: A little hard to follow at times (only a little) because it wasn't all in chronological order. No intermission.  For a three hour movie, it went by fast. Intermission wasn't really needed.
DISLIKES: It was never painfully loud, and some shots certainly deserved to be loud for the effect. But, it was unnecessarily loud a fair amount of the time. 
HATES: 25+ minutes of advertisements and previews. But that will depend on the theater.",POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023",Move was very boring,NEGATIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","Everyone in this movie delivers in what can simply be called a spectacle. While it is 3 hours long, the musical score and sheer will of the cast and crew gets you through the movie.  It was a fun ride indeed! Watch it now lol",POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","Never read the bio book and only vaguely familiar with his story, but totally enjoyed the movie! Yes, I was able to sit thru all 3 hours of it and it did not seem that long.  At the end, you want to know more about this man.",POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","The movie was well done, as Christopher Nolan almost always accomplishes, and Cillian Murphy is a near-doppelganger for J. Robert Oppenheimer.  The story is truly more about the man than his work on Trinity, which was refreshing. It was a really good drama with some excitement and historical education.",POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","Way too long, needs to get rid of at least 30 minutes. Decent movie overall. Could have been better.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 2, 2023",Great story telling.   Acting was magnificent,POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","I saw it in 70 mm IMAX.  As a 3 hour film, it kept my attention, and presented many aspects of Oppenheimer's life that I didn't know before.  However, the cinematography, sound, and video were quirky and distracting. 

Much of the dialog was presented in short, cryptic scenes that made it difficult to follow the conversations and context.  The soundtrack was punctuated with very loud noises that vibrated my seat, with delayed sounds of nuclear explosions and what sounded like a very loud train.  There were also confusing and repeated flash-forwards, where the current (older) scenes were in color and the flash-forwards were in B&W.  I eventually caught on that the B&W meant ""future"".  But the chronology was frenetic and difficult to piece together.

Outdoor scenes filmed during the day were very dark and underexposed, which surprised me.  It was not clear to me why an outdoor daylight scene (e.g., riding horses) should be so dark.

All in all, the film was worth seeing, I thought.  However, a new cut of it could improve the overall presentation.  I don't know how the parsimonious dialog bits could be expanded, unless there are some parts of dialog left on the cutting room floor that could be re-inserted.  The new cut would have to reconsider what else to cut, given that the film is already 3 hours long.  It may be that the story is more suited to be a multi-part series.",NEUTRAL

"Aug 2, 2023",Perfectly crafted movie. Each character has acted their bests. A MASTERPIECE.,POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023",absolutely astounding movie. loses its way a little bit though,POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023",This movie was a cinematic masterpiece and a must see for anyone who loves movies inspired by real events . Christopher Nolan knocked this one out of the park!,POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023",A masterpiece - blown away by the acting & intense true historical piece unfolding ! Oscar for Cillian Murphy ! Must see!,POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","too long, and they should have to shave an hour off  and focus on the main subject  other things to that shouldn't be in there as well",NEUTRAL
"Aug 2, 2023",Amazing depiction of the people and the effort that went into the nuclear arms race and the science behind it,POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023",Did not seem like it took 3 hrs to get through from beginning to end. It does show how the people given power in the government will and do attempt to destroy people after they no longer are useful. Great movie!!!,POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","Powerful movie.  Though over long, there is mo wasted space.  Brilliant acting. Powerful soundtrack.   Great cast.  Well done without much cgi",POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","A brilliant movie about brilliant men and one brilliant woman. A masterpiece as good as Mystic River, Spotlight, or some of the Coen Brothers' films. Not an action film by any means, but it's exciting nonetheless as it builds to the moment that those brilliant people actually test out what up to then had only been theory. Then the aftermath. I wouldn't call myself a Christopher Nolan fan. I like some of his movies better than others. Oppenheimer has to be considered the best film of his career IMO. The pacing of the movie is perfect IMO. So many actors, that I'll just point out a few. Cillian Murphy is terrific. As always, Gary Oldman steals his very brief scene. It might be Robert Downey JR's best work since Chaplin or maybe Zodiak. Emily Blunt is mostly in the shadows for most of the film, but gets her chance to shine in hour number three. Jason Clarke stands out as an irritating Adam Schiff type. My one warning: go easy on that 48-ounce soda that you bought, or you could be using it as a pee-cup by the closing credits. Three hours and 20 minutes by my watch(including previews and commercials), but worth every minute.",POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023",I thought the movie was an accurate representation of the facts I know from growing up in Northern California in the early 1950s.,POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023",Awesome movie. I learned a lot about the man and that time.,POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023",Wish they would have a scene where they actually dropped the bombs on Japan,POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","I was hoping they would focus more on the seriousness, physics,  and incredible work that went in to the A-bomb. The second part of the movie put us to sleep. Here was such a momentous thing such as the making and impact of the A bomb that lacked focus while the film focus was turned to the later discrediting of one man (of a team) by a jealous rival. Meh!",NEUTRAL
"Aug 2, 2023","Easily the worst Christopher Nolan film. I thought it was very boring. And it's not because I didn't understand/follow it, I'm a chartered engineer with a strong interest in the Manhattan project. The film barely focused at all in the Manhattan project it self, nor the spying. It focused almost solely on the obvious surface left moral issues Oppenheimer had with his work. It wasn't enlightening in any way and where it wasn't focusing on his basic moral issues it was focused in a sham hearing to review his security clearance.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","Oppenheimer is a highly detailed character study that will leave you thinking/horrified about the convergence of science and politics long after the credits roll. Sound mixing issues aside, this is a top 3 Nolan movie and my favorite movie so far of 2023.",POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023",The storytelling and visuals were amazing. Cillian was awesome. One thing that didn't make it a 5 for me was the length & amount of dialogue. The movie was a lot of dialogue so kinda hard to keep up with especially due to the length,POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","Wow!  It CAN still be done  It IS possible for Hollywood, in the 21st C, to produce a movie with ADULT sensibilities!  A film dealing with complex human beings & their interactions, reality, historical events, politics - and the various motivations behind interpersonal relationships!  

Oppenheimer is living proof of this  In short, a competent film rooted in reality ‚Äì which is considerably MORE than one has any right to expect, in these times 

This, despite the fact that the vast majority of todays offerings seem aimed at 10-year olds ‚Äì involving cartoon characters and/or comic book superheroes sequels prequels sidequels and a fixation on senseless gunplay/violence.  Plus, of course, the fortuitous destruction of very many things Special effects and stunt people rule!

I should mention that the movie is 3 hours long, and that SOME interest in the subject matter would be helpful ‚Äì and is assumed.  It didn't drag for ME - even though I already knew this story...

"Aug 2, 2023","I just had to know who directed the movie and I already knew I as in for a stunning movie, visually, story-wise, and also with great dialogues, and it was just that, great camera-work, great music, great acting, the movie had me the enitre three hours through, not let ups, not saying there werent some weaker passages where the music carries the movie, but overall it was still really great, if you are not willing to sit in a chair for three hours and watch people talking about theories, politics and physics for 3 hours straight, with an ocassional break in the form of a sex scene or a party etc. then this might not be the movie for you, otherwisee an absolute must see!",POSITIVE

"Aug 2, 2023",Yeah it's pretty amazing! Three hours fly by due to a gripping story and amazing performances! The only thing I would be critical of was the terrible awkward nude scenes!,POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","Well, Oppenheimer didn't actually pass the time. It wandered from science to relocation in the desert to adulteries and boozing and world history to turgid explications of brilliance,  folly, culpability and betrayal, all bookended by fictional scenes with a twinkly Albert Einstein. So it did not pass the time, except (sorry, Dr. Einstein) in a relative sense. I hate to say it, but my major complaint about the movie is that it is three hours too long.",NEUTRAL

"Aug 2, 2023","Best movie I have seen in years.  So much action even the 3 hrs was totally worth every minute.  It wasn't just about 1 thing.

Several more flashes to the past, already witnessed takes the viewer down one last, exhilarating finish without going off the rails into some non-sensical multiverse.  Superb imagery

"Aug 2, 2023","Nolan misses the the opportunity to show the unimaginable horrors of Nuclear War. Nolan is the master of  visualizing the unimaginable (Dark Knoght, Tenet, Interstellar). With no scenes of Nagasaki or Hiroshima, I was extremely disappointed that the master of Cinema declined to visualize the potential horrors of Nuclear Holocaust. In 2023, we live in a real threat of Nuclear War with Russia and China. I had hoped that Nolan would have taken the opportunity to show depict the unimaginable horror of Nagasaki and Hiroshima as a warning ‚ö†Ô∏è echoed from History to present day.

Instead, the audience's attention is directed to Straus's rejection for an senate appointment. I was disappointed in the artistic direction of story telling to the inconsequential.",NEGATIVE

It also touched upon the importance of integrity and whistleblowers who need to address the pride that can lead to fiendish pursuits of ultimate power.",POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023",Too long and too stressful. I wanted a more lighthearted movie. Spending more money on Imax wasn't necessary as most of it was just talking.,NEGATIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","I loved it so much. It's very long, but I think it's worth the watch. J. Robert Oppenheimer is someone that a lot of people have animosity towards, but this movie manages to humanize him. Christopher Nolan said it best, ""Even the best intentions have the most profound and negative consequences."" I LOVE THE SCORE. It's my favorite thing about this movie besides Cillian Murphy's performance. The only thing this movie lacks is the perspective of the indigenous community in New Mexico who suffered immensely from the making and the testing of the atomic bomb.",POSITIVE

"Aug 2, 2023","Great movie overall, but I was definitely expecting some more visuals, though. The trailers and intro made it seem like the visual IMAX experience was going to be a lot more exciting than it turned out to be. That said, I do think the enhanced audio from the IMAX version was noticeable and really added to the atmosphere of certain scenes. I don't know thay I would recommend the IMAX version, but I would definitely recommend the movie itself, given it's incredible story, script, and acting - just don't expect a ton of visuals for the explosion(s) itself/themselves. If you're only, or mainly, in it for the story, though, it absolutely will not disappoint.",POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","Very good acting !   Explained a lot about the A bomb.

"Aug 2, 2023","Pomposity Personified

My least favourite 'auteur', Christopher Nolan has produced a loud, bombastic film concerning the great Jewish American physicist, J (for Julius) Robert Oppenheimer based on the wonderful Pulitzer prize winning bio, American Prometheus. At over 3 hours long, zipping in and out in black and white for no reason, it depicts Oppenheimer as an unknowable genius who is a lefty, womaniser, and a morally conflicted, autistic victim of his own success. Nolan often casts Brits, Irish and Aussies as Americans - especially as heroes (the entire cast of Batman, for example), but this time he has outdone himself - casting Irish Catholic Cillian Murphy (with a nose that points to the sky) as Oppenheimer (with a nose that pointed to the ground). Bizarre casting choices abound - Brit Tom Conti as Einstein, for example. I would be glad to introduce Nolan to some Americans, and perhaps a few Hollywood Jewish actors. People praise Murphy for his performance, but as a Jewish New Yorker familiar with you know, what Jewish New Yorkers look like and sound - I found him vacuous and unconvincing. By far the best acting was Robert Downey Jr. who made the movie worthwhile as the villain Strauss (half American Jew, 100% villain, eh Chris?), followed by Matt Damon as General Groves (but 4 inches shorter and 40 pounds lighter, at least). 

Weaving in and out of time, intercutting celestial and atomic graffiti throughout, the music of Ludwig Goransson ripping the screen whenever, the film tried to achieve in sensory overload in place of, you know, pace and reasoned storytelling. Nolan continues to fool the critics and film goers into thinking he is an intellectual with this tripe, Inception, Interstellar and Tenet. But he is far better at doing lightweight stuff like the Batman movies, with absurd plots, visual dynamism and cartoon characters. His attempts at serious films like this COULD have been are best left to people who know how to make decent films, not this overloaded bullshit. Shame too, American Prometheus deserved better, as did poor Oppie.",NEGATIVE

"Aug 2, 2023","The movie is fabulous!  Well written, excellent cinematography, incredible acting. HOWEVER the graphic pornography on screen of the relationship between Oppenheimer & Jean Tatlock was unneccasary to convey the depth of her dependence on him.  It could have been done more tastefully to open the movie up to a wider audience.",POSITIVE

"Aug 2, 2023","Well done as far as acting and technical presentation. Important historical review. However, failed to really emphasize and call out the monstrous and unforgivable deployment of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and what it did to those 100's of thousands of people. Also missed pointing out that Japanese surrender was already imminent. Finally, was unnecessarily long. Could have been reduced to 2.5 hours easily.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 2, 2023",Great story and fantastic acting.,POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","Mistake to see in Imax format! Missed at least half the dialogue which was spoken behind repeated explosions. Unnecessary exaggerated sound effects. Spouse removed his hearing aids and I wore ear plugs, which we always have now when going to the cinema. Speaking with neighbors who saw it in regular format we learned that it wasn't much better. WHY do films have to be projected so loudly??!! Acting outstanding. Script true-to-life using words spoken by the  principals years ago. . .the words we could actually hear. Disappointing experience.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 2, 2023","Quick cutaways to scenes not adding any value to the titular character or greater story feels like Family Guy at times. 
Loud in between scene physic reaction graphics out of place in otherwise quiet film. Nolan's use of noise was poor, especially at climactic bomb scene where silence meant to add drama, actually takes away from communicating power of the bomb.
First thirty minutes should have been cut out - added nothing and was slow - and movie barely salvaged by performances from RDJ and Matt Damon. 
Movie does a poor job of being a character driven drama, documentary or timepiece.",NEGATIVE

"Aug 2, 2023","This 3 hour long story kept my attention and interest beautifully and I felt like I was in a great history classroom that taught me so many things I hadn't known.  I will definitely read more on this man and his life.

I tell my friends this is not to be missed.",POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","Despite the length of the movie and already knowing some of the story going into it, Nolan's pacing, use of sound, and Oppenheimer's everpresent dread that transitions from trying to understand the universe to fearing the use of his understanding, there are constant threads pulling you through the story, closer to the edge of your seat, building to the very end where most threads end and leave you with one more you can continue to pull on long after the movie. Do you now share his dread? That, you will have to decide.",POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","Too many long, unnecessary, closeup scenes of boiling explosions, sunbursts, etc. Ditto closeups of Oppenheimer staring forlornly into . nothing. 

Oppenheimers troubles with politics were never clearly explained, and seemed almost beside-the-point vs. the development of the bombs. 

I believe that the hype over the movie was prematurely established even before its release. It doesnt deserve accolades. If you havent seen it yet, tamper your expectations.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","Oppenheimer was, alright. Visually nice to watch, the special effects was good, and the use of black and white and colour scenes was smart.

"Aug 2, 2023","Fantastic acting and cast! I never knew the depths of his involvement in the Atomic Bomb but do know.

"Aug 2, 2023","On the positive side, I learnt more about Robert Oppenheimer's career than I had previously known, and the acting was good when it was allowed to be. However, I found the film unnecessarily disjointed, hopping back and forth in time: some scenes in black and white postdated those in full colour, to add to the confusion. The film score (more like an incessant effects track, with musical instruments) was loud and obtrusive in the narrative - for example a tumutuous (drum?) crescendo as we studied the protagonist's face, to indicate his troubled mind; or dialogue with orchestral backing to tell us of the importance of a particular conversation. For heaven's sake, this is not the 1930s: why not just let the actors act? I am confident that they would hold our attention and inform us less clumsily of their thoughts. The impression was left of an overbearing director and/or editor, more suited to action fantasies than the psycological and political drama that this should have been.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","It was too long.  Many stars.  Well done, could have done a better job of explaining the science. If you are not familiar with physics, you really have to pay attention.  The actors were fantastic.",POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023",for a movie about atoms bombs they showed one. they talked a lot and it wasn't entertaining,NEGATIVE
"Aug 2, 2023",It was good for me but I was hoping for an awesome movie and I didn't get it.  It's 3 hours of basically dialog and a lot of it is interesting but I thought it was way too long especially the hearing at the end I thought was never going to end.  Depending on your interest level your mileage will vary?  I can't give it an across the board recommendation.

"Aug 2, 2023","Great movie overall. Brush up on your physics history beforehand or you might get a little overwhelmed by the name drops and lingo. While it does take some creative liberties with history, it generally tells a great story of the man that brought us the most destructive power to date. The conflicts and hubris which Oppenheimer lived with really shone through along with his genius. Three hours is a short time for such a tale and yet a long time to stay parked in a theater seat.

"Aug 2, 2023","I loved the way that sounds and visuals came together to convey mental states.  The triggering of a traumatic episode, cues to near flashback, is there several times before you get the story of it.  I found it so powerful.

And Im grateful for the younger generation to get a feel for the Cold War, our fear of extermination by nuclear war.  The terror of communism and how crazy the red scare was.",POSITIVE

"Aug 2, 2023","Oppenheimer - Bang and a Whimper
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Perhaps it was my expectations after reading the initial reviews, the big names on the billboard or the star director in Christopher Nolan, but I had high hopes before I watched this movie yesterday on IMAX. My feelings are now mixed at best.

Where do we start - I haven't read the Oppenheimer biography, but who hasn't heard his name. The movie is in 3 parts - the journey leading up to the Trinity test, the senate hearing of Strauss, intercut with the Advisory board review of Oppenheimer's security clearance in the later part of his life. Christopher Nolan has made a brave attempt at weaving the various narratives, but the subject matter is so thin that in the attempt to stretch it to cover the 3 hours, the fabric has become very thin and one can see through it.
The most impressive part of Oppenheimer's legacy - the Trinity test - was handled quite well. All the scenes leading up to it were really well made and well performed. The scenes depicting the test itself - left something to be desired. Oppenheimers uneasiness with what followed (Japan bombings) was handled in a very flaky manner. Perhaps it was the man or the story-writing at fault, we'll never know.
The other two parts of the story were very weak. The intensity of those scenes, certainly for dramatic effect, didn't sync well with the material. The advisory review was blown out of proportion (including a completely gratuitous sex scene which felt completely out of place - and not only intentionally so).
The quick cuts of Strauss confirmation hearing were much better handled, but again it was not enough material compared to the time spent on it.
To be fair, the actors acted the hell out of their characters. As many critics have said so far (at the risk of eating their non-existent hats), Cillian Murphy will certainly be nominated for an Oscar. RDJ may also be nominated for a supporting role. Cinematography and sound may also be recognised. However, the movie as a whole doesn't work well. 
The supposedly strong women in the movie don't have much to do. As is often the case, they have been reduced to two-dimensional characters. Florence Pugh is neurotic and horny. Emily Blunt is frustrated and drunk. We never get a chance to explore their motivations beyond some throw-away lines. The one scene where Emily Blunt's character gets a chance to shine is too short.

Overall, I wouldn't recommend my friends to see the movie. I would wait until there is a shorter cut or it inevitably shows up on the streaming platforms.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 2, 2023",The actors were superb in their roles. I learned so much more about this time in history than I had previously known. All-in-all...well done!,POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023",Very good movie just a little too long,POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a thought-provoking and visually breath-taking film supported by exceptional performances and meticulous craftsmanship. Despite occasional emotional detachment and some personal issues with the non-linear structure, Oppenheimer remains a deeply compelling, and intellectually stimulating film that leaves a lasting impression.",POSITIVE

"Aug 2, 2023","The cinematography, music, and sound are perfect.
But because the story is too heavy, there are lots of dialogues that can't be skipped, and the storyline goes back and forth, making many viewers, including myself, dizzy with the story.",POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023",The movie was excellent. There were characters you love and hated. The actors were amazing in their roles.,POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","Fantastic big screen experience.  The all-star cast is impressive and there were amazing performances from Cillian Murphy, Robert Downy Jr. And Matt Damon.  There are too many star studded cameo performances to mention but, my favorites were, Rami Malek and Casey Affleck.  The story of Oppenheimer, The Manhattan Project, the creation of the Atomic Bomb and the devastating aftermath of its use is captivating.  Ive seen it twice already.",POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","After witnessing this EPIC episode this week, I cannot stop thinking about the entire dramatic episode and its repercussions for humanity. I seemed to have a fantastic head start on things, which kept me learning ahead of other people. But, at one point in the film, it offered me a horrifying yet satisfying sensation as well as an additional load of emotions to deal with. Christopher Nolan has been a lifelong engineer and a prophet of mind-bending thrillers mixed with emotions. He knows how to bring the best out of the people he's working with.
In RDJ's language, ""He's kind of like a dad that you can't beef with because he's actually just a really good parent"".

""Oppenheimer"" is a captivating biographical film that delves into the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the brilliant physicist who led the Manhattan Project during WWII. Directed by a talented team, the movie skillfully weaves together historical footage and compelling performances to showcase the complex personality of this enigmatic figure. The film offers a thought-provoking exploration of Oppenheimer's role in creating the atomic bomb and the moral dilemmas he faced. Overall, it is a must-see movie and carries a lot of enriching information about why and specifically how the Los Alamos incident made Dr. Oppenheimer as famous as he is today.
He's neither a hero nor a villain, neither monster nor savior, just a man in flesh and blood trying to do the right things at the wrong time. Altogether, the Los Alamos secret project that maybe he took too personally was successful in terms of yield, but for a moment he didn't even sit and think about the innocent people's lives‚Äîpeople that will be exterminated without knowing anything about what they have done. Maybe fate has nothing to do with us; It is US who decide who we shall be and who we will become without considering the most probable consequences that we will create in the future or simply we chose not to see.",POSITIVE

Well worth the 3 hours it took to watch it all!",POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","Sorry, but the 3 hours was too long & boring. Wish I hadn't gone to see it. Mission Impossible & Sound of Freedom much better. Don't waste your time with Oppenheimer.

"Aug 2, 2023","""Oppenheimer"" delivers a compelling portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer, brilliantly brought to life by Cillian Murphy. The film is elevated further by standout performances from Matt Damon as Gen. Leslie Groves and Robert Downey Jr. as Lewis Strauss. However, the first part of the movie may feel a bit sluggish, though it picks up its pace in the second half, creating a smoother narrative flow. Admittedly, the story's complexity can be challenging to follow, making it difficult to keep track of all the characters. Despite this, the film's gripping moments leading up to the atomic bomb explosion and the impressive depiction of the explosion scene itself make it an exhilarating experience. Although the 3-hour runtime and occasional slow moments might deter some viewers, the movie is undeniably a great watch that benefits from a second viewing, even if not necessarily in IMAX.",POSITIVE

"Aug 2, 2023","I checked the watch when the trinity test happened and was highly ecstatic to find out that there was still an hour of runtime left. But that excitement didn't last.

The movie successfully captures the tension and intrigue surrounding the Trinity test, providing a gripping experience for viewers. However, as the credits rolled, I couldn't help but feel a twinge of disappointment at the missed opportunity to delve deeper into the psychological aftermath of Oppenheimer's actions.

Having established such a remarkable character study in the first act, it felt like a missed opportunity not to delve into the internal turmoil and moral dilemmas that must have plagued Oppenheimer post the devastating bombings in Japan. A deeper examination of the inner conflicts faced by the protagonist would have not only added depth to the narrative but also elevated the film to a more profound and thought-provoking level.

One cannot deny the compelling performance of the lead actor, whose nuanced portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer brings a sense of authenticity to the character. His ability to convey complex emotions with subtlety is truly commendable and carries much of the film's emotional weight. However, the screenplay's failure to provide a stronger psychological arc for the protagonist limits the actor's range and deprives the audience of a more profound connection with the central figure.
Oppenheimer is undeniably a captivating biopic that vividly portrays the events surrounding the Trinity test and the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer. Yet, its refusal to fully delve into the psychological aspects of its complex protagonist leaves a lingering sense of unfulfilled potential.

P.S. The score by Ludwig was amazing.",NEUTRAL

It is a long, historically based film.  I think it is important to do some reading before you attend. The brilliance of founders of quantum physics, combined with the need for the country to end a horrific war, brings about scholarly discussions about how to do this and consider the humanity of an atom bomb.  Packed with incredible and familiar actors, I wonder if you will spot them all.

"Aug 2, 2023","My second favorite Christopher Nolan movie. Outstanding acting, cinematography, sound, and editing. Some of his most creative use of non-linear storytelling by going back to the same scene from two different perspectives.",POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","A masterpiece. Serious topic, extraordinary acting  (especially Murphy, Downey, Jr., Blunt). Worth seeimg multiple times.",POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","Stellar sound design elevates this visually stunning and poignant film.  All performances are top-notch.  Does not feel like 3 hours despite being 3 hours.

As a bio-pic it cannot really control that the events of Oppenheimer's life don't exactly follow a normal climactic structure, but one gripe I have is that the movie does peak in tension at around the middle and never fully recovers from that.  This is especially true if you already know the history of Oppenheimer's post-WW2 life which makes an event presented as a plot twist not land.",POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","Openhiemer seems one prepared to do hard things.
Does a single man convince the U.S. government, military to build a community for scientists in a vast barren landscape simply because of his childhood longing and familiarity. Or is it destiny?",NEUTRAL
"Aug 2, 2023","{POSSIBLE SPOILERS} I absolutely love this movie. It was a blast and a half (all puns are intended) to watch. Like most movies, there were a few slow bits, and a romantic B-plot, but the movie was excellent, really putting into perspective the affect that the development of the A-bomb can do to everyone.",POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023",One of the best films of the year so far. One of the best performances by Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. Christopher Nolan has made a modern masterpiece.,POSITIVE

"Aug 2, 2023",Incredible minds and glad we didnt see the mass destruction!,POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","Oppenheimer fires across all cylinders: writing, editing, cinematography and a soundtrack with a role of its own.  Christopher Nolan makes complex, historical subjects entertaining and exciting.  The ensemble cast played well together, without anyone one player chewing the scenery.  I was glad to see this big film in the theater.",POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023",Great movie about history of atomic bomb!! Could have left the nudity out & still had a great movie!!,POSITIVE

"Aug 2, 2023","Nolan delivered another classic! I was so glad I did my homework on Dr. Oppenheimer prior to watching the film in IMAX. I knew so much about the Manhattan projects, but not very much about Los Alamos, the the studying prior to the day of release helped me understand what I was walking in to.",POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023",Great historical drama with excellent acting.,POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023",Excellent movie.  It did not feel like a 3 hour movie.  A part of history that needs to be understood.,POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","Three-hour movie that could have been done in two hours.  Whoever did the soundtrack should be shot, overshadowed the dialogue, and the screeching of the violin was too much.  Couple to the left of us left, the couple on the right of us got fidgety.  We left tired, and unsatisfied with the story.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","This film will go down as one of the greats. A superb history lesson to those that have no idea of the manipulation of government .
A sobering reality of what this whole event has meant to ours & future generations.

"Aug 2, 2023",I thought the movie was very good they went into so much detail and it was nice to see how much effort they put into the movie. Cillian Murphy is phenomenal,POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","Its worth it just to see the story, which is better than anything any Hollywood writers could come up with, BUT I wasnt thrilled with the format used, starting at the end of his life and seeing the story from his memories basically..while defending himself on an inquiry board, meh! Well shot though.",POSITIVE

"Aug 2, 2023",Really long movie. Very well made. Good story.,POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023",Interesting movie about the atomic bomb and its creator.  Wish there wasnt nudity and sex scenes. It really added nothing to the movie and wasnt necessary. Im sure most people went  to learn about  Dr Oppenheimer.  Not sure why Hollywood has to add something so unnecessary.,POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023",The movie never showed the war. It is like the audience is isolating with the scientists.,POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","Amazing movie!!! Absolutely excellent story line. Truly great acting, great actors. I was consumed in the entire movie. The actor that played Oppenheimer did a spectacular job! He deserves an Oscar! Will definitely watch it again.",POSITIVE

"Aug 2, 2023","presents a biopic story with a combination of science, politics, drama and much more, and is supported by beautiful cinematography and blaring music",POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023",It gives you a really good peak into the US point of the race to own the superiority over weapons. Also reflects the inner struggle of the private citizen and physicist.,POSITIVE

"Aug 2, 2023","Christopher Nolan is a genius
I'm so impressed how fast paced Oppenheimer is, it's so intense. Nolan made sure simple conversation became puzzles to be solved and wars to won.",POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","Good acting, bad directing, 3 hours is too long for a shallow movie like this.  Looks like the people who made it tried hard to satisfy the audience with different views about the atomic bomb creation and its use by US at the end of WWII, but completely failed.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 2, 2023",The movie is an awesome. The acting is great both Cillian and Robert Downey Jr are stellar. I hope they win an Oscar. Overall the whole cast was amazing. The movie photography is fantastic. I love the combination of the black-and-white frames. And how the two stories are clearly differentiated with the fission vs. fusion.  The music is great. I liked that they didnt focus on the bombings but rather on Oppenheimers and Strauss views. I feel you dont have to know any physics to understand how they develop the bombs. 3 hours  went by very quickly since one can get invested in the story very easily.,POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023",Oppenheimer is a brilliant character study and an important education about our history.,POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","Excellent script and acting.  Nailed the tempo, 3 hours just flew by!",POSITIVE

"Aug 2, 2023","Acting was superb. Story line was fascinating. Excellent, riveting movie.",POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","Love it! 3 hours long but I didnt care. The story needed that much time. So much history that I never knew about. And maybe history can sometimes be a little boring, this story wasnt. With all the great acting and directing and writing and cinematography, it kept me fully on the edge of my seat. Cillian Murphy deserves an award for this for sure! So captivatingand good looking doesnt hurt!",POSITIVE

"Aug 2, 2023",Great story. Makes me want to research more. Nudity scenes were ridiculous. NOT NEEDED!!!,POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","Great moviedid not quite live up to all the pre-release hype. Cillian Murphy was excellent and intense in his portrayal of Dr. Oppenheimer, however I believe a Robert Downey Jr surprisingly stole the show! (Maybe best supporting actor nod?)",NEUTRAL
"Aug 2, 2023","Excellent!  Terrifying and painful being in the minds of J Robert Oppenheimer and Adm. Lewis Strauss!  Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. were masterful.  Wonderful supporting performances and, again, masterful story telling!  I was engrossed from beginning to end - don't miss it!",POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","Excellent acting by everyone, especially by the actor who played Oppenheimer. Very suspenseful. The soundtrack/score was amazing. Saw this at Indy 70mm IMAX also,  which was much better than IMAX 2D.",POSITIVE

"Aug 2, 2023",Great cast and overall really good movie.,POSITIVE

"Aug 2, 2023",My expectations were too high. Not enough on the effects on Japans people.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 2, 2023","There was lots to like, including all the different actors, the characters and story telling.  I wish there had been more about the science and less about the military and politics.",POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","Great acting and filming, would like to have seen more about the science and consequences of the two bombs dropped on Japan. Don't know why it was filmed in IMAX, there was no reason to see it that way as it was basically just a drama.",POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023",Very powerful and well acted. Cillian Murphy will definitely get an Oscar for this.,POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023",Didn't like the flash forward and backward format and switching from color to black and white. Also a waste to film in IMAX. Great cast and well acted.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 2, 2023",It was well acted and filmed but at least 30 minutes too long. The non linear timeline became confusing at times.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 2, 2023",Excellent in every aspect!  Very thought provoking!,POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023",Amazing! Demonstrated how difficult it was to reach this point of history.,POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","Fascinating story based on true events.  Terrific cast!  
Also, very informative for those who arent familiar w/ the development, testing and initial use of the atomic bomb to bring WWII to an end saving hundred of thousands American lives.",POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023",Wow speechless. Definitely gonna go see it again.,POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023",Movie was incredible. A Cillian & RDJ mastercraft. The entire cast gave the best performance that they could with the amount of screen time they had. It was amazing. Ludwig again showing everyone that he is now & the future of cinema scores.,POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023",A very long 3 hour movie of mostly just talking. I almost fell asleep - especially in the beginning. I really don't see what the hype is about this film.,NEUTRAL

"Aug 2, 2023","This was a remarkable movie.  The story is compelling.  The history is close enough (I have read American Prometheus.) And the acting was the best I have seen in years.  Just a great film.  Nolan has written, produced, and directed a masterpiece.",POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","I was confused throughout the movie - names, time frames, scenes that made no sense when they first appeared.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 2, 2023",This was an excellent film. Great story about humanity and the struggles we face.,POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023",All star cast that did an in-depth examination of Oppenheimer.  Execellent Job!,POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023",Great acting and great story! Unneeded nudity. Absolutely unnecessary.,POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023",Awesome movie! Sound was awful in the theater we pickednot the fault of the movie,POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","Pretty good. A little discombobulating given Nolan's tendency to jump between time periods. I guess he got drunk on breaking the Three Act Structure when he was making TENET and never really went through proper withdrawal afterwards. Otherwise it's a decent war science film. Caveat, it's not a military science fiction film, it's a historical war science drama film. I'm much pleased.",POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","An amazing film on so many levels.  The creativity of Christopher Nolan in telling this story through flashbacks and cutting between the ""present"" and the past worked so well.  the photography was impressive especially the contrast between the bacl and white segments and the color segments.  The set design and costumes added so much to the story.  And the special effects were riveting.  But most impressive were the actors themselves.  I found Cillian Murphy and Emily Blunt to be absolutely compelling, but they head a stellar cast, not because of their ""star power"" but because of their authenticity.  A powerful movie that spotlights genius and hubris.",POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023",It was a reminder that politics rules the current environment. I like movies that take me away from reality.,NEGATIVE
"Aug 2, 2023",awesome - I can see this getting nominated for many awards,POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","A masterpiece by Nolan. Visually spectacular, but it will be low on my re-watch playlist.",POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","It was a good movie, but a very long one. I feel like they could have cut at least an hour off of it and still told the story.",NEUTRAL

"Aug 2, 2023",Great casting and great acting!!,POSITIVE

"Aug 2, 2023",Too long and drawn out. A good movie but over rated and over hyped.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 2, 2023",First movie I've been to that I didn't even realize it had started. Music is loud. Movie is very choppy. It is like watch a movie preview for 3 hours.,NEGATIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","A stunning visual showcase for a moral paradox. At three hours, there are still threads left to explore but the film raises important historical and human questions that resonate even today.",POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","To long, didn‚Äôt need to be",NEGATIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","70 mm film IMAX was just amazingly impactful.  Moved along nicely, didn't seem as long as the clock would indicate.",POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","This movie was well done. The acting performance was great and I liked how Nolan showed the elements in Oppenheimer's mind. I liked how they set up the bomb scene and it was very well done! My only issue with it was the nudity and sex scene. I thought it was unnecessary because it is a historical movie and there was no need for a sex scene. But other than that, it is a great movie and Nolan has done it again.",POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023",One of the better movies I've seen in years. Would definitely recommend you see it on the largest screen possible.,POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023",Gorgeous movie with an incredible cast. Cillian Murphy deserves an Oscar. Very dense material but a very satisfying story with a devastating ending. I loved it.,POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","Authentic, a film of many themes that truly embraces the gravity of Oppenheimers situation. Been a while since Ive seen a blockbuster that delivered to its hype.",POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","I can't believe I didn't sleep during this. It was basically 3 hours of people in rooms talking to each other. There's Einstein! There's Enrico Fermi! There's Good Will Hunting playing another military guy. There's a lot of people who don't give a sh in the audience. What are we all doing here? They're discussing why didn't Oppenheimer make the H-Bomb when he had a chance? Was he a commie or something? 

I didn't find the portrayal Robert Oppenheimer the man really interesting, nor did I like him much. Maybe it's because Cillian Murphy looks about as American as Stephen Fry. He was just cold and weird and aloof even while having sex. Or was the real Oppenheimer boring af and Cillian is killing it? Either way it's dull as hell. When is the effing bomb going off? There it goes. But wait, was Oppenheimer a commie? Who cares.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 2, 2023",It was great. Bring your attention span and your A game so you follow along. Only complaint was it was longggg.,POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","Awesome movie and a great history lesson.
Was let down by the bomb explosion but other then that it is a cinematic master class by Nolan.",POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","beautifully structured , shot , and told. a fascinating first 30 minutes , an even better middle 30 minutes , and the last 30 are the cherry on top. fantastic ending to a fantastic film , the score was great , the performances riveting , the dialogue well written, the historical events told in a intense connected fashion. all the characters were great , and the way it all interlinks works so well. the ending was a classic .",POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023",well i didnt get to see it ! because i made a mistake and bought ticket at the wrong theater and called when i realized it it was still in previews but would not refund or exchange  thanks alot for taking 28 dollars from me fandango !!!!!,NEGATIVE

Really describes an important time in world history.",POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","It was very informative, but very, very, very slow.  I actually nodded off a few times during the movie.  I was disappointed in it.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 2, 2023",A phenomenal movie based on the true story of the inventor of the atom bomb. It has remarkable acting and stunning visual effects and sound. I highly recommend watching it in IMAX.,POSITIVE

"Aug 2, 2023","Very well done, although the start and end dragged a little.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 2, 2023",Just saw this in theaters in IMAX and am thankful for it was left absolutely speechless with plenty of questions and wanting to watch it again its a movie that really gets you Thinking while the suspense is absolutely thrilling Definitely a film to watch if you're interested in something that mentally engages you,POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023",great directing and storytelling. I loved how the emotions of the characters were told in the movie and how visual effects were used. I do feel the sex scenes could have been done better and didn't do enough to move the plot to be warranted but the positives severely outweigh the negatives,POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","It was well acted and suspenseful, eventhough we know the conclusion.",POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","Felt like they dragged the Los Alimos portion of the movie. I fell asleep. The beginning was great. As was the end. The complexities and politics that go along with developing the bomb were displayed in an interesting way. The dialog between friends, colleagues, and lovers was engaging. As someone who didn't know anything about this particular moment in history, I throughly enjoyed the movie. But I wouldn't watch it in theaters if you had a long day. You will fall asleep. Excited to re watch at home so I can break it up into 2 or 3 sittings and really take in some of the parts I missed.",POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","I'm not sure but I feel like I need to watch this again. It jumped around alot and the music underneath the dialogue was almost constant and distracting, it felt unnecessary. Maybe it was to keep the audience alert as it is a very long film. My husband said and i agree, that it felt like a constant trailer for the film particularly at the start, it was so disjointed. It also lacked character development so I didn't feel like you got to know the characters fully, and it therefore left me unmoved. The acting was good and there were some great visual cinematic moments so that's my 3 stars, but it didn't live up to the hype for me. I was a bit disappointed to be honest.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 2, 2023",Great story telling at its best,POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","It was the best movie weve seen in years. It was extremely well done, the actors were amazing and the make-up department was exceptionally subtle as the actors aged.",POSITIVE

"Aug 2, 2023","If you're a history buff and interested in WW2 and/or the development of the atomic bomb, you will like this movie.  It is presented in a unique way that I first kind of found confusing but in about 15 minutes understood it and found it really entertaining and informative.  3 hours so start with an empty bladder.",POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023",3 hour movie was too long.  Also unnecessary nudity.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 2, 2023",Great movie-story was intriguing  acting very good and the filming excellent!,POSITIVE

"Aug 2, 2023",Excellent Actors/Acting,POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","Wasnt expecting a work of art, but certainly hoping for a better movie. Still not sure what Christopher Nolans contribution to the spectacular, sad event of the Bomb was ‚Äî or of Oppenheimer for that matter. In addition to cliches, some well known details, and a few distortions, the film lacks character development and historical analysis.  Whats there could be edited down to one hour.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Have to watch it again even tho it‚Äôs 3 hours long it went at a fast place at times and I couldn‚Äôt understand some of the dialogue because of the background sounds. Should win an Oscar,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",A great story but complicated to follow the way it was presented in the movie jumping from past to present and the sound at the theater we attended was terrible to loud and distorted.  The acting in the movie was top drawer all the way all were super!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Great acting and Christopher Nolan movies do not disappoint!!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Batman director gets in over his head.,NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",this movie was okay. the pacing of it has this strong tension brewing and it feels like it's giving me anxiety at times. but overall it was a good movie. i do agree with someone who mentioned the sex scenes were strongly unnecessary. there was no purpose for Florence to go topless and it doesn't change anything about the movie.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Fantastic! Fascinating story I never knew.  Provides a in depth look at how aggressive the US government pursued anybody that contemplated aspects of communism at the time.  Even those who performed miracles in the service of their country.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Amazing movie.  Intelligent, informative, thrilling, complex.  Maybe Best Movie material.  Do not miss it.  It's a part of history still relevant today.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Nolan is one of my favorite directors and Cillian Murphy is brilliant. I found it a bit complex to follow unless you know the story before hand and while the director likes to play with the different optics and give it some spin, I felt it was hard to follow at times. The photography was awesome and the images about the bomb were amazing.",POSITIVE

"Aug 1, 2023","This movie is A CINEMATIC MASTERPIECE!! Cillian Murphy has a Career-Best, Amazing, and Oscar-Worthy Performance. So does Robert Downey Jr has a Oscar-Worthy performance but the whole cast is great. The Cinematographey in here is Spectacular! THIS MOVIE IS A MUST SEE MOVIE IN IMAX",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","As what most critic reviews have said and even friends that have seen it, the middle act is the meat, the beginning and end act are the bones.  Part 1 and 3 is part history channel, part C-SPAN.  Yeah it was interesting to get to know some of the history (the entire movie is not 100% factual) of Oppenheimer's life but I wanted more drama and for 3hrs it was not enough payoff in the end.  Usual Nolan's epic movies fly by the 3hrs, but this one, I was counting the minutes til it ended.

But great performance by Cilian Murphy.  Oscar worthy?  Perhaps, though not enough to win but he could be nominated.",NEGATIVE

"Aug 1, 2023",This was more of a mental movie on the history of ww11. Younger audiences would  find it hard to follow if they are not up on their history.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Very technically correct and accurate portrayal of Oppenheimers sacrifice and subsequent punishment for doing exactly what the country wanted from him. You can see it coming a mile away.
That being said, you can only wonder why a man of such intellect could be so conflicted and not expect the eventual outcome.
Cillian Murphy does a fantastic job portraying Robert Oppenheimer realistically.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",A fascinating story about the man/men who developed the atomic bomb and their misgivings about their work.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Well made and presented (as historically correct as possible). Complex characters pique my interest. Thee only downside is that three hours without a restroom break is a bit much for a person who lived through this event.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",The acting was terrific and most interesting story.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","I did not have the opportunity to watch the movie. During the previews, the loud noises of the previews prevented me from continuing to watch what was on the screen. I had to leave the theater with a headache that came on so suddenly it caused tears.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Not very well documented to the facts.  This guy was not a saint.  They should have spent more time developing the real story behind the reason the bomb was developed.  His story on its own was very geeky!,NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","A bit too discursive and slow. Otherwise, an interesting story.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Excellent movie overall with pretty good pacing and cinematography. I just felt the last act could've been truncated a little bit, it started dragging after a while. But I still loved the film overall and thought it did a really good job of telling Oppenheimer's story.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","The first 20-30 minutes were confusing, but the movie was excellent & Robert Downey, Jr. should get an Oscar nomination for his performance.  A little long, still a terrific movie.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Awesome in large format, and awesome sound.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Phenomenal acting by star-studded cast and really delves into the moral, emotional, political, and technical issues Oppie was facing.  It really told the story.  I thought the musical score could be a bit more muted since the acting was so tremendous, the movie didnt need it and I found it distracting.  Visually a great movie.  One gets so immersed, you do not realize its a three hour movie.  This movie is about the man and his struggles during and after the Project, so if youre looking for overly technical details such as the delivery or actual dropping of the bombs, this is not the focus.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Loved it! Thought provoking, realistic, and well filmed. Would recommend to everyone - we need to be aware and prodded to think through history as it impacts our future.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",It was an interesting part of world history.  I dont think the sex scenes on film were really necessary but understand why they included them.  I have recommended the movie to others even if it was longer than it needed to be to convey the message of the film,NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023","I will see this again.  By far the best movie in a generation,",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Brilliant. I would have happily walked back into the cinema and watched the whole thing again if I could. It's a haunting movie that sticks with you long after you have finished watching. It might be three hours long, but I never once looked at the time as I was totally engaged.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Way too long, disappointed to say the least.  Christopher Dolan messed up yet again but that's not surprising given his other weakly directed movies.  Save you  and stay away.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Performances were amazing.  Cillian and RDJ should definitely win an  Oscar.  But, all performed well.  A great history lesson.",POSITIVE

"Aug 1, 2023",Fine film making by one of our best!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Extremely well acted and beautifully filmed, although it could have been 30 minutes shorter.  Some scenes like the security hearing dragged on. Still a very good movie.",POSITIVE

Best film for me in a decade.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","The story was wonderfully told, and the director was able to really build the tension both before the Trinity test and the end of the movie so that you felt that you were part of the experience.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Acting superb.  Engrossing biopic about events that changed the world forever.,POSITIVE

"Aug 1, 2023",It was a good movie but too long,NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023","Wonderful performances, especially by Robert Downey Jr. It certainly showed Oppenheimer's terrible treatment by the government! An extremely thought-provoking film!",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Great road down history showing the double edge sword of the emotional burden of bombing a country and victory of winning the war! Coupled with the suspicions of communism and betrayal made it captivating. The actress shown prolonged and openly topless, in many scenes, is more than tasteless and very unnecessary. I would not see it again for that reason.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023",A necessary watch for historic and entertainment purposes.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Overall a good movie. Moving back and forth between earlier and later time periods was surprisingly effective. 

Thought there would be more focus on the development of the bomb. Was also surprised of the duration spent dealing with the 1950's congressional hearings.

Only questionable material were the multiple nude scenes that didn't add anything to the film",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Not the movie I expected. It was more about the dismantling of his government position than the project. Didnt appreciate the sex scenes that added nothing to the story but made it uncomfortable sitting next to my sons.,NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",The movie was excellent.!   The seats were horrible. The employees at the service counter were not helpful. Ours was sucking ice from her cup while waiting on us. The bar was broken. No beer service. I expected comfortable seats. I need to have my legs elevated. They weren‚Äôt.,NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Acting was superb!. Robert Downey Jr , Cillian Murphy , and Emily Blunt were all equally fabulous.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",The dialog was amazing.  There is never a dull moment.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Beautiful cinematography all around with a fast paced narrative and some intriguing displays of creativity. Near perfect storytelling that puts the weight of the situation onto the audience and serves as a grave reminder of the danger of nuclear war. Overall, an impressive film from that surpassed my expectations and deserves to be seen in iMAX.
Recommendation: bring a blanket bc after 3 hours the theatre gets pretty cold",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Actors and actors were superb. Movie kept we curious and alert even though it was 3 hours long.,POSITIVE

"Aug 1, 2023",THE HISTORY WAS ENLIGHTENING - HAD NO IDEA HE & HIS FELLOW SCIENCE COMMUNITY ENDURED SUCH MALIGNING THROUGH POLITICAL CHANELS.  THE NUDITY DID NOT ENHANCE THE BACK STORY.  FACTS IN EVIDENCE ARE SUFFICIENT FOR THE TRUTH...,NEUTRAL

"Aug 1, 2023","Excellent cast, very interesting and telling about our history.  A tad long but great to see on the big screen without any interruptions.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","The movie was a good history lesson, and some brief research into Oppenheimers life and accomplishments beforehand would have helped us to follow the plot better - since it jumped around. The cinematics were beautiful and acting good although I thought a few minor actors were stale. Despite seeing it in iMax (or maybe because of the high volume of the theater sound) we had trouble hearing or understanding at times. Accents may have played a part. It was interesting seeing all the young stars (siblings and kids of major stars) making appearances.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","The movie unfolded in a very careful, deliberate pace. Which gave it ample time to explore Mr. Oppenheimer's story but it also became tedious after a while. I felt it could have achieved the same results with a more streamlined film.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023",A little too much drama needlessly added.,NEUTRAL

"Aug 1, 2023",Absolutely great movie! The acting of the cast was phenomenal all around. The movie is extremely loud so keep that in mind if you have any sensitivity.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","It's very long, but I enjoy courtroom style discussion and this movie had plenty of that. 
Action only fans could be disappointed.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",The movie is 1 hour too long. The sex scenes were completely unnecessary. Nearly lost my hearing in some of the final scenes. Why?!,NEUTRAL

"Aug 1, 2023",LONG BUT EXCELLENT!!  GREAT ACTING!!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Great movie after all these time. It is worthy to go to a movie theatre to see this historial movie. It did not feel that long as it is a 3 hours long movie. It is a good show produced.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Le d√©but du film est long , on s'ennuie facilement mais c'est totalement justifi√© par la seconde partie du film , beaucoup plus d√©routante , qui entre dans la chute et la r√©demption de Robert Oppenheimer , j'ai trouv√© le film super , surtout au cin√©ma l'explosion de l'essai Trinity semble presque r√©el surtout si vous le regardez avec les effets 4d.
Voici ma note personnelle :
 -Sc√©nario : 10 / 10
-Casting : 9 / 10
-Visuels : 9,5 / 10
-Effet sp√©ciaux : 10 / 10 ( surtout quand on sais que les explosions n'ont pas √©t√© faite en CGI )
-Fin : 10 / 10
-Overall : 10 / 10",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Nolan does it again. Out of Nolan's war chest of great movies, this is definitely up there. I've watched many biopics, and by far this is my favorite. The cast is absolutely incredible; there were so many great actors playing side characters that it's quite funny to see. Cillian Murphy was absolutely amazing as Oppenheimer, and it will definitely be one of those acting jobs where the actor is forever remembered for that one character they play.

The Trinity Test, as we all know, was ground-breaking, but the movie really does it justice with its dramatization. You really feel the power and ground-breakingness of the test. By far my favorite scene. The movie keeps you on your seat, and at the end of the movie, you really do learn a lot about Robert Oppenheimer. All I knew before this movie was that he was the father of the atomic bomb, and this movie truly teaches you this man's life story and the hell of a life, I must say, he lived.

Overall, the story was great, and the movie's cinematography was amazing, as expected from Nolan. But I truly love the anti-war message that comes up during the movie, especially towards the end. It really is a powerful and beautiful message, which resonates a lot, especially with the other themes of the movie.

The only problem was the relationship between Strauss and Oppenheimer. The movie goes by way too fast, and a lot of it seemed underdeveloped in my opinion. I wish they did more with it. Although I'm sure most of it happens subtly and I may not have caught it, other than that fantastic movie, which is a must-watch.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",could have edited out 30 minutes,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Great story beautifully portrayed!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Disliked the experience:  Unfortunately, it was hard too follow bc I couldnt hear.  
Loved the movie.  I need to rent when available.  And research the political side covered in the last hour.  I say with a 3 a hrs, 1/2 should be on the editing room floor.  I dont think anything / scenes was too much or unnecessary. But why sex in the first 15-20 minutes?  How did it affect the movie? . More and more customers are sick and tired of the graphic sex and gratuitous horrible language.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",The movie was great! Actors were perfect!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Beautiful movie! Best movie of the year from acting to visuals!!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","One question I usually ask myself, after seeing a film--would I pay good hard earned money to see it again--
In this case ---YES,YES,YES. Acting was superior by all the 'stars'-- had to double check who played Einstien!
Money very well spent for sure--5  stars without a doubt.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Incredible film even for its length the movie stays interesting throughout.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Historical  drama but a bit too long,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","This is the type of movie that used to always win ""best picture"" academy award.  I hope it does so this year.  So many great performances and such an interesting story.   Three hours was a long time to sit.  I wish it had an intermission :-).",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Loved the story and depiction of Oppenheimer's patriotic character and views on nuclear non-proliferation. However, he could have been portrayed as a womanizer without the unnecessary explicit nudity and sex scenes. Makes it difficult to share this movie for its historical significance with underage teens for R rated movies.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023",Cillian Murphy was excellent.!!!!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",It is very deep with lots of historical events but its very personal.  I feel like I need to learn more about the events after the bomb was dropped more than the actual making of the bomb.  that was the story.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Loved the actors and their acting. Not so crazy about the movie although it held my interest for 3 hours. A compelling story!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Too long.plot meandered around too much between Oppe and Strauss. Disappointing because of the hype. Not a 5 star movie, 30 minutes less nonsense and it might be a 4.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023","The movie was very good, however, I'm glad that I saw a short documentary about the movie before since for many movie goers, the story could be difficult to follow because of several flashbacks throughout the story.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",I would have liked less politics and more science but the Christopher Nolan story was excellent.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Brilliant! A Nolan masterpiece.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","IMAX is a waste.  See it in standard 70mm film projection or Dolby Vision.  The audio at the IMAX screening was deafening and there was something off in the mix as the music (which by the way distracting to the max) overpowered the dialogue.  That got better after the first hour or so, but the music overall seemed forced.  Visually, the IMAX seemed unnecessary as so much of the film is in close-ups.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023","A film like Oppenheimer can easily be regarded as a well made film, but is not for everyone. Rating it based on filmmaking, then it's a 10 and that's where I will stay personally, too. Certainly there are things that could be changed to ""make it better"", but the decisions that were made by Nolan were the correct ones narratively.

The purpose of the film is not about creating the bomb, but its true intentions, other than being focused on Oppenheimer, are not truly revealed until the third act. The characters and their ideals drive the plots forward in a very interesting way. Revealing how people, especially the physicist and scientists, act in this place and time fits the structure of the story to a T. We don't need to know the direction that the film is going since we already know the end. Who Oppenheimer is and how he communicates with those around him is all the audience needs for the first hour and the next hour, dealing with the bomb, is paid off dramatically based on our personal experience with these characters. There's a lot of plot, but not much story, which is exactly what this film needed.

By the time we get to the true meaning of the film and why it's told as a drama rather than a documentary is realized in its third act. It's a human story that will make you question history and not so much the ""how"" of the bomb, but the ""why"". The 3 hour journey is a completely original experience. It's an audio and visual experience that doesn't let go of its audience. You will be forced to watch the movie at a high volume or with subtitles, but the payoff of a loud 3 hours spent with Oppenheimer is relentlessly rewarding. While it may not be for everyone, it is a film made perfectly for what Nolan was going for, and it's ""perfect"" for that reason alone.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","A great movie that was very realistic and portrayed the a harsh reality of war and political tricks, the issues were/are real and the dangers of  the atom bomb opened Pandora's box on our world. Anyone walking out or bitching about this film is either a commie or and idiot.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Ive always been fascinated with Oppenheimer, and all of his accomplishments in the movie did not disappoint. Cast was terrific.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Sound other than dialog too loud!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","It is the perfect movie  The acting, the writing, the sound, the cinematography, the sad history of it all to I wish remind us just how we should not repeat it.  3 hour movie and the time just flew because you are so into it.  It will sweep the awards.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Despite the length of the movie, I was never bored, distracted or disinterested. Melding current/past scenarios were seamless and effective, detailing his story from a personal, professional, legal, historical perspective. Oscar nomination, at least!",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Loved it. Everything was just great. Everything.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","This was well done, my wife commented on the nude/sex scenes as well done in proper context of adult behavior.  Anybody that walked out on this must have been a Commie or dumb as the realistic nature of time and events was spot on. It's not for kids, only adult only for realistic nuance of the cold harsh facts of life in that time.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Wasnt much more than a documentary.  Very hard to stay awake.,NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","This movie helped me understand more about the history and lives behind the bombs that helped end the war with Japan.  The only parts I thought were not really needed were the scenes with the partial nudity.  Overall an Excellent, well-made movie! The three hours passed by very fast!",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Only its running time and Nolan's characteristically knotty screenwriting compromise what is a hugely powerful examination of the moral and political costs of the invention of the world's most dreadful weapons. Superb photography and a clutch of excellent performances carry the film, not least Cillian Murphy's incredibly complex and vulnerable Oppenheimer. Great casting and surely a shoe-in for Best Actor everywhere.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Very realistic movie, the editing, acting, tense, and drama were vast parts of this great movie!",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Great cast, superb acting, excellent filming, etc etc etc!!!!!!!!!!!",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",this movie is Brilliant start to finish,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",I loved this film. Made a special trip to see it in 70mm film format and was not disappointed. The cinematography was amazing. I loved the rich coloring and textured feel of the film stock that was used. The story itself was told so well that it made the 3 hours move by at a great pace. It interwove the personal narrative well with the historical factual narrative very well.,POSITIVE

Chris Nolan
is a genius",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Very informative! Well made movie,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Excellent movie. We absolutely thought it top notch. The only complaint was the unnecessary explicit sexual content. It was not needed. The almost 3 hour movie went by quickly.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","The story line jumped all over making it hard to know who exactly the characters were. There were so many scientists who were only touched on briefly, I ended the movie not really knowing which scientist was whom. I literally almost walked out three times thinking, if I have sit through another long monologue of men in a small room questioning Oppenheimer, I am done. I made it through, but honestly, I have made better decisions.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","It is so refreshing to not only see a movie like this come out in the current movie landscape, but it was done incredibly well. This is Christopher Nolans best work and Cillian Murphy could not have done better. Truly a must see.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","The acting was suburb!  Cillian Murphy was suburb! Glad we finally got to see him play a totally different role.  Emilly Blunt and Mat Damon were perfect in their parts, and who doesn't love Robert Downey Jr!  All of the casting members were good choices and played their parts well. There were lots of details that resonated with the attitudes of that era.  I especially liked the idea that Oppenheimer, as well as Eistein had some regrets about what their discoveries would mean for mankind and the future of the world.  They certainly made an impact on our lives.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Outstanding movie!  Everything about it is spot on!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","The performances were Oscar-calbre, but the film dragged. The story wasn't told well, and the constant underlying buzz of anxiety-provoking music became annoying within the 1st hour.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023","Too bad that we were not able to see this movie since the show was canceled by the Theater at Irvine Spectrum(   One star rating is for the theater, not the movie.  We will have to rebook again.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Could this be Christopher Nolan's best movie? Everything he has done as a director was in preparation for this movie. I predict this movie will be nominated for Best Director, Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Adapted Screenplay, among others. A classic.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Terrible, long, boring, redundant, unnecessary nudity",NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","The movie would have been better without the sex and nudity scenes, and less of the F word. Especially, when pushing this movie in combination with the Barbie movie. 

I watched the MSNBC documentary on Oppenheimer and found it to be better than the movie. At least I wasnt embarrassed watching it like I was the movie along with my 91 year old friend.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023","This was a movie my husband wanted to see, and we saw it in Imax.  The larger screen was not necessary as there were no scenes that required it.  The movie was mostly dialogue.  It was long and boring in my opinion.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Extremely well done.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Educational, too long! Acting was outstanding!!!",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",So beautiful and horrifying. The acting is impeccable. The story telling is top tier. It felt like I held my breath for 3 hours as I sat on the edge of my seat. The visual design and sound design were incredible and intoxicating. This has become one of my favorite films of all time. This is truly Nolan's masterpiece.,POSITIVE

"Aug 1, 2023",Oppenheimer is a well made film with a very watchable cast of characters. Throughly enjoyed it :),POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","The acting was extraordinary and the set was fantastic, but the director's approach did not enhance the story line, it was disjointed, lack cohesiveness and did not focus this most important issue of war and nuclear armament. This should have been 3 separate films so that Oppenheimer, the person and his weapon of death could have been more deeply explored!",NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Liked the in-depth script, and the performances (particularly the Cillian Murphy).  Did not think the affair with Ms.Tatlock was needed it didn't advance the story, only added to the runtime.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Movie was great theater needed to turn down volume by 10%.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",This historical movie was very well done and led to many interesting conversations afterwards. Can't say that I've seen a movie quite like it in a long time.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Such a well written story with excellent pace and factual. The acting was superb it could not have been better!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Borring! Not because main characters are theoretical physicists (I am theoretical physicist by myself) but because the scenario is horribly written, and the film is poorly made. I love Emily Blunt, but this is her worst performance. Even Matt Damon is not helping. This ship is sinking as film is progressing and nobody can save it. What a waste of time and money.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",This movie is 3 hours long (3 hour tour?). Some of those hearing and arguments could have been cut down to a few relevant quotes. The acting is phenomenal -- I see Oscars for Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey.,POSITIVE

"Aug 1, 2023",Very boring. More action in previews,NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",The special effects were good.  The acting was good.  But the way the story was told needed work.  The first hour was confusing with alot of time period jumping back and forth the second hour was focused on the Manhattan project and was too hyper technical and the third hour tried to resolve what the first hour teed up.  The third hour was the clearest but it took too long to get there.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023",Very informative and very entertaining!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Too long the close ups of Cillian were a bit much at the beginning.  Not much about the after effects of dropping the bomb OR the long lasting effects on the lives of those living around the los  Alamos region.  
It did a good job showing the politicians not really understanding what they had.  Truman came across as an ass.  Actually, no one knew what they had.  
Special effects of the Trinity blast were intense.",POSITIVE

"Aug 1, 2023","Powerful movie, makes you really think about what is going on in the world today.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Oppenheimer is long. Not too long, just long. Beautifully shot. Loved the imagery throughout.  Jumps around back and forth through decades. Not necessarily hard to keep up, just makes you want to see again again to see what you may have missed bc theres so much.  Oscar-contender,  for sure.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Although it is a long movie, it keeps your interest. I walked out thinking‚Ä¶ Wow, there‚Äôs a lot to unpack there!!!!",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Loved the movie, great historical story that everyone should see. Acting was excellent.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Bored from the start. Not good at all don‚Äôt know why they made this film,NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",The score and visual storytelling were crazy good.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",It evoked very powerful emotions.  A definite must see.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",While this may not be the movie for everybody it was excellent in my opinion. Another year in waiting and they could have even covered the posthumous reinstatement of his clearance!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",We almost always like true life stories at the movies. I wasn't aware of much of the story on how that all came to be. I was glad to see that some thought went into the making of the bomb and its possible consequences ! We enjoyed it !,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",The story was interesting but it was very slow-3 hours is too long.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023","Entertaining and very historically informative. 
Superb acting and visual effects.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",The movie has an incredible plot that makes you feel like a character,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","It's as if one of Francisco Goya's black painting's soul was somehow turned into a movie. A depiction of a creation so terrifying and mesmerizing that you can't look away.

Helped by a stellar cast, it is an amalgam of visuals and sound that are able to literally control the way that your heart beats. Mind you, this is a movie that needs to be experienced either at the cinema or with a surround sound system.

In a way, the music and sound mixing becomes an unofficial narrator for the movie. It takes you by the hand and guides you through a beautifully haunting and at times infuriating story. A story about how a man that was too brilliant for this world, ultimately doomed it due to events that were out of his control in order to save his country.

The movie also excels in it's pacing, as it feels like there's a continuous crescendo until the inevitable boom and subsequent silence thereafter. There were moments where the air felt like it was on fire, something that not a lot of movies can even attempt to do, let alone succeed.

Impeccable acting, impeccable writing and a reminder that the world is simply waiting for the Doomsday Clock to strike midnight in order for it to be able to heal from what humanity has brought to it.

This IS Christopher Nolan's BEST movie. But if existential dread is not something that you can cope with, maybe skip it.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Great movie.  Told me a lot of things I didn't know about Oppenheimer.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Outstanding historical drama!  Will definitely go see it again after researching to learn more about some of the people involved in the project.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Awesome movie! Lots of stars. Super interesting.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",This movie was a generational story of how one man and one event can change the course of history for better and worse. Some of Christopher Nolan‚Äôs greatest work while remaining true to his unique style of storytelling while also experimenting to push the boundaries of what a film can become.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Visually stunning, but not very successful at storytelling. This long movie is made up of vignettes of actors making speeches. The dialogue doesn't flow in a natural believable manner. Most of the characters are black or white and not very likable.

I found it disappointing.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023","An amazing docudrama, That told the mostly unknown story about Oppenheimer, and his very complex life.
The acting was award winning. Especially Cillian Murphy in the lead role.
Just a beautiful production.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Was very insightful and also very captivating. Only dislike would be rapid fire dialogue without subtitles and lots of names to keep track of,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Liked: Portrayal of the historical background. Rami Maleks acting.
Disliked too much dry dialog and wordiness, too little human engagement. 
I plan to watch it again when its streaming in case I missed important dialogue and elements of the plot that I missed.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023",Great acting and storyline. A must see!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Excellent movie. Loved it!,POSITIVE

"Aug 1, 2023","Outstanding acting, great cinematography, wonderful score.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","It was a fasinating dive into the creator of the atom bomb. At first it was a bit confusing with several events being protrayed, but once I sorted out what events and how they were intertwined the movie became more interesting and very educational.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Excellent...long, but excellent",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Very fine film interesting WII history!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Loved the details of the development of the bomb enjoyed the look at his relationship with Einstein and fellow researchers.
Never knew he had an affair. Found it sad how he was treated once he changed his views about such instruments of death.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Oppenheimer lived up to the hype. Definitely a must see!!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Cillian Murphy's performance was truly Oscar worthy!
The move would have benefitted from some tighter editing....",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023","Spectacular film in every wayfrom the writing to acting to cinematography  to music to casting.  
SPELLBINDING!!!",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","I recommend the movie. The reason I do not give it 5 stars is because it was very difficult to follow the dialogue: I know the Hollywood fashion is for actors to speak in muffled voices that are not audible and to drown even that out with blaring music. Don't they think that people go to movies to hear???? This one went over the top on both counts. Numerous other people have told me that they caught no more than 30% of the dialogue. This was particularly true of the women actors. As bad as the mumbling was, the blaring, bombastic music was particularly a dialogue destroyer in this movie. The music was good, but TONE IT DOWN!!!!",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Suspenseful telling of a period of history that is not well known. Cillian Murphy an supporting cast, especially Robert Downey Junior, were stellar.c",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Great story, excellent acting",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","The science and politics was a part of the sign of the times, back then and even now. Seeing the bombs drop or even the more of the surrender was quick.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Oppenheimer brought fourth many deep and effectively moody settings for the character analysis to occur. For the complexity of the overall story and science involved in the actual retelling it was never dull or overly wordy, rather it was witty and engaging so that I felt challenged to listen intently along the journey. The backdrop of New Mexico was especially captivating.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","I would give this 6 stars if I could.  Oppenheimer is a film for the ages, with a compelling story, amazing cinematography, outstanding direction, and a knockout ensemble cast.  IMAX/70mm is the undisputed king of movie formats.  I've seen this film in every IMAX/70-certified venue in Southern California.  Universal CityWalk should be regarded as the gold standard IMAX theater for picture and sound.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Excellent stars, excellent directing and writing!",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","The movie might have deserved a 5-star rating if we'd been able to hear what they were saying more than 80% of the time. Unfortunately, we watched it at an Imax and it was so loud that in addition to distorting the sound, it was loud enough to shake our seats! Terrible experience.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023",The director captured the story well. It was very educating and informative. There were many factual things that occured and wasn't discussed in school and  history.    All the actors were great and believable.  Hope the film and director get its recognition and oscar...   Well done!!!!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","The movie portrayed Truman in a bad light. The Japanese were not surrendering and we had the choice of sending a huge number of soldiers or dropping the bomb. At the time the public did not want to send more soldiers, and a decision was made to drop the bomb. That fact should have been noted.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Great movie but too long,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Great history lesson.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","The movie was very well done. Great acting.  Good history coming to light.  Wanted to read more about the time and situation. 
The theatre at AMC Prairie Fire was terribly hot and uncomfortable for three hours.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Jump around between scenes to much and the background music was way to load,NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",This was so well done. Very intense work. It gives you a feel of the internal struggle of making a weapon of such power.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Such a great movie! Very insightful and a cinematic treasure.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",I liked the history behind the movie but it was entirely too long and drawn out,NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Epic, intense. Great acting",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Likely the movie of the year.  All around great film. Robert Downy Jr a shoe in for best supporting.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Great visuals, compelling storyline, and superb cast.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Too much communism content.  Nude scene, really?  Why?.  Who wants to see Oppenheimer in the nude.  Tried to squeeze all biography into 3 hours.   Interrogation flash back was boring.
Should have concentrated on activity at Los Alamos and the science and the bomb.  Truman scene was boring.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",The story was good but way too long (it could have told the story in 1 hour and 45 minutes I think) and the jumping from present to past to future and back again was annoying. Confusing at times. Totally unnecessary too. The story would be much better in chronological order.,NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Explained information  was not aware of. Also showed the corruption that has always been underlying in the power hungry politicians. Something I feel everyone should view. I wish there had been more emphasis on the people who were affected by the test blast and what the repercussions for them moving forward looked like.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","To say Oppenheimer is a feat in itself of filmmaking, is an absolute understatement. All aspects are working together fluently. The score is fantastic, writing, acting, editing all top notch. Has some of the best and most fascinating imagery I‚Äôve ever seen on film. It‚Äôs riveting, gripping and Nolan really outdid himself and so did Cillian and Robert. Couple Oscar‚Äôs incoming and please see this in 70mm!! ",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Too long and story not well developed,NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Great movie. Was a bit nervous when I saw it was 3 hours but movie was fantastic. Great casting and really enjoyed the movie.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Good optics and imagery.
The story line seemed a little slow at times.
The implied conclusion (That the atomic bomb was the main reason for the end of WW2.) is not historically accurate.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Such a well done film. Will have you walking out of the cinema speechless. An absolute must see movie!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","A very thought provoking film with some terrific performances,Mr Murphy is outstanding.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","The writing, directing and acting all came together to provide a first rate movie about a complex man and his impact on history.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",It kept me engaged the whole time.  I dont think the nude scenes were necessary.  It was a good movie.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","All of the major themes and characters were well fleshed out. Beautiful music. The women were full, interesting characters. I loved the science. I loved the history. The real horrors of the bombing of Japan were conveyed that was a relief. Well done Christopher Nolan.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Thought it was too long & found it to be confusing & boring!,NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Disturbing AND gratifying. Really brought a human face to several legendary scientists who we never think of as people with the same problems and dilemmas we all have. Visually stunning!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",it was all entertaining and i hope truthful.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",It has great pace and plot development.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Powerful story with amazing actors.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","The cinematography is spectacular.  I found it going back and forth from one event to another in time, unappealing. The sexual scenes were completely unnecessary  and added nothing profound to the film.
Cillian Murphy did a fine job of Oppenheimer, some scenes better than others, but not capture the myriad characteristics of his personality that to me was Nolan's fault,
Robert Downey was brilliant beyond belief as Strauss.  I feel it was a mistake not to show, even if for a few minutes, Hiroshima and Nagasaki after the bombing.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023","Well done, but there was a lack of representation in the experiences or pov of the Japanese people who were actually affected by the deployment of the atomic bomb.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","I loved it. I enjoyed it much more than I thought I would. I respect Christopher Nolan and his work. He puts in so much effort to deliver big event original movies that matter. Hes one of the most important film makers of our time. I have not been a die hard fan though. Some of his movies although impressive left me feeling kind of uninspired, which maybe thats my fault, but I go into his movies with such high hopes that I feel let down occasionally. I think this is his best film by quite a lot. The pace, the acting, the music, the editing, jumping back and forth in time, the INSANE build up scene to the Trinity test and then the third act of the film.. some people are cold on the third act. Not me. I think this is the most fascinating part of the movie. I was curious why Nolan didnt name the film American Prometheus!! That would have been such a killer title. But I see why he chose Oppenheimer. Its perfect. The third act puts a bow on this epic character study. An awe inspiring, important, timeless film about, what the film may suggest, the most significant man in modern history, perhaps ever. No clue how Nolan pulled this off. Cannot wait to see what he and his co-creators do next!",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Well acted. Excellent background on historic time. Younger voters need to see movie to learn about history.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","I appreciate the accuracy of the storyline.  The presentation itself was fragmented, especially for the current generation, many of whom either dont know or understand how politicians manipulate what happens in our country.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023",Wish the movie had shown more about building and dropping the bomb. Spent too much time with the backstory of his life.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023","It was educational, eye opening & interesting.  I loved every thing about the movie & would like to purchase the DVD when available to watch from home again.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Great writing, cinematography & music. Just too long for my taste.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023",Excellent movie! Quite an expose on the politics he endured post explosion of the test bomb! Wish more on the fallout experienced by NM residents at the time.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Beautiful cinematography
Beautiful sound effects
Breathtaking soundtracks
Great acting
A masterpiece in general",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Would have given 5 stars if I could have hear and understand the dialog. The sound quality left a lot to be desired!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Great movie! Everything thing about it was fabulous. Acting, sound, cinematography, storyline.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Historically somewhat accurate but movie was not as heartfelt about the many people who suffered and long term effects of the bomb especially to the numbers who lost their lives or suffered from the radiation (cancer, sickness, loved ones dealing with loss, etc). I disliked the constant orchestra during dialogue.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Stunning visuals, haunting sound, engaging storyline, stellar acting",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Cast was amazing. Brilliantly written. Loved everything about it!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Loved the whole story, but I wished I had done some history research so it made more sense.  It was too loud in some places.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",It seemed more like a documentary. It was interesting but not very entertaining to me.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023","I enjoyed the history of the bomb, the government involvement and the twists and turns of the scientists character and the man  n government whose personal goal came into play.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Christopher Nolan once more didnt disappoint! I thought the movie stayed true to historical events and the acting from each of the cast was outstanding. I recommend anyone interested in history / science see this film. Just be prepared to sit for awhile.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","I had expected more of a war movie but was pleasantly surprised. The movie was entertaining but also informative. I guess I should have paid attention in school. Great acting as well, I see an Oscar for Robert Downing Jr.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",The movie was full of moral passion and pathos. Excellent and a must see!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",I never knew his story. I thought it was done very well.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",A good story with good effects.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Very revealing and educational,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","The suspense and intrigue created were very engaging.  The length of the movie seemed necessary in retrospect, and boredom was never experienced.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",As good as it gets. Suspense with historical significance.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Too loud in the theatre so movie was difficult to focus on.,NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Too long and very boring,NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Honestly got nothing bad to say about the movie,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Beautifully shot,  excellent performances, but ultimately a far-too-talky treatise on Oppenheimer's security clearance woes.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023","The movie was well done. The acting, cinematography, directing. I liked that Nolan focused more on the atomic bomb and Oppenheimer himself rather than the war. Im just excited to see non-sequel or rebooted content. Please give us more of this.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Beautiful score, great cast, wonderful script!",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",The movie was incredible and we loved it! Viewing the movie on the IMAX screen was totally awesome and I highly recommend!!! RC Theater at Queensgate York did not disappoint.,POSITIVE

"Aug 1, 2023","It was an amazing,brilliant movie",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","The casting was perfect and the movie showed the many sides of Oppenheimer, including the aftermath of the A-bomb. The three hour duration passed quickly!",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Like this type of movie & interested in the bomb creation,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Great multiple story lines and acting/ could have been 15-30 minutes shorter,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",About 1.5 hours too long!  Same things over and over,NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Oppenheimer may be one of the most artistic and impressive movies so far this year. Nolan once again shows that there is a medium of art and entertainment, which kept me engaged throughout the film. Fantastic acting accompanied by stunning visuals and audio collections that brings history to life. The film is a summary of a tremendous man's life, and they did a great job covering the bases while adding a little Hollywood spectacle. It's a marathon and it isn't easy to sit through especially coming off of a long day, but the pace and content are engaging to keep your attention. Some issues with character balancing and pacing could have been cut down and it may not be the most entertaining escape for certain viewers, but the movie is worth the praise given what it achieves in this genre.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023","Terrific movie.  It was exciting, educational and thought provoking.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Phenomenal cast and acting. Long movie but I didnt fidget once because it was so engrossing from start to finish.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",The acting was excellent! Should be seen twice to keep up with all the characters. Extremely well done!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Great facts about Oppenheimer. Great cast as well. Just a tad too long.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","The movie lived up to the hype. We all know that the United States initiated the Manhattan Project and was able to defeat Japan. However, we didn't know how difficult this task was. We also didn't know that success was far from guaranteed.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","I think Oppenheimer is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Acting, pacing, story-telling ‚Äî it is masterful. Few movies have ever held my attention for 3 full hours. The gobsmacking reality versus intellectual theory of creating an atomic bomb was so intrinsic to the intent and then reaction of the individuals ‚Äî and so perfectly portrayed by Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey, Jr, Matt Damon and Emily Blunt. 5 stars and then some!!",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Excellent cast and story line ignited an interest in ready more about the subject!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Good character development. Some of the dialogue was hard to distinguish in that the music was too overpowering.  Well scripted.  Strong performances.,POSITIVE

"Aug 1, 2023",Didnt understand all the visions at the beginning of the movie. Didnt like story line.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023","It was intriguing but never settled into a clear arc, i was not sure what the actual drama was. Never got to know the guy enough.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023","Direction and production values are excellent. Film techniques to keep the viewer attentive during the three hours are quite successful.  However, it had the qualities of a quasi-documentary, and the assertive, charismatic qualities that have been attributed to Oppie were not ever in evidence in this film. Murphy's stance was consistently that of a martyr. The director's preoccupation with the injustice done to Oppenheimer seemed to overwhelm the expressiveness and humanity of the characters to give the movie more of a feel of the medieval morality play. However, the moral conflicts of the scientists and the horror as a consequence of the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were very well portrayed.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",It is a great and complex story and the acting is superb. It is too long though and the script could have been better to make the story flow better.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023","Riveting, well filmed picture. The story is long but never boring. A must see for science and/or history buffs.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Stacked cast! Great writing and cinematography. Cillian Murphy is Fantastic!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Great movie, great acting and certainly didn't seem like 3 hours.  Even though I knew the story, it was still jammed packed drama",POSITIVE

Acting was great. Very intense script.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Learned things I didnt know about J Robert Oppenheimer,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Good acting, interesting dialogues, amazing story. Maybe casting more Jewish actors to represent the events more accurately. We are doing that with Spanish, African -American, other minorities but for some reason Jewish actors are not represented.  Just a thought.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",I think it was a great movie.  I liked all the detail that  was shown regarding the things that took place leading up to the big explosion and the aftermath.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Historical and excellent acting,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",The story was vivid and true to Murphys performance and that was mentally refreshing to watch.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Great show. If you like history and need validation of what a swamp (full of swamp creatures) Washington DC is, you will like this show. Its a flashback (and forward) format so youll u have to pay attention. Lol
Really good.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","There were many aspects of this film that I felt were outstanding and top-notch! 
Ill definitely be adding it to my collection when it becomes available
Do be prepared for moments of loud sound (as one may expect), and some brief nudity (which didnt really add).
The deep dive into this mans mind and the historical depiction, which by all accounts is accurate, I found to be fascinating!",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Very interesting movie.  Probably need to watch at least twice unless you are a history buff to understand the true timeline of events.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","The movie is extremely powerful, but I do not recommend seeing it in IMAX. Your hearing will be affected/ damaged. Also, the focus of the movie is more on the obsession with communists than on the development of the nuclear weapons.",POSITIVE

"Aug 1, 2023",Very long and drawn out.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023","It meandered too much between the past and present.  I kept trying to like it but after three hours, I gave up.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Oppenheimer was an amazing movie. It really made the viewers think about the effects of the nuclear bomb while keeping the attention almost throughout the entire movie which is impressive with almost only dialogue. Overall I will most likely go back to get the Imax experience which I wish to experience.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Should have pictures of real people and what happened to them in end credits. And perhaps shown the horrific effects of the bombs.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Excellent movie! Great actors!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",The acting was phenomenal.  Special effects were just right and editing was impressive.  All should win an Oscars.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Excellent movie! It is well written and acted with a great storyline. There was so much I didn‚Äôt know about his life. I love stories based on historical people and events. I highly recommend this movie to everyone. ,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Oppenheimers story is fascinating and the film tells it well.,POSITIVE

"Aug 1, 2023","Intentionally saw in 70mm IMAX format, wow! Great history and the effects were amazing. Favorite movie in a long, long time. Well done!",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","It was excellent movie. It was just very long and drawn out - they could have eliminated his imaginations.  We were disappointed that there was no real discussion or scene that focused on what happened in Santa Fe, NM.  Also, the actual process of developing the weapon was alluded to many times but was never really explained.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023","The first hour was so boring, but the rest was very good.  The performances were excellent.",NEUTRAL

"Aug 1, 2023",accurate and exciting view of Oppenheimer's science and the McCartheyism hazing later in his life.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Nothing special that required seeing it on the big screen. It felt like something that should have aired on the history channel. Acting was excellent, I fault the screenplay for making it boring.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Its not what story is being told (anyone can find the historical facts of the Manhattan Project) but HOW its being told. This takes its place alongside greats Come and See and The Thin Red Line exploring the psychological effects of war, this time showing its effects on a civilian. A cinematic tour de force.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Nolan hit it out of the park with this one. I love how he went for an Aaron Sorkin drama in the last hour and nailed it.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Comfortable seats in the theater and ample running time allowed me to catch up on my sleep. This was a complete bore. What am I missing here?,NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",a movie that mostly dialogue for 3 hours long and Ive never been more awake.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Great story. Fantastic cast.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Generally I like thoughtful complex movies of a dramatic nature but we left after 1 hour. This hour could have been summarized into a dramatic 10- minutes easily. The main focus seemed to be on senate communist party hearings and unionization of university faculty. It also bounces between multiple time periods, with no particular reasoning and we had to use fashion of the period to keep it organized in our minds.

"Aug 1, 2023","This movie was very academic. Most of the science above everyone's head. This made the dialogue tedious. Even though it was fast paced, there was just way too much talking. The actors made it good to watch with what they were dealt. I found the score to be irritating. It was too much of the same for three hours. It would have been a great story, but missed the mark.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023",Great film- Chris Nolan does it again!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",It was incredible from start to finish. It impacted me physically as well as emotionally.  Will be hard to match the imax experience.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",It took too long to deliver the challenge Oppenheimer was experiencing morally. It was not clear. The second half.was far superior to the first.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Too documentary and definitely too long,NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","The movie theater didn't give us warning the IMAX wasn't working. A lot of people were upset. They only said it's IMAX and not the theater s problem. At least email the people, that there's a problem.. we had to drive far for this.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","I'm not a huge Christopher Nolan fan. I find a lot of his work to be too long, supercilious and confusing. I like to be able to follow the story and the plot so that the narrative unfolds in such a way that I don't have to say ""wait, can we rewind that scene?"". I've had to do that in several of Nolan's films. Inception was probably the worst offender. I wrote this the day after I saw the movie:

""Inception was a blessedly short film for me since during it, I entered a dream state (deep REM naps) several times. These refreshing sleeps, populated with dreams far more interesting than anything in the film (I am always naked and running through huge crowds) were made possible because I was in a recliner stadium chair, allowing me to stretch out. Thus, the film was more like a trailer than a full blown theatrical feature, and as far as I can tell, I missed nothing, nor did the story make any more sense, since, let's be clear, it made no sense at all for those who stayed awake. Anybody claiming otherwise is an idiot, or afraid to admit that they had no idea whatsoever what the movie was about.""

I don't feel that way about Oppenheimer. For two acts right up until the bomb goes off (not a VFX shot for the film purist Nolan) the writer/director had to stick to the conventions of a biopic, i.e. tell us about this man's life in chronological order. In this respect, it is a magnificent piece of work: beautifully shot in 70MM film, splendid production and costume design, with bravura historically acccurate performances from the ensemble.

Act 3 is a little perplexing because it is so dense with political intrigue that I wanted to revisit certain scenes to keep things understandable. It's also too long. After the bomb goes off, everything that follows is somewhat anti-climactic. But, again, the exceptional acting and the mise en scene makes the length of the act forgivable. It's clear that Nolan loves the content and the era. His fascination with the period, the story and our flawed hero is infectious.

So without question, this is the best, most cerebral and most engaging film amidst a slew of cinematic flotsam that pass as entertainment these days. BTW, I saw the film on a standard screen with standard audio. If I see it again, it will be in an IMAX theater. Nolan is one of the few remaining film traditionalists, so I will respect that commitment and see the film the next time in a manner consistent with the way he shot it.",POSITIVE

"Aug 1, 2023",Great movie and performances. But the first hour drug on a little.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","A great story-telling experience of a true event. The impact of Nolan's choices struck, in my opinion. 3 hours is a little long for a movie like this, especially when it feels like the buildup is the dropping of the bombs, but then there's like an hour or so after that of his story and impacts on his life. The film doesn't dwell heavily on the lives lost and repercussions for society, which I was glad for - there's other and better ways to learn about that stuff in my opinion. I do think the sex scenes were a bit thrown in just because they could with the rating. There was one scene where it was impactful but the ""character"" felt used for the nudity and not very impactful on the story - but again, it's a true story, so it's not like it was based on nothing. It's a shame because I think it could have been used as an educational movie to show in school without those scenes.",POSITIVE

Nolan did amazing on this one and its one of if not his best movie. its definitely one of the best biopics I've ever seen. its up there with movies like shindlers list storytelling wise, and gives off a similar feeling with the lighting and the music. the only thing i would suggest is not having those s*x scenes because I found them slightly unnecessary and it would have appealed to a larger audience if they did remove it.",POSITIVE

""The Bomb"" is only a supporting actor in this political drama and exploration  into the psychoanalysis of a troubled genius.

"Aug 1, 2023","Could not understand one third of the dialogue. Some of the sound effects, which had nothing to do with the bomb, were louder than the bomb effect. Could have been the theaters sound system, but whatever it was it made the whole experience even more unpleasant than the theater seats.

The interaction between the principles and the set design are amazing.  Cillian Murphy for best actor, Robert Downy Jr. for supporting actor and Emily Blunt for best actress.

"Aug 1, 2023","Good film overall but just about 30 minutes too long, in my opinion.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Meh. Perhaps the most over-rated/over-hyped movie of the year (next to Barbie, of course). Entire 3 hours felt like exposition...I literally can't recall a single moment of subtext in the entire film...just a vomit of endless words on the screen, with each character spelling out exactly what they were saying, feeling and thinking for exactly 180 minutes. There was maybe a few moments of actual non-dialogue, but so much jump-cutting and editing...it all felt hastily thrown together, jumping from one scene and point in time (year, month, or day--not counting the obvious black and white flashbacks) to the next, edited like a giant real of endless linear film that must have been 80 hours, like they were trying to squeeze in every conceivable word of dialog they could without any thought to what was actually needed (some shots were even poorly edited for continuity you could spot differences in actor's gestures or faces from camera angles that were clearly from different shots, continuity that even most sitcoms do a better job of concealing during the editing process).

If you want to see a good examples of how to compile huge amounts of exposition, history and fiction inspired by ""true events"" in a much more entertaining and thought-provoking fashion, go watch Oliver Stone's JFK, which weaves through hundreds of points in time, positions and perspectives masterfully.

Honestly I have no desire to ever watch this movie again. Terribly boring, uninspiring and not thought-provoking, save for the singular well-anticipated special effect ""big wow"" moment of test detonation (shortly followed by a complete glossing over the actual event itself, plus the second Nagasaki bombing mentioned only 1 time in passing as if it were a throw-away line), which still left an hour or more to go in the film afterwards. You could see people looking at their watches wondering where the rest of the movie was going. The answer is: Nowhere.",NEGATIVE

"Aug 1, 2023","movie was fantastic! however, one complaint everyone came out with that while the music was great and certainly added to the movie, it more often than not got in the way of the dialogue which made it very difficult to understand what the actors were saying.

Among many themes in the movie:  Just because it can be done, does not mean it should be done thorny issues regarding greater good decision-making and moral reasoning insight into political and cultural recurring trends and processes the heros journey (Joseph Campbell) recognition of disconfirmation bias as a powerful human behavior the context of division of beliefs among political and military leaders about how to break the will of a people with either precision bombing of industrial choke points vs. carpet bombing of civilian population, both of which were done in Europe and Japan, and the eventual supremacy of Truman and LeMay, still being played out in Ukraine the lost opportunity to have empowered the U.N. the question who was the audience for Hiroshima and Nagasaki:  Japan or Russia?  and the context of anti-Semitism both in Germany and among the Allies and in the U.S.  This movie goes on and on.

"Aug 1, 2023","Great story on the history of Oppenheimer career 
Not worthy of all the IMAX hype it was just as good at a regular theater.

"Aug 1, 2023","The movie was overall good. However, the fact that it jumped around between the present (1930s-40s) and the future (his investigation and the senate hearings) made it difficult to follow.

I saw another movie in the same theater a few months ago, and had the same complaint which is that the loud parts were far too loud, in fact, painful to my ear.

Cillian Murphy  was remarkable at demonstrating his euphoria at accomplishing the practicality of the applied science, yet the let down when the scientists were immediately discarded and the military industrial complex took over.  The pride of accomplishment and the shame were felt side by side.  It was magnificent at showing all this in a short three hours.  (I mean that - 3 hours felt like nothing.)

Wow.

Just wow. 

Incredible piece of cinema. Not a movie. Not even a film. Pure cinema.

A beautiful and stunning cinematic experience and masterpiece.

Christopher Nolan should never make another movie again because he will never come close to this cinematic masterpiece. This should be his signature.

Its loud. Its intense. It takes moments of discussion about theoretical physics and makes them riveting.

And Robert Downy Jr. is remarkable. Every scene with him is a something truly special and intense. 

And Cillian Murphy doesnt just portray J.  Robert Oppenheimer. He shows us what Oppenheimer felt in the aftermath. Its stunning and beautiful and horrifying all at once. 

This is Nolans Schindlers List. A true masterpiece, expertly crafted and executed and wholly engrossing. 

Bring earplugs.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Thought the movie was excellent, but perhaps a little longer than it needed to be.   Did wish the end had said that  President Lyndon Johnson honored Oppenheimer after his security clearance had been revoked, and that US Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm ordered that the 1954 decision to revoke his security clearance be vacated.  It left you wondering what happened to Oppenheimer.   Otherwise, it was an excellent movie!",POSITIVE

"Aug 1, 2023",nice piece of history,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","I soooo wanted to give this movie 5 stars but I cannot for the following reasons. The main being the editing. In a traditional documentary include all of the nitty gritty details but in cinema we dont want to do this because the run time will be way too long and will take away from the movie experience. So many little things could have been edited away and we could have been left with not only an amazing movie but the story arch would still be intact. Another reason I had to take away a star was the nudity that completely had no place. We are all adults we know when there is sex involved in a relationship without having to see every areola. Why? There was no point. It didnt add to the experience and in fact it took away from it because in a movie theatre there is no one in their right mind who feels comfortable watching those scenes with strangers or even friends and family. Less people will go to see this film because of the nudity. While others will only see it for that reason but that it for another discussion. In all, this film could have been the best film of the year if it had just been reigned in in the Final Cut.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023","It was great history though sadly needed to save many more lives than were lost.

"Aug 1, 2023","as a study in character, it was illuminating to see the depths of Oppenheimer's heart and mind.  As an historical piece, we all know what he achieved, just not how he did it and why.  It will likely earn Golden Globe and Oscar consideration.",POSITIVE

"Aug 1, 2023","Wasn't what we thought it would be.  A great character portrayal with historical relevancy and subplots very unexpected.  Great cast, thought provoking backstories, real life historical figures with generational references new audiences might not understand.  Cillian Murphy is excellent.  Robert Downey Jr awesome in his role as revenge seeking politician.  Whole cast is superb.  Backgrounds in New Mexico and Los Alamos very realistic. Made we want to read the book for more depth.  The whole Barbieheimer marketing was totally ridiculous since neither audience would ever want to see the other movie in one setting free concessions or not unless avoiding the extreme heat and needing a reason to stay in the A/C.",POSITIVE

"Aug 1, 2023","Left out too many details about the literal fallout from the tests in NM, the actual impact of the exposure of radioactive fallout on US residents. I found it focused too much on the technical and not enough on the inner turmoil endured by Oppenheimer as a human. In my view, it was more spectacle than personal.

"Aug 1, 2023","Definite best picture candidate. Highly recommended. There is some graphic nudity and sex, which I was not expecting.

Incredibly impactful film that most of us will not soon forget.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","I really enjoyed the movie! However, I think it is a little overhyped. I definitely will be watching it a second time to further gather my thoughts. I LOVED the first two acts of the movie and the ending, SO GOOD! But the third act is where the movie sort of lost me. I understand the themes that were being presented in the third act, but it wasnt as engaging and didnt keep my interest like the first two acts did. If the third act was on par with the first two acts for me, this would have been my favorite film of the year, unfortunately, that wasnt the case. For me, its a thumbs up, but not a double thumbs up.",NEUTRAL

"Aug 1, 2023","Not life-changing like some early reviews seemed to purport, but maybe because I knew way too much about this time in America's history already. Great performances, sound design, editing, etc. See it in 70mm!",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","This is such a powerful movie. It's long by today's standard but I was riveted and the story never lagged so that shorter wouldn't have done the story justice.

Since Oppenheimer was stripped of his clearance (not long) before I was born, I had heard of him and his leadership of the Manhattan Project but never really knew a lot about him. So many of the physicists with whom he interacted were names from my physics books.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",The movie was great. And historical informative,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",I loved the movie.  Fantastic performances by the cast.  The movie is long but very detailed.   It appears to be less about the building of the BOMB and more about the life of Oppenheimer and how he went from a national hero to a national target for anti-communists.  This movie needs to be seen on a large screen!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Way too long, technical and to much emphasis  on politics! Boring! Acting great best part  of movie Emily Blount and Matt Damon, Robert Downy Jr worst not enough screen time for all these great actors!",NEGATIVE

Would have been better at home with subtitles and the ability to pause halfway through.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023",Liked it very much. Very interesting but. A little slow at times. Very enlightening on what our own government will do to its own. If he add invented such a thing in this age hed be a billionaire.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","I liked the fact that Nolan portrayed those who thought the bomb was a bad idea as well as those ""gung ho"" scientists that wanted to jump right in.  I understand a little bit more the terrible debate these scientists had and some of the guilt they may have felt afterwards.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Very informative and seemed true to the primary character, the covert behavior of military and daily life of that era. The attention to detail was astonishing. The clothes of each character, which were representative of their hierarchy in their various businesses. The vintage cars and the home decor were spot on.
There was difficulty in some of the rapid speech & terminology used to describe the science & technology of the mission. Closed captioning would have been a great help. Will probably watch it again at home, with the CC turned on.",POSITIVE

"Aug 1, 2023","I didn't like it the way I thought. It's very confusing and fast sometimes you don't know in which moment of time you are because it takes place in three different stages. Also, there are many names of characters that you lose track of, it is difficult to know which one they are talking about. I expected something different, I only liked the linear part when they are building and testing the bomb.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",One of the best films I have seen in a long time. You are so captivated by the show you don't even realize it is 3 hours long.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Generally I am not a fan of 3-hour long films, but Oppenheimer was paced perfectly. The story was well-told and built up as it ought to be. Cillian Murphy personified J. Robert Oppenheimer!",POSITIVE

"Aug 1, 2023",A story about an amoral science GOAT who developed a conscious while weaponizing physics that lead to dropping the little boy and fat man in Japan. Kinda cringy watching a sex scene with 300+ other people.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","The best movie I have seen in many years! Mind boggling. Star studded, but you can hardly tell. Multiple story lines that are all addressed. This is a must see. I need to see it again, as it is complex.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",The movie was well acted and one of the best I have ever seen. It dealt with all of the things that were hidden from public view and illustrated how government manipulated both people and the narrative that was provided to citizens. It took the audience back in time and yet showed the parallel of events and actions still going on today. It is frightening to know how much is being withheld to cover up the crimes that both elected officials and government employees are committing. The weaponization of government agencies being used against those who disagree or who threaten to expose these crimes is no different today than it was during the days of Oppenheimer. Anti-Semitism is on the rise and our new enemy is China. I hope people watch this as well as the Sound of Freedom.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","I loved that the movie  was historically fairly accurate. The acting was superb. The only thing that it did not have was an intermission, which I deem necessary for a 3 plus hour movie",POSITIVE

"Aug 1, 2023","Magnificent and thought provoking. 
Only aspect that I did not like was the sound mixing because it drowned out the dialogue.
On a separate note, was disappointed that the fall out from communities was not referenced at any point",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Actually, this wasn't my type of movie, I just went with my husband.  However, it was a good movie!  At first, it moved slowly, but I kept watching and enjoyed the backstory about how Oppenheimer initially struggled and the complexities surrounding his personal life.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","""Oppenheimer,"" the latest offering from the visionary director Christopher Nolan, is a compelling biographical drama that takes viewers on a journey through the life of the esteemed physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer. With a strong focus on historical accuracy and stunning visuals, the film offers a captivating cinematic experience that will undoubtedly resonate with enthusiasts of scientific history.

Nolan's storytelling prowess shines brightly in ""Oppenheimer."" The narrative skillfully explores Oppenheimer's scientific achievements while delving into the profound ethical dilemmas that surrounded his groundbreaking work. The director's masterful touch elevates the film, delivering a thought-provoking and emotionally engaging account of one of the most significant periods in history.

The casting in ""Oppenheimer"" is top-notch, with the lead actor delivering an exceptional performance as J. Robert Oppenheimer. Supported by a talented cast, the film's characters come to life, adding depth and authenticity to the overall story.

Visually, ""Oppenheimer"" is a feast for the eyes. Nolan's signature cinematography style contributes to the film's immersive experience, transporting the audience to the era in which the events unfolded.

"Aug 1, 2023",Excellent portrayal of Oppenheimer by Cillan Murphy of a brilliant but troubled genius. Accurate depiction of how early actions have consequences years later when the political landscape shifts.

The movie moved along quickly because there was so much detail that was included, needed to replay much of it in my head as I looked up things later about the characters, and went oh, man, Nolan got that in there this way, incredible!! Loved the sinister, innocent, 'gotcha', saddening parts as well",POSITIVE

"Aug 1, 2023","This is the most profound film I have seen until this exact moment in time and space. I will never be able to watch it again, vastly triggering and evoked such emotions. Stellar performances around, the use of the Gita was spectacular, the dialogue that was certainly poached from those brains that held suicidal ideation, depressive proclivities and anxiety. I purchased the score during the closing credits. I felt the film inside of my very skull, enhanced the sound of arterial blood flow within my ears. I became the body electric watching this as it pierces you to the core. I was thrilled to find a new film that wasnt full of woke, sheep-shaped snowflakes. I was ecstatic to watch a film that wasnt obsessed with counting ethnicities, countries of origin and properly using them in a sentence. It was jarring however and for those that shut their ears against personal insight, weakness and pain, it will come off as too long, shallow and pedantic. For those that close off their emotions, say rub some dirt in it, I feel bad that you will most likely miss everything and focus on the irrelevant. This film is a seismic shift and flies in the face of necessary, inclusivity. Before this film, I always considered There will be Blood  to the epitome of all that is filmmaking. Oppenheimer destroys that.",POSITIVE

"Aug 1, 2023","Since the movie was based on American Prometheus, it had more of Robert Oppenheimer's relationships, social life, and political effects. People who are not that interested in Oppenheimer's life would not be that satisfied after the movie. I think the tense atmosphere and all the great actors really made the movie. RDJ did a great job as Lewis Strauss in the hearing too. I hope it showed more of Oppenheimer's distribution to physics and nuclear engineering but I think it was the best film of the year! The action was great and Christopher Nolan's bio pic is a must-see!",POSITIVE

"Aug 1, 2023","Everything about this movie is excellent from the acting to the sound to the cinematography to the pace to the script to the tone seriously, everything! Highly recommended. I would watch this again. Loved the movie.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","I took two teenagers, and we all enjoyed the movie. It held our attention, it was easy to follow the story line, the actors were great, and the history was interesting. The movie did not seem 3+ hours long because it was so creatively done.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","It's long, its obnoxiously loud at times, but overall its a good movie. An interesting perspective into an important time period of history that impacts all of us today. I will watch again to pick up small details I'm sure I missed in the first viewing.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Very good acting and storytelling of an important historical moment.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Really enjoyed this historic event....""Oppenheimer"" was a super informative movie with great acting.  It was very long, but no way to cut it shorter.",POSITIVE

"Aug 1, 2023","Masterpiece! Acting, editing, music, directingone of the top movies made!",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Not a terrible movie. I think it ran a bit long. Probably could have been a 2.5 hour movie.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","As someone who grew up in Los Alamos, I was pleased by the portrayals of the people my parents worked with. Yes, the use of the bomb was awful, and yes, beating the Germans was seen as necessary. 
I wish the movie had spent even a fifteen-second shot of a room full of women (mostly the wives and daughters) at rows of adding machines. They were the computers whose calculations made the project possible. The one throw-away line about some of the wives help out answering phones did the women of Los Alamos a disservice. They deserved to be recognized for their work as much as the physicists who depended on them to do the calculations in the pre-mechanical/electrical computer world.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Acting? Amazing. Visuals? Amazing. Music? Incredible. I've been thinking about this movie for over a week, can't wait to see it again.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Too long. An hour could have easily been edited out of the film.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023","The movie gave an in-depth background into the key persons and their personalities before, during and after the development of the atomic bomb. Excellent script and the performance by the actors was spot on. This is a must see.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Sobering. Two best actor performances. The bedroom scenes should have been removed.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Slow first 1/2 hr- my husband walked out, I stayed. Got better ad soon as he left. My son and grandson had seen it and said the last hour ir so of the ending seemed boring to them. I found it just as good as the rest of the movie after the first half hour.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Excellent movie! Superb acting, amazing visually, and I learned a whole lot about the Manhattan Project!  I highly recommend it!  Long movie, but I don't see how it could have been done differently.",POSITIVE

"Aug 1, 2023",Performances were exceptional.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Very good. But a little long.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","I felt the movie was excellent. Technically accurate with regard to the physics. Robert Downey Jr. was fantastic in a possible academy award nomination. 

Sex scenes were unnecessary. Point could have been made without gratuitous graphic nude scenes.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",I totally enjoyed the movie. The acting was superb. The story was interesting. Seeing it in an IMAX theater is a must.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Too long.  Overly dramatic soundtrack became distracting at points. Excellent acting performances,NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023",Wonderful. Might be the best move I have ever seen. Sat there for 3 hours and was afraid to leave my seat for fear of missing something important.,POSITIVE

"Aug 1, 2023",Great performances.  Extremely thought-provoking.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Excellent story telling, however it bounced around a bit and for those who dont know the history, it may take two views to understand.  I did it just because!",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Love how it makes you use your brain and it's not just a mindless watch! Amazing movie!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Incredible history based movie, very intense and interesting. I would ha ve given it 5 stars but the audio was way yo loud.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Great movie. Acting was terrific. Some of the score was annoying,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","The historicity of the movie was very good. The main problems were: (1) the dialogue was not clear and understandable in many places and, (2) while faithful to history, the repeated jumps between time periods was confusing.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023",4th time seeing this movie. Very powerful important film.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Movie did a poor job of portraying the difference between uranium and plutonium bombs, as well as distinguishing the issues among Chicago, Oak Ridge and Hanford development . . . and, therefore, did not define the several clashes between Oppenheimer and Groves -- beyond security matters.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Great movie. Chris Nolan at his best. Tremendous acting and story. A visual and auditory experience.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",The acting was beyond superb. One of the best movies I've ever seen.,POSITIVE

"Aug 1, 2023",It was trashy. Totally unnecessary prolonged nudity. Slow and hard to follow. Three hours too long.,NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","too long, scenes jumped from one era to another, hard to follow, not enough about the man himself (other than his sex life)",NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Very interesting.  Three hours went by very quickly.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Boring. Too much politics and too little science.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023",Very slow and very long.  Highly educational but tough to sit through.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023","I liked it a lot to a point that I had seen it twice, very interesting how a scientist gets wrapped into politic .......",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Great movie , def a must see for anyone interested in this type of movie and seeing how things really happened",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Terrific cast. Great acting! Wonderfully told & depicted true story everyone should see.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Really well directed! I loved how it showed all the scientists' unique personalities. I expected more about Oppenheimer's family life, being a biopic, but his son was only 4 when the A bomb was dropped on Japan and it keeps a pretty tight focus around that incident. 
The movie tries to strike a balance between awe at the scientists' achievements and horror at the effects of their creation on the world. Whether it's successful at that or not is up to the viewer. 
I agree with criticisms that it could have delved more into the effects of nuclear testing at the Los Alamos site.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Lead actor and Downey both terrific. Too long.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Very unsettling but it was real life.  Loved that they cast was so vast.  The storyline was just written beautifully.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",A very educational movie that shows how are government works to this day.  Thank goodness for the morals of people that will stand up for what they believe in.,POSITIVE

"Aug 1, 2023",Slow in developing. Jumped around too much. Sound seemed muffled.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023",very good and educational movie.  learned many things I was not aware of as I was born in 1949,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","It was pretty long to be so technical about the review board.  However, as a whole, it was riveting.  Ambition was apparently the chief cause for the use of the bomb, so it's well to consider that just a few men's foibles create enormous chaos.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Three hours flew by.  The editing, acting and cinemaphotography were fantastic!",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Amazing cinematic experience - a must see on IMAX 70mm if you can.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Intense lesson in history and morality.  As resonate today as 1945.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Powerful storytelling. Great musical direction that flows perfectly with the mood of the movie. Incredible acting by so many well known actors. Typically steady and sound Nolan direction. Three hours flew by. Loved the intensity in and even uncomfortability of some scenes. Did not appreciate the sexual content but realize that it was an aspect of Oppenheimers life that impacted his character.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","It was one of the best films I ever seen in a very long time.  I'd rate it up there either Gone with the Wind, Australia, and some I can't remember",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Absolutely flawless!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Amazing! excellent acting, great cast. Finally a movie without superhero nonsense.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",The first two hours were boring and the movie was very slow moving with lots of dialogue. The last hour or so was good and finally made it to the action. Great history lesson! Loved the last hour but the entire movie was way too long.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023","I took my family to see this epic film by Chris Nolan and it was fascinating. Very detailed and it leaves you wanting more,  to know more about Oppenheimer.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Amazing. Well acted and paced for a movie with a lot of dialogue. Feel this will be in the kid for academy awards on all fronts.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Boring, reading the history was better than the movie.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023","Historically I suppose it was very good however, to me it dragged on and was boring. The lead actor didn't have much of a personality.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023","Outstanding movie, easily the Movie of The Year for 2023!",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Though it had some interesting moments, overall It was kind of dark and too long. I left feeling bad for watching it",NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Too long and not much happening..,NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Just a masterclass in filmmaking. 3 hours long and we werent bored for a single moment.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Excellent acting, accurate uniforms, realistic sets.   This film should be see in a big dark theater not at home on a tiny screen.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Watching this film in 70mm 15perf IMAX was a treat to behold, an absolute full cinematic experience with a mind boggling dilemma.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Too long. Would have liked more on how they built the A bomb.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023",Great story & acting did not seem like a 3 hour movie- very fast paced,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Sex scene not necessary - 3 hours - way to long - could have trimmed an hour off it - I fell asleep because it was moving to slow,NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023","This movie was good, but I do wish the focus had of been on Einstein instead of Open-whatever.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","It was a long movie but definitely  kept your interest.
Great performances.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","It was really good, not sure how accurate though.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",A little too long but otherwise good,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Absolutely fantastic movie!
The acting was superb as well as the storyline.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",3 hours of politicking and Oppenheimers sexual exploits made for a very long movie.  Should have spent more time on the science and development of the A-Bomb.  Painful to sit through the boredom.,NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Gret story not many people know about. A little long, but worth it.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Really well filmed and produced! You can really experience his thoughts through the visuals and sound production. Interesting portrayal of his life.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Too long, dragged out, too much dialogue not enough to keep audience interested for 3 hours. Movie was hyped up too much.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023",Great review of history. Proud to be an American!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Great back story to the creation and dangers of our nuclear weapons age.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Very thought provoking. Always interesting to look back in history, to try and understand events and their impact on all of us.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023","The acting was great as were the sets, costumes etc. However flashbacks were not an effective way to tell the story. It was extremely choppy and felt like they were trying to make an epic movie rather than telling the interesting story of his life.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023","I don't know about anyone else, but was the volume way too loud? It was tough to tell because the dialog was way too low... like they were whispering. The movie was good, but it is hard to know what his history is and what is fiction. All of the actors were wonderful, and the direction was superb. The photography was amazing. It reminded me a little of Memento because it traveled all around in time. It helped to what I assume was the McCarthy Era in black and white. That acted like an anchor to remind you where you had bounced. So I really liked it, other than feeling like I left a concert from having ringing ears.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","I really enjoyed the movie, even learning a little bit of history.  Which I did check out. 
Also the atomic explosion was scary and made me think WTF.  Definitely a good one",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Powerful directing of fabulous actors.  Truly one of the best movies Ive ever seen!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Really slow getting started.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Too long, not enough WWII background, made him something he was not a communist and made him boring. I teach History.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023",Great movie with a very strong cast!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","An exceptional film. Mesmerizing! Must see!
It is good to go in though knowing some of the history about the atom bomb, and the key players, Oppenheimer being the head of the project.
Definite Oscar Contender!",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",The acting (&the actors ) were fantastic!  The storyline was thought provoking as well. I grew up in the era right after WW II so it was especially poignant for me. I shudder when I think or read about how close we came to blowing up our world.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",excellent film that was perfectly paced.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Reveals the complete untold story - at least I was not aware!  However, I spent a lot of time trying to understand the use of B&W vs color.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Mesmerizing!  Felt it was the longest I had sat watching something, riveted to the screen, for 3 hours.  The story was compelling and relevant, the emotions palpable.  Christopher Nolan at his best.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","An important movie to be sure, but there are other ways to learn more about the creation of the nuclear bomb and Oppenheimer.  This director is very self-indulgent, the movie is faaaaaarrrr too long and full of unnecessary trickery.  Cuts all over the place rather than tell a linear story, has many, many characters you can't keep track of, drags in places.  Robert Downey Jr. saves the movie to a certain extent, he's excellent.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023",Long and slow to start but finished well,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","The acting was fantastic! The plot drug a little bit, but the story telling was phenomenally done. The movie could have been done in 2.5 so I think its 30 minutes to long. But great movie!",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","It was very well done and we enjoyed it. At times, the dialogue was just a tad too perfect. Not distractingly so, though.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",It will be nominated for an Oscar !  A must see in High School.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Loved the movie. Could have done without the nudity and really was not needed. Acting was great all around.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Fast moving, great acting, great story and history!",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Riveting start to finish. Fantastic cast and storyline taking us back to the time between the wars. IMAX must.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Very Nolan, the sound, the cuts, and the effects... also very R rated lol",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","While I really did enjoy all the historical aspects of the movie, the cast and acting, it really could have done without all the nudity and sex. You can get the point across without showing full nudity on screen. Other than that, seeing it in XD was great.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",This movie was very well done. Enjoyed it very much.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","It was bit long, but it opened my eyes to a lot of things that are still happening in government.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","And just like that, 3 hours of my life was stolen. 

I wanted a sophisticated look at an important and pivotal point in world history. Instead what I got was three hours of solipsistic talking heads, nonstop dialogue, (literally) and wall-to-wall relentless LOUD sound design. All of it in service of Christopher Nolans attempt to make a controversial Oliver Stone styled movie. He borrowed Stones classic use of random black and white scenes, jump cuts and disjointed reaction shots which made flms like NIXON and NATURAL BORN KILLERS unique. 

Sadly, although Nolan delivers a resonable facilily of Stones style, he lacks Stones story telling and dialogue skills. Most disappontingly, there are no new revelations or controversy. This is a standard retelling of Oppenheimers rise and fall, which was told far better in the 1989 film, FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY, for a fraction of the budget and half the screen time. 

If youre thinking of this as one of those movies you just HAVE to see on the big screen, save your money. With the vast majority of the movie composed of close ups and medium shots, this marathon is much better suited to your 65 incher, at home, drink in one hand and in the other, a pause button.

I gave it 2.5 stars for Robert Downeys performance. Which was Oscar worthy.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Movie in IMAX was awesome, however, the theatre should have standard reclining seats. The theatre selected did not have these - the movie is too long to be seated uncomfortably. Other than that - great movie.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Love 70mm imax quality! Sound design/score/camera and light were perfect and not distracting! They helped build the story and the actors were incredible! Really makes one think about the power we hold and how it has been used. 
Cinema is NOT dead!
Ill see it again soon!",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Very good & very close to real story,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","So well done! The science is WAY above my head but the way the movie presents it in a way anyone can relate.

The sex scenes were totally unnecessary",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Long movie, 3 hours, but kept my attention the entire movie.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",All three of us had trouble hearing much of the dialogue. The sound was horrible.,NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","I liked the drama and the vivid display of Oppenheimer's intellect. However, the scenes with gratuitous sex in them were totally unnecessary. The movie would have been great regardless.

I mean consider the movie Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning. There were more nuanced and subtle displays of love and affection without having to resort to gratuitous sex scenes.

I mean any cheaply made X-rated movie can give you that if that's what you're looking for. But perhaps the producers thought that an ""R"" rating would draw a wider audience. And in today's sex-crazed culture, just possibly they're right.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","I very much enjoyed the movie, it went on for a long time and you REALLY have to be on you A game in remembering who is who, what and where. I did enjoy the black and white vs color shots to help you know what point of time you're in.

Lastly would of been awesome if we saw a few more explosions that just the 1.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023","First time at Imax, wow!!!",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","There were many aspects of this story I didn't know so I got a nice history lesson in a good movie. I was disappointed to see that the main actor was Cillian Murphy, who I think is creepy, but as it turned out, he did a good job portraying this character. When I looked up a photo of Oppenheimer, he resembled him very well. Good story, informative, and thought-provoking.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Nude sex scene. Dont believe it was needed for the story about their relationship.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","It was a good story, the acting was fabulous. The movie could have been a little shorter.  Too much detail",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Fantastic depiction of real life events. Acting superb on every level.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",I liked the history in the telling of the story of the making of the A bomb.  Some of Oppenheimer's visions seemed like he might be on a LSD trip.  In the long run it was an entertaining 3 hour movie.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer should dominate the awards next year. Clearly his best picture yet!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Unbelievable, the soundtrack, the visuals, the story, the emotion. 100% Yes!!!! Favorite movie!",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","This is cinema!  

The story, pacing, acting cinematography and directing are all at a premium level. This is the type of drama made to be seen in theaters.  

While my particular experience was sullied by the old, annoying couple, who wouldn't stop using their mobiles and gave their non-stop commentary throughout the entire 3 hour film this is STILL a MUST SEE. Go see it in IMAX as the director intended, and you'll be doing yourself a huge favor.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",This movie is complete and utter genius.,POSITIVE

"Aug 1, 2023","Compelling, interesting, engaging, can't take your eyes off the screen!",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","I would give ZERO stars, really, Boring, dull, slow",NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Masterful performances by some surprising cast members!  Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, and Robert Downey, Jr. are just a few of the best.  This little-know story of J. Robert Oppenheimer's involvement in the development of the atomic bomb illuminates a pivotal moment in world history and the moral dilemma confronted by the people involved.  It could have done a deeper dive into his internal conflict, but maybe the clips that would have done that had to be cut to bring the running time down to ""only"" three hours.  Even at that, it would have been nice to have an intermission for those of us with weak bladders.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","""Oppenheimer"" is a masterpiece. One of the best films I have seen. The acting is superb. The visual effects and editing are magnificent. Even at three hours long, it is riveting throughout. We saw it the the IMAX 2D theater, which I highly recommend due to how it enhances the experience.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Interest story and great acting but way too long for my taste,NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023","Loved it for the story. The cast. The acting. The special effects. The sounds, songs and everything else!

"Aug 1, 2023",Very well made and interesting.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Too much time focusing on appeal and confirmation hearing. Would have liked to see more action on making of the A bomb.,NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Im sure this is a great movie to those who can keep track of the characters- I could not. Theres not much about the bomb in the movie- more about the politics.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Astonishing! An absolute masterpiece of a film.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Boring period piece centered around a a boring physicist with very little action for a Christopher Nolan movie.  Actually, that isn't true, there was ZERO action. 3 hours of Cilian Murphy pretending to be some kind of genius when it was clearly a team effort. What are you people smoking out there with your perfect reviews? I want some.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","This movie delivers. Saw this with 3 other people and all 4 of us loved it. SEE IT IN IMAX! Great cast, moved well for a 3 hour movie so it didn't seem like it. Nothing frivolous to be taken out. Worth it!",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Very long, slow movie with several themes running through it yet all tangled up.  I actually had to Google Oppenheimer after the movie to understand what the issues were.  The acting was great but the story was too tangled up for me.  Too bad they just did not do it in chronological order - it would have been a better movie.",NEUTRAL

"Aug 1, 2023","Movie covers important history that is really interesting!  Unfortunately, the movie making crews did everything possible to distract and prevent audience from following story.  Background music was way too loud and consisted mainly of pounding drums!  Actual music for more tender scenes was still way too loud and overpowered the dialogue between characters.    Movie was way too long!  If you're going to make a movie 3 hours long, then have an intermission!  For people who sat through theater commercials and then loud previews of coming attractions and then the 3-hour movie, it was a tough slog!",NEGATIVE

"Aug 1, 2023",An incredible achievement of the telling of this important American's life.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",I saw Oppenheimer the next day after I saw Barbie. Oppenheimer is a good movie but a 3 hours you can wait to see it on streaming. The movie is basically Christopher Nolan doing a clever play on words with a major Batman Dark Knight reference. All the high caliber actors had played comic book superheroes which elevates the quality of a comic book movie so they can make the money to make riskier art films like this. It's worth watching but in my opinion Barbie is the better movie.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Very intense and long. Sexual scenes were unnecessary and distracting. Way too many cigarettes smoked continuously. No wonder Oppenheimer died of throat cancer!,NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023",The soundtrack kept the movie intriguing through the whole movie and Acting from the cast members was brilliant.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","As usual for any movie made in the last 10+ years, it was too long. A case of lousy editing and minimal control over production.  However, it was a good presentation of the times--- the creation of the Manhattan Project, McCarthyism's influence, the social and moral culture.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023",Enjoyed the historical account but storyline was a bit confusing at times.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023","Authentic in storyline but a little too
Long",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","The acting was great, but the story was disappointing. The first two hours covered nothing. We didn't learn anything about how they invented and created the bomb. The 3rd hour was good with the story of the politics and the hearings. Nothing has changed our government is just as corrupt as it was back then. I would suggest wait until it is streaming and watch it at home. At least you can take a stretch break.",NEGATIVE

"Aug 1, 2023","Very good movie. A bit long, but enjoyed the story.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","The movie was well made and thoughtful.  However, I saw a documentary on Oppenheimer a few days before seeing the movie.  There was nothing new covered in the movie that wasnt in the documentary.  There were a couple of graphic scenes I didnt expect, or want to see.  I understand the directors intent, but the movie would have been more enjoyable without them for me.  I also found the movie too long.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023",Excellent presentation and wonderful direction and cast. Run time too long.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023",It really didnt need the sex scenes.  Im not a prude‚Äîbut they just didnt add to the movie.  I did think the scene where Oppenheimer is being questioned and appears briefly in the nude revealed how exposed he felt at the time.  The emotional dance between Oppenheimer and Strauss was  interesting‚Äîshowed the complexity of both men.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023","Christopher Nolans magnificent film, Oppenheimer, has brought the power of technology, and the ethical issues that come with it, into the spotlight at an appropriate time, as uncertainty and fear of the new power of artificial intelligence rises.
Both as a powerful and balanced commentary and as a work of art this movie is superb. Brilliant script - very witty and insightful, amazing caste, gorgeous cinematography. I went to see it twice last week, and enjoyed the second time even more - in iMAX and 70 mm.",POSITIVE

"Aug 1, 2023","It's truly a flawed MASTERPIECE -- brilliantly acted, directed and written. HOWEVER.... the sound mixing SUCKED! Why did Nolan feel the music was more important than the dialogue in about 3 scenes???  Casual conversations imparting important information DID NOT NEED ANY MUSIC AT ALL!   I have seen a couple of reviews online complaining about this, and lo and behold, 3 friends had the same complaint!  I would love to see more honest reviews by pros and just folks about this.  I'd love to have given Oppenheimer all 5 stars but it ain't gonna happen.",NEUTRAL

"Aug 1, 2023","Wonderful performances by Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr., Matt Damon and Emily Blunt. Tom Conti was so good as Einstein I didn't recognize him. The rest of the cast were excellent as well. The story switched back and forth in time but not so much as to lose the continuity of the story. The movie was about 3 hours but kept my attention so well I didn't notice the time. I found the sex and nudity scenes a bit much but maybe that's just me.",POSITIVE

"Aug 1, 2023","The movie was faithful to the book.  The cinematography to fantastic.  I saw the iMax version, but I imagine the other version compare favorably.  I love how Christopher Nolan combines the visual and sound effects so that they really impact you.  I have never seen a movie version of a large explosion that matched the real event so well.  Kudos to everyone involved in making this film.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","The acting was magnificent, I believe the storyline and the characters paid great homage to the historic accuracy of what transpired, and allowed more to see the tribulations Oppenheimer went through on the political stage.  The movie was far too long and the audio effects were extremely frustrating and often downright obnoxious.  Over all, a good movie, but really because of the acting and storyline.  As far as SFX and audio, just because you can doesn't mean you should.  The movie would have been much better without that.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Shooting for a magnum opus, more of a magnum its-okay-us. Performances were good but seemed more like a series of vignettes than a cohesive plot. On the plus side, it did not feel like a three hour movie at all. It really kept me interested.  And the scenes with Florence Pugh were worth the ticket price alone for me.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Great writing, acting, directing & cinematography!",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","I thought the actors all did a good job. The writing was good, except for the poison apple scene, which seemed a little far out.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Text: Matt Damon as a fatter version of himself, playing a general with jokes. Totally unconvincing. Just doesn&39t have the gravitas to play a military general. Miscasting.

No sympathetic characters in the entire movie. No one that&39s really likable. Except for Albert Einstein, who has may be a total of five minutes of screen time. All the other characters are dull, one dimensional, greedy, self interested, authoritarian. Such a bleak view of humanity.

The Oppenheimer scenes of madness borrowed way too much from A Beautiful Mind, which is a much better movie than this is.

The worst part - what was the whole point of this movie? Three hours of dogmatic, professorial, authoritarian white people topping each other with their arguments and their insights. Who cares? Hat the movie was about Oppenheimer losing his security clearance and what a pivotal moment in history that is. Again, who cares? It&39s simply doesn&39t matter and it certainly doesn&39t justify three hour movie.

Also, what is the point of all of that grating, heightened music and sound effect? Every moment isn&39t climactic. Yet the music would have you believe something as simple as Oppenheimer putting on a hat and picking up his smoking pipe is something to key in on. Who cares?

I learned a few things. I can&39t trust IMDb ratings. This was not an 8.8 movie. This is may be a 4.5 at best. There just wasn&39t any point to this movie. There was no substance, and the style was mediocre at best.

The other thing that I learned- Christopher Nolan ain&39t got it anymore. Momento was very good. The Batman trilogy, especially part one and two, was excellent. Inception was top notch. But that was over 10 years ago. I haven&39t seen interstellar, but it might be the last good movie he&39s made. His use of the beehive Sound effect at the beginning of the dark night was superb. But it&39s been copied and overdone by just about every action thriller out there. And he&39s overdone it himself and all of his movies sense. I just hate that he needed to use it every other minute during Oppenheimer. What a piece of garbage. What a waste of time. Could&39ve spent at three hours re-watching a classic like Das boot or the seven samurai. But it is very hot right now, and I did get three hours plus of air conditioning at the theater. I guess that&39s something.
Summary: Paying for three hours of air conditioning in a theater",NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Script was clunky in some sections. Too much explaining in dialogue-- not enough explaining through action on screen. Some painful little vignettes between Oppenheimer and renowned physicists. Audio mix was muddy in parts. TOO F'ING LOUD OVERALL. Had a blinding headache afterwards. Absolutely hated the atmospheric drone underneath almost all the dialogue. Having said all that, some good performances here and the world created by the filmmakers was solid.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023",The actors and acting were superb. I lived at the time of the events and remember them well.,POSITIVE

The actins was great and the scenes were luscious and spectacular",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Outstanding! We were entertained from the beginning to the end and its 3 hours long. A must-see for sure!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",It was very interesting and opened my eyes to what happened behind the development of the atom bomb.  Some of our government tactics during that and probably still going on are dreadful.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Absolutely spectacular return to a true blockbuster movie, knowing the ending notwithstanding.  Every aspect was sublime, from the musical score to the cinematography (IMAX is a MUST!!!), through acting (RDJ, Damon, and all) to set design, special effects (NO CGI), and the best was by far the story.  Disclosure I wrote my college thesis on Truman's decision and its lasting effects, so I am biased.  My 23-year-old son loved it also and giggled at my emotional reaction to this masterpiece‚Äîvery spot on historically, with only subtle cinematic license issues, in my humble opinion.",POSITIVE

"Aug 1, 2023","Loved!!!!! It is a long movie, but it flies by its such a good movie.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Very long, very slow. Too much about Oppenheimer and not enough about the task at hand, the mission or the broader picture. Way too much narrative at the expense of intense drama surrounding the project. It was just long, boring and not worth 3 hours of life. The entire first hour could be cut without harming the movie. Acting was slow and never pulled me into any of the characters, even Oppenheimer. I was expecting much more drama and action around a huge global event. 

Theres a Prime series on stream now call Manhattan that does a much better job of telling this story, is riveting, and easier to stay awake.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","An otherwise great movie practically ruined by the overbearing and extremely LOUD background music and effects!  I had to plug my ears several times.  Some of it drowned out the dialog for effect but I did not enjoy it. 
 They bounced back and forth in time with so many names and faces I will need to watch it twice more to actually learn who did what. But never again in a theater where I can't control the volume!",NEUTRAL

"Aug 1, 2023","Awesome movie, I cant wait to rewatch.  I will say it was very LONG.  So much dialogue in the interrogation process, names and events to follow.  The flashbacks also make it difficult to follow. Definitely need a rewatch to pick up on some things.",POSITIVE

"Aug 1, 2023",Movie was phenomenal!!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Great movie everyone should see it,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","The movie (saw it in IMAX) continued Nolan's visual style and finding ways to express abstract concepts -- what more abstract than quantum mechanics -- while capturing top-notch portrayals of historic figures. By following the events after the war, it gave perspective and depth to a person that many folks have only seen previously as a caricature in a wide-brimmed hat. However from a spectacle standpoint, it didn't go as fas as I'd hoped in depicting the energies and force of nuclear explosions. Also, they did not depict the characteristic ""double-flash"" of actual nuclear fission bombs. So the IMAX-ness was sort of wasted here.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","This second part of Barbenheimer is definitely more difficult to watch than the first one, both for the serious subject matter and the way the story is presented: in typical Christopher Nolan fashion jumping back and forth in time, supported by the mixed use of color and b/w footage. That being said, the three hours go by quickly, due to supreme film making and acting by the great cast. Cillian Murphy convinces in his first lead role, Florence Pugh is probably largely responsible for the film's R-rating, and an almost unrecognizable Robert Downey Jr is cast as antagonist for a change. Btw, to me the relationship between Oppenheimer and Strauss (aka Murphy and Downey Jr) looks a lot like the one between Mozart and Salieri in 1984's Amadeus. A final word: this movie is clearly aimed at adults, so take your kids to watch Barbie instead.
If you are more interested in the subject matter now: There are numerous worthwhile museums and related sites in the southwest, namely Trinity Site near Los Lunas, the National Museum of Nuclear Science & History in ABQ, and the Atomic Museum in Las Vegas, NV. There is also the Manhattan TV series, which is loosely based on the events at Los Alamos.
A few days later:
Quick re-watch for the recommended 35mm-film-feel, but, honestly, give me high quality digital any time. 
It was nevertheless worth it, since certain elements at the beginning of the film made more sense this time around, knowing the film's ultimate destination. I also paid more attention to the visual effects, since there currently is a big discussion going on about if Christopher Nolan really didn't use any CGI. To me, the effects look great, yet classic (remember Barbarella's psychedelic shots?) so I believe his claims that he limited himself to 'regular' special effects. No CGI does not mean no visual effects, after all, and VFX is not the same as CGI. Anyway, still a great film for adults.",POSITIVE

"Aug 1, 2023",I thought this movie was terrible for an average person who isn't familiar with the history of what happened and who all the characters were.

It wandered through (but did not nail) the political background, Dr Oppenheimer personal weaknesses, the science and  collaboration, a moral dillema, real consequences, the US gvmt disdain for all humanity, women's influence on Dr. Opp., etc.  
Was the depiction of him being a 'tormented scientist' looking for fame accurate? Also, was expecting impressive visuals associated with the historic detonation, but none.

"Aug 1, 2023","Oppenheimer is a movie deserving of its hype. It is one of those rare movies that deserve the cinematic scale and sound of a theatrical release. Christopher Nolans direction kept the attention squarely on Cillian Murphys lead character instead of venturing off on one of many other important historical aspects of the Manhattan Project. Because of this, some very significant scientific leaders, such as Vannevar Bush, are barely shown or mentioned in the film while others such as Matt Damons General Leslie Groves were given the typical military caricature treatment despite the generals record and reputation as a man who could always be counted on the complete construction on time ‚Äî and time was definitely the hidden antagonist, putting pressure on every key decision. 

This singular focus on Oppenheimer is actually quite helpful in the pace of the movie and reveals more about the man that, unless one had read the book American Prometheus, few of us would know. Nolan builds ands and builds until the power of the project becomes greater than all of the brilliant cast, including Oppenheimer. Its a weighty moment worth the wait. Robert Downey, Jr and Emily Blunt were outstanding and Florence Pugh deserved more non-nude attention. Some of the best characters came to life from actors I had not previously seen. Cillian Murphy was as good as any Daniel Day-Lewis performance. Was the movie too long? No! Next up, a trip to see it in 70mm IMAX.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",I love Oppenheimer because the movie's history and details are clear and to the point. It is highly key as to why we need to continue to educate ourselves and our children on American history and the history of the world.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","this movie rode on the Barbie marketing coattails. no reason to watch this movie on IMAX because 98% of this movie is close ups and dialogue. 3 hours of it. 

superb acting. I didn't even realize Gary Oldman was in this movie until afterwards. he's so good. Cillian was really good too.

"Aug 1, 2023","Oppenheimer is a masterpiece. It is a dialogue heavy, fast moving, historical drama that is a case study on a man who is a very complex person with a lot of inner demons. He is a flawed person, who was blessed with a brilliant mind which created a weapon of mass destruction. Oppenheimer is portrayed fantastically by the Amazon Cillian Murphy. It is an Oscar worthy performance from Cillian and the supporting cast is just as good. Emily Blunt is fantastic, Matt Damon is fantastic, and RDJ steals the show when he appears on screen as Lewis Strauss. This is a movie everyone should experience in theaters. I would highly recommend it for all adults.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Excellent film with wonderful acting, sets and costuming...However, I did not see any advantage in seeing it in IMAX over a traditional screen.

"Aug 1, 2023","Based strictly on the acting, screenplay and cinematography, Oppenheimer would have easily been a 5-star movie for me.  But, the Director made a very poor choice when he did not believe that his actors and his recreation of this important event in history was dramatic enough to carry the movie. He choose to have music playing more than 80% of the time that the actors were speaking. He thought it created more drama, when it actually was just repetitious and boring.  This one decision made it an annoying movie that I will see again nor recommend. So sad because it was that close to being 5-Stars.",NEUTRAL

"Aug 1, 2023","The movie flows well as a credible biography of an interesting man and moment in history, as well as the people with whom Robert Oppenheimer interacted.

"Aug 1, 2023","I loved it, really suspenseful and I felt really bad for Oppenheimer because he had a conscience and realized what he created  for the US  government to ensure our safety.. and then we punish him for demanding to have rules in place for this bomb. He was a good man- even though he created a bomb- which if he didnt do it first, whoever got it done first would have used it against us. Beautifully done movie. The costumes, that Cillian Murphy guy that played Oppenheimer was amazing- I will look for him in future movies. Left the theater blown away by the film",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Nolan needed to let this story be more linear and cut some parts from the movie, it could have been 30 min shorter and been fine and made sense",NEUTRAL

"Aug 1, 2023",confusing and way too long,NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023",Liked the movie but not the experience.  Movie started almost 45 minutes late and the theatre was not senior citizen friendly - narrow steps and no rails.  Almost tripped going down.  Thank goodness there was young lady who helped me.  My husband struggled too.  Will definitely not be there agai.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023","Well acted lots of artsie bits with visuals and sound. 
3 hours went by fast!",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",It was educational and I learned a lot by seeing the movie --- but it was extremely long movie. The last full hour should have been only 30 minutes to form the conclusion.,POSITIVE

"Aug 1, 2023",Yes its a 3 hour movie but it doesnt feel that long. Great movie!,POSITIVE

"Aug 1, 2023","A monumental achievement in directing - Nolan's best!  Murphy & Robert Downey Jr. are unbelievably spectacular.  This should not only win Best Picture, Director, Actor & Supporting Actor, but also Visual Effects, Editing and Sound.  Brilliant filmmaking.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Loved the movie but the IMAX experience was not so great. Part of that was due to having to sit close to the screen but as I used to tell my overly dramatic grandchild when she started screaming and crying, "" You are so loud I can't hear you.""",POSITIVE

"Aug 1, 2023","Excellent acting, directing, script, cinematography. A masterful film",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","LOVED Oppenheimer. The exciting story, the acting, the visuals. Some history new to me. All wonderful.
But the sound in the IMAX theater on West 34th St was very loud. Very, VERY loud.
Painfully, distractingly, dangerously, abusively, aesthetic distance-breakingly LOUD.

LOUD. LOUD. ((( LOUD ))). I had paper napkins stuffed in my ears and still had to cover my ears frequently. Sound that loud can damage hearing. 
We will NEVER see a movie in IMAX again. I am highly unlikely to go back to that theater multiplex again, either.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Way to long to keep my interest.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023","The performances were excellent. I do not think it was necessary for the camera to linger on Florence Pugh's bare breasts in two scenes, however. It was gratuitous and did not do anything to advance the narrative.",POSITIVE

"Aug 1, 2023","Maybe the best movie I have watched in my 76 years on this earth.  A marvelously told historical story of profound importance.
The actors (except Harry Truman's character)  were all very believable and relatable.  Mr. Murphy finally landed a role that did justice to his huge talents.
The cinematography and special effects were both wonderful.  I will probably buy this movie on CD when available & I have only purchased two other movies in my life.  WONDERFUL MOVIE!",POSITIVE

"Aug 1, 2023","This is an important and fascinating true story, although not done in the form of a documentary. Great acting. . . the editing was confusing, and some important questions were raised but not answered.  What are the consequences of a world-changing scientific breakthrough, like the one that enabled the atom bomb. . . and how can we prevent it from being misused.  Very relevant to our world today.

"Aug 1, 2023",Well written and compelling screen play.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Much too long.  With 25 minutes of previews before the film we sat for 3 and a half hours.  Why not an intermission?  I was disappointed that the movie focused on Oppenheimer's postwar fall from power, a them interwoven through the entire movie, than on the development of the bomb itself, which only served as a backdrop to the movie.  Also, the nudity was gratuitous, totally unnecessary to the plot.  Robert Downey should win an Oscar for his performance.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023",Thought movie was great with so much history involved. Acting was excellent!,POSITIVE

"Aug 1, 2023","The movie was too long.  The sex scenes were gratuitous and not needed.  The role of Robert Downing was overplayed and historically inaccurate.  Also, while Oppenheimer's conflicted feelings about the atomic bomb is well documented, I seriously doubt if he was having mixed feelings when he spoke to his team after the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima.",NEUTRAL

"Aug 1, 2023","Very intellectual, fast moving movie. Very good actors, excellent performance.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Oppenheimer is definitely not a movie for everyone. It's bio pic drama based on the life of Oppenheimer and more than just a film about the atomic bomb. The sounds design, cinematography, and actings are all on point! One of the best blockbuster in 2023.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","it was superbly cast and a little long. IMAX was too loud and ui do not recommend that theater to anyone over 30!
the story was grippimg and unsettling for someone who remembers the MCCARTHY ERA.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",One of the top three movies I have seen. Not a weak character and great actors playing them. This is a 'must see' for baby boomers and should be required in our school systems. This is what life is really about.,POSITIVE

"Aug 1, 2023",Awesome movie! My self and my two sons thoroughly enjoyed it!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","A truly moving and breathtaking experience by the genius Nolan. With accurate and subtle storytelling and beautiful visuals and an epic soundtrack, seeing this in theaters is an ethereal experience. Nolan masterfully crafts details in the characters' narrative, a true master of showing not telling as he uses cinematography and camera work to showcase different aspects of the characters. Underneath it all, he also explores deep questions about what it means to be human in this universe. And is humanity worth working for and helping? Weve proven were just self destructive and egotistical. Another aspect that the movie talked about was how the politicians manipulated the public and Oppenheimer himself. What makes our life worth living in a dark world and what can we do about it? Also the physics montages and explanations were so so good and inspiring as heck. MUST SEE",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Great performances and history lesson. A bit overlong though.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","I think that reading 'American Prometheus' before seeing this film ruined it for me.  Slow, plodding screenplay, but the actors were top notch.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023",Movie itself was great. But the theater we watched in had sound turned up too loud. Painfully loud at moments. Possibly the movie distribution company requested such loud sound settings. Either way subtracting a star for that.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",It's close to the truth of the real Oppenheimer story.  Highly recommend.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",This was an intense character study done without CGI. and brought us back to the reality of life during World War II,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","This movie is truly a master class in film making. Christopher Nolans writing and directing is spot on. The way he weaves a story forward and backward is brilliant.

"Aug 1, 2023","The movie was racist made by a British director with the Animus against Indians. The movie seems like Oppenheimer theorized black holes, whereas in reality black holes or first terrorists by chandrashakar and Indian scientist. The movie also quotes from the Hindu holy scripture in hey sex scene, which is not how and when Oppenheimer actually said the line.

Moreover, most of the movie takes place in a conference room and is not worth filming an IMAX or 70 mm. The story is largely about Oppenheimer's political trials as opposed to the making of the bomb which was a big letdown.",NEGATIVE

"Aug 1, 2023","Well made, and the sound editing was incredible. The nudity/sex scenes were unnecessary.

"Aug 1, 2023","I agree with others - it was a very long movie. The story is good, the movie is good, it's just long. I could suggest a few scenes / miniature side storylines to cut out. Very surprised to find out who played Lewis Strauss - totally didn't recognize him until someone pointed it out afterwards!",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023","I'm not quite sure how to rate this. I did go see it in the 11-mile-long 70mm IMAX at the Chinese Theater, so it's hard to beat a better viewing.

Im not a big fan of Nolans general outlook, as I don't think he really provides insight or takes us anywhere useful on the human condition. It's not that he is dark, it's that he is pessimistic and offers no solution. I don't think he knows how to show human joy or warmth, or real love - Memento with the elderly couple and the insulin shots might be his best and only real example.

What I do respect about Oppenheimer is that it is an original blockbuster film, all practical effects, gets people excited and to the theater to see a movie about history, gets people to watch an intellectually dense film about physicists talking about politics and science, and leaves people sad - that's quite a feat in 2023.

I did leave thinking about the movie and reflecting about growing up tangentally around physicists (my best friends dad and his friends), excited about solving problems on how the universe works, and then how the insane system we live in manipulates that. I just wish Nolan was capable of tapping into something that leads people to think about potential positive change rather than dwelling and sulking in a grand way. I'm left wondering, why put all this energy, skill, and effort of you aren't doing more to fit into and guide the cultural zeitgeist? If he could do that, the he truly would be epic.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Would definitely watch again,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Was a powerful film but too loud.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Fantastic movie all around. The cast is incredible with every pivotal character being played by a well known actor. I didn't want the move to end. I plan on seeing it one more time while it's still in the theaters. (Do yourself a favor and see it on IMAX or JBX.),POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",just not up to the hype for me!,NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Riveting race for science and humanity that turns into thriller,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","""Oppenheimer"" portrayed Robert Oppenheimer's STRENGTHS ( e.g., a brilliant mind, a compassion for the victims of the Atomic bomb, a dedication to the United States, an encompassing optimism about the Manhattan Project) and his SHORTCOMINGS( e.g. his inability to steer away from temptations, his workaholism, his primary focus on theory).  

It is a movie that I want to see again since there are  many facets of the film that are still unclear to me.",POSITIVE

"Aug 1, 2023","Oppenheimer‚ÄîA COUNTERPOINT: Saw this Christopher Nolan opus a week after everyone else (though theaters are still selling out). Yes, it was epic, but it would have been so much more engaging if someone else took over the editing and scoring. 

ISSUES:
1. For much of the film, an overly melodramatic soundtrack drones on, to excess, like an opera. It often detracts from the scenes and can drown out dialogue (the drowning-out may have been because of where we sat‚Äîmaybe we were too close to the surround sound speakers‚ÄîI dunno). 
2. Often, editing/pacing felt off.
3. WAY too much dialogue. The visuals should have told more of the story. 
4. Too many characters‚Äîhard to keep track. 

There are some riveting scenes. Example: Oppenheimer meets  President Truman in the Oval Office (another masterful cameo from human chameleon Gary Oldman). No music just good timing, pacing, camera work, and editing. The testing of the bomb is also a showstopper. 

It's still worth a look. Many great performances! For-sure Oscar noms for Robert Downey Jr. and Emily Blunt. But too many gimmicks over substance. I'm wondering what someone like Mike Nichols could have done with all this footage.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023",2nd time I watched it but this time I decided to watch it in a standard movie theater. Definitely see the difference in sound and image. Going to watch it this weekend again but in IMAX,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",This is an excellent movie.  Very riveting.  The whole three hours went by very fast.  Will get Academy Awards nominations.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Great movie for the first 2 hours, full of fascinating history and science, held my interest.  Last hour was 100% politics, I got a little bored with it.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Movie story was excellent, actors for the most part outstanding in their parts however, the music constantly playing drown out the speaking line so unable to hear a lot of the time.  Also, the sex scenes were over played and his Communist involvement with this character underplayed as this womanizing and his wife being a dues paying Commie seemed to be his downfall . Interesting how the Government took over instantly when the bomb finally worked and he was no longer needed & he realized he wasn't the ""big cheese"" any longer.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023","Acting was great, but could have focused more on  the need for the weapon and what the world was going through at the time.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023","Homerun. Acting, dialogue, everything!",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",To long and boring. Movie felt rushed,NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Oppenheimer is a good representation of Robert Oppenheimer's character, personality, and motivation. Such an important aspect of WWII. His was a service not only to the Allies but the world as well...An important history lesson!",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",It wasn't bad. A little too long. Great acting.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023",Great storyline and incredible performances,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","More than a spectacle film, though it does have those elements, its more about the thoughts of the man. A really great view into the struggle of a man that must come to grips with the world ending power of his own creation.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Its worth seeing but its super long and I found it to be somewhat confusing unless you know your history. Jumped around a lot. I still enjoyed it though.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023",Historically very accurate. The visual aesthetics were on point. The acting is phenomenal. Definitely an Oscar contender in several categories.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Did not take my eyes off the screen once during the three hours. Christopher Nolan & cast beautifully told this story. 70mm is a must for this film!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Start to finish an outstanding cast and acting with a screenplay that finally tells the story of what a great patriot Oppenheimer was to the world!!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","This movie was boring to watch for most of the runtime.  Maybe if I knew the historical story behind Oppenheimer, then it would be more interesting to me. But after they tested the bomb, the movie went into politics and such which just made it undesirable to watch for another hour. The movie seemed to be overhyped for a documentary. PS. do not get a seat at an end of a row for an IMax movie.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",excellent movie acting was spot on,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","An uninteresting story, poorly told. But at least its in IMAX!",NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Great film and highly recommend,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Liked the plot and cinematography. Was a little hard to hear and understand dialogue. A little muffled. Good acting and filming.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Narrative was riveting. Performances were superb. Visually stunning. Christopher Nolan is a fabulous director. His movies are always interesting.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Pro: Excellent history lesson.
Con: Much of the dialog is softly spoken, was drowned out by low-frequency background music. Was often not understandable.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Great movie with lots of history.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",This astonishing movie gripped me from the first moment to the last.  A visually stunning experience combined with wonderful acting made this a topnotch movie experience.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Another work of Papa Nolan. Once in a while, there are some comfortable movies. Having said that, Nolan has captured the details of the era before, during and after World War II very well. The movie is fun where the events of the past and the present are interchanged elevate tension from gentle to strong pounding. It's a pity that I don't have the luck to go see IMAX, it will get more emotion.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Entertaining way to learn history. A little long, but it kept my attention.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","I rarely gush about a film, but what an incredible piece of art. The craft behind this film is breathtaking. Then there is the cast. It has been some time since a film's ensemble of actors has been this good.  Every one of them at the top of their game. See it.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Engrossing, multi-layered story of a complicated genius who evolved over time.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Master piece, how to take drama to a whole new level with character interactions, and the final scene is perfect.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","I loved the in depth story, but I thought it was a little long.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Amazing movie. Perfectly written, fantastic visuals and great score. Loved it",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Fantastic acting, great cinematography",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Kept my attention. 3 hours went by in a flash. Great plot and great acting.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Overly dramatic. Trying to hard. Long and tedious. Trying to convert a villain into a anti-hero. All this handwringing about his humanity - not his ego and selfishness.,NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Superb acting.
Enjoying learning the history behind the bomb.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Outstanding performances and portrayal of the life of Dr. Oppenheimer.  Regret it was R because younger teens could learn some of the historical events.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Great movie - Irvine IMAX was awful. Over 90 degrees in the theater.last hour almost unbearable. Wont be back.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023","An absolutely sobering reflection of the world at war, with perhaps even further implications today. Cillian Murphy is brilliant in his role.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Outstanding acting and screenplay.  Story remained consistent with his life events as I understand them to be. Beautiful cinematography.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Entertaining and engaging. A bit too loud in iMax.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023","First act was hard to follow, third act felt unrelated to the rest of the film",NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Excellent performances by each actor, story one to be understood.  Painful in many ways, changed the world, you judge for better or worse.  Oppenheimer a confused character,",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",The acting is on point for all the A-List stars.  I had no idea about his story until this movie came out.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. The acting was excellent and the story entertaining. Patience is required to follow the changes in the timeline but I felt it was well worth it. (The nudity was unnecessary in my opinion.),POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Good film, a very montage approach to the first 2/3 of the film, then it takes on an Oliver Stone aesthetic in the final act. The IMAX music overpowered the film, I'll enjoy it more at home, making the connections to TENET and Interstellar. A-",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","This 3-hour movie devoid of fast paced action flew by.  The dialog, casting, acting, directing, editing, and virtually ever other aspect of this film were superb.  Best movie I've seen this year.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Three hours was a bit long without an intermission. Otherwise, a must see.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Very interesting, good acting and storyline however, it was too long. Story could have been told in less time.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Its a masterpiece in every way! Christopher Nolan is a brilliant filmmaker.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","I liked the movie overall in its portrayal of the theme, but some of the people portrayed were weak.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Amazing experience start to finish. The cast and the music were genius,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Amazing movie.  The acting, story, cinematography - all top notch.  See it on IMAX.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Everything about this movie is beautiful!  The actors performances were stellar!  Its been a long time since a movie made such an impact that we were still talking about it.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Loved the movie. Sound was not stellar!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",I thought the film aligns with the all of the elements that make for great cinema. I think the length of the film was bit extensive.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Overall disappointed. The editing made the film hard to follow‚Äîtoo much jumping around. And I think that Robert Downing Jr.s character, though well acted, was given too much screen time.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023",Riveting! Had no idea the 3 hours could go so quickly!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Well written and incredible portrayal of a very important piece of American history. The acting was excellent by, not jus the key players, but supporting cast. I recommend this movie to everyone.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Too long and not what I expected,NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023",Interesting and disturbing. Very long movie. Extremely well acted and directed. Would recommend,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",An absolute Masterpiece a film that will be remembered and shared for generations,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Amazing movie the only negative is I think they could have easily told the story in less than 3 hours. Nolan did a great job of keeping a good pace so it didnt feel as long as it actually is but still a very long movie that didnt need to be 3 hours. Like every 3 hour movie.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",I didn't particularly like the many flashbacks of his life.  It sometimes was confusing.  But otherwise the movie was terrific with wonderful acting from all the characters in the movie!  Definitely an Oscar contender.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Well done and historically relevant.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Loved it, excellent acting",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Very well done and interesting especially for the older crowd.  Young audiences may find it a little boring.  Those of us who lived through that time can appreciate the history, detail, and insight into the personalities. Last part of the film, events that took place after Sept of 1945 explore how O was treated badly and take-away is that not much has changed regarding political bias and corruption. The moral dilemma could have been explored more but a 3 hour movie was enough. (And I ran out of popcorn.)",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Excellent casting, performances, sound and score, imagery both fantastic and gritty. Emotional and brainy.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Creat acting
Very informative 
Entertaining",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",It was redundant and boring. I did not enjoy it at all.,NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Terrific acting.  The movie was historically honest.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Excellent story and very entertaining even with its length. Great acting and very visually appealing and creative. A little hard to follow some of the characters motives / allegiances. The moral dilemma and feeling responsible for the development of such a weapon is mind boggling.well presented.  As a history buff, I really enjoyed this one.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","The plot is super tight and it's played out by some big-name actors who totally knock it out of the park. It'll get you thinking about war, especially the scary nuclear kind, and it really shows how human quirks can affect work affair.

The music is pretty awesome, but man, at certain spots, it cranks up so much that you're left struggling to catch what the actors are saying. A bit of a downer when you're engrossed in the plot.  The movie's a gem that'll get you thinking and feeling in all the right ways.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","I loved the accuracy of the story, as I understand it, though it was a dark time in our history that made me sad and reflective.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Great performances and a powerful telling of the tremendous scientific development that inspired an equally tremendous conflict between discovery and implementation.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","The movie is very long...3 hours. The script is very wordy...The genius's speak, and you have to listen closely to keep up. The Academy will LOVE this movie, and it will be nominated for many Oscars for it's history and true story factor. Not for everyone...it has no action, is steady and a chronicle of the facts.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Very interesting piece of history that I was unaware of.  I felt the nudity/sex scenes were not necessary.  The dialogue could have been done in a different (clothed) setting.  Took away from the film, in my opinion.  Other than those scenes, the movie was very good.  Fabulous acting by Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. !!",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Liked the story and the photography as well as the acting. Disliked the length of the film as I saw several dialogue scenes that did not add to the storyline and could have been cut.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Great film but unnecessarily LOUD!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Good movie, the beginning was a little hard to follow because it goes back and forth between different time periods. If you dont know anything about history, I recommend watching or reading a short bio about Oppenheimer before watching (which is what I did)",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Good movie! Great acting. Worth seeing.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","I would have rated it 4.5 stars if possible. The thing that I think the filmmakers did to the detriment of the film was they were too kind to Oppenheimer himself. I felt like they reached to create too much empathy for a very flawed person who made (or had a huge hand in) a lot of his problems and who, lets face it, unleashed hell on Earth with his creation.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",The dialogue was 80% exposition.  It felt like I was watching a 3 hour trailer.,NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Great movie but a bit long. A few scene could have been left on the cutting room floor and a few others could have been shortened. Having said that, I would go see it again.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Well done. A good history lesson, a number of top movie stars, the movie's pace is very good",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",It was interesting but it was too long.  The administrative hearing scenes could have been cut or minimized.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023",Fairly usual superficial Hollywood treatment reviewed as if it's profound. Tells Oppenheimer's story during which we are subjected to his makes girlfriend and his fleeting thoughts about the morality of building a nuclear bomb. Nothing new here.,NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Very compelling, but the nudity was not really necessary.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","I enjoyed the duel story telling of the movie. However it could have been done with at least 45mins cut out so we could het to the point quicker. Acting was great, just too long.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023","Start to finish, a masterpiece.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Excellent story and acting. Academy award contender!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",The music was very distracting and run time was long and tedious.,NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",IMAX experience and the intensity with moral dilemma.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Really enjoyed the movie. Nolan took a book that was a biography, and made it into an experience. Amazing!",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Need subtitles.   To long,NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Everything about this movie is fantastic,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Good movie.  Lots of details I did not know.  The sex scenes are just not needed.  I think it took away from the picture.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Captured the time critical nature of the pursuit and the associated horror of the achievement. My sincere appreciation to the director and writers who avoided the need to overwhelm us with the carnage.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Background music was way, way too loud.  It was difficult following what the actors were saying. Several other folks, who saw the movie said the same thing.  I would like to have seen the movie under normal conditions but would not recommend it because of the loud music.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Great acting.  just 1 hour too long.  The last hour was the best.  Wind up was just too slow for me.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023",Intense story.  Each actor(s) brought to life their particular famous individuals that I only read about in history books. Cilllian Murphy was excellent as Oppenheimer - deserves award recognition. Long but holds your attention,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Best I have seen ages..Sound was a bit sketchy, It, at times, seemed to fade in and out. But do not miss this film. It should sweep oscars.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Overly long, overly dramatic and unnecessary nude scenes but entertaining. Very interesting story and people.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",I thought it was very well made and the actors were fantastic,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Very well done with excellent acting. Long movie on a very difficult time.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Its a paradox, too broad and too shallow at the same time",NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Accurately represents history of one of the most important events of all time. Well acted and directed. Should be the best movie of the year.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",OPPENHEIMER is a great movie,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Give this movie alllllllllll the Oscars this year! It was beautifully done. I took my 13 year old and he loved it.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",The movie wouldve been excellent if it had only been about an hour shorter. The acting was superb.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023","The sound editing was a little hit and miss, the script too fast-paced (no time to take in what had just happened), and the acting around Cillian Murphy was questionable. I couldn't invest in the characters Matt Damon and Robert Downey, Jr (as Stanley Tucci) were playing. Branagh was brilliant (as expected) and Murphy was good as Oppenheimer, but he slipped into Peaky Blinders territory occasionally with his accent, which made me think I was watching 'Tommy Shelby Blows Up the World!' I fear many critics watched this from a viewpoint of it being a Chris Nolan movie about a very important period in America's history. However, films about important moments still should be entertaining. This was too much like a lecture on Oppenheimer and the dangers of nuclear weaponry.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Exceptionally well done, fresh treatment of time frames, great script and acting and cinematography and I-Max sound. Best role ever for Robert Downey Jr.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Great watch and such a great story that's told..,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","I was drawn into this film within minutes. The cinematography is incredible. The story wasn't unnecessarily dramatized. Murphy, Downey, Blunt and Damon were brilliant as were all the supporting cast. It was especially great to see Tom Conti. The story unfolded flawlessly. 2 bombs were dropped, one was the Trinity test the other, Rami Malek dropped in the court room. It was intense.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Truly one of the best movies I have seen in a very very long time. The 3 hour run time might sound intimidating but the movie was so good it really didn't feel that long. 10/10.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Near perfect movie. The cast and score were brilliant. The story was thought provoking and really leaves an impression as you leave the theater.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","A little too long, however Cillian Murphy was AMAZING as always.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Phenomenal movie! Perfect casting and extremely well directed. Kept me engrossed the entire time and never got overly complicated. Cinematography was beautiful as well!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Great cast in a movie less about the beginning of the atomic age and more about the great and flawed personalities of the times.  I did not recognize Robert Downey, Jr until half-way through the movie, he did such a great job as older Lewis Straus.  I would not be surprised to see Downey earn an award for Best Supporting Actor. The story line seemed so real and plausible that I wish I had lived through that time so I could compare the movie to personal experience.  My only complaint was the ending.  Oppenheimer's motives for a passive approach (one could almost say Martyr-like approach) to the security hearing were never fully explained.  And his rehabilitation is glossed over at the very end.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",best movie. glued from start to finish. Typically not my kind of movie but this was fabulous. Well done. Was sad when it was over.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","The movie was fresh- music, dialog, music, costume, framing, setting. Great casting, cutbacks, sound, dialog, made to take in like a blockbuster with every action hitting the right note! Dialog fresh and moving the action forward, great music score, fantastic special effects, exceptional shooting, casting choices, and pace. I was reeled in and had to see it a second time in IMAX theatre to get the impact it was meant to have! Would recommend in several Oscar categories and will be reading the novel it was derived from for original content and more fleshed out details. Absolutely riveting as a film fan and music lover!",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",The movie is great! The pacing of telling this complex character is what made this movie shine. The biggest disappointment to the movie is the non stop music at times its necessary but other scenes the dialogue is hard to hear and downplayed a bit because of it. (should've casted Hans Zimmer) But this movie delivers one of my new favorite classic Nolan endings.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","It was more of a history lesson, could have used a little more excitement for a 3 hour movie.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023",The acting was great and the story was intriguing.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Would have been better on Netflix as series.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023",great historical movie.  Interesting and spell binding.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Engaging, intelligent, terrific acting across the board, tense, well-paced.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",I loved it enough to see it twice,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Movie was long, it was entertaining. A bit of history that we seem to forget about",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Absolute must watch!!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Oppenheimer was about 1.5 hours too long!,NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","What is a good movie with a solid story. At times, it may have felt a bit long, well worth watching.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","The film makes every scene feel as important and intense as the last scene for 3 hours, making it work in amazing ways and Cillian Murphy is phenomenal in the lead.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","It's a well-acted film, with a great cast.  But it doesn't feel the full history of the situation.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023",Absolutely fantastic!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","A good film with a lot of reasons to like it. It was a bit long on the details, which held it back from being a great film. The beginning jumped around more than it needed to and I'm not sure helped the story much. Once it got going, the film displayed Oppenheimer as the complex and interesting person he was. The responsibilities he dealt with are monumental. Imagine a world where we lost the race for the bomb to the Germans  it puts the importance of the Manhattan project into a starkly different reality than many of us consider. 

They could have left out the poison apple for the professor that likely never happened but many will unfortunately remember. Oppenheimer was a lot of things, but nothing I've read suggests any inclinations toward violence.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Movie jumps back and forth alot without always being clear. Sound mix was AWFUL. Had to plug my ears multiple times. If I knew that it was going to be another TENET volume movie, would not have seen it. Heard the book follows a linear progression which should have been fine for all the actors that put in great performances.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Very well written and directed and keeps you engaged the entire movie.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","movie was great, actors and actresses did a fantastic job.  only negative, its loud.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Powerful and moving. Beautifully acted and shot. Left me with a subtle but deep feeling of uneasiness about the future and the world we've created for ourselves, oblivious that we are all now just a few mistakes or misunderstandings away from oblivion (and have been for several decades).",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Oppenheimer is a film that has a stacked cast that never goes to waste. Every performance is a 10/10, Nolan is at his best, and I'd be surprised if the entire production doesn't yield countless awards. Fastest 3 hour movie you'll see.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Some of the dream or flashback scenes were strange and didn't add to the story.  Also the fact that the reason the decision was made to use the bombs to end the war quickly was good to hear, the fact that this movie was neither pro or anti of the use of the weapons.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","I enjoyed it. Idk how truly historically accurate the movie is, but I thought the acting and set were excellent.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","As near a perfect movie as I've seen. A must watch, and it never felt too long.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Great movie with a star studded cast!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Great movie!  Even though its 3 hours long the movie moves along and is very engaging.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","It was an absolutely magnificent movie that is sure to take away multiple Oscars. Everything about it was top notch including the acting, cinematography, music etc. The story was also fascinating. It is an absolute must see!!",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Great cast, gripping story",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","A deep look into a very complex man dealing with very complex times. A race to beat the Nazis in the development of an atomic bomb leaves the US with a working device after Germany surrenders. One third of this movie deals with Oppenheimer's education and professorship at the University of California at Berkeley. One third is devoted to the development of an atomic bomb (actually two kinds of bomb). The last third deals with the aftermath of using the bomb on Japan. No summary can encompass all of the complexity of this movie. Warning: if you really want to understand what's going on, read up before seeing this movie, because Christopher Nolan is not going to spell it out for you.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",This movie is beyond amazing,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","It's not a movie for everyone but it's fantastically thrilling, I didn't even notice the 3 hours",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Amazing!  For a non-action movie, it keeps you in your seat for the whole three hours.   You will not want to get up go visit the concession stand or restroom.  Its that good!",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Superb acting, historical costuming, fantastic movie",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",We both really liked it.  Learned some important info.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Disliked the moments of extreme volume. Literally hurt my ears. But it was a great movie.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Believe it was essentially historically accurate. Liked the tension in the script over the morality of going forward with project.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Amazing movie ! Watched it on 70mm and it made the movie even better,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Good movie, but I can't give a full review due to old people not shutting up during the movie.  Yes, that was an atomic bomb going off, no need to announce it to everyone.  I dealt with that the whole. movie.  Explaining the obvious to themselves.  Please, old people, if you can't hear, go to a showing that has CC available.  If your mind is mush and you don't understand WTF is going on, wait until your home shows the movie.  Seriously, other people do exist in your world, and we aren't NPCs.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Loved the entire experience!  It was slightly difficult to follow the plot in some places where they chronologically jumped, and keep track of each nuance, but thats what made the intellectual stimulation a cut above most movies.  The acting was superb!",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Way way way too long!  Stretched the story out too much.  Too many close ups of Oppenheimers face! 
Not the epic everyone says.  Hollywood loving Hollywood, not theater goers.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","The movie was great, but the theater experience not so much.  The volume was so loud it made it difficult to sit through the movie!!   Unpleasant experience!",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","I thought it was pretty boring and slow and fell asleep.  However, my husband loved it",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023","Star studded cast, score was great, and Cillian Murphy is exceptional as always",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Very long movie, but it was good. Probably a movie I would have waited to see at home. Acoustics were crazy good though!",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023",Watched in in IMAX and the sound was very loud at times.. Even the music seemed to drown out the dialouge in many scenes.. Scenes jumped around the time line too much for me.. Plotlines went unanswered.. Could've been better.,NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Cilia Murphy was a great choice.  Movie kept me on edge of seat even though I knew what happened.  Good historical piece.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Just a couple of spots in the movie where the music/sound effects overwhelmed the dialogue. Also the theatre had the volume up WAY too high. Took away from what would have been a great expeience. Can't wait until it streams so we can turn on CC.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","The movie was great! Everything from the acting, the sound, the music, the cinematography, the directing, the casting and of course the story being told!",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Very good, as good as Begins and Dunkirk, not as good as DK and Interstellar",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Great screen play, great music, great performances 
Interesting details about interesting people in interesting times",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",A little too long still a great film!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Id give 10 stars if I could!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Well scripted and excellent cast special effects were amazing.  Not often a 3 hour movie can keep you this captivated. Came home and researched more on Oppenheimer.  Seems the movie well supported the reality.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",I had problems at first with the movie going back and forth with time. Once I figured out how to tell what time the movie was in really enjoyed the movie.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","I found myself looking at the floor a little too often. Unnecessarily long and the nonstop music was distracting. Could use some editing and focus in the storyline. Otherwise, the talent was good within their respective roles.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023","Brilliantly acted and directed, a long movie but positively worth the concentration needed to understand a bit of the story of one of America's less understood thinkers and activists.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","It was a long, slow movie in uncomfortable chairs. They probably could have shaved about an hour off the screen time.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023",It was great. Mind expanding and it went fast for a longer movie. Star packed!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Excellent acting, story, screenplay, music. Nolan does it again never fails.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",I know it's named Oppenheimer but I was hoping for a little more detail in the science and the Manhattan Project and less of a biopic.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023","The music overwhelming the dialogue was very distracting at times.  I really enjoyed the unfolding of the story of the 1st A Bomb, but the whole congressional inquiry could easily have been skipped (or an entirely different film).",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",It felt like I was watching the directors cut of a film.  It was just too long. Needed a better edit.  I was able to see glimpses of a what couldve been a really good movie but it was dragged down with way to much superfluous bits of story as to make it bland.  Nice job by all actors especially Rob Downey Jr.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023","Spectacular performances and a great script are just part of how good this movie really is.  Completely relevant in todays time of war and an indifference to death.  The movie sheds just a small light on the fact that as human beings, we are responsible for the fate of this world and that even though everyone has personal struggles and flaws, we have to ensure there is a future for those who come after us.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Chris Nolan doesnt know how to make a bad film. Truly excellent work!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","It was well written but long and tedious. Also, the sex scenes were unnecessary apart from creating a dichotomy from Oppenheimer's intellectual capacity and primitive state, it deemed him! There was an eerie silence in the theater during the explosion. The movie failed to capture the tribal positions of the time from communism and democracy, racism in Europe and Asia and how the USA lived out their superiority and racism in Oppenheimer's fear of one country having so much potential power.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",The actors were simply outstanding.  The film was just magnificent and is easily the best movie I have seen in a decade. The movie will win multiple academy awards. It is a must see if you are even remotely interest in this part of our history. The film brings to life a whole different era. Just great work.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",The only decent parts of the movie are the ones shown in the trailers. There is a 2 hour documentary streaming on Peacock right now that is more entertaining and you won‚Äôt have to pay $35 for 2 tickets to the IMAX theater.,NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Great move. Starts off a bit confusing but it all becomes clear,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Wow!! Incredible movie.  Im still reviewing it my mind a week after I saw it.  Thought provoking!  Well done.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",More than a movie. Feels like an event with 70mm IMAX,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Suspend Suspenseful, Dramatic, Great Acting, Thick Plot, Intense, Heartwarming, and Action Packed!!!",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","All men, hard to hear dialogue, too long",NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Oppenhemer is one of those moves that keeps you on the edge of your seat even if you already know the whole story.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",So immersively historical,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Good historical story,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",It was a complex story told in an absolutely riveting style.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",The acting is top notch as well as the music,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Painfully slow moving story and a bit self involved. Most of the story centers around the politics and his own inner demons.,NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Good storyline, flow",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Great movie... awesome acting. Solid accurate story. Long movie time but never a dull moment.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Hi.......I wanted to love this, all the great actor performances and the subject matter(I am a history nerd).  I thought there were so many good parts, but i felt like they put in a blender on puree and the show seemed unnecessarily long.  I feel guilty giving this review because there is so much garbage out there you want to reward this content with 5 stars, but in the end being honest I could not.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Astounding movie.  Script, acting, cinematography, sound, musical scoring all perfect.   Must see in iMax.  70mm might be even better.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","very interesting,  the film was more about Oppenheimer then I expected.  We enjoyed the movie",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023",I liked all the Suspense of the movie and the surround sound.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","I enjoyed learning about the trials. He endured after the bomb was detonated, rather than the focus on the bomb. I had no idea he went through that.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Amazing story telling. Acting was amazing.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",This is an accurate movie about Oppenheimer's evolving views of the atomic bomb and early associations with American communists. The first part of the movie is slow. The sex scenes add no value and are distracting. What's missing is a better telling of his relationship with Teller. Teller had more to do with Oppenheimer's loss of status as the Godfather of atomic research.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023","Great movie and script, the atom bomb going off was a little anti-climatic for me but was still really cool.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Oppenheimers portrayal didnt shy too far from the book. It is a dark film in a lot of respects but shows how far we have come in a nuclear age - unfortunately.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","The movie was everything I expected and more. Great script, great acting across the board. The movie was successful at telling a very complex story and left me wanting to know more. The ending visual of Earth was chilling.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Fantastic Movie held your interest for entire 3 hours Historically accurate,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Good movie very long tho,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",It was a great bio pic on Oppenheimer. If you're expecting a movie about the Manhattan project exclusively this is not it. The movie is about Oppenheimer.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Loved the details in the story,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Loved it.  Even better, the 2nd time i saw it.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","I saw this in 70mm (NOT IMAX) at Regal Kingstowne in Alexandria VA. Liked the movie, but the quality of the picture and sound in that theater was Terrible! There was a constant ""rain"" of colored streaks from the film down the middle of the screen the entire movie. The sound quality was so bad we missed a lot of the dialogue. Read an article saying that this would be a good format, but it would have been better to see in Digital or Dolby. At least at this theater.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Powerful story in American History that wasnt being taught in schools, although the movie seemed somewhat slow with character building and lacked exciting moments, even when the bomb was finally tested and used.  Happy the story was told but could have waited to stream at home.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023",Excellent story telling about what the movement behind the bomb's development was all about.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Nolan got inside Oppenheimers head and showed us what we can only assume was his intense, nonstop reality.  The fast paced dialogue and music kept this 3 hour masterpiece moving along at a decent clip.  Weaving together the historical data and drama makes for a stellar cinematic experience.  Looking forward to many rewatches.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",A little longer than it had to be.     But..wonderfully done.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Kept my interest from beginning to end.  Even though I knew the history, looked forward to seeing how the story would be told.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Great acting, great directing. Great movie.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",excellent.  fast paced.  Characters were outstanding.  One of the best films of the decade.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Great story, easy to follow filming. Theater a bit load volume wise.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Movie was great but volume level in theater was WAY too high.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023","Excellent movie, stunning acting and incredible cast",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Great movie, great acting - maybe a hair too long",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Sound volume so loud in theater would hurt your ears. Content was more about the political stuff than the science part.,NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Amazing movie. Start to finish, the weaving of the 3 acts, giving us the betrayal twist, and the picturesque New Mexico backdrops were phenomenal. And one of the best movies ever, acting performance-wise. Murphy, RDJ, Pugh, Damon, Malek all amazing. A+ film",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Too disjointed and long,NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",I thought this was one of the most riveting films I've seen in a very long time. Cillian Murphy was astonishing. Christopher Nolan's story telling is superior. The camera work. A 3 hour movie and I never looked at my watch. Love it!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Superb acting and direction. Held our rapt attention throughout the 3 hours.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Very hard to understand most of the dialogue. Volume too high.,NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Amazing movie. Only complain would be the dialogue at times was not super clear with the music in the background.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Outstanding. Best film of the year. Fascinating. Full of great facts and depictions.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Excellent movie. Well acted. Lots of details about Oppenheimer's history covered here that don't get mentioned anywhere else. Cinematography was beautiful.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","I recognize the skill and craftsmanship in this movie.  My main complaint is that it's actually too much for me. I wanted a moment to breathe... to get to know the characters. Things happens so fast.  You really need to be dialed in to stay with the film but what it did for me is make me exhausted.  It felt a bit like work and less about entertainment.  The images are amazing.  What I wanted to more of the human element.  For example... people meet... they're in bed.  Project is funded... it's underway.  It spends no time letting you know the people...

It's definitely one of those movies you have to like because of the hype.  At least this film makes sense.... (see Tenet).",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023",Excellent movie however important parts of his life weren't covered and some things were covered too exhaustively.  It was then very long and not complete.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","It was intense and very well done. Cillian Murphy was fantastic. Stellar cast, all performances were top notch!",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Amazing cast and filmed beautifully.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","I liked the actors in the film. I like the historical sense to the movie, and the links between the characters. The cinematography was amazing.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Love the sound & visual effects. The actor who portrayed Oppenheimer looks just like the actual man himself. Great movie and very accurate too.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","I think Oppenheimer is a movie that has a lot of potential but just falls short a lot. The first half of the movie you are introduced to so many characters that you cant keep up. The movie had two scenes that kept me glued to my seat, the bomb going off and the thank you speech!! Other then that it was a lot to sit through for 3 hours!",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023",Best acting and directing since The Godfather,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Way Too Long, My friends and I were ready to walk out after 2 hrs. But good acting, Very poor job of depicting his life and accomplishments with an interesting and engaging script . Look at the MSNBC special on him for a much more entertaining and accurate experience!",NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",This was a great movie. There were three scenes with nudity and pretty visual lovemaking. It is too bad the producers and the director showed this much nudity. You can act love scenes with more discression. This cuts out many youth being able to watch it. Hollywood just can't seem to help themselves with stupid calls.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Loved learning the history. 
Actors were phenomenal",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Mi ie was great , but it stopped midway and we had to leave due to they could not get film to restart.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Very well done. Three hours went fast!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","There was a lot of history and political culture I hadn't known  especially the role socialism and communism played at the time - late 30's early 40's.  The cast of the movie was excellent - you hardly could recognize Robert Downey Jr. at first until you recognized THAT VOICE.  The three hours went by fast - I'm seeing it again next week.  I hadn't known the role Los Alamos played - learning the history was interesting especially because I went there in the 70's to be with a friend who was part of an experimental nuclear treatment for cancer.
I found it all fascinating - and the message of the movie is - we don't know how close we are to self-destruction.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",I expect that it will be taught in movie making schools for generations.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Good acting. I had concern if I could stay awake for the whole 3 hours. Turns out the movie is so intriguing that my eyes are wide open the whole time.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Three hours of just talking scenes. Only 5 minutes of action. The last hour bored me to tears. It is not the movie advertised in the trailer.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023",Liked the story but it dragged on a little bit towards the ending!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Volume too loud.  Sensational scenes not necessary.  Couldnt hear dialogue.  Good acting.  Could have been better.  Dont recommend seeing in the theatre,NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023",Best movie of the year!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Very good cast, plot and historical content.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Fantastic performances and a really compelling story told against the backdrop of one of the defining events of the 20th century. Dialogue-heavy but when the script is this good, that's a benefit!",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","The movie was interesting as far as being authentic. I think it was a bit long,",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Great job of captivating the audience for those 3 hours! Showed us the entire process of Oppenheimer and his team creating the atom bomb as well as the aftermath of what he was dealing with after! Just wish it was a little shorter 3 hours is a long time after all.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",So good - acting was top notch and the movie kept you intrigued the whole time.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",The acting was superb!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Complex, compelling recounting of a pivotal moment in World History.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",It was hard to understand. What I did understand I enjoyed it very much,NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023",I thought this movie was great. Besides having all the great actors in the film it caught my attention. I havent even noticed I was sitting there for 3 hours. What an awesome movie bravo,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Very phenomenal film!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",The acting and cast were incredible!! The movie was great!!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","For the subject matter to be a very secretive, detailed part of history, the movie conveyed the message and emotions in a truly entertaining way. The cast was a huge superlative of the movie, too.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",One of the best movies Ive ever seen!! Probably the best! Loved the actors and I watched the documentary on Oppenheimer. Everyone played the best role at every level. Might be the best of all time!!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",excellent movie experience.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Great movie, very intense and exciting. One of the best movies Ive ever seen.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",It was great but more of a melodrama about government politics.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Great movie. Stellar Cast. I see this winning multiple Oscars. It's a known story, but that doesn't stop the engaging tome that this is. How does a three hour movie sit? Well, my butt wasn't numb, and the last hour is very compelling.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Too long, could have been an hour shorter.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Great acting and cinematography.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",One of the best movies Ive ever seen. Great effect and even better acting.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","It's a really good film, but not awesome. It needed to be a a 2 to 2 and a half hour long film. It loses a lot of its impact by cramming in everything about Oppenheimer's life after the bomb is dropped and not flushing out his relationship with his wife and mistress. One mans opinion. See for yourself.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023",A fascinating look at a complex man.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Quite well done with a focus on the interpersonal struggles.  We will see this one again.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Good movie. Could have used fewer close ups of Cillian Murphys face tho.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","The first ""half"" was just too long, and the entire Florence Pugh (no deference to the actress who was great) subplot was unnecessary. From the point when they successfully tested the bomb right through the end was excellent.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023",Loved the movie. Very historical. I dont mind nude scenes but without it the rating may not have been R so a younger audience could see it as well. Very educational and enthralling.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Movie. Everyone should see history. In the. Making,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","a good biopic, but don't see the advantage of seeing on imax 70mm
could easily watch at home for same effect.   only one real ""bomb scene"" and it's not that impressive
if you liked ""a beautiful mind"", you'll enjoy this

so for the movie 5 stars, for the hype -- subtract two stars",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023",Way too long and repetitive hearing scene was repetitive.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023",Loved it. It is a must-see. It is a cinematic masterpiece.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",A riveting story well told. A reminder that the smartest minds are not always the wisest.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Fantastic acting, great story. Seemed like two movies rolled in to one. No doubt there will be academy award nods in it's future.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",I loved this movie!!! Its about time they started making movies worth seeing again!!!!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","It was a movie, but fell short of the expected glamour associated with Nolan.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023",Way too long and very complicated unless you know a lot about the history of the time period.,NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","It was a very interesting story but a bit too long, imo!",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",would have wished it was IMX but LX theater was a good second choice,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Movie was excellence and well executed.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",The film is trying to appeal to various demographics and in the process becomes less focused and instead rather meandering.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Great movie overall. Kept you engaged and even though it was 3 hours, it went by quick.  All wonderful actors and actresses.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING! It definitely lived up to the hype.  The filmography was beautiful and the acting was spectacular.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Acting was really good, the sound varied from good to too loud. the image seemed to be bumpy/jumping around a bit ion the 70 MM screen we watched",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023","excellent - in every aspect.  Didn't just faithfully retell the book, it brought it to life. Fascinating, compelling story gives much food for thought.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Good pacing, good storyline",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Quickest 3-hour movie I've ever seen!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Too slow and too long,NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023",Great acting and story.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Painfully loud. Next to impossible to follow the storyline unless you've read the book.,NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Saw it in Cinemark XD.   Good movie.  3 hours long but it doesn't feel like it because it moves quickly.  Great story as well.  Excellent cast.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",It was an interesting movie but could have been shorter.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023",Great cast! Interesting coverage of an important historical topic.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Excellent writing, great acting. Cinemaphotography was amazing and the music score outstanding. I expect it will receive several Oscars.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Probably the most boring movie I've seen in decades. Literally 1 minute of any action and 2 hours and 59 minutes of CSPAN level dialogue. I find it hard to believe this was directed by Nolan.,NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",The movie was extremely well written and the actors were really great. The one thing I didnt like was the loud sound effects of bombs exploding.,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","It was good and bad. I'm a fan of history, so this was informative and I learned things... but it's like watching a three-hour-long movie trailer. You're lucky to get more than a few contiguous minutes of a scene before it transitions to another time and place.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023",Would have liked the outcome listed after move before credits,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Good...a little long,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","it was remarkable acting. Parts of it were a little hard to follow. It's a long movie at 3 hours, but you almost felt that parts of the story still didn't have time to be told. If you're someone who really enjoys a character study movie and getting deep into the impact, a person has on history and their interactions with the people in their life, you will love this movie if you're someone who enjoys more action and more intrigue, then you might not like this movie
as much.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Thought it was a great movie with a lot of information.  There wasn't one actor or actress that played a bad part.  It was a little long but I do understand that there was a lot of story to be told.  I definitely could've watched a new episode of this if it were a show every week for numerous weeks to make it even longer and give much more information and background.  The sound/music, I think, was one of the best parts, it made everything so much more suspenseful.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Learned more about the story of the atomic bomb.  Well told, great acting",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Extremely slow moving, it is a 100% drama not suspense or action as the trailer kinda portrayed. They assume you know all the characters as there isnt any character development for you to really understand the characters youre watching. Unnecessary nudity that didnt make sense. They jump through 3-4 different time periods back and forth, which is fine, but you must tell the audience as a director what time period the scene is from at least one time. He doesnt do that at all. Its focus for the majority of the 3hrs is about the political drama surrounding it rather than about the actual atomic bomb. So you basically need to be a history buff or read an actual book about the events surrounding prior to actually understanding the characters youre watching and all of the dialogue.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Leading candidate for best picture of the year! Historically accurate and intriguing. The events leading up to the Trinity test were intense!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Great adult movie. Acting terrific!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Great acting and direction.,POSITIVE

"Aug 1, 2023",The direction and acting was top tier!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Too long. Dragged in the middle. If youre not a war history buff, it wasnt great. Husband is, Im not, hence 3 stars. TOO TOO LOUD!",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023","The movie was perfect as perfect as it can get. The characters were superb. The acting was superb. The sound and story were superb. The movie was brilliant. Nolan, Cillian, Downey and the film itself better win all the awards.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Good, but not great...could have been shorter and still been enough.  It's really more about his life than the actual bomb, so set your expectations appropriately.",POSITIVE

"Aug 1, 2023",Great movie and definitely one you want to see in theaters!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","Even though you know the outcome, there's plenty of suspense. The personal relationships and motivation for making the bomb were very interesting.",POSITIVE

"Aug 1, 2023",Excellent acting & cinematography.,POSITIVE

"Aug 1, 2023",Overrated- I knew a little of the back story but the character development and depth was not there for me.  For 3+ hours I want to come to care and I just didn't I just wanted the movie to wrap up and end.,NEGATIVE

"Aug 1, 2023","""Oppenheimer"" (2023) √© uma obra cinematogr√°fica do renomado diretor Christopher Nolan que mergulha nas profundezas da vida e trabalho do f√≠sico J. Robert Oppenheimer durante o hist√≥rico Projeto Manhattan, que culminou no desenvolvimento da bomba at√¥mica. Com uma narrativa rica em debates pol√≠ticos e emocionantes atua√ß√µes, o filme oferece uma experi√™ncia cativante ao espectador.

Nolan demonstra sua maestria ao conduzir com destreza os debates pol√≠ticos, evitando quaisquer trope√ßos que poderiam causar t√©dio no espectador. Mesmo diante de uma hist√≥ria amplamente conhecida, o diretor habilmente penetra nas entrelinhas dos acontecimentos, oferecendo di√°logos profundos e reflexivos que exploram os dilemas √©ticos e morais enfrentados pelos cientistas imersos nesse ousado projeto. Em meio ao cen√°rio devastador da Segunda Guerra Mundial, as nuances psicol√≥gicas dos personagens emergem em conflitos internos que transcendem o √¢mbito cient√≠fico.

Destaque merecido vai para Cillian Murphy, que entrega uma atua√ß√£o excepcional como Oppenheimer. O ator captura perfeitamente o olhar desolado e perturbado do f√≠sico em seus √∫ltimos anos, o que √© fundamental para nos envolver emocionalmente com o personagem. Sua atua√ß√£o √© t√£o impactante que n√£o seria surpresa v√™-lo concorrendo ao Oscar. Robert Downey Jr. tamb√©m se destaca com uma atua√ß√£o magistral como Lewis Strauss, transmitindo com maestria a empreitada vingativa do personagem contra Oppenheimer.

Diferente do que muitos pensavam, o longa n√£o busca enaltecer ou endeusar Oppenheimer, mas sim apresentar um retrato complexo do cientista, com suas virtudes e defeitos. Ao abordar suas decis√µes, o filme exp√µe os dilemas do f√≠sico mostrando que suas decis√µes tiveram consequ√™ncias profundas e o atormentaram at√© o fim de seus dias. Com isso, revelando que a busca pela gl√≥ria acad√™mica n√£o veio sem um custo para a humanidade do protagonista.

Outro aspecto admir√°vel √© a abordagem sutil e filos√≥fica da influ√™ncia de Albert Einstein na cria√ß√£o da bomba at√¥mica. A narrativa opta por destacar a decis√£o de Oppenheimer em continuar o projeto, em vez de centralizar a ""culpa"" na figura ic√¥nica de Einstein. Essa mudan√ßa permite uma abordagem filos√≥fica sobre a responsabilidade dos cientistas em rela√ß√£o ao impacto de suas descobertas na humanidade.

O refinamento art√≠stico e t√©cnico do filme √© espetacular, desde a bel√≠ssima fotografia que enriquece a ambienta√ß√£o com efeitos pr√°ticos, proporcionando uma sensa√ß√£o de realismo envolvente, at√© a trilha sonora impec√°vel que empresta uma atmosfera melanc√≥lica √† jornada emocional de Oppenheimer.

Em s√≠ntese, ""Oppenheimer"" (2023) √© uma obra-prima cinematogr√°fica dirigida pelo renomado Christopher Nolan, que nos transporta para os bastidores do hist√≥rico Projeto Manhattan, acompanhando a trajet√≥ria do f√≠sico J. Robert Oppenheimer. O filme apresenta uma narrativa envolvente, habilmente mesclando debates pol√≠ticos e reflex√µes filos√≥ficas sobre as consequ√™ncias morais da ci√™ncia. Com atua√ß√µes not√°veis, lideradas por Cillian Murphy, que entrega uma interpreta√ß√£o excepcional como Oppenheimer, e Robert Downey Jr., brilhante no papel de Lewis Strauss, o filme nos envolve emocionalmente, mostrando a humanidade e complexidade dos personagens. ""Oppenheimer"" √© muito mais do que um simples relato hist√≥rico, √© uma experi√™ncia que nos convida a refletir sobre as escolhas que moldam nosso mundo e a responsabilidade dos cientistas diante das descobertas que trazem transforma√ß√µes profundas na sociedade. Uma obra cinematogr√°fica que transcende o entretenimento e se estabelece como uma reflex√£o profunda sobre a natureza humana e o poder da ci√™ncia.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","What's with the apple?  Newton, Turing, and now Oppenheimer.  

While there is no doubt about Oppenheimer's loyalty, it would have been good to refer to the extensive list of once very highly regarded scientists whom we now know to have been traitors (not three seconds ""Oh this is Fuchs"" (the British baddie).  The security concerns were not the product of a few people's jealousy.  The director could have acknowledged this if he was set on making a court room drama.

It would have been better to dispense with this and just concentrate on the making of the bomb.  Or dispense with the making of the bomb and concentrate on the court room drama.  Either way, drop the sex scenes.

The film tangled the two threads and made a mess.  Weak direction partially redeemed by good acting.  

Some engagement with the science would have been good.  The scene in Chicago was skimmed so lightly one would not know, had one not read about it elsewhere, that this was the world's first nuclear reactor, just how important it was, and the serious concerns about a possible runaway.

And if dialogue is important, please allow us to hear it properly.  It's not as if the music was that good.

The best pr√©cis I have read is ""Man in hat beats Nazis to the prize"".",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023","The cinematography, sound and casting are great, but it doesn't make up for the poor cut. Shaped in another way this could have been a hit.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023","Overly talky and disappointingly short on the real life drama of the scientific and engineering challenges leading up to the test and the tightest secrecy of wartime. It isn't even explained as to how an A-bomb is supposed to work in theory and in the practical sense. I left the theater knowing no more about the bombs than I did going in.  Much too much about the post-war, red scare politics which come as no surprise and more of a yawn. The supposedly cathartic meeting with Einstein that is returned to for emphasis is another ho-hum, who cares, kind of scene that makes large swathes of the movie arrogant, preachy in boring ways, and lacking gut punch. The scene with President Truman made him look like an obnoxious tyrant, which goes against writings of eyewitnesses and the most respected historians. It's a shame they had Truman come across that way, when he was a diplomatic and thoughtful leader during very difficult times, not an ogre.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023","Oppenheimer is a great film with stunning visuals unlike any I have seen throughout many modern films, even in the era of CGI's common use. However, the overall back-and-forth of timeframes throughout the film makes the pacing and clarity a bit jumbled. 

Those timeframe elements come together at the end, but it almost feels as though the film is actually two whole stories, with the first just being a footnote in the background to the story of the government's treatment of Robert Oppenheimer. 

The performances by Emily Blunt and Cillian Murphy are excellent, and do alleviate some of the clarity issues by adding suspense and emotional investment to the broad story arc. Overall, Oppenheimer demonstrates the aspect of framing and visuals that make Christopher Nolan's films compelling, but simply gets dragged down by a lack of focus and pacing.",POSITIVE

"Aug 1, 2023","The sound track was so loud it was hard to hear the dialogue. In my view the relentlessly 'exciting' sound track was used because the dialogue and characterisation were insufficiently interesting.  Lots of people say the film made them 'think.' Can't imagine why. Didn't they know American developed the first atom bomb which caused horrible deaths and suffering to two Japanese towns. Surprise, surprise Oppenheimer is apparently slightly conflicted after the bombs are used.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","""Oppenheimer"" is an awe-inspiring cinematic triumph that skillfully delves into the compelling and profound story of the creation of the nuclear bomb. Directed by the visionary auteur, this movie presents an unparalleled narrative of science, politics, and the moral dilemmas that defined one of the most significant events in human history.

The film revolves around the life and work of J. Robert Oppenheimer, brilliantly portrayed by an exceptional lead actor who effortlessly brings the complexity of this enigmatic physicist to life. From the outset, the screenplay captivates viewers by immersing them in Oppenheimer's intellectual brilliance and his unyielding determination to push the boundaries of scientific discovery.

The film strikes a perfect balance between historical accuracy and artistic interpretation, ensuring a seamless blend of facts and emotional resonance. The captivating visuals and attention to period detail transport the audience to the era of World War II, making it feel like a journey back in time. The cinematography is spellbinding, capturing the beauty of science and the horror of its consequences with equal prowess.

One of the most commendable aspects of ""Oppenheimer"" is how it explores the complex ethical dilemmas faced by the scientists involved in the Manhattan Project. The movie does not shy away from portraying the moral quandaries that haunted Oppenheimer and his colleagues as they realized the immense power they were unlocking. This introspective examination elevates the film beyond a mere historical drama and transforms it into a thought-provoking masterpiece that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll.

The supporting cast deserves accolades for their exceptional performances, adding depth to the narrative by portraying the key figures who shaped the events surrounding the creation of the nuclear bomb. From government officials to fellow scientists, each character is impeccably portrayed, making the film's ensemble truly outstanding.

The film's gripping storytelling and emotional depth are further accentuated by a hauntingly beautiful score that underscores the tension and gravity of the events depicted on screen. The music heightens the impact of crucial moments and amplifies the emotional connection the audience forms with the characters.",POSITIVE

"Aug 1, 2023","Very rarely do I think a movie was too long until I watched this one. The story is good but to be crushed next to strangers and watch a proceeding for around 1h and 30 mins is utterly unenjoyable. The movie could've been only 2 hrs long but isn't since you are bombarded with details some of which make no difference to the story, personally I didn't come for a lecture. Furthermore the movie in some instances fails to evoke any type of emotion other than discomfort and stress. The revelation towards the end was somewhat unsurprising. The acting was brilliant regardless and the story still is interesting but if I'd have known I would've never watched this in the cinema but at home where I could've paused it for a break.",NEGATIVE

This is basic World War 2 knowledge that Hitler's top Nazi scientists were in a cataclysmic race with America's scientists to create the Atom Bomb first.  We keep forgetting that the outcome of World War 2 could easily have been MUCH different if a ruthless Nazi fascist dictatorship ruled the entire world today.  Our entire planet would look just like North Korea.",NEGATIVE

I thought I would come out with a profound sense of the bomb, or our responsibilities as a society and species, but I mostly just saw a man dragged through an unfair hearing for three hours. Really dry. The movie should have focused on the bomb, the moral quandaries, etc. Well shot and acted.",NEUTRAL

"Aug 1, 2023",10/10 fantastic movie! Shows the desperation that spurred the Manhattan project into action as well as the regret and gravity of dropping them on Japan. Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. deserve Oscars for their performances. Christopher Nolan's best movie to date!,POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","""We dropped a bomb on a defeated country."" Uh, no we didn't, Mr. Nolan. Tell that to the 11,000 marines that died on Iwo Jima alone. Interesting that the British in Dunkirk are nothing but noble. But the Americans in Oppenheimer just might be the bad guys. Does Mr. Nolan really believe the Russians would've simply stopped pursuing nukes if we did not pursue the hydrogen bomb? That'd be naive, bordering on stupidity. Ok, historical misgivings about the movie aside, it's overwrought. It's a 5-part mini-series crammed into a 3-hour film. The ending drags on though we've already gotten the point, mercilessly pounded into us over and over again. The acting, however, is simply incredible, and several parts of the dialog are very memorable. The explosion scene itself is incredible. But this is really two films - one about Oppenheimer, and one about Downey's character. Mixing the two was a bridge too far.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023",Splendid with excellent acting. The film moved effortlessly across two time lines with gorgeous cinematography.,POSITIVE

"Aug 1, 2023",I dont know why but I tried to like this movie and hour and a half in I kept spacing out and was extremely bored. Besides it being directed by Christopher Nolan I don't get the hype at all,NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","""Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds."" That is the popular tagline said by J. Robert Oppenheimer. It's mentioned only twice throughout the entire film, and I also repeated it during dinner with my girlfriend after watching the movie. She is a big fan of Christopher Nolan films. Naturally, her somewhat biased standards will deem this three-hour-long biopic excellent. On the other hand, I feel that the film falls far short of the overwhelming hype it received - it's way above serviceable but not near outstanding. Unlike his previous films that are centred on events, his recent highly-anticipated venture is a fact-based character drama that follows the life of the renowned physicist and the journey of how he became the creator of a weapon so powerful that he bears the guilt of his own achievements for the rest of his life. 

Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" is not entirely about the atomic bomb or even focused on the Manhattan Project but rather centres on its titular character's life before, during, and after the making of the deadly explosive. His obsession with making a weapon whose destructiveness is way beyond the comprehension of a regular human is awful and alarming proof that humans are capable of things that are more immeasurable and inexplicable than the complexities of the science of quantum physics. (I don't understand physics, much less the gravity of making a bomb) Here, his life is presented to us in a form similar to that of a documentary, but the narrative is so fragmented that it can sometimes be difficult to follow its plot. On top of that, the film confuses us further by jumping between its two different timelines: one in colour, the other monochrome. The one in colour tells us more about Oppenheimer as a pre-bomb student and shares his romantic relationships with two women. It also includes his private interrogation in a small room where he testifies about having his security clearance stripped by the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) board after he objected to the planning to make an even more destructive weapon, the hydrogen bomb. In black and white, the other timeline follows Robert Downey Jr.'s Lewis Strauss as he testifies in front of the Senate. He is the antagonist, and as a member of the AEC, he is the one who painted Oppenheimer as a communist during the Red Scare in an attempt to bring him down.

The lineup that makes up this ensemble cast is impressive. Almost every minor or supporting role is played by a known star. Some only appear once or twice, but they each try their best to make an impression to not be forgotten by the time the film ends. But the film mainly consists of men, and the two women on screen aren't developed or written well. Florence Pugh appears in the first half as the devout communist whose self-destructive character drove her to suicide. Emily Blunt plays the erratic and volatile wife with a drinking problem. In short, this is a long film about men in rooms talking about and making decisions that will affect and change the future. And the talking they do sort of requires you to have some knowledge about atomic energy. But at its core, ""Oppenheimer"" is about a scientist and his relationship with humanity - and later, his role in killing thousands of people with his work.

Matt Damon plays a Colonel that is representative of the army and pushes for the development of the bomb by recruiting all the scientists he can get by saying something along the lines of, ""The Nazis are making a very powerful bomb! We must also make one quicker to beat them and win!"" But then Germany surrendered. Japan doesn't, but neither are they making a bomb. Would it then be fair to use it on an enemy that is certainly ill-equipped? ""It will still save lives by ending the war,"" they tell him. He is in a moral dilemma that keeps him up at night. But besides that, the film doesn't say anything more than that, and its three-hours runtime makes it extra and sometimes boring. One element that alleviates the boredom is the memorable performance of Robert Downey Jr.. I can't think of any movies he starred in besides the Marvel films. As a result, I've become attuned to his acting style of being the arrogant Tony Stark. But here, he shows us his versatility, playing a man driven to madness by his own unfulfilled ambition, and it's terrific!

""Oppenheimer"" isn't about the bomb, as the hype might suggest. Rather, it's a self-portrait of him and his life. As a result, when the film arrives at the Trinity Test, it isn't as impactful or satisfying as one might expect and is made anti-climatic by the subsequent continuation of the hearings. In the end, like the spectators watching the atomic bomb explosion, I couldn't help but feel both amazed and uncertain about the film's greatness. But at the same time, I could not fully connect with it and felt distant from it, just like them watching from afar.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 1, 2023","I wouldn't say its the best movie by nolan, I'll always give batman trilogy/ inception as his best works.

"Aug 1, 2023","The good: Downey Jr gives an Oscar worthy performance as Oppy's nemesis. Strong, calculating, very complicated character. I found myself understanding his weakness. His fatal flaw of measuring himself against a man much more intelligent than him being all too real. Matt Damon was impeccable in his role. Overall the acting was fabulous, but...
The bad: Cillian Murphy I think captured Oppenheimer in his later years perfectly. Tortured, worried about his legacy. But that man could have never led the Manhattan project. Historically Oppenheimer was selected for his leadership. People that tortured cannot lead a project that big. I blame Nolan for making the character so incredibly depressed, which is apparently historically untrue, and emotionally false in reality. Murphy was nonetheless impressive in this manufactured role.
The ugly: why the choice to shatter the story line into so many fractured vignettes? By the end of the 3 hour run time I was just tired. 2 timelines would have served the story better. Coupled with the incessant sound track, I enjoyed the movie less and less as it progressed. A few moments of silence would have told a quieter side of the story better. I love Nolan, but this is my least favorite film of his. Sad. I waited since the spring.",NEGATIVE

You're sure to get a thought-provoking and moving experience. Oppenheimer proves you don't need explosions to hold the audience in the palm of its hand. Great actors, writing, sound work, cinematography, etc can all do the trick if you've got the talent to make it happen.",POSITIVE

Only 5 minutes was them testing bombs or even talking about the science of it. The rest was communist party meetings and the trial? Who cares about the that?

From start to finish , so intriguing the more it plays the more you're waiting to find out what happens. 3 hours may be long in some people's minds but, for me I was so attached to the screen with the amazing casting choices and how those roles were played.

I seriously would recommend if anyone gets a chance to see it in IMAX 70MM, it felt like I was in the room with Cillian Murphy. 4.5 stars because I would have liked to see more of the science involved. After watching it a bunch of times, the points that feel like science should be the main focus, communism still is. Overall, the best and most creative movie I have seen in a long time.",POSITIVE
"Jul 31, 2023","Phenomenal movie, probably the movie of the year. Everything is incredibly entertaining and looks and sounds amazing, while never flinching from the beauty or the horror. The best cast in years, superstars giving their all. If you love a light show it's that, and if you want something powerful to think about, it's that too.",POSITIVE
"Jul 31, 2023","The movie is long at the 3 hours, but it doesn't seem that way.  Cillian Murphy looks very much like Oppenheimer in this.  Did you know that he ate only one almond and water for weeks to lose the weight?  I worry about actors who do stuff like that - many doctors think it is dangerous.  His performance is excellent, I am sure that an Oscar nomination will be forthcoming.  But the highlight for me in acting was Robert Downey, Jr. as Lewis Strauss, the former head of the Atomic Energy Commision who developed a deep hatred for Oppenheimer on a perceived slight at a hearing.  And he was suspicious of Oppenheimer communist ties - he teamed up with Edward Teller, who was angry with Oppenheimer because of Oppenheimer's opposition to the H-bomb to wreck Oppenheimer's professional life.  At least so far this year, I think Downey is a shoo-in for a best supporting actor Oscar.  The movie is filled with many other fine actors, including Rami Malek (""Mr. Robot"") who has a relatively small but key role in the hearings on Strauss.  Emily Blunt is very good as Oppenheimer's wife but the highlight from the female acting performance for me is Florence Pugh as Jean Tatlock.  The movie is filled with half of Hollywood it seems, including Alden Ehrenreich, Dane DeHaan, and Josh Hartnett.  It is the must-see movie of the year.",POSITIVE

Adult filmaking at its very best.",POSITIVE
"Jul 31, 2023",A good telling of Robert Oppenheimers life and times. I was not familiar his history so the unfolding of events kept my interest. I liked that the film presented the complexity of situations rather than trying to sell us on a perspective. If the film has a message it is that the creation of the atom bomb put the future of mankind in serious jeopardy. A situation that still exists today.,POSITIVE
"Jul 31, 2023","A haunting account of probably the most prolific and earth-moving figure of the modern era.

"Jul 31, 2023","Oppenheimer follows the line of amazing films by the great Christopher Nolan. The film gives us the insight of the team Robert assembles for the Manhattan Project. Sure, many viewers would argue the film being too political, but the conflict of communism and fascism brought paranoia to our country's leaders during WW2. The idea of building an atomic weapon was supposed to be a warning to our enemies, to end the war, so they could not have their plans exploited which is why they tried to defame Oppenheimer for being a communist despite it being false. Overall, the movie was fantastic. All the movie lovers that hate on this film need to climb out of the bandwagon, this was a part of history.",POSITIVE

"Jul 31, 2023","A pass over a fascinating,extremely important subject but not a great treatment. My issues are:
1)  The music and sound effects track is way too LOUD.  It often drowned out the dialogue.  All I talked to afterwards agreed.
2) The timeline is unnecessarily choppy and sometimes quite hard to follow.
3) There are many characters of importance historically and to the movie.  Many are poorly introduced or not introduced at all.  In 3 hours fewer visual and noise effects and more attention to the characters would help.
It is worth watching once even though your ears hurt, and you spend so much time trying figure out when this new,unknown, but obviously important person is speaking,  that is hard to willingly suspend disbelief.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 31, 2023","Oppenheimer exemplifies the best of both Christopher Nolan's work and Cillian Murphy's acting. It is as historically accurate as can be, but with a interesting screenplay by Christopher Nolan, the story of Robert J. Oppenheimer becomes that much more interesting, making the audience anticipate his every move. The supporting performances of Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon and Tom Conti are also a standout of the film but never take away the spotlight from Cillian Murphy. This thriller is truly shocking and surprising, opening new perspectives of life and people. A true cinematic masterpiece!",POSITIVE
"Jul 31, 2023","Fantastic cinematography and acting. Don't come into this expecting it to be all about the bomb. Not much action, but an intriguing and well written film. I love how accurate it is to history as well. One of the best films I've seen in a long time.",POSITIVE
"Jul 31, 2023","(A wonderful spectacle that both fuses and fissons ethics, science and politics) Nolan satisfies film buffs by shooting his historical drama in 70mm IMAX, partly in black and white, which has never been done before. 
Oppenheimer (based on biography American Prometheus) tells a nonlinear story about the perspective of scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) and partly politician Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) during the development of the first nuclear weapons. The film chronicles an impressive clash between a scientist, full of conflict over his personal feelings and those of humanity in his role as father of the atomic bomb, and the ambitions and personal vendetta of a driven politician. The characters work together in the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), an American advisory body that provides pronouncements on the development of nuclear weapons after World War II. The beginning of the film is mainly concerned with Oppenheimer's role during the physics developments prior to the Manhattan Project which is then laid out in the second act. However, the film erupts after World War II in the third act where the main characters fight for their credibility and reputation. The entire duration of the film (equivalent to three hours) consists of scintillating dialogue that is fantastically performed by a multitude of impressive actors. In particular, lead actors Robert Downey Jr and Cillian Murphy show their best side. However, supporting actors Casey Affleck (Boris Pash) and Jason Clarke (Roger Robb) perform at a similar if not higher level.  The trio of Cristopher Nolan, Hoyte van Hoytema (Cinematography) and Ludwig Goransson (Music) masterfully drag viewers into the fire of dialogue. The film is visually stunning in 70mm and has a brilliant score. Nolan, through his way of nonlinear storytelling, makes intriguing clashes stand out well: science versus politics, communism versus patriotism but especially selfish ambition versus the common good. Oppenheimer has all the tools for an absolute film classic, but has sloppy editing (Jennifer Larne). Shots are sometimes interspersed too quickly to follow easily. Several times characters who speak are not brought into focus. Also, some dialogues are surpassed by the volume of the film music. These choices sometimes lead to unclear dialogue, making drama less compelling.  Also, the film pace detracts from the impact some setpieces have. Perhaps a revised longer version, as Francis Ford Coppola did for his masterpiece Apocalypse Now: Final Cut, would take the film to an even higher level. In any case, with this work, Nolan once again shows himself to be one of the strongest filmmakers of his time. A wonderful spectacle that both fuses and fissons ethics, science and politics.",POSITIVE

Cillian Murphy's portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer was truly remarkable, capturing the essence of the brilliant physicist with finesse. His nuanced performance added depth and authenticity to the character, making it a standout role.
Robert Downey Jr. delivered an extraordinary performance as Lewis Strauss, a significant character in the film.

"Jul 31, 2023","As always Nolan has done a great job cinematically, one of the finest directors around. The cast and crew are excellent (even if Emily Blunt takes a bit of time to warm up to her usual standards). Watched this in IMAX but some of the dialogue was poorly mixed - and that's during the quieter moments. The 3rd act drags. No doubt this movie will be Oscar nominations galore but I only gave 3.5 as it didn't have enough heart for me & the 3rd act could have been handled better (for me). 
SPOILERS AHEAD

I didn't find myself caring enough about Oppenheimers trial, which after what he'd achieved I feel like I should have cared about him being treated unfairly. 
I didn't see the point in the incredible Florence Pugh being pretty much reduced to a naked footnote. Felt out of place to the rest of the movie. 
It dragged after the Bomb had been dropped, I think Nolan wanted his usual ‚Äòtwist' style ending with the B/W & colour scenes colliding but didn't really work for me.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 31, 2023","Solid acting, especially from Murphy. He will get Best actor awards. But Nolan couldnt decide whose story he was telling. He wasnt telling history's story, or Oppenheimer's story‚Ä¶was it a story about Downey's character? As Dorothy Parker famously said, ""First, you must kill all your darlings."" Nolan had too many darlings. Film is 30 minutes too long. In my theatre, people left early and I had to stand up at the back. There was no climax. I think the Trinity test was supposed to be the climax but it wasnt anchored w dialogue. The hearing was too long, lacking gravitas bc what‚Ä¶he's gonna lose his security clearance, so what. A lot of messy, too many threads, mixed w a lot of fabulous. But better to shoot for the moon and miss than make another bs empty headed romcom.",POSITIVE

"Jul 31, 2023","I really wanted to love this movie but seeing it in IMAX was a sensory overload, and not in the best way.  The two intertwining stories are not needed and really makes the 3rd act drag on.  The sound effects for the practical things like explosions and mass crowds are great, but the constant closeups of people shouting at each other drag on and I left the theater with a headache and ringing ears.  I'm a metal fan, and for this to happen to me makes me wonder what a cerebral smart person must feel walking out.  
It looks great and the cast is good but there are too many people to keep track of and I would have liked to have learned more about how they figured out the splitting of the atom and how they discovered it by using CGI to visually show it.  Nolan is no fan of CGI and it all ""had"" to be practical, which I think takes away and left me with a sense of what if....  The sex scenes were totally unnecessary and most of the female characters came across as a burden to Oppy and I'm not sure how you make Emily Blunt look terrible, but good job, you succeeded.  Maybe I'll like it more on a second viewing, but it will be awhile until I'm ready to give another 3 hours of my time.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 31, 2023","Sure it was a cinematic experience, visuals and music were fantastic, the cast and their acting was fenomenal. I just find some holes in the plot and how some characters are portrayed, specially female ones.
It's not something new in Nolan's films where females are poorly written or their point of view is always male based (which makes them look ""powerful"" in males eyes, but thats not how it actually is).
Oppenheimer being a womanizer is common knowledge, but i think they could've done a better job, some scenes were kind of unnecessary, and left more to talk about than the actual plot, the creation of the nuclear bomb.
After the big explosion the movie turned dense and boring, it felt like it was all about a dispute between two men egos, and some kind of american propaganda, it would have been a better idea to portrait even more Oppenheimer demons and fears and how the world was affected after the explosions, the good and the bad.

Only downsides for me were a few strange musical cues (it sometimes faded out very amateurishly, like it was a last minute decision after the music was already written and recorded) and a few cuts where the jaw movements of the actors filmed from behind didn't match the audio take that was used. So only technical issues I had. I never felt the 3h-duration, the movie flew by. What a deep dive into the man Oppenheimer, what a tightly written, whitty script (even funny at times) but what an emotional ending. A home run imo.",POSITIVE

"Jul 31, 2023","Nolan's best work, by far. While he has never failed to provide both entertainment and thought provoking ideas, they've never been as fully realized as Oppenheimer. Masterful performances, incredible fidelity to his subject matter, while finding the cracking drama at the heart of it... this time brought to life by his non-linear storytelling, rather than being obscured by it. 

Most telling is that somehow, after all he's done before, he improves his use of audio to carry the emotional tenor physically to the audience. From the cacophonic electron dreams that drive the title character, to the subtle sounds of a gloved hand clenched in refusal of a handshake, this is so much a sensory experience, rather than the expected cerebral one. Dunkirk was a technical masterpiece, but I always felt distanced... removed from everything. It is a fitting historical report, but it did not bring about the immersion of Oppenheimer, where I felt I'd lived that lifetime.

Oh, and Emily Blunt has only a little screen time, but nobody deserves a supporting roll Oscar nod more than her. Her presence throughout, and two key scenes, are critical to understanding this story more than Oppenheimer himself. (No knock on Murphy and his very-likely Oscar winning portrayal.)",POSITIVE
"Jul 31, 2023","My main issue has nothing to do with the actors and their performances (which was stellar).  It has to do with how the story was told.  Some may call it ""intelligent"", but I think that's cope for it actually being very confusing and all over the place.  Character development was virtually non-existent.

"Jul 31, 2023","Truly one of the best films in recent years, the photography and sound design were amazing, specially the use of the IMAX B/W film. And that's without talking about the writing which is also amazing so engaging and well written that it doesn't fell like a 3 hour film.

"Jul 31, 2023","As a recovering nuclear engineer, I went into the movie prepared to see bad drama and bad science inspite of the critics' universal gushing, but I found both to be upto snuff, to the point were I forgot about the details that didn't matter and focused on the journey of the characters. There was a lot to cover in the movie- distilling an adult life into three hours, and C.N. did.",POSITIVE
"Jul 31, 2023","Oppenheimer is one of the most astounding films anyone can see, when I saw it in the cinema you slowly start adding up the dots to put the picture together in your head. The film speaks a lot about how Robert felt while he was developing/figuring out the atomic bomb and how he felt after it was tested. At one point you can see were he had regret filled in his eyes as soon as the testing of the Atomic Bomb went off. I 100% recommend anyone to see it but it's not the type of film everyone will like, after all, it is around 80-90% dialogue more than interesting actions happening.",POSITIVE
"Jul 31, 2023",Great movie. Amazing acting. The best directed movie of 2023 so far. Make sure you go to the bathroom before hand because if you miss a second of the movie you will be confused.,POSITIVE

"Jul 31, 2023","The first Nolan film I have ever seen and by far one of the best movies I've seen. The movie keeps you captivated from the moment it starts. The acting by everyone from Murphy to Blunt to Damon everyone was amazing and really sold the role. RDJ's acting will win hime an Oscar and this movie overall could sweep the oscars because of how great it is. The production design, the acting, sound editing, cinematography and more is just amazing. This movie leaves you feeling so many emotions all at once and is easily so far the best movie to come out this year. You can really tell how everyone on set cares about this movie and the level it need to be at to succeed. Nolan directed this film perfectly and it really makes you fall in love with his work if you haven't already. The music is also another massive bonus to such an amazing film, the music creates so much tension and friction it hurts to watch but in a good way. The music is done by Ludwig Goransson and he did a fantastic job capturing how to make you feel. All in all this is a must watch for everyone and definitely the best film of the year and last few years in memory.",POSITIVE

"Jul 31, 2023",It's a good movie. I would recommend it. But it is not great. A lot of great stars but the production shudders through scenes that are sudden and disconnected. Great starring role for Cillian Murphy who carries the movie despite the disconnected editing but strong story line. Standout support were Dane DeHaan and then Matt Damon and Robert Downey Jnr. Why Dane first? A totally enveloping character in a few short scenes.,NEUTRAL
"Jul 31, 2023","An incredible story, told in such a way that you won't get bored for even a minute.",POSITIVE
"Jul 31, 2023","Very disappointing.  

Much of the acting was good, but the film was disjointed, you learned nothing about science, the great scientists at the time and their moral struggles or politics other than Oppenheimer was linked to communists as were his two wives and many of his friends, so of course they were going to investigate him. We were supposed to be on his side but realistically I was hoping they would just put him in jail so I could go home. Even the conclusion of the movie was wrong, ironically nuclear weapons ushered in an era of peace between the world powers that hadn't existed before, because you know if you press that red button, you and everyone you know will die. 

A failure of screenwriting, what should have been a great story was turned into a snoozefest. I think the nude scenes were designed to wake people up in the middle of the film. A massive missed opportunity on the scale of the farce that was Alexander.  

A lot of the positive reviews here read like they were written by ChatGPT.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 31, 2023","Nolan, Murphy, Damon, Blunt, Downey. You can't ask for a better star cast. I was going into this film knowing all the actors and actresses of who they are and what they play in this film. I couldn't even recognize Gary Oldman which is what truly shows how good of an actor he is and how impressive the makeup artist was. The plot for this is amazing but I am biased because of how much I enjoy learning about history. I took my friend to see it who didn't understand the plot much but I felt he did not have much of an open mind to it. It was still incredible to be a part of the few people to see this film in 70mm as how Nolan intended compared to millions who have seen it in a regular theatre is something I will never forget. This was just an incredible film that is in my opinion going to be one of the best movies to have ever been made.",POSITIVE

Every performance was brilliant, the cinematography was truly beautiful and the dialogue was even better than most films. Christopher Nolan has done it again!!!",POSITIVE
"Jul 31, 2023","Oppenheimer is such a Great Movie a Real Christopher Nolan Classic.

Giving Cillian Murphy the Role of Robert J. Oppenheimer was such a great decision since Murphy has Experience in playing ""Darker Themes"" like Peaky Blinders e.g.

Matt Damon as General Groves is perfect.

Robert Downey Jr. as Lewis Strauss was also a great Decision. And i could'nt think about someone that fits the Heisenberg Role better than Matthias Schweigh√∂fer (except Bryan Cranston ofc.)

Jokes aside even the Supporting Roles were great e.g. Josh Peck is in the Movie last Time i saw him was in ""Drake & Josh"" gave me a feeling of Nostalgia.

Its great to see that Christopher Nolan has such a great Reputation that he gets so many Stars to play in his Movies.

I always think its quite hard to make a Movie about Historical Events since you cant change that much and the end is clear. But Christopher Nolan is such a great Director.

The Film didnt feel like 3 Hours Total cause most of the time you were sitting there ""Biting your Nails"". 

The Music made the Movie even better, giving you the right Emotions for each Scene, same as in Interstellar.

For me Oppenheimer is one of the best Movies i ever watched, it made me feel every dramatic Moment as if i were in it, every Laugh Oppenheimer had, i had too. When he was Shaken by the stuff he did, i was shaken too.

I apologise for my English since it isnt my first Language, i hope i could give you all one more Reason to watch Oppenheimer.",POSITIVE

"Jul 31, 2023","Oppenheimer no es una pel√≠cula para todos. Desde la primera secuencia nos introduce en la mente de Oppie, sus sue√±os (no metas), y como estos lo acompa√±an hasta el final del film. Es una pel√≠cula que est√° cargada de fuertes emociones varias que es lo que te lleva a amarla. Junto a eso, el dise√±o sonoro es brutal, perfecto a nivel musical y a nivel de la f√≠sica. Parece que Nolan se haya estado preparando todos estos a√±os con sus pel√≠culas para llegar a este momento y crear una inigualable y magistral obra cinematogr√°fica, digna de elogios, felicitaciones y obviamente, unos cuantos (si no son todos) premios de la academia.",POSITIVE

"Jul 31, 2023",I don't get the love for this movie. The music score was more suited for an action movie. Even in scenes that were in small rooms of people just sitting talking the booming soundtrack made me think batman was gonna smash thru the wall. Maybe turning the sound off and reading subtitles would make it better.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 31, 2023",Excellent. Loved hearing and seeing about the history and the brains involved.,POSITIVE
"Jul 31, 2023","This was the best movie I have ever seen. Every second of this film is captivating and I wanted the movie to continue for another 3 hours when it was done, the first time I had ever cried during a movie. The characters themselves are so well written and you could feel what every character was felling and Oppenheimer felt like you knew him since kindergarten by the end of the movie, the music was perfection and the sound work was out of this world and it was the first time sex in a movie didn't fell forced . The bomb was the best cinematic experience of all time, better then when the world turns to color in the wizard of oz. anybody who doesn't like the movie definitely had a fired attention span from TikTok and think that the best movies known to man are marvel and mission impossible movies.

"Jul 31, 2023","Boring, so boring. I don't think I've checked my watch so often during a film in the hope that perhaps somehow I've misjudged how much time has passed and can go home soon. Acting is ok but there is zero story to follow. Don't bother.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 31, 2023","Nolan's Oppenheimer, once again, leaves audience with a memorable 3 hours. The amazing performances from Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. only makes it better. Arguably one of the most impactful movies in the last decade.",POSITIVE
"Jul 31, 2023","One of Christopher Nolan's best films in quite a while after the more underwhelming, by his standards anyway, Dunkirk and *especially* Tenet, Oppenheimer already has the more straightforward narrative and better sound mixing going for it but what truly makes it amazing is not just the build-up to THAT scene but also the strong performances, dialogue that is never boring to listen to despite the subject matter, intense score and a combination of great pacing & good editing to avoid making the three-hour runtime feel tedious making for a riveting dramatisation of real events. Nolan had the difficult task of making a biopic about the father of the atomic bomb appeal to millions of movie-goers who are unlikely to know who he is and I think it's safe to say he succeeded big time.
EDITED TO ADD: FINALLY, NOLAN WON AN OSCAR AFTER YEARS OF GETTING SNUBBED. NOW I CAN ACTUALLY SLEEP AT NIGHT!!!",POSITIVE
"Jul 31, 2023","One of the best films I have seen ever. It's fast paced dialogue wise, and if you're bad at remembering names like I am, it can be a clusterFk in some spots but I pieced together the parts that confused me and overall, LOVED the film. Going to the theaters again next weekend to watch it again. Might even go a third time.

ABSOLUTELY watch this in theaters people! The soundtrack was so intense it felt like the movie was grabbing you by the shoulders and shaking you to wake. Cillian Murphy was beyond a doubt the best casting decision ever for Oppy, the physics is well explained just enough to understand the actual process in developing the Atomic bomb, and Oppy has great emotional depth in this film. So much I didn't know about him before. Each of the star studded cast pulls their weight and does an amazing job, too many to name them all. 

Go watch it. Go watch it now!",POSITIVE

"Jul 31, 2023",Great movie ! One of the scenes had my heart racing‚Ä¶ the Music was amazing!,POSITIVE
"Jul 31, 2023","I didn't like Oppenheimer very much, and most of the characters in it didn't seem like each other very much.  And that made it difficult to watch.

There are almost three distinct films here: 

1.  We are bored near-to-death by the filmmaker's obsession with Oppenheimer and his various friends' communist party sympathies - to the point that it bordered on pro-communist party propaganda. We are introduced to a cast of characters who don't seem to be particularly friendly with each other, aren't particularly likable, though all are quite impressed with one another's intellectual credentials, rank or social status -- boring.   

2. the Manhattan Project itself leading up to the Trinity test, the first successful test of an atomic bomb -- this was the only part of the film even remotely interesting or engaging. And even this section of the film was... slow.  There were conflicts amongst characters which were poorly explained or hard to follow.  

3. And the final third bores us near to tears with the story of Oppenheimer's loyalty hearings concerning his security clearance and a senate hearing where the villain is vanquished, though not in a particularly satisfying way. 

At 3+ hours long, it's simply, too long.  And the filmmaker or script writer seems enamored of their own voice without any idea how boring, time consuming, perhaps insufferable his film becomes.  

Virtually every current actor is in this film, and all of their performances are first rate.  Yet, the film itself, it tedious, slow, and long... sooooooooooo long and boring.  Though it had moments.  But just moments.  

I want those three hours of my life back.  I learned little new information, and didn't enjoy any of the characters, most of whom didn't seem to like one another.  Not the least of which, none of Oppenheimer's wives or lovers seemed to like him very much.  It's difficult to watch a film where there is almost no one to root for, and, like the other characters in the film, you don't like anyone on screen very much.  I wrote my review as a warning to others.  Watch it on 1.2x speed (or higher) on Netflix when it comes out if you must.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 31, 2023",The movie is hyped to be watched at IMAX but has nothing that makes it an IMAX movie. It should have been released as a documentary on Netflix. There is just conversation among few people in a conference room for most of the time. Its difficult to understand what people are talking about. Waste of time and money. Fell asleep towards the end as its so boring.,NEGATIVE

"Jul 31, 2023","Christopher Nolan at his best. The acting, storytelling, and visuals were all superb. My only gripe was the nudity, which, for me, diminished the grandeur of this otherwise flawless masterpiece. Cheap cinema often needs sex to sell, but Nolan, the greatest filmmaker of our generation, doesn't need any help, so this felt very much out of place to me.",POSITIVE
"Jul 31, 2023","Probably the best film I have ever seen. It includes Einstein, Feynman, Fermi, Heisenberg, Bors and many many others. I'm going again to see in IMAX. Incredible experience. Don't miss this one in a lifetime film in theaters.",POSITIVE
"Jul 31, 2023","As someone with an affinity for history, I'd say this movie is a must-see. Easily one of the best movies of the decade, and we aren't even halfway through yet.

"Jul 31, 2023","Bloated, overlong, confusing. The sound was terrible and the score frequently overpowered the dialogue. Too many characters and too much jumping around in time. Interesting history but could have been told way more succinctly.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 31, 2023","The third hour of the movie -- post Hiroshima/Nagasaki -- was better than the first two hours. However, this movie did not need to be three hours and I was ready for it to be done. The casting and acting was excellent but the script was a bit bloated.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 31, 2023","I left at just over two hours, it wasn't going to improve for me.
This is really a biopic of Oppenheimer, which is visually disappointing considering its IMAX delivery.

There was a lot of talking, very few closeups, and an ensemble cast, which included small parts played by significant actors, which I found distracting.

Re. The Visuals.
Nolan commissioned Kodak to create a 70mm film stock, to work in an IMAX camera.
Great, I thought this would mean we would see dramatic images in BW, like Salgado shooting the Bombing of Hiroshima. 

Instead, the opportunity was wasted, the scenes shown, at least up to 2hrs 10, were just BW scenes. No visual Drama.

Sometimes the film would move back in time, to earlier years, but with no date on screen, and then flick to a BW scene and then back to the present day. Confusing.

I don't think Nolan has bested The Dark Knight, and I enjoyed The Prestige more than Oppenheimer. 
I never really forgot that I was watching a movie, a Christopher Nolan Movie.

I do recommend the documentary, Trinity and Beyond, which really carries the Horror of the Nuclear arms race. 

I no longer trust RT reviews, my guess is studios are paying review farms to pump up numbers, even RT marks films fresh when the text is certainly critical.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 31, 2023","I couldn't write this review upon watching the film immediately because my brain still didn't recover from the experience I've had with it.

I was really excited and so were everyone else before it was released, Christopher Nolan as director, the trailers, images and everything in production related to the film was huge and especially the casting members.

I've never had a feeling in the cinema like the one I had after the ending hit and the credits rolled since maybe the Joker back in 2019, emotions were everywhere.

This film tackles the story of one of the most important events in our history and the person behind all of it ""J. Robert Oppenheimer"", the father of the atomic bomb.

It's a 3 hour journey full of non-stop and engaging dialogue that'll keep you focused and wondering in some of it trying to decipher what it means, a lot of figures of history and character names are mentioned and the interactions and relationships between them unfold.

Cillian Murphy fully deserves the oscar award for best lead actor 100%, especially when it comes to the emotions in his eyes, you can clearly distinguish between different emotions in his face just by the face and eye shots that Christopher Nolan likes to do.

The soundtrack and music are definitely second main protagonist after Cillian Murphy, they were some of the best I've heard in years, the way they blend in with the scenes creating astonishing scenes that give unimaginable feelings and goosebumps, It definitely carried the film in many times.

The direction choices and editing in most of the scenes are out of this world and amazing.

The rest of the cast were really amazing and it's hard to list each and everyone of them as they are a lot, but they were all up to par and amazing.

Experiencing this on the biggest IMAX screen with a 7 star service made it 100 times better.

If you ever had any doubt about what cinema is and what it could be, this film is it.

I've never given a film a full rating before because no piece of entertainment can be perfect, but I'll be honored to give my first one to Oppenheimer as I've seen nothing that would make this film experience less than that, and if there were any, it's VERY VERY minor.",POSITIVE

The actors, the script, the pace was great; however, the only negative I have for this movie is it could have done without the sex scenes. I am not a prude in any way, but these scenes were totally useless, and had no real bearing on the story telling.... In all honesty, it really seemed like just gratuitous sex to just tick a box for an r-rated movie. But it truly could have done without them.

"Jul 31, 2023","The movie was overall the best movie I've seen in ages! The only thing that I didn't like was that there were 2 extended scenes of completely unnecessary nudity. The nudity did not add to the story line, they could have gotten the story line across without it, BUT‚Ä¶ the story was great! The acting was amazing! The cinematography was astounding!",POSITIVE
"Jul 31, 2023",Historical Masterpiece üòé,POSITIVE
"Jul 31, 2023","The visuals were so crisp and stunning, the sound was powerful and immersive. While the movie was 3hrs long, it was paced very well, never a dull moment.",POSITIVE
"Jul 31, 2023","Overall, an interesting approach to the development of Atomic Bomb and the US race with the Manhattan Project. The storyline is fairly good although the Director seemed to create distrust in the US Government response to war and the deep sentiment that Americans had against the Japanese who were relentless in their attacks in the the Pacific. There were a lot of truths and half truths raised about Oppenheimer and his loyalty to the US and eventually being denied a security clearance.  I did not care for the blatant sex scenes and nudity that left nothing to the imagination. His relationship could have been brought out without exposing so much nudity. It really didn‚Äôt add anything to the story. The ending is  quite dramatic in demonstrating some justice to the political persecution that Oppenheimer faced. The acting overall and special effects were excellent.",POSITIVE
"Jul 31, 2023","Phenomenal soundtrack, great acting, and superb writing. Just felt it could've been told in 2hrs instead of 3. And more footage of the devastation.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 31, 2023","The story was extremely whitewashed. Doesn't mention any of the indigenous people killed at Los Alamos. In fact, it seems like a deliberate attempt to erase their stories to paint Oppenheimer with sympathy. Nolan tries to paint his image with complexity, forcing the audience to play judge, jury, and executioner‚Äîdeciding whether or not there is any morality behind Oppenheimer or the American government. However in doing so, he doesn't actually show anything from Nagasaki or Hiroshima. Not a single Japanese actor or person is ever shown in the film. Of course, there's also the common Nolan problem where the women are props and just inexplicably crazy without giving them the justice of explanation or depth. Nolan has this problem where he writes women but not characters. 

If you want to watch a movie where it makes the deaths of 200,000 real people revolve instead around an ego battle between two white men, then watch Oppenheimer. If you want to watch a movie that has a frantic pace yet still manages to be boring through useless dialogue, then watch Oppenheimer. If you want to a watch a movie that forces you to remember useless background characters mentioned once 45 minutes ago, then watch Oppenheimer. If you want to leave the movie feeling bereft and grieving possible potential, then watch Oppenheimer.

Oppenheimer could've been about a man who was so blinded by his own hubris and compulsive need for progress, that he disregarded the lives of people he viewed as playthings. In some part, it was, but never enough to be satisfying or make much sense. The movie wants you to root for Oppenheimer. I refuse to.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 31, 2023",Una verdadera obra maestra junto a Spiderman podr√≠amos hablar de la pel√≠cula del a√±o. Cillian y Robert est√°n impresionantes. Ahora mismo cillian podr√≠a ser el mejor actor del mundo a mi opini√≥n. Totalmente recomendada y las tres horas se hacen cortas.,POSITIVE

"Jul 31, 2023","Just okay.   Bad audio made it difficult to hear in many sections, timeline was hard to follow, and there were way too many characters to keep track of.  Historical perspective was interesting but in hindsight, I wish I had waited to see it at home with closed captioning.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 31, 2023","An excellent biopic put together in traditional Nolan style, falls off at times (also in traditional Nolan style) mainly due to some of the overarching subplots that don't necessarily need to be there. That said, they don't divert the attention from the main events or make the scenes themselves uncompelling to watch, they just feel out of place. Ultimately, it is an incredible spectacle that tells a complex story about an even more complex man, in ways that make one deeply appreciate the sheer amount of creativity and intuitivness Nolan pours into his works.",POSITIVE
"Jul 31, 2023","Loved the movie overall, excellent cinematography. Only thing I dislike was the sound being too loud.",POSITIVE
"Jul 31, 2023","This is one of the best movies, probably the best, in the past few years. While many complain about the lengthy run-time, it is necessary for the plot and the beauty of this movie. The morals in this movie make you contemplate your own morals.",POSITIVE

"Jul 31, 2023","I'm a huge history buff and movie buff. Combine them both and I am an eager beaver, especially with Christopher Nolan directing it. 

1920s - 1960s. Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer is a brilliant scientist as he prepares to testify before the US Atomic Energy Commission. Rear Admiral Lewis L. Stauss is a government employee as he prepares to testify before Congress. In the years of these men meeting each other and preparing their fate before two US government agencies, the history of science and politics comes to a head when the specter of the Second World War emerges. Allied physicists begin work on the Manhattan Project, the US atomic weapon program as the multitude of scientists, soldiers, and policymakers do not just work on a project that affects the war but also the post-war world. Strauss and Oppenheimer butt heads as the successes of the Manhattan Project incur controversies that end in both men enduring disgrace.
This was a phenomenal movie that just screamed success from the moment of the first trailer to the first box office numbers. Christopher Nolan's previous successes made it clear that this man is a hardworking talent, and this was a guaranteed success. I am critical of how he tells the story, but the acting and the respect for history were splendid. The cast was amazing with Murphy, Downey, Damon, Blunt, Pugh, and the rest. The effects, or I should say THE effect was marvelous. This is a movie that makes you think but at the same time can enforce your opinions over the controversy that came from the creation of the atomic bomb. But this is a great film and worthy of praise.",POSITIVE
"Jul 31, 2023","I heavily disliked this movie in the aspect that Nolan nit-picked pieces of history to put into the film. He completely brushed over the logistics of the Trinity Testing to ""an Indian burial site"" when it was actually a whole town of Indigenous peoples. It was little quips like these and the complete whitewashing of what happened that disappointed me. I thought this movie could have had a positive impact on the fact that it could bring light to certain topics that aren't brought up in the mainstream media that are important since it's such a big film, but Nolan was NOT up for the task.  Although I do understand it's supposed to be Oppenheimer's story, the creative freedom Nolan directed was distasteful at best and harmful at worst.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 31, 2023",Masterpiece! Must watch in IMAX or Dolby to get the immersive experience that Nolan takes you through.,POSITIVE
"Jul 31, 2023",The story was good but all over the place and the sex scenes were so not needed,NEGATIVE

"Jul 30, 2023","The best movie since Parasite by a country mile, perhaps even better. One of the best films of the 21th century, and one of the finest pictures I have ever watched. Everything from the acting, screenplay, and the visuals were to perfection. The filmed juggled so much and yet it all blended in perfectly. Probably Nolan's best work, in my opinion.",POSITIVE
"Jul 30, 2023",Way too long. Boring at times. Way too much in the story. Should have stopped several times but kept going. Very painful to sit though!,NEGATIVE
"Jul 30, 2023","Great movie, but the background music crowded out the dialogue early-on.  Otherwise a good movie with plot, historical significance and meaning.",POSITIVE
"Jul 30, 2023","Overly wrought. Poorly paced. Badly directed and edited. The script feels like satire. Cillian Murphy is phenomenal and so are the wardrobe and cinematography, but that's it. 

I am a Nolan fan but this was a huge miss. Zero depth or development, just one frantic pace that ends up a boring and exhausting experience. I guess even Nolan is human after all.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 30, 2023","Oppenheimer has the greatest acting and storytelling I have ever seen. Oppenheimer is not a movie it is an experience. When you sit down to watch Oppenheimer it leaves a long lasting impression on you. Moreover it is one of those things that when you finish watching you feel like an entirely different person. If I was to describe Oppenheimer I would say ""It is the most beautiful experiences that your eyes and brain can register."" Needless to say it is a must watch my only problem with Oppenheimer is that I wish it was longer.",POSITIVE
"Jul 30, 2023",Kept my attention all 3 hrs. Fast paced and will probably go back to see what I missed.,POSITIVE

"Jul 30, 2023","Yes, it's good. It's not boring, and wasn't too long. But if there was ever a movie that needed subtitles OH MY GOD this is it. The score was so loud at times I wanted to jump in the movie so I could hear what the hell they were saying. One scene was worthy of a large screen‚Äîguess what scene that is. This is really not a big screen movie since it's 99% smart people with accents talking.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 30, 2023",Acting was outstanding. And the story is incredibly compelling,POSITIVE

"Jul 30, 2023","this is the second time we've seen Oppenheimer.
The first time was not in IMAX.
The movie itself is obviously amazing, because it was our second time.  as much as I like the IMAX theater the sound was 10 decibels too high.
this movie is so close to perfect historically perfect, that I encourage every American to see this.",POSITIVE
"Jul 30, 2023","It's exceptional in every respect:  direction, cinematography, acting, sound design, editing.  It's historically accurate and scarily anticipates today's world.  This is how our nuclear troubles began.  It's up to us from here on out.

Cillian Murphy gives one of the best lead performances ever.  Robert Downey, Jr. is superb in support.  The rest of the cast never strike a false note.  The look and feel of the whole endeavor mark a turning point in the making of biopics.  Nolan's steady guidance of the project does indeed make movie history.

My review is here: https://moviestruck.substack.com/p/oppenheimer-2023",POSITIVE
"Jul 30, 2023",Will probably like this more when i can watch at home - since it's just dialogue 95% of the movie it didn't really need to be seen on the big screen. Was long and couldn't hear what people were saying every once in a while so that took me out of it,NEUTRAL
"Jul 30, 2023","So yeah, who knew that director Christopher Nolan's newest film 'Oppenheimer' was the Summer blockbuster we all needed?! It's hands down, the best film of the year for me, so far! Like a lot of the director's film's, it may require multiple viewings! A-",POSITIVE

"Jul 30, 2023","Powerful and thought provoking with an ensemble cast that enhances each performance like a link in a chain building up to an explosive end.  Oscar worthy performances, in fact I predict lead Cillian Murphy for best actor, Robert Downey, Jr. best supporting actor, Florence Pugh (just edging past Emily Blunt) best supporting actress.  I left the theatre feeling much like I had just gotten off a rollercoaster ride, thrilled, scared, excited, alive all the while planning to do it again.",POSITIVE

"Jul 30, 2023",Excellent movie. Felt a tiny bit long but worth it.,POSITIVE
"Jul 30, 2023",Atrociously written. The story is disjointed and suffers a bizarre left turn in the final hour which focuses on characters that the audience has had absolutely no time in which to connect. I can't believe that technical filmmaking can blind critics to the most important element of any film - the script,NEGATIVE
"Jul 30, 2023","Long, boring, all over the place, basically a snooze fest. Christopher Nolan must be paying people for good reviews because no way this should be in the 90s üëé",NEGATIVE

"Jul 30, 2023","That's 3 hours of my life I'll never get back! The sound was awful, I couldn't hear any of the dialogue in the first hour as the actors were mumbling and the music was playing constantly in the background which was driving me mad and strangly making me angry. As the film progressed the music got more intense, at one point it was someone scratching a repetitive noise on a violin - it was torture. Several couples walked out of the cinema before the end and I wanted to join them but my other half was enjoying it so I had to ride it out and fight the urge to fall asleep. Lots of people will love this film and it will probably pick up many awards I'm sure but for me it was a thumbs down.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 30, 2023","Powerful, entertaining, awe-inspiring. Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor/Actress, Best Sound - and the list goes on. (My audience was actually laughing at the 'Coming Attractions' because they are on the opposite end of the spectrum from 'Oppenheimer'. Do these idiots at WB, Disney, et al, not realize that what they're producing is total crap-ola?) My biggest surprise was Robert Downey, Jr. I can only imagine what goes through an actor's mind when they realize and understand that they're playing the role of a lifetime. Emily Blunt was spot-on and certainly worthy of a nomination. Chris Nolan is a master of film-making. R J Oppenheimer as an everyman is portrayed with thoughtfulness and honesty by Cillian Murphy. If there's only one movie you see this year, ....",POSITIVE

"Jul 30, 2023","It is not for everyone. This is not a movie like interstellar or inception. Not action packed, not fast-paced. This is a nearly perfect documentary that tells the story of Oppenheimer in a way i did not think was possible. The ending left me baffled, and the soundtrack was one of the bests I've heard so far. This movie is not for all, but if it is for you, i can assure you that you will get out of the theatre, get home, go to bed, and you will still be thinking about what you just experienced. 10/10",POSITIVE

"Jul 30, 2023","The experience was worth the length, it keeps you captivated with everything unfolding, especially around the bomb. It also demonstrates the effects the bomb had on the people who worked on it, it was practically perfection with everything connected. It serves as a reminder that it was not merely words in history books, that the terrible things truly took place and many people suffered and died. Even with the subject, I would watch it again. An experience that shouldn't be missed.",POSITIVE
"Jul 30, 2023",I want to learn more about Oppenheimer after watching this movie. I enjoyed it and didn‚Äôt feel the 3 hours. Definitely wanted to see more like the construction of the atomic bomb but overall it was great. I love how CN did some scenes with two different meanings. Must see.,POSITIVE

"Jul 30, 2023","Amazing performances from Robert Downey, Jr. and Cillian Murphy.

"Jul 30, 2023",This is a must see. I was going in there wondering if I was going to watch a 3h movie that should have been 2h. Not at all. The story unfolds at a good pace. I love the ethical issues raised in the film. Loved it! 10/10 would recommend!,POSITIVE
"Jul 30, 2023",Timely and important. Spoiler alert‚Ä¶.Oppenheimer's reputation was sullied by vindictive individuals who used the political chaos (Red Scare) of the time to frame and punish him for his beliefs.,POSITIVE

"Jul 30, 2023",Very disappointed. Boring as hell. Very difficult to hear most of the dialogue because the score was way too loud over the top of it. Maybe it was just the sound mixing in the particular iMAX theatre we saw it in. Fell asleep several times and I wasn't even tired. Confusing timeline with way too much dull exposition.

"Jul 30, 2023","I'm a fan of Nolan and with all the hype I was excited to see this movie. The sound quality was really poor from the start making it difficult to engage with the dialogue. The constant score - the always excellent Ludwig Goransson was too much (and yes I get the aim of why he did this), again it made it difficult to engage. Far too long (kept falling asleep) in the last half hour. As for Nolan's love of giving  Kenneth Brannagh a part in his films and letting him do accents please make it stop.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 30, 2023","This is a definitive work for our current era of film. A blockbuster that uses absolutely fundamental techniques in filmmaking to completely subvert audience conditioning and expectations.

The centerpiece is not the concrete but the abstract, and reveals are about philosophical points, not plot.",POSITIVE
"Jul 30, 2023",Been waiting for the story to explain why and how the decision was made to create the atom bomb since I was 14 years old and read Hiroshima bombing short stories in high school.

"Jul 30, 2023",I've never left a movie review before now but I felt compelled after seeing this masterpiece twice and being on the edge of my seat both times. This movie deserves all the awards that I hope it gets. It's a completely fresh new way to show a biopic and told one of the most important stories in the history of the world in a beautiful and gripping way. If you wait to stream this later you will regret not seeing it in theaters.,POSITIVE
"Jul 30, 2023","This film made feel absolutely terrified of the capabilities of mankind. That out of fear, we created the means to destroy ourselves. I highly recommend it! It portrays not the film genre of horror, but real life horror!",POSITIVE
"Jul 30, 2023","What should have been a very interesting movie about the atomic bomb and the man who made it possible, was a very, very, slow, unmemorable story, with no clear point to it. Visually, the movie itself is beautiful, but the dull nature of the story leaves me wondering why such a star studded cast was needed for it.

 As it went on, I found myself waiting for it to be over, and when it finally did, I was surprised, as the moment seemed like it had been a spontaneous decision, as if someone in production said 'Don't you think we've dragged this movie on for a bit too long?'. A good question! 3 hours long, and what for? It is filled with pointless information and extremely long scenes inside interrogation rooms and courts as if nobody has anything better to do. There are only a couple of genuinely interesting moments in the movie, but that must make up only a very small share of the length.

I would not watch this again.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 30, 2023","It was very promising, but has a lot of flaws. The story isn‚Äôt very compelling once you get to the second half of the movie. There are nudes scenes (of course of one of the female actresses) that add absolutely nothing to the story. Aren‚Äôt we past that at this point? The dynamics with the senator/Oppenheimer aren‚Äôt well explained and become muddy. There are barely any female characters, and the ones that there are aren‚Äôt portrayed positively.

"Jul 30, 2023","""Oppenheimer"" is masterful filmmaking- the writing, production values, casting, editing, art direction/effects, cinematography, sound, and certainly the directing by Christopher Nolan. I see the reason for the raving from cast members for Murphy's becoming J. Robert Oppenheimer, particularly Downey, Jr.'s. But Downey himself gives a tremendous performance as a man embarrassed and haunted by it, to the point of a heinous assault on a great man's character.
Nolan's films are events, and I am in for all of them. It's to the point that it's almost difficult to be truly objective. Great actors and crew persons want (dream?) of being asked on to one of his projects. 
The visual work here from the images flashing across the screen, and Oppenheimer's mind, in the opening scene, to the Trinity test, put the viewer in the thoughts of the 'destroyer of worlds' and on the site at Las Alamos as our world was forever changed. The heightened breaths taken at the moment of explosion and reaction was a shrewd touch, as it was the most extreme reality laid bare.
I found no more than possibly one scene as excessive. The control of time and place we see and return to at points in the lives of those involved in this stretch of history is impeccable in the hands of such skilled professionals, but Nolan most of all. 
I've seen it twice now and find it is an exceptional addition to the cinematic canon. 4.4 stars",POSITIVE
"Jul 30, 2023",Definitely the best movie of the year!,POSITIVE
"Jul 30, 2023",Loved the sound design and the rhythm/pace of the movie. Definitely doesn't feel like a three hour movie.,POSITIVE
"Jul 30, 2023","I normally like Chris Nolan movies but I do wish this had longer than what seemed to be a 30 second scene in the first oh, hour, hour and a half of the movie.  Nothing seemed to be given TIME to emphasize significant - perhaps because it tried to jam everything in so much, but the first real scene that seemed to develop the focus of the movie (Oppenheimer) was the communist party and romance scenes.  I think if they hadn't jumped around soooo much in that first half of the movie and just combined 3x30 second scenes into 1, more could have been taken away; instead I felt like I got an hour long trailer and a two hour movie about the last half of the Manhattan project and a security clearance review with a pinned on political batt",NEGATIVE
"Jul 30, 2023","An absolute must see.
Keeping in mind that is biopic, it is long, full of events, characters, ideas, science and politics. 
It is a movies I believe is even more enjoyable if the audience is reasonably aware of the historical period, the war, the cold war, the role of the atomic weapons, etc. It is nonetheless approachable by everyone.
It is a movie that invites the audience to think, suggesting questions not easily (let alone comfortably) answered. 
It requires time to be digested, and like a good wine, it leaves a good taste long after having enjoyed it.",POSITIVE
"Jul 30, 2023",It was rlly good but not something I'll watch again maybe in like a year or two,POSITIVE
"Jul 30, 2023","Useless over complexifiction, too long. Disappointed",NEGATIVE
"Jul 30, 2023",This movie is a great film for anyone who don't know Oppenheimer or his story. The leading actors in this film deserve an oscar award. Such great performances by each of them but the one that stood out the most to me was Emily Blunt! Yes! Such a versatile & well rounded actress. She literally can play comedy as well as dramatic roles.,POSITIVE
"Jul 30, 2023","I'll start off by saying that the movie is beautifully acted and somewhat engaging in the beginning when it made the effort to tell the story. But quickly ascends to such a pace that your just flashing from scene to scene so quickly that you lose all understanding of what is going on and why they're doing it. Their is no explanation  of the characters motivations. The incredibly fascinating science behind what their doing is basically in favor nonsensical images of the quantum world. The horror of Hiroshima and Nagasaki is glanced over. The romances have no romance at all, they appear to just be around each other despite having no affection for each other. Despite starting a subplot about not being able to attend on his child, it's never followed up on. The final conflict is just a boring series of meetings with loud intense music that left me wondering why i should care about anything within that whole sequence.

 In short the whole film missed the entire point of the story (the science, the romance, the moral quandaries, the horror of hiroshima and nagasaki, the explanation of who the hell Oppenheimer was and why we should care) in lieu of loud noises surrounding a thoroughly historically unimportant and uninteresting clearance hearing. I left feeling like it was a waste of my time.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 30, 2023",Solid movie but I feel like it is over rated. It kept my attention and I did not feel the 3 hour run time. I would say unless you want to see it on the big screen or support theaters you could just wait to see this on streaming.,NEUTRAL
"Jul 30, 2023","Definitely felt like 3 hours.  Nolan really crammed as much information into every scene (which lasted about 15 seconds each).  Also, it was less about the bomb and more about the government's attempts to deny him security clearance after the fact.  Seriously.  A movie about security clearance.  Character development was confusing and fleeting, leading to a severe lack of connection to anybody on the screen.  If it weren't for the incredibly loud buildup and startle audio I would have slept through most of it.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 30, 2023","I liked the film and thought it was a very good film. Christopher Nolan once again proves his mastery of storytelling and soundtrack, creating a thought-provoking and visually stunning cinematic experience with a beautiful soundtrack. However, it is essential to note that this film might not appeal to everyone and is more suited for a specific audience.

Clocking in at around 3 hours, one might expect a daunting experience, but surprisingly, the time seemed to fly by. While my movie theatre, fortunately, did take a short movie break, the film's fast-paced nature kept me engrossed throughout. And at the right moments, the film was at a somewhat slow pace. Nolan has a unique way of weaving complex narratives that demand attention and concentration, making sure the audience is captivated throughout the entire duration.

One of the film's standout features is its non-chronological order. The film jumps between different timelines, allowing the audience to piece together the story's puzzle as it unfolds. This approach adds an extra layer of intrigue which kept me even more engaged, trying to connect the dots between the various events.

However, no film is without its flaws, and Oppenheimer has one notable mistake (it didn't affect the overall storyline however). During a scene in Leiden in the Netherlands, the characters were meant to be speaking Dutch, but instead, they spoke German. I am not sure how this is in the end result, definitely with a Dutch cameraman who filmed this movie who would definitely take notice of this flaw.

Oppenheimer is a remarkable film that delves into complex themes and historical events, making it ideal for history enthusiasts and fans of intellectually stimulating cinema. With its mesmerizing storytelling, it may not be universally appealing, but for those willing to embrace its intricacies, it offers an unforgettable and satisfying cinematic experience.",POSITIVE

"Jul 30, 2023","Wonderful directing, writing, and acting all around. Nolan did a wonderful job in his storytelling way. All the high profile actors did not dominated over one another in their performance, but actually complimented each other.  I have read book the American Prometheus, which majority of the information derived from. I loved Nolan touched on some important parts of the book, but there is still important information you can get from the book.  Nolan proved CGI doesn't make an impactful film in storytelling. This movie is a masterpiece towards bring back the traditional methods of filmmaking and storytelling.",POSITIVE
"Jul 30, 2023","Movies like this is why there's a writers strike, because the entire Hollywood making movie apparatus is failing. This movie should've been a crisp two hours, the final 60 minutes are an interminable slog of Aaron Sorkin West Wing-esque allegedly compelling dialogue that is utterly wooden and un-compelling. What on earth was Robert Downey Jr's character and make up? Why is a congressional hearing the climax of the movie? Why are there so so many featured characters? 

I see reviewers running over each other to praise this film and honestly it makes me happy there's an actor and writers strike. The many Oppenheimer/atom bomb documentaries cover the bases here, this movie was unnecessary. Hopefully on the other end of this strike we get more compelling movies that have a greater purpose than providing an opportunity for Nolan's grandiose purposeless fare",NEGATIVE

"Jul 30, 2023",I have watch the movie three times at time of writing. This is very likely Nolan's greatest achievement. I shed tears throughout the movie. The mark of a great movie is when you forget that this is not live footage from the time. These are talented actors that inhabit the spirit of the individual they are playing. The run time is often used as a crutch to wave negatively at the film. I my case I never once looked for the time. Every actor and actress acted their asses off. Perfection through and through. The highlight was the last few minutes of the film. Thoroughly enjoyable.,POSITIVE
"Jul 30, 2023","A great movie. Only complaint is that the beginning of the story is fast-paced & the wider storyline is difficult to follow & make sense of, but everything else more than makes up for it. The bomb scene, although underwhelming, tells a great story and for that, deserves 5 stars.",POSITIVE
"Jul 30, 2023","A must watch! This is a brilliantly made film by Christopher Nolan, who also wrote a terrific script that the talented cast enjoy with excellent performances. Particular praise goes to Cillian Murphy, who in completely embracing the titular role gives a powerfully evocative insight into an enigmatic individual whose intelligence, success and failings provide for an enthralling film, elevated by an absorbing audio visual IMAX experience that rewards the trip to the cinema.",POSITIVE

"Jul 30, 2023","H√° um fato: voc√™ n√£o vai sentir as 3 horas de filme passarem, muito embora essa seja uma tarefa dif√≠cil para um filme biogr√°fico.

A vida de Oppenheimer n√£o √© muito emocionante. Um g√™nio de seu tempo, desenvolveu interesses por muitas √°reas do conhecimento, mas foi na f√≠sica que encontrou seu lugar de destaque.

O resto √© hist√≥ria. A maneira como ela √© contada √© que importa. Como √© caracter√≠stica de Nolan, h√° duas linhas temporais que permeiam o filme. Recortes do que acontece no futuro para explicar o passado. Do final para o come√ßo. Isso exige um certo foco do telespectador, o que, talvez, tenha tornado o filme t√£o cativante por 3 horas. Isto porque o cl√≠max, que √© a explos√£o da bomba, n√£o surpreende muito. Na realidade, decepciona. 

Todos n√≥s j√° vimos uma foto ou um v√≠deo da explos√£o de uma bomba at√¥mica. √â fato que seria algo criminoso reproduzi-la, para um filme, no mundo real. No entanto, a op√ß√£o do diretor por abandonar o CGI e optar por uma grande explos√£o de uma bomba convencional, acabou por tirar o toque real√≠stico que tanto almejava.

"Jul 30, 2023","Not as good as it could have been. There are a lot of sequences that were dull. Although Cillian and Robert Downey were exceptional, the other star studded cast faded into the background. Richard Feynmann for example, who played a pivotal part in the Manhattan project, wasn't even mentioned by name once. He was just seen playing the Bonjo and had 3 lines of dialogue.

It overshadowed the message of the movie. Had you lived in those days your neighbors could accuse you of being a communist and you'd be deported having to proof you were not.

"Jul 30, 2023","Personally one of my favourite movies of all time. The film may be 3 hours long, but for me there was not a dull moment, and everything that happened was done in a way that made it exciting. Christopher Nolan has made yet another great film, and seeing Cillian Murphy in a lead role executed perfectly, if not before, now has certainly cemented him as one of the all time greats. 

Seeing Robert Downey Jr. in something else than a superhero/comedy movie was refreshing and again shows his depth as an actor. 

All of the cast both infront and behind the camera did a tremendous job at telling a story very few know the full context of. It is informative and exciting for viewers with little understanding of what role Oppenheimer and the rest of the manhattan project had during World War ll.

I expected an exciting tale that was full of inspiration and accomplishment fueled with American history. I got literally none of that from this movie. The movie was 10% about the history of the bomb and 90% about politically charged proceedings that occurred. In addition, this movie was incredibly confusing with way too much dialogue and little action. The only slightly exciting part was the scene of the bomb test, and even that was depressingly lacking. This movie was also WAY too long. 3+ hours of conversations and scenes of court proceedings and attempted accusations is not a good way to make a movie. This absolutely a one time see movie.

"Jul 30, 2023","Being one of the most highly anticipated films of the year, by the time of writing, Oppenheimer will have been reviewed by pretty much everyone. This review will likely add nothing nuanced or new to the discussion but will serve only as a vessel for this writer to shout from the rooftops about the utter brilliance of this film. 

As we are all by now aware, the film follows the history-defining life of the American physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, his path to create the atomic bomb, and the fallout for the world and Oppenheimer from its creation. This is all set out before us in an impressive run time off three hours. There was the chance therefore that Oppenheimer could have easily run out steam. It is however paced to perfection with you longing for the credits to never start rolling which is a stunning achievement in and of itself. But good pacing alone does not make a great film. So many aspects feed into building this into the spectacle that it is (you could say each being like a marble in a glass bowl).

To start with, no one drops the ball with incredible performances being delivered across the board. Cillian Murphy immerses himself in the role of Oppenheimer to deliver an in-depth look at what the weight of creating such a destructive force does to the human mind and conscience. The scene in the Los Alomos gym, as well as being emotionally draining for the viewer, allows Murphy to fully encapsulate the crushing moral weight of his actions in the face of the perceived success of the Manhattan Project and the ‚Äòwinning' of the Second World War. As well as this, Emily Blunt plays the emotional range of Kitty Oppenheimer to perfection. The interview scene between Kitty and special counsel Roger Robb (played by Jason Clarke who needs to be heaped with praise for his role also) is the climax to this and is alone an Oscar worthy performance. That's not to mention Robert Downey Jr who excels at making you loathe the politically deviant and self-absorbed Lewis Strauss. We will leave it there for individual acting, but it is a rarity that such a stacked a-list cast gives uniformly brilliant performances as we experience here. 

The Trinity Test was the horrifyingly beautiful sight that we all expected it to be and was the peak of some astounding visual effects.  To do it all without CGI is a cinematic feat and shows it can be done strikingly well without a reliance on computer generated special effects and could signal a change in attitude towards the level of its use in future films. 

To go back to the Trinity Test scene, what intensified the tense build is G√∂ransson's accompanying score. The score does this incredibly well throughout and peaks with the final exchange between Oppenheimer and Albert Einstein giving the already poignant words a dizzying level of impact. 

What's missing from Oppenheimer does also need to be discussed. Not once does Nolan rely on imagery directly from Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Take for instance the scene where Oppenheimer is viewing a presentation about the fallout of the dropping of the atomic bombs on Japan. The camera is pointed directly at Oppenheimer and the surrounding audience with the images being completely out of shot. The reactions from the audience do enough to portray the abject horror of the events without having to rely on upsetting imagery to bring home the point. Nolan should be praised for this directorial decision. 

The set design and settings had the same attention to detail that the rest of the film boasts. The blackness of the atomic bomb made you feel like you were looking directly into the heart of darkness itself. The stunning New Mexico landscape also punctuates the evilness of the events that unfolded within it and offers an interesting juxtaposition as to how something so naturally beautiful could be the birthplace of something so truly ugly. It's only accentuated by the deployment of 70mm Imax film which we know Nolan has worked to showcase and bring into more mainstream use. 

IMAX is also employed exceptionally to capture prolonged close-up shots that allows the audience to feel they are face-to-face with the characters and to drink in the emotion they are exuding. This is prominent from the first scene where we are presented with a young and troubled Oppenheimer standing in the rain struggling with the boundaries that youth and inexperience bring to untapped genius. This is also seen through the wisdom and concern that Tom Conti is able to portray in his role as Albert Einstein in the intimate and emotionally deep discussions between his character and Oppenheimer.     

Overall, Oppenheimer is an astoundingly complete cinematic study of morality. Every single aspect of the film delivers, leaving you emotionally drained yet enamoured by what you've witnessed. This is without doubt the best film of the year and possibly even the decade. Others will come close to reaching the dizzying cinematic heights and might have better commercial success, but Oppenheimer will stand strong as technically the best. For the minority who just see this as a film with people talking about an atomic bomb, it's okay, brilliant cinema isn't for everyone.",POSITIVE
"Jul 30, 2023",Theory will only take you so far,POSITIVE
"Jul 30, 2023","Movie is more about the character study of the Oppenheimer rather than depiction of War or nuclear bomb blast.
How politicians misuse scientists at the time of crisis is indeed shown with so much details and depth.

Nudity could have been avoided but still it might have been used as a statement.

Out of 3 hours, you MAYBE get 5 min regarding the ""trinity test"" and even THAT is a let down....so disappointed!!  Would have loved a movie more about the process of making the atomic bomb with SOME background on Oppenheimer.  Watching him sit and talk to a naked lady....not my idea of great work.  Please do not waste your money/time on this movie...it's not even a rental.

"Jul 30, 2023","An epic biographic journey complimented by its ambitious cast and production. ""Oppenheimer"" powers through its 3-hour runtime with exceptional pacing, earning every minute as it unpacks and examines the multitude of social, scientific and political forces that weigh on the titular figure in the roles of husband, father, scientist and, in particular, an American. The narrative never pontificates any particular view of the man himself, and actually invites the audience, given a faithful telling of the facts, to weight the unprecedented stakes against uncertain morality for themselves, albeit in retrospect. Special note must be taken to appreciate Nolan's respect for his audience by not imposing on them, presenting the life of a historic figure with subtle humanity, but never manipulatively. As with his love of analogue filmmaking, Nolan stays loyal to practical effects, achieving remarkable results through masterful editing of sight and sound. An experience worthy of the cinema!",POSITIVE
"Jul 30, 2023","A must see for several reasons: use of audio, editing, filming, storytelling (in writing and visual edit) and acting. Next the moral dilemmas and ethical conflicts being portrayed. Oppenheimer is historically 90pct correct, switching up certain things a little bit, but leaving the message of the true events and ramifications intact.
A movie to be experienced in a theatre for sure, but if you can't - do watch when it comes out later as well.

"Jul 30, 2023","Boring and confusing.
Half of the people were not identified and the film was about Oppenheimer's trial and the theoretical and testing of the atomic bomb.  There was one test explosion and that was the only excitement in this film.
The rest of it was mumbling and pained expressions.
It could have been a lot better by showing the Hiroshima explosion to portray the devastating effects of these scientists' bomb to the audience but the scientists heard about Hiroshima on the radio.
The film goes back and forth from the trial to the building of the bomb but then Strauss' story is thrown in and this part is filmed in black and white for some bizarre reason.
As we walked out people were saying how bad it was and how boring it was.
2 hours would have been enough.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 30, 2023","Oppenheimer was a refreshingly in-depth exploration of an inherently complex man and an even more complex story - which undoubtedly changed the course of humanity as we know it.
For that reason, I - and seemingly many others, have been willing to sit for three hours, in IMAX theatres, to watch the journey of J. Robert. Oppenheimer.

I will admit that I came into the viewing experience with a working knowledge of Oppenheimer, the Manhattan Project, and American Politics more generally - notably as a non-American myself.
Regardless, this hefty movie never felt stale or poorly paced, and I appreciated the flexibility of the movie to change scenes spontaneously throughout.

The performances matched the cinematography - with so many A-list actors working harmoniously to develop the story for Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer.
I would personally express my respect for Robert Downey Junior's performance as Lewis Strauss. One of the best supporting performances I have ever seen.

As I mentioned above, the film is complex, quickly paced, and requires you to have a working knowledge of the film's context - or a very open mind. I appreciate this isn't for everyone, but this style of film is not released every day.
Oppenheimer is a rare find in modern cinema, and I would highly recommend you view it on the big screen whilst you still can.",POSITIVE
"Jul 30, 2023","The acting was great, the cast did their very best but the film was boring.

The movie is essentially about a trial to reinstate Oppenheimer's security clearance and goes back in time to when the atomic bomb was built and tested.
There is one big bang when they tested it but that's the only action in the film.

I appreciate this is a biopic about Oppenheimer not an action movie but there wasn't a lot to keep us interested in watching.

Considering the great critic reviews and hype about this movie, we expected a lot more than people mumbling and staring into space.

The film was shot in colour and black and white but it didn't seem obvious as to why.  It wasn't for a timeline reason but seemed to be just for Lewis Strauss' story.  But the film is called Oppenheimer not Strauss?!

Einstein being played by a man with Italian not German heritage was a poor move too.
People did leave the cinema before the end 
and I completely understand why.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 30, 2023","Typical Nolan : intelligent yet accessible movie for grown-ups.
Try to see it in a theater with celluloid instead of digital : I saw it in Paris on a 70mm print and it was a marvel for the eyes.",POSITIVE

"Jul 30, 2023","Def so many fake 5-star reviews here. The movie was just awful - I wanted to walk out within an hour. I kept thinking about how the movie could be made better. The depiction of Oppenheimer was flat and lacked depth, and the storyline very long and and drawn out with very little by way of entertainment or substance. The only slightly engaging part of the movie happens during the last 20-30 mins, but wasn't worth sitting thru to get there.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 30, 2023","I appreciate all the intelligent things about this, and understand its a good movie. However, my real emotional reaction while watching it was one of disinterest and boredom. I stopped paying attention, and therefore in the last quarter, when I was more interested, I couldn‚Äôt follow it. I‚Äôm OK with that.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 30, 2023",Christopher Nolan did it again,POSITIVE
"Jul 30, 2023","Never knew the details behind The Manhattan Project. Scientists have been and will always be slaves to the military so Oppenheimer‚Äôs demise was not a surprise. On the other hand, it is a matter of survival as long as there are Hitlers and Putins. Better them than us.",POSITIVE
"Jul 30, 2023","Such an amazing film! It was so intense and immersive, I was on the edge my seat the whole movie. The scenery and soundtrack were phenomenal. The actors were spectacular!! Definitely a must see! One of my favorite movies of 2023!!",POSITIVE
"Jul 30, 2023","Difficult to follow too much terminology, couldn't hear some of what is said diction is not clear enough, the action parts of it the actual Testing wasn't until 2/3 of the way into it. I imagined that they would test along the way but wasn't the case. Disappointed to be honest, it may suit others but not all.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 30, 2023","I didn't know what to expect from this film. I am a huge Christopher Nolan fan and was waiting for this movie for well over 2 years, and as such avoided most of the trailers to try and avoid giving anything away. After watching it though‚Ä¶ holy cow. I loved everything about this movie,  the cast, acting, cinematography, sound, SFX. My one and only critique about this film after my first viewing was the story. I know it's based off a book (can't remember it's title) however I found it odd that this entire masterpiece's climax rests on the security clearance hearings of Oppenheimer and the (imo) juvenile grudge held by Strauss, even though RDJ absolutely crushed that role. All in all I will definitely add this to the Chris Nolan hits catalogue and I recommend you give it a watch, especially in IMAX!!",POSITIVE

"Jul 30, 2023","Boo. I felt Oppenheimer was directionless, emotionless, and a poorly structured mess. It was about as emotionally engaging as a quantum physics audiobook at 3x speed while the Benny Hill theme plays to a revolving door of characters in congressional hearings. Characters (especially the women) sketched like stick figures. Nolan: you lost me for good.",NEGATIVE

The juxtaposition of scientists, with this almost childlike curiosity of this new toy they could explore the workings of, and the realisation of the absolute horror of their creation dawning upon them. Extremely fast paced, fantastically layered and just an amazing experience to watch the biggest names of the scientific World in action. We've read about these people and their work, but to see them portrayed as something beyond just text in a book was breathtaking. Nolan portrayed it all so masterfully, as always.

"Jul 30, 2023","Oppenheimer √© um filme que hipnotiza seus telespectadores, com um roteiro bem encaixado contendo bons di√°logos. Percebe-se o amadurecimento de Nolan nesse novo longa, recheado de efeitos sonoros e visuais fant√°sticos, sem contar a trilha sonora composta por Ludwig G√∂ransson que mais uma vez ajuda Nolan a nos impactar ainda mais com suas m√∫sicas. Os enquadramentos foram os melhores  da carreira do diretor, com belas decupagens, fora o cuidado que teve com os atores dessa vez, coisa que em seus filmes anteriores √© f√°cil reparar que nem sempre o diretor tira o m√°ximo dos seus atores, ou at√© mesmo n√£o coloca um plano mais pr√≥ximo do rosto dos atores, para pegar suas express√µes, vemos isso bastante em Oppenheimer fora o desfoque de fundo, fazendo com que n√≥s os telespectadores s√≥ conseguimos olhar para o personagem em quest√£o. Cillian Murphy foi excelente, assim como todo elenco. Pela primeira vez Christopher tem cenas de nudez expl√≠cita em sua pel√≠cula, o que n√£o incomoda de certa forma, somente se for pensar em um take que em minha vis√£o poderia ter sido substitu√≠do por n√£o achar necess√°rio, o jeito que Nolan colocou os atores como vieram ao mundo daquela forma s√≥ me fez pensar em algo constrangedor; que eu acredito ser proposital de acordo com o contexto da cena, estou dizendo da cena do quarto n√£o da primeira, mas da segunda em que os atores est√£o sentados em duas poltronas de frente um para o outro. O filme te prende do in√≠cio ao fim no personagem de Murphy numa hist√≥ria ""corrida"", din√¢mica, sem falar da explos√£o da bomba que √© uma cena bel√≠ssima mas tamb√©m assustadora. Christopher Nolan se superou nesse filme, isso mostra que o diretor aprende com os erros, e consegue sempre nos surpreender. √â meu filme favorito do diretor, j√° que gosto mais de filmes digamos mais 'p√© no ch√£o' e obviamente na minha vis√£o esse foi o filme mais 'p√© no ch√£o' do diretor, focando na hist√≥ria, n√£o precisando explicar sobre as teorias da f√≠sica que s√£o vistas no filme e nem sobre os personagens hist√≥ricos, somente focando na pessoa Robert e mostrando o porqu√™ dele ser conhecido hoje como o ""pai da bomba at√¥mica"" focando na express√£o dos atores e as vezes desfocando tudo ao seu redor, deixando um pouco de lado suas ideias mais mirabolantes e indo para uma hist√≥ria real com um tema j√° conhecido na ind√∫stria do cinema e um personagem importante para a √©poca. Oppenheimer √© intrigante, fant√°stico, impactante, emocionante e sem d√∫vida nenhuma uma obra de arte.",POSITIVE

"Jul 30, 2023","Genuinely confused by all of the perfect score reviews here. This movie was 3 hours of straight dialogue. Most of which was very confusing almost entirely allegorical. Was it intellectual? Sure. Does that make for a edge-of-your-seat, thrilling theater experience like this marketed itself to be? Absolutely not. Oppenheimer himself as a protestors is hard to get behind because all in all, he‚Äôs not a very likeable, and while the movie does a good job demonstrating his guilt about contributing to the demise of humankind, the movie didn‚Äôt know where to go from there. It ended so anticlimactically, especially for a movie that drew on and on and ON with 3 hours of nonstop political-driven dialogue that I honestly lost interest in about halfway through. Sorry but this movie wasn‚Äôt worth the ticket prices. My partner and I both left wishing we‚Äôd waited to rent it :(",NEGATIVE

It did do a good job of exploring the attractions of communism to intellectuals, elites and idealists who were unlikely to suffer it's negative effects - same then as it is now.

"Jul 29, 2023","A three hour long, boring social media hype. I did not like neither the idea, nor its execution. The plot was too much focused on the process to Oppenheimer and disregarded any detail on the actual scientific challenges linked to the realisation of the bomb.

It was so boring!",NEGATIVE
"Jul 29, 2023","It's a testament to Nolan's skills as a filmmaker that a three hour film comprising men talking is powerfully engaging. Nolan is known for scale and spectacle, and while the subject matter offers ample opportunity for this, Nolan instead focuses on the human element of the creation of the atomic bomb- not the explosions (one is enough to make its point), not the grim reality of its results- although these are discussed and referenced lightly through symbolic dream sequences- Nolan is at his most filmic here, most symbolic, perhaps more so than Inception's totem moment. Murphy is excellent as the lead, whose inner workings and humanity are barely touched upon; like his legacy, the film focuses more on his scientific discovery than the people in his life- but perhaps that's the point. Oppenheimer wasn't exactly the best husband and father and that they are given short shrift amid his scientific adventures or selfish gratification (and dark consequences) operates effectively as a narrative tool. What little Blunt has to do is wonderful, owning the screen in the third act. Robert Downey Jr reminds the audience why, after being mostly Iron Man for 15 years, he is regarded so highly with a multi-faceted performance. Gary Oldman has one scene- and that's all he needs- as Truman and plays the president like a mean spirited crimelord- setting the tone for witch trial against Oppenheimer when he dared suggest that this technology, these doomsday weapons, should be regulated properly. The final moments are a tad on the nose, but certainly powerful stuff. There is no focus on the impact of the bomb, no gratuitous explosions or city destruction- this is not an action movie, not a story of victory over oppressors- it is the story of science triumphing, and then being used to hold the world to ransom. Little is made of what communism is, though it is apparently the antithesis of America, which, if the film were to have one, is- as a political institution at least, the villain of this powerful, almost play-like piece of cinema.",POSITIVE

"Jul 29, 2023","I've only ever walked out of the cinema twice, once at Anchor Man 2 & now Oppenheimer! Genuinely the most painfully boring film I've ever had to endure, walked out of the film around half an hour from the end wishing I hadn't wasted the money or the 2 1/2 hours of my life. World War 2 historians would have struggled to keep their eyes open during this film, I knew it wasn't going to be that exciting but dear dear Mr Nolan, what were you thinking?!?

"Jul 29, 2023","Oppenheimer is one of Nolan's best visual masterpieces, combining Oscar-worthy acting and carefully aligned scenes to create something that coalesces in the final scene, leaving you stunned. It forces you to confront the brutal nature of mankind, which is not only destructive on a mass scale, but also personally vindictive towards specific individuals. I'm still astounded. Cannot recommend enough.",POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2023","Absolutely breathtaking, didn't feel like 3 hours at all Cillian Murphy is breathtaking and deserves every possible allocate RDJ and Emily Blunt also deserve Oscars",POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2023","Starting with the bias I loved this movie, always being a fan of science and specifically physics and quantum mechanics, and add up that is a ""war"" movie it was just a perfect match.

Now Nolan's style is present all around the movie, telling the story out of order and using filters to indicate the different perspectives, and a ""the world stood still"" moment in the story climax. The audience also gets all round great performances while they get blasted by an inspiring and amazing soundtrack, would watch again",POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2023","Really good movie but became confusing towards the end. Too many people with too many agendas and couldn't keep it straight. Also, what was the point of showing nudity??? Completely unnecessary and lessened the seriousness of the movie.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 29, 2023","I wish they had focused more on the war, the struggles with building the bomb and the difficult decision to actually use it. They divert into the sexual life of Oppenheimer which had almost nothing to do with the story the movie was telling. Also, I think actual video and photos of the destruction that the bomb caused and real life news, pictures and aftermath of having used the bomb not once but twice would have made the movie better than the gratuitous sex scenes that didn't add to the movie. Real life photos etc. would have brought home the struggles that all who spent time creating the bomb would have felt. Finally, fortunately I watched a short documentary on the Manhattan project two weeks before I saw this movie. I was confused for about 2 hours of the movie but the documentary I previously watched helped me understand what was going on. Way too many names that are very important to the plot but barely appear in the movie we're very hard to keep straight. Also, the movies isn't about the Manhattan Project or, really, even about Oppenheimer. No spoilers. It's a good movie, but in my opinion, should have chosen one direction to focus on, especially for a three hour movie. I'd recommend watching it at home with subtitles. There were so many times when a single sentence that a character said that was (apparently) extremely impactful, but if you missed a word or two, you didn't know the importance of it. To me, they touched in too many areas and had way too many characters to keep track of. Plus, they never try delved into Oppenheimer's true feelings about the project or aftermath. If you're going to show a touch of it, they should have really gotten into it and gotten rid of gratuitous sex scenes that weren't relevant to the story being told. Pick a lane. And, seriously, show the real pictures, news clippings etc. of what those bombs did. That would really have brought the movie home.

"Jul 29, 2023","This movie made me have goosebumps. From the story line to the audio, it was perfect. If you have the mental capacity to watch the whole 3 hours it's incredible.",POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2023",The five star reviews must be fake. Don't waste 3.5 hours of your life on this boring film about the guy being reamed by the US government about being a supposed Communist. So boring. Barely anything about Los Alamos or the bombs themselves. Nothing like the previews!!!!,NEGATIVE
"Jul 29, 2023","Es una muy buena pel√≠cula a nivel de todo tanto visual como argumental, lo √∫nico que le noto como error es que a veces es un poco confusa si no conoces la historia ni ese mundillo.

"Jul 29, 2023",Loved the movie! 10/10   I believe the film is basically telling us what mankind can do and possibly destroy the very world we live in if we set our minds to something that we 100% believe in,POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2023",This is one of the most thought provoking movies I've seen in ages. Days later I am still thinking about it.,POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2023","Nolan returns to form with this deeply introspective and cerebral epic. Taking the most stacked cast possibly ever assembled to tell the story of the American Prometheus the man who gave man the power to destroy themselves. The acting is top notch, the soundtrack delivers, and it is shot masterfully. I will say the movie has a few flaws, in that it does not grip you the whole way. However while you are watching this it is hard not to think that you are watching a master execute his craft.",POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2023","This is cinema! For me, this is Nolan's most impactful masterpiece. It is without a doubt the best adaptation of a book I have ever seen. The story is portrayed in an incredible, tense and dynamic way. I like the fact that it is dynamic because it manages to hold the viewer well even in moments that would be calmer or even a little boring in other stories, but here everything is done very well for you to hold. One thing that helps to keep you hooked is the incredible interpretation of the actors, giving life and high realism to their characters and I especially highlight Cillian Murphy who is the soul of Oppenheimer. The film manages to convey the feeling of the scene very well, especially seconds before the explosion, making us feel in the protagonist's shoes and what helps is the fact that Nolan has not used any CGI the whole film, so it makes us anxious for the result as well as Oppenheimer and his co-workers.",POSITIVE

"Jul 29, 2023","Phenomenal movie! The only reason that I did not give 5 stars was histrionic pace of the movie that seemed at times very exhausting. Nolan's absolute dedication to the history left little choice but to cut in as much story as possible by showing us snippets of that history. Nolan ties everything together in a way that provides the audience the proper intuition. But, as we see the histrionic hallucinations through Oppenheimer's eyes, the audience should be forewarned that what JRO saw was the consummate line from the Hindu text, ""Now I am become death, Destroyer of Worlds"".",POSITIVE

It is a must see.",POSITIVE

"Jul 29, 2023","Not as dramatic as I thought it would be. Would have appreciated more narrative around the actual project and less around his extended personal life. Also, like almost every film since COVID, should have been trimmed!",NEUTRAL
"Jul 29, 2023","Three storylines are interwoven in a complex narrative...his personal life and loves, his Communist party affiliation which wrecks his security clearance and occasions a full-on committe hearing about his loyalty during the McCarthy era, and the Cold War filmed in black and white, but most compellingly, his stewardship of the Manhattan Project and the creation of the H-bomb knowing he has ripped away the curtain separating man and God, literally stolen his way into the mind of the Creator which posits consequences the likes of which are mythic. For his hubris in giving man fire, Prometheus was chained forever to a rock only to get his liver poked at daily by vultures, restored by night to go thru it all over again the next day...torture, hunh?With that fire, mankind is capable of great genius and self-destructive lunacy in its pursuit of dominance and sovereignty. Oppenheimer, scientific brother to Bohr, Einstein, Heisenberg, Fermi et al., is poised to end the war with Japan by dropping a nuclear holocaust on Nagasaki and Hiroshima, and in the process killing, maiming and altering genetics of millions. Horns of a dilemma kinda thing. Theoretical physics when co-opted by military and political factions becomes reality, the likes of which are almost primeval, primordial in nature. The atom is the primary unit of all matter, and these 20th century physicists have outsmarted themselves and us...yes, we now know what God knows. Now what do we do with it? The fruit of the tree of good and evil...a bittersweet piece of fruit. What price, genius?

Technically, the optics are brilliant, as is the audio, particularly the spectacular countdown to ground zero when they launch a test run of the bomb in a New Mexico desert. The hearings post-war are filmed in black and white, pitting Oppenheimer against AEC commission chair Strauss who appointed him head of the Manhattan Project. The rides on horseback in the same desert delineating his romances are ironic artistic counterpoint. But what is fascinating are the exchanges among physicists who hope for responsible control and discipline over this revolutionary discovery. The question remains: have these guys - brave, short-sighted, brilliant, foolhardy, intoxicated by their compounding discoveries, so like swashbucklers on the high seas of scientific revolution - did they do us any favors or did they doom us all to the end days, the final apocalypse?",POSITIVE

"Jul 29, 2023","Oppenheimer was a fantastic excellent and visually compelling piece of cinematic art; I saw it in IMAX. It was awe-inspiring in that format was very visual, loud, and realistic. It was really loud and really visually stunning I had to sight in the front row where it felt like you were really getting hit by an atomic It was great, but I would recommend sitting in a middle row. The film overall had excellent performances from its cast, especially Cillian Murphy, Matt Damon, and Robert Downey Jr all of them were fantastic, and the IMAX experience really heightened it since it was how the film was intended to be seen instead of a lower quality digital version.",POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2023","One of Nolan's best work, absolutely beautiful shots and amazing way of telling such a complicated story.",POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2023","Two things.  Great job of showing the horror of a nuclear blast without audience fleeing for the exits and first time, in years, where Robert Downey did not mumble his lines.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 29, 2023","A truly amazing experience. I haven't been let down by any Christopher Nolan film I've seen yet, and this film continues that streak. The story and direction by Nolan (based, of course, on the true story) is expansive and endlessly interesting, filling the film's three-hour runtime and never making it feel overly long (though, honestly, no film feels long to me anymore).

The cast, especially Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer, Emily Blunt as Katherine Oppenheimer, Matt Damon as Leslie Groves, Robert Downey, Jr. as Lewis Strauss, and Florence Pugh as Jean Tatlock (among many, many more amazing actors and performances, and including some surprising appearances) deliver continuously and keep making themselves more and more interesting the longer they are onscreen.

The visuals are amazing, and the fact there is no CGI in the entire film (at least, according to Christopher Nolan) is an amazing fact that astounds me even further, especially during scenes like the Trinity test. The cinematography by Hoyte van Hoytema compliments this with on-location shooting, delivering beautiful, awe-inspiring shots.

Finally, the score by Ludwig G√∂ransson is a combination of many different emotions and descriptions, like beautiful, awe-inspiring, tension-filling, and just amazing. Without the music, I feel many of the scenes would not have been able to deliver quite as well with their emotion, among other things. Once again, G√∂ransson delivers, and after his previous great compositions for Nolan's last film, Tenet, I'm not surprised.

In conclusion, this film is epic and amazing, and I hope to see it again in theaters. Nolan continues his streak of amazing and surprising me, and I'm very excited to see what film he'll think of directing next. Without a doubt, the only rating I can give this film is a ten out of ten (or, on Rotten Tomatoes, five out of five).",POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2023","Top notch acting and writing. Visuals and music were great too. Very talky, but I was never bored. Definitely in the top five Christopher Nolan films.",POSITIVE

"Jul 29, 2023","It's been a few hours since I watched oppenheimer and I still can't stop thinking about it. Everything about that movie is nothing but perfect.
If there's one single person on this planet who knows how to end movies and has the ability to make his viewers think about it for a long ass time, then it HAS to be christopher fucking Nolan. | literally couldn't breathe. The last 60 minutes of the movie has to be the greatest of all time. It was just flawless. The editing, The acting and most importantly that gut wrenching music.
The trinity sequence is so fucking terrifying and only nolan can do something like that. And I can easily say that it's his best scene. This movie will be remembered for decades. gawd.
And cillian will definitely receive an oscar nomination and i wouldn't be surprised if he won it. Overall, it's a masterfuckingpiece and that is how you make cinema.",POSITIVE

"Jul 29, 2023","Oppenheimer is undoubtedly the best movie of the year 2023 and one of the best movies of this decade so far. Its a real masterpiece which is a must watch one for all the brilliant movie lovers. 

The people who got disappointed after the movie might have expected a movie about bomb or war or something but it's the movie which tells the story of Robert J Oppenheimer, the man who is known as the father of the atomic bomb. It's the story of his life, how he developed the historic world changing invention, but it's not an action or fantasy movie. People who watch it with the expectations of a fantasy adventure movie may get disappointed but for the people who knows the real sense of this movie will surely enjoy this. It's a real true masterpiece üíØ",POSITIVE

"Jul 29, 2023",What an incredible film!! Definitely Oscar worthy this is what cinema is about great movie great story and completely amazing!!!!,POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2023",Christopher Nolan's latest entry is long.  Theres a lot of random time jumps so be prepared and the unnecessary sex scenes could have been avoided.  Visually Nolans work never disappoints but a 3 hour biopic was a stretch.  The plot of the movies is more or less is Oppenheimer on trial for being a communist.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 29, 2023",It could have a hour removed and it would be a better movie. It had things that were distracted from the story and I felt were unnecessary.,NEUTRAL
"Jul 29, 2023","Probably the best Nolan movie so far, and one of the best I've seen in recent years. Stellar cast, incredible score by Ludwig Goransson and a very deep exploration of humanity and it's drive for self-destruction.",POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2023",Powerful movie about the invention of the atomic bomb.,POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2023",Excellent film! Thrilling narrative from start to end! Nolan at its best.,POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2023","No one other than Nolan can dream of venturing into something like this and deliver something so amazing. It's not the typical Nolan movie in terms of complexity, visuals, and cinematic grandeur. But it's a whole new feat on its own. It's deep, intense, intellectual, and engrossing; taking us back to the times of Dr. Oppenheimer. It's a deep dive into the great scientist's mind. As far as performances are concerned, Cillian Murphy deserves an Oscar for this career best performance. Robert Jr., Emily, Matt Damon etc. have all lived their characters and delivered brilliant performances. On the negative side, It could have been a bit shorter, and could have shown us more on Oppenheimer's relation with his wife and how it evolved into what it was towards the end.  
PS: Those who expect fireworks, explosive action, and other such stuff will be in for a huge disappointment. Appreciate the movie for what it is, or better don't go to the cinemas and torture yourself.",POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2023",Great movie probably the best this year. I loved the music.,POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2023","Pretty incredible movie, very engaging and the film's score played a huge part of the movie as it was composed to play a very psychological element with the audience, and it worked. In some ways I was psychologically shaken after watching this. Our showing was a 6:45 p.m. and got out after 10 p.m., packed theater, audience was people from probably all walks, each generation, all left visibly affected or in deep pondering of some kind. It's not a jovial movie, it's deep, so be ready for that. In just 10 years we'll be up to 100 years since the beginning parts of some of this movie. Watching this movie though puts a person's mind into when all of this unfolded and the decisions that were made. I agree with Denzel Washington's character in Crimson Tide more now than ever. ""the purpose of war is to serve a political end, but the true nature of war is to serve itself.""",POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2023","I am not a Christopher Nolan fan. With that being said this is the first time that i watched a movie of him without getting bored. Cillian's performance was phenomenal. Acting was overall very satisfying but Cillian's tortured,nuanced performance as Oppenheimer will remain on my mind.",POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2023","Amazing cinematography, performances, set design, and color grading but extremely hard to follow.  No dates are displayed on screen to distiguish between present and past, and many events are jumbled together.  Would have been better as a linear storyline instead of nonlinear.  It is a three hour film that I believe could be a two hour film if unneeded information was excluded.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 29, 2023","This movie reminds me of why I love movies. Everything was perfect (acting, sound, .... etc).
Especially felt that the music was telling the story and it kept interested in finding out what's happening next though I know Oppenheimer's story.",POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2023","Oppenheimer actually had the most obvious correct criticism of when the right goes too far. McCarthyism was placed on full display, as people with heartfelt convictions towards political communism were unfairly treated. The right-wing cancel culture from the 20s to the 60s. Despite many within the US government leaking details on nuclear fission for the invention of nuclear arms in the soviet union, their treatment was wrong. Not everyone canceled and pushed out of polite society for merely having communist convictions acted upon those convictions. They were of no threat and also had no idea of the genocide happening behind the brick wall of the Soviet Union. That was half the film and the other half was absolutely amazing.",POSITIVE

"Jul 29, 2023","Tremendous film, a thinking-man's epic. For those without a science background, the important thing is not so much understanding the science itself, but rather understanding the problems that the science poses for these men and women. The film is as much about the solving of a scientific problem as the moral responsibility that comes when that solution is implemented in practice. Brilliantly acted and brilliantly directed. The film-making - especially the editing and sound (or lack of it) virtually become characters in and of themselves in terms of their contributions to the film.",POSITIVE

"Jul 29, 2023","It never ceases to amaze me how many people seem to think the end of the Cold War meant the end of the threat of nuclear war. Nothing can be further from the truth. 

Oppenheimer is a brilliant film. It's engrossing- the three hours fly by. It's also deeply disturbing and frightening. I've never seen a full cinema of people so sombre and quiet at film's end. And it needs to be frightening: the threat is far from over. 

We're now at the fourth generation who have grown up under the shadow of the bomb.",POSITIVE

"Jul 29, 2023","Good story, good visually, good acting. But it was all spoiled by the incessancy of the sound track. (This being musical sound effects, without a melody or score.) It was often unnecessary, and often drowned out dialogue, which resulted in the movie making a bit less sense than it deserved. And at the volume the movie was played at in the cinema in which I viewed it, it all amounted to an assault.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 29, 2023","This was really terrible.   It felt like an action movie, when it was anything but an action movie.  In terms of emotional levels, the movie starts at a 9 and goes to 10.  There's no build, it's all just loud, fast, and confusing.   Too many characters to keep track of, too many short scenes, too much editing that is not needed, jumping back and forth in time.  It felt like Nolan was saying, ""Look how smart I am!  Look at what I can do!"" the whole time, which is what a lot of his movies feel like.   Instead of finding a good story to tell and telling it without bombarding the audience with fast editing, overblown music, and show-off technique that isn't needed.   It's a mess.   The movie is 180 minutes long and there are probably 178 minutes of music.   Chris Nolan is a very insecure director -- he can't let a dialogue scene play without music, he doesn't trust his actors.   He has a 12 year-old's sense of emotion.   No subtlely,  nothing that isn't bombastic or trite.  I had a headache after it.  And felt like I learned nothing about the truth of what happened because I don't trust Nolan -- for all of the reasons above.  Cillian Murphy was terrific, it's too bad the movie he is in is awful.",NEGATIVE

One of the ones that will make a lot of noise this year.",POSITIVE

"Jul 29, 2023",This is easily the most engaged I've been watching a 3 hour movie of people predominantly talking. This was the first film I'd seen in 70mm too and it's really beautiful. I didn't know much about Oppenheimer beyond what I learned in school about the arms race during WWII but I appreciate how thorough the movie was explaining the history while still being very entertaining. The editing is very well done. They were able to create action scenes from what otherwise would have been somewhat mundane discussion. I definitely plan to read American Prometheus because I believe that's where my h of the film's reference material came from.,POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2023","This film was one of the biggest letdowns I've ever experienced in theaters. We bought our tickets for this two months in advance and couldn't stop talking about it the day of. 

The film was essentially a bunch of men walking around with their lips moving the entire film but nothing coming out of their mouths because the soundtrack was blaring so loud. In addition, there were a handful of entirely unnecessary nude scenes that made you feel like you were watching porn in public. I looked down our row and in front of us when these scenes came on and women were cringing and covering their eyes. Makes you wonder who they had previewing the film before it was released to the public.

Overall, the film was so long and done so poorly that there's not much more to say other than it'll leave you feeling like you just wasted 3 hours of your life and lost $15.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 29, 2023",It's the best movie of 2023. The bgm and the cinematography is fabulous. All cast was doing their job perfectly. Cillian Murphy as Robert Oppenheimer and Robert Downey Jr as Lwiss Straws is one of the best casting.,POSITIVE

Well done film.",POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2023","I felt the movie is overrated. Little historical content. Many, many characters who are often not identified. The only test they show was Trinity. No Fat man or little boy explosions. Editing was sloppy in the beginning.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 29, 2023","Oppenheimer is a complex and challenging film, but it is also a rewarding one. Nolan's direction is masterful, and he creates a visually stunning film that is both epic in scope and intimate in its portrait of Oppenheimer. The performances are all excellent, with Murphy giving a tour-de-force performance as Oppenheimer.

The film is not without its flaws. The pacing can be slow at times, and the film's philosophical themes can be a bit heavy-handed. However, these flaws are minor compared to the film's many strengths.

Overall, Oppenheimer is a powerful and important film that is sure to be remembered for years to come. It is a film that will challenge you to think about the nature of science, war, and power. I highly recommend it.",POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2023","3 + hours lost!
The trailer was promising but sitting through this 3 hour Nolan indulgence was frustrating and overdone -  needs 45 minutes removed. The drama attempts too much, gets lost in over-repeative details and in the process fails to entertain. Very disappointing.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 29, 2023","I know some people who think this is a film about the Atomic bomb and Oppenheimers part in making that happen. This is a biopic with only the middle act really dealing with that part of his life.
It's 3 hours, it's a biopic and follows Oppenheimer through his life. I learned a lot through this film, not knowing where he came from and how he was treated thereafter.
The film is an eye opener, great performances from a cast too star studded to mention. The sound and visuals right from the off, give a feeling of seriousness to the matter at hand (the Atomic bomb) and the thoughts at play within Oppenheimers mind.
The juxtaposition of the elation of winning a war, but unleashing hell on earth and the chance for humanity to destroy itself are felt keenly in the ""celebratory"" scene - which you'll know when you see it.
It's long - 3 hours, so be prepared to concentrate to understand the nuances of what happened before, during and after the bombs were dropped.
All in all a great film, a good history lesson and a poignant place to consider all of our future actions.
That said - absolute power corrupts absolutely. So, I'm sure the film will impact the viewing audience, however, the powers in the world today that have this power at their fingertips - will it matter ? Let's hope so.

Poignant, enlightening and powerful.",POSITIVE

"Jul 29, 2023",Geez poor edited movie.. what a mess. Only good thing is cillian Murphy. The rest of the cast was not good. Dissapointing,NEGATIVE
"Jul 29, 2023","Oppenheimer is by far best film of 2023 I have seen so far as it just ""Spectacularly Ginormous"" in every aspect as Christopher Nolan has done a thrilling job.",POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2023",A superb film.  The three hours flew by.  Cillian Murphy deserves a best actor Oscar.  I especially enjoyed that the film confronts difficult issues without sliding into preachiness.  This is a film for adults who think.,POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2023","Christopher Nolan has created his master piece in my opinion. Oppenheimer is a deep study of the creator of the atomic bomb and all that he went through before, during and after. The acting is nothing but A plus across the board, this might be Nolan's best sound mix since you can hear everything they're saying and the cinematography is just the best we've seen. I got to watch it in its 70mm glory and WOW! Check this out in the biggest screen possible! Worth every second!",POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2023","I realize I'm in the minority here, but I found this movie to be exhausting to watch. Nonstop talking heads. So much dialogue I don't think I've ever seen a movie with this much dialogue and different characters in it. It felt self-important  with all the celebrity cameos. Between the cameos and ""smart dialogue"" the movie felt to be in love with itself. Acting was good, but no way that I will ever sit through this movie again.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 29, 2023","Really solid film. if I had to critique, I'd say it would have benefited from being a miniseries as there so much packed in this film, but even still it was an enjoyable screening.",POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2023","Wow!  This movie just knocked me out!  So many parts of the movie were just excellent. I think I need a little time to fully process everything.. but I left the theater just in awe of the movie.  Acting, script, cinematography, directing, score, sound, and visuals... were all just amazing.  Nolan really knows how to make a really powerful film.  It leaves you asking questions about war, and how the atomic bomb really changed things.  I only had a few small issues with the film.  It does sort of peak about 2/3 of the way through the film.  At least in terms of actions of the film.  Then it asks questions about what happens after you invent and use an atomic bomb.  Really powerful stuff.. and it kept me interested the whole time.  I loved seeing it in IMAX.. with the powerful sound especially.  Although if you only get to see it in a regular theater.. that is ok too.  But in a theater is the best way to see it for sure.  Really awesome and it's such an inventive and powerful movie.",POSITIVE

"Jul 29, 2023",Movie is painfully overrated. In classic Christopher Nolan form the script was bad but sound and visual effects saved the movie. Never felt more unconnected to a character‚Ä¶ 3hr biography. Cillian Murphy was great but script limited his relatability. Would not be as harsh if it didn't have a 94%. You should watch it but based off rotten tomatoes rankings I'd give it 65%. Never will watch it twice,NEGATIVE

Oppenheimer doesn't allow you to feel one way for too long, you will explore many emotions throughout this film and it keeps you on the edge of your seat, at least until your arse gets sore because that's how long this film is.

"Jul 29, 2023",this movie was stunning and probably the best movie i've watched in recent years. the cinematography in this film is incredible as christopher nolan never fails at.

"Jul 29, 2023","A brilliant film in terms of visuals (it will not be an exaggeration to call it an art), brilliant music that makes you fall into the chair. Even though it's not an action movie, the movie itself is gripping and keeps you in suspense and gives you a lot to think about and reflect on. Finally, I would like to add that this film must be seen in the cinema",POSITIVE

"Jul 29, 2023","Overall, it was great but not without some issues. Pugh's character and how women were treated script-wise was very narrow - it's about Oppenheimer so keep it that way. Cillian and RDJ were fantastic as lead and supporting actors. The sound engineer - kudos to you for creating literally ground shaking experiences throughout. Like I said; some snags, but enough greatness going on to carry through.",POSITIVE

"Jul 29, 2023","This movie is overhyped garbage. Can't believe it's rated so high, worst movie I've seen in a long time. The fast paced conversations are hard to follow and insufferable. There is no character development. It's just 3 hours of confusing conversations. Wanted to walk out. Truly can't understand the hype for this movie",NEGATIVE
"Jul 29, 2023","Definitely a must-see, though the writing is uneven. The first third was choppy like a soap opera. The movie really shined though after that. Acting was superb all around, as were the costumes and settings.",POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2023","I liked the move, however, it is not for everyone. To really understand the movie, you‚Äôll need a pretty good base line knowledge of WWII, and the Cold War. Many people will come to see the detonation and the trinity test, but it‚Äôs really just a small part of the film. It is a in depth look at the life of Dr. Oppenheimer, and the personal struggles that came with the aftermath of building the atomic bomb. Great movie, not for everyone.",POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2023",Lights went out due to weather and we didn‚Äôt get any refund.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 29, 2023",this is one great movie so far in 2023.,POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2023","Even though it might be a bit hard to followup and keep on with the story, having a little context makes you feel some hype to understand the background and thinking behind the actual creation of a weapon that could cause such damage to our planet and the people in it, things become more clear as the movie goes on and it strikes you with a reveal lately that leaves the morale of Oppenheimer up to the spectator to judge. Amazing film for a patient and interested public, can also be enjoyed by everyone but might be harsh to enjoy it fully.",POSITIVE

"Jul 29, 2023","This movie is absolutely amazing!! This is Christopher Nolan at his finest!! I feel like if a less ambitious director made this film it could have been really boring, but Nolan pulled through. 
The dialogue is great, the acting is great, and the music is awesome! I just can't get enough of this film, and I learned soooo much!
I started researching the real life history of it, and I learned a lot. 
I highly recommend this movie.
Now, this movie may not be for everyone, but if you sit down, and pay attention, there's a very good chance you'll enjoy it especially if you appreciate good history!",POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2023",The greatest movie of our time. It had a very powerful message. The actors were amazing and the music score pulled you in to experience this thrilling masterpiece.,POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2023",Very long boring movie. Should have been cut down to 1.5 hours. Save your time and money.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 29, 2023","I'm definitely in the minority here, but‚Ä¶ First of all, IMAX adds nothing to the experience. Unless you like to be deafened. Constant loud (loud!) music, though it is interrupted by numerous loud (loud!) explosions, thunder, foot stomping - you name it. If it's loud, the director put it in. And in, and in‚Ä¶forever. Way, way too long, too many confusing jumps back and forth in time.. Now, in addition to the story of Oppenheimer, and the development of the atom bomb, you want to learn why Strauss did or did not get into the Cabinet, this is the movie for you. Director obviously is full of himself, and being a bit of a star, no one tells him enough! Pass.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 29, 2023","The movie was truly outstanding. Finally something uniquely great in the theaters. The pacing, the score, the acting, the visual effects! Man i loved it. They told a great story and for a 3hr run time it didn‚Äôt feel very long",POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2023","It's hard to encapsulate this movie, as its bombastic plot is contrasted with an intimate character study of the man in question. It takes an All-Star cast, gives them the proper script to deliver fantastic dialogue, and edits it perfectly to capture the events and internal struggles of everyone involved.",POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2023","I wont even describe the screen because it is a freaking Christopher Nolan movie. The movie is really good, it story accurately portrays the becoming of a genius physicist to the inventor of mankind's deadliest weapon. The film is a smooth mix of drama, history and politics. The only thing you need to keep in mind before watching the movie is that you need complete knowledge of world war 2 and Oppenheimer's life else a few scenes might not be suitable for the audience",POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2023","Wow just wow for me it is easily the best Christopher Nolan film he truly knocks it out of the park. It is a true masterpiece from start to finish. The cinematography is amazing, the writing is amazing, and the acting is the best out of any Nolan film. I will be shocked if it does not win best picture at the Oscars. On top of that Cillian Murphy has basically guaranteed his Oscar nomination for best actor he is truly spectacular. Despite a towering 3-hour runtime, you find yourself immediately invested in the story. And while it definitely feels like 3 hours you are never bored or waiting for something to happen. The fact that Nolan is able to capture the sheer magnitude of the atomic bomb once they test it using no CGI is almost unfathomable. Even after the testing of the bomb, you see Oppenheimer's perspective change he feels responsible and for speaking his opinion he is attacked by governmental figures. Robert Downy Jr has proved and reminded that he is much more than just Tony Stark. Best supporting actor at the Oscars for sure. The score as in any Nolan film is spectacular and helps you feel the magnitude of some scenes Ludwig G√∂ransson composes something truly amazing. To wrap up Oppenheimer is a true cinematic masterpiece from start to finish please go see this movie.",POSITIVE

"Jul 29, 2023",One of the best films I've seen in awhile that really has no flaws.  The story telling was precisely done and each character was well paced and defined.

"Jul 29, 2023","Awful.  Slow, boring, no special acting.  I am 100% mind blown on why the movie is well received.  The recently made TV Show about the Manhattan Project was 10x more interesting yet cancelled.  This should have never made it to theaters and the only reason it's so successful it either due to lack of content or group think.  Of everyone I know who saw it in theaters, only one enjoyed it.

"Jul 29, 2023","Oppenheimer isn't a bad movie. It's a good movie. It's just difficult to know just how good it is since the dialogue is constantly interrupted either by over the top sound effects or a self important and intrusive soundtrack by Ludwig G√∂ransson. It isn't that Christopher Nolan thinks he's Michael Bay. There's only one explosion, but it is a big one. It's just that he might as well have been Michael Bay, exchanging explosions on the screen for an explosive soundtrack. I don't know if Ludwig G√∂ransson thinks he's the new Vangelis or the next Hans Zimmer, but he is neither. They must have a great sound system in the studio's mixing room. It's just too bad the average Cineplex can't quite match it.

I think he would have been better served if he had brought Zimmer onboard to do the soundtrack. He brought other people from the Batman movies. Gary Oldman is almost unrecognizable as President Harry Truman and Tom Conti is totally unrecognizable as Professor Albert Einstein. There are other Hollywood Heavyweights in other cameos as well. But they're all overshadowed by the intrusive overbearing soundtrack.

If only Christopher Nolan had more respect for the audiences intelligence he might have given the dialogue a more prominent place in his film. Quantum Mechanics and Nuclear Physics are difficult enough subjects to tackle when you can hear and understand every word being said clearly and distinctly. But when you have music that is trying to create a sense of urgency and tension even in scenes where there is none, it's a bit like the snow he inserts into scenes where it isn't cold enough to see the actors breath. Obviously he is foreshadowing nuclear winter and fallout, but again, it's as intrusive as the persistent soundtrack, and more than a little ham-handed. Muck like the inserted nudity and sex scene trying to allude to Oppenheimer's life being laid bare before his detractors. 

Cillian Murphy's performance is excellent. Had this film been made a decade or two ago his part might well have gone to Peter Weller. He would have fit right in as the Doctor Buckaroo Banzai of the 1940s, especially when Naked Lunch like sexual and atomic hallucination intrude into the story almost as much as that bombastic soundtrack. 

Perhaps all the blasts of music, sound effects and shocking imagery are to keep the audience awake since you can't always hear the dialogue. Or, maybe, he thought the dialogue itself would put people to sleep, especially after the bomb is made and shipped off to Japan and the movie is only a little more than half over and the film degenerates into a courtroom drama against Oppenheimer by a Robert Downey Jr.'s bitter character, since it's filled enough science and political science to put the audience to sleep even with the intrusive music and hallucinations. It's hard to say for certain since I couldn't hear a lot of it.

So I hope when the DVD comes out there will be instead of a Director's Cut, a Viewer's Cut, complete with options like a soundtrack that can be turned down. At least there will be Closed Captions, hopefully accurate ones, and not like the ones that seem be written for the deaf by the deaf. No, good ones where you can read what's actually being said. Only then will I be able to determine just how good this good movie really was. It was certainly better than the theater's sound system as it struggled to keep up. Perhaps they should resurrect the of Sensurround System from the 1970's that they used for movies like Earthquake and Midway with enough Cervwin-Vega speakers for a Grateful Dead concert. Maybe that would allow the audience to hear the dialogue above the intrusive score and atomic blasts. Otherwise it's like trying to watch a combination of a dramatic Broadway play with the entire New York Philharmonic on stage with the actors, punctuating their every line with fanfares and flourishes.

Does this review seem overly long and monotonous? Well then Oppenheimer probably isn't your cup of tea. The ""courtroom stuff"" makes the ""math stuff"" seem interesting by comparison. It seems that Christopher Nolan wanted to give us an epic. It's certainly long enough to be one. But most of the film isn't IMAX worthy, even if the soundtrack requires their sound system. This could have been a Smart Movie, but I think Nolan made it just smart enough for intellectually challenged pretentious people to think it is. Or maybe I'm wrong and it's just me. But if I were you, I'd wait for the DVD, or Stream it. That way you can rewind missed dialogue and take breaks as needed in order to find out.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 29, 2023",This movie does a spectacular job at involving complicated subjects that aren‚Äôt hard for the audience to grasp all while making the film easy to watch. The fast pace makes the 3hr fly by. One of Nolan‚Äôs best films in my opinion ,POSITIVE

"Jul 29, 2023","Was an interesting movie.¬† ¬†Not sure whether to recommend catching¬†it in the theater or not.

This is a biopic about Oppenheimer.¬† ¬†Even though the trailers make it look like another Manhattan Project movie, that's only a small slice of what we see.

A lot of biopics suffer the same problem - what story will you actually tell about a person's life.¬† ¬†Some do it well.¬† ¬†Most end up just all over the place.¬† ¬†This one leans a tad bit on the 'all over the place' side.¬† ¬† The first half hour comes off as a mess.¬† ¬†Jumps in time between different scenes in his life.¬† ¬†Way too much time spent on his life as a young adult.¬† ¬†

The middle of the film does focus on Trinity, but mostly on Opps life.¬† Some more flashbacks.¬† Not so much a focus on the bomb¬†development but on the politics of Trinity and between the physicists.¬† By now we know Opps is a womanizer.¬† Full of himself but not always standing up for himself.¬† ¬†And we see the beginnings of him realizing the 'what' of they are doing.¬† ¬†The basic tenet¬†of can they do it vs should they do it.

The last part of the movie is post-bomb.¬† ¬†Ops hopes to use the bomb to negotiate an armistice¬†with Russia but learns that once developed, the politicians will do what they want with atomic¬†weapons (build bigger bombs as we know).¬† ¬†Here we focus on hearings, mainly the one where they revoked Opps clearance, and the slighted politician who is out to get him.¬† ¬†But Opps pursuit of peace and his indecisiveness come back to haunt him.¬† This section brings together most of the flashbacks we saw at the front of the movie.¬† But while it ties things together it's less about Opps and more about who is politically maneuvering who.¬† ¬†

So with this movie you learn more about the man than about the bomb.¬† ¬†That makes it a good movie about Opps, but not the most exciting movie.¬† ¬† The one thing that surprise me was the number of stars in this movie.¬† Up to you if the cinematography is worth catching on the big screen or wait to catch it at home.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 29, 2023","Providing a dark contrast to the upbeat humanist themes of interstellar, Oppenheimer asks important philosophical questions about the price of a weapon and the toll it takes on the person who introduces it.

"Jul 28, 2023","As someone who has studied the subject, Director Nolan gets most of his history right; with some artistic ""liberties"" (such as completely unnecessary nudity and sex scenes).

I hated all the sound from the music to the effects, hated every bit of it except the explosion which, in it's entirety was spectacular.

"Jul 28, 2023","Just got back from the movie. Was NOT what I expected... but was FASCINATING (with one brutally emotional scene ... made even more emotional by the LACK of on-screen emotion). Just don't go thinking the movie is like a linear story ... it is very 'dense' with dialogue. I've heard it referred to as a 'monster movie' and in some ways it IS just that ... where we hardly see the monster and when we do the monster isn't what might have been expected. Looking at reviews, seems audience either LOVES it or HATES it ... very few 'middle of the road' reviews. The SOUND and SCORE are powerful but unlike other Nolan movies (where I went back to the theater 4 or 5 more times) I think this is a 'one and done' movie for me to see.",POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","Amazing storytelling by Christopher Nolan. He made a three hour movie consistantly intruiging. Most of the reviews talking of the movie being boring refer more to the lack of action than lack of an interesting plot, but no one said this was an action movie. Nolan also does an amazing job focusing on Oppenheimer's life as a whole, not just the bomb. Stellar performances from everyone.",POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","Even Robert Downey Jr couldn't save this YAWN, although he played his dull written character to perfection.  Three hours of chemist chat! I was lulled to sleep for a short bit, only waking in hopes the agony was over. It was not. BAD BAD BAD",NEGATIVE

"Jul 28, 2023","A once in a lifetime experience, and a must-see film for anyone who hasn't seen it yet. It's an historical thriller, drama and biopic that keeps you on the edge of your seat, and all thanks to Christopher Nolan's writing & directing, all of the incredible cast (with of course Cillian Murphy's stellar performance as the J. Robert Opennheimer carrying the entire film on his shoulder, completely humanizing the character, as well a Robert Downey Jr. as the villanous Lewis Strauss) and everyone who was part of the production of this film. Overall, an impecable film that leaves an important message for the post WW2 21st century nuclear world we live in, and a call for more IMAX 70mm theatres (couldn't see the film in that format, but if you can, and a have a theater proyecting it near you, please see it in the biggest format possible as the director intended).",POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023",This movie hit all the right feels. It's damming how Dr. Op was used and treated after helping end World War II. You really have to watch this in a different perspective. Christopher Nolan did it again. Excellent.,POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","Overlong, tedious in places and disappointing handling of material that could have been hugely engaging and informative.   Murphy was excellent, and a few others worked hard, but with many underdeveloped actors that we were not invited to care about much less understand.  Much of the plotline was not properly explained either, and the action sequences of the bomb itself were very short.  Massive let down after all the wild hype.  A story worth telling, and one that demands the screening of a few frames at least of the real aftermath of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but which didn't happen.  To me, that was gutless.
Wait to stream, don't waste your money.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 28, 2023","now i am become death the destroyer of worlds.
 We agree that this is one of the greatest films that we will mention in the coming years, integrated in all respects
 First, directing: Nolan presented us with wonderful scenes using an IMAX camera
 Secondly, the acting: Cillian Murphy was fabulous in this movie. I really felt that Oppenheimer's character was made for him. He was acting with his eyes. His looks at the camera were alone enough to know what he feel.The Oscar will be for Best Actor
As for Robert Downey, you will really forget that he played the character of Iron Man. It was a masterpiece for me. This is the best performance in his career. Also, he deserves the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.
 Thirdly, music and sound: If you are not interested in sound or music, then this movie is completely different. It was the best experience anyone could go through in any movie, and for me it was the best thing in the movie.
 Fourth, the scenario: to say the least, it was complex and woven in a wonderful way. We were moving from untidy timelines, going back to the past, then going to the present, and also going to the future. Some scenes were in colors that indicate something and were narrated from a person's perspective, while others were in black and white. And it indicates something else and the way he wrote Oppenheimer's character and analyzed his feelings and feelings of happiness, sadness or tension. I think that the film was able to present a biographical film in an unconventional way.
 The defect in this movie are two things. The first is the speed of the events in the first hour of the movie, as it was moving between times quickly, making this viewer in a state of incomprehensibility with the large number of characters. This may make some viewers upset, but it was not an important thing if you focused on the movie. The other defect, and I think it is not important, is the lack of focus on Oppenheimer's emotions towards his relationship with his ex-girlfriend and his wife. He did not give us enough time to get to know his character or even get attached to the character, but this is not important because the movie is not romantic.
 This is a first-class dialogue movie. If you are willing to watch a three-hour movie full of wonderful events, politics, feelings, tension, fear and anxiety, then this movie is for you. Advice before you watch the movie, try to know some information about the life of the scientist Oppenhaper and about the events Which was going on in the war so that you are sufficiently aware of what is happening in the film and focus on the film well. This is not written by any ordinary director. This is written by the genius Christopher Nolan.",POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","I actually worked with 3 physicists from The Manhatten Project in the 1970's-80's (one of their names is very briefly mentioned in the movie), and I had a great respect for them.  They would have been less happy with the taut dramatic aspects of the movie, but more happy with its pictoral rendering and the kind of thought and psychological tension that the movie brought to these folks.  The Oppenheimer actor was superb, as were the supporting actors, and the facial close-ups showed excellent character development.  President Truman was the only flub.  Highly recommended for anyone seeking answers as to the first bomb development in the U.S., and to how the U.S. government can pillory those in its service.",POSITIVE

"Jul 28, 2023",Sex scenes/porn was completely unnecessary. The film should of focused more on how the bomb was put together. ,NEGATIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","This is without a doubt the best Nolan in around a decade. It has elements of all his films combined to make a very masterful movie. Seeing this on the biggest screen possible is the best way to get the best experience. The film builds the tension throughout the movie that only Nolan knows how to. Cast is just icing on the cake with the amount of excellent performances. Not one weak note when it comes to acting. Only complaint would be the runtime, however every minute is earned which begs to question what if anything should he have cut out. Cillian without a doubt steals the show and really shows just how great of an actor he is. He's already proven how good he can be, but this role is one he was destined to play which allows for him to flourish. I still believe his best film to date is Interstellar. This film gives that movie a run for its money. Nolan without a doubt deserves the award for best director. It's really a shame when you look back at how many times he's really been nominated for big awards in the directing category which has only been ONCE which wasn't until Dunkirk. No one quite captures an audience like Nolan does. Nolan should not only be nominated, but should win for directing. Otherwise this would really question how credible the Oscars are. This is without a doubt one of Nolan's best written and directed movies of his whole career when less talented directors have been nominated for a whole lot less.",POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023",I loved it! ..educational,POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","One of my all time favourites, if you love Nolan then watch this film ASAP because it is about as Nolan as Nolan get's, a visual and audible spectacle. Every actor plays their part to perfection and if your name isn't Christopher Nolan, Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr or Emily Blunt then don't show up to the award shows!",POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","Exceptional. Many great performances, Emily Blunt's, Josh Hartnett's, RDJ's, Matt Damon all do extremely great but Cillian is just off the charts in this one. It is frankly incredible. Very well written, the 3h go by very fast. Not to mention the incredible score.",POSITIVE

"Jul 28, 2023",For the intellectual it's a masterpiece but I think some might struggle to follow and should maybe stick to Barbie. Brilliant film.,POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023",I thought it was excellent.  But would have been better without the scenes involving Florence Pugh.  Added absolutely nothing to the story.,POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","Pretentious and boring. Maybe, just maybe, if it was 90 minutes long. But still, chock full of self absorption in the characters as well as director. And the cinematography , esp the hand held camera scenes, was distracting. The final denouement degrades Robert Downing Jr's character into a two dimensional bond villain, just to achieve [unrealistic IMO] closure on Oppenheimer, who has always been, and always will be, an enigma.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","I just got back from watching Oppenheimer in IMAX and WOW just WOW. This movie is simply incredible and is most certainly Christopher Nolan's magnum opus. Both Cillian Murphy and Nolan deserve Oscars for this masterpiece. Murphy's performance as Oppenheimer was excellent from start to finish and he portrayed every aspect of the character incredibly. Oppenheimer is easily the best movie I have ever seen, hands down.",POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023",Oppenheimer is Christopher Nolan‚Äôs Best Film and it‚Äôs the Best Film of Year so far!,POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","Like so many others, I am a huge admirer of Christopher Nolan. And, judging from the ratings of critics as well as the audience, I was expecting it to be one of his best. But, every scene just seemed to be: Good acting/smart script... turn page... Good acting/smart script... turn page... which may seem like a recipe for a terrific film. But, this is a movie, not a picture book. The film never really drew me in and fully engaged me, the way a great film usually does. I honestly became so tired of it that I walked out after about 25% the way through. I understand from a critic who had the same experience that I did (Echo Chamberlain on YouTube) that the ""Los Alamos Hour"" did rise to the occasion. But he said the he could have skipped about 2 hours of the rest. I honestly don't understand how it can be as highly rated as it apparently is. But, at least I know there is one other Nolan fan who feels the same as I do...",NEGATIVE
"Jul 28, 2023",One of the best movies I've seen in cinema,POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","""Oppenheimer"" de Christopher Nolan es una joya cinematogr√°fica del 2023 que sumerge al espectador en la vida del cient√≠fico J. Robert Oppenheimer. El aclamado director logra una pel√≠cula monumental que combina el drama hist√≥rico con la √©pica cient√≠fica, sin perder de vista la esencia humana. El filme retrata la vida del tit√°n de la ciencia moderna, su brillantez acad√©mica, complejas relaciones personales y las inesperadas consecuencias de su trabajo con la energ√≠a at√≥mica. A trav√©s de actuaciones brillantes, una conmovedora m√∫sica y un gui√≥n cautivador, ""Oppenheimer"" reflexiona sobre el poder, la ciencia y la moral, desafiando nuestras concepciones sobre el progreso y la responsabilidad. A pesar de su duraci√≥n, el ritmo mantiene a la audiencia cautiva hasta su devastador cl√≠max, convirti√©ndola en una obra maestra de Nolan que equilibra la narrativa √©pica con una mirada √≠ntima a la lucha interna del cient√≠fico.

En el papel principal, Cillian Murphy ofrece una interpretaci√≥n impecable que lo posiciona como un fuerte candidato para el pr√≥ximo Oscar y hace de ""Oppenheimer"" probablemente la pel√≠cula m√°s importante de su carrera. El filme se destaca por su capacidad para contar una historia intensa y llena de dilemas, con un singular peso hist√≥rico. Desde la interacci√≥n con figuras hist√≥ricas como Albert Einstein hasta las conversaciones con los altos mandos militares, la pel√≠cula presenta momentos cinematogr√°ficos magistrales y una toma final impresionante que insin√∫a un mundo al borde del abismo nuclear. En conclusi√≥n, ""Oppenheimer"" es una introspecci√≥n intensa y espectacular sobre el 'Prometeo Americano', que nos recuerda el poder del cine para explorar la complejidad humana frente a la ciencia y la moral.",POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","Confused, noisy, chaotic, superficial. No character development, historically dodgy, lacking humour, politically one-sided, far too self-reverential.  
Oh, and Einstein was definitely not some sort of wise sage, but a deeply flawed person who was also a maths genius.

"Jul 28, 2023","Oppenheimer was one of the best movies I HAVE EVER SEEN. The visuals where out of my mind, The bass was so intense and powerfull I literally cannot describe it. Oppenheimer has had a pretty dramatic and how the US president called oppenheimer a cry baby. I could feel his emotions. Christopher nolan did an absolute banger. Putting this as my second favourite movie, going to see the movie again in full IMAX! 

Great job Chris. I wait to see what other fab work you will make/show in the upcoming years!",POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","Great movie! Yes three hours long but it keeps you hungry for more the entire time. Definitely need to watch in IMAX. Subtitles are preferred because of how fast everyone talks and the accents introduced in the movie. Great dialogue, amazing acting. Robert Downey Jr.'s character will blow you away, on top of Cillian Murphy's emotional roller coasters he goes through. 10/10.",POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","Nolan strikes again! All of this man's movies have had some impact. Although I have seen many ground breaking movies from Nolan, this might very well be his best.

But the worst part was we missed the beginning of the movie‚Äîit started and stopped a few times out of focus before they fixed so I‚Äôm not sure what happened the first few minutes. And since house lights are on a timer, they came one before the film finished.

My one complaint echoed by others is the muffled audio in much of the dialogue. But exceptional. ,POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","Let's admit it. Some of us got suckered into watching this in the barbenheimer combo. And there's good reason to believe it would've failed like tenet, hadn't leeched off the success of barbie in this social media meme-driven combo. This is a really long, boring and dour movie. The soundtrack blasting throughout the movie non-stop doesn't help you stay awake either. In fact, the lack of silence gaps makes the experience anesthetizing. There's also a lot of filler that I think doesn't help the movie. It could've been a lot shorter and leaner. You're better off watching a documentary series on the subject rather than watching this movie. At least you could pause it and view it at your own pace. And you're likely to come out better informed in the end. It really isn't good material for a movie. But it would've been great for a docudrama series.
Also, IMAX is completely overkill for this. It's not worth it. And I can't believe it got bumped over the newest mission impossible in IMAX theatres. SMH.
The fact they blew a huge portion of their budget on blowing up a real bomb, has got to be the most michael bay thing ever. Your auterism has to be put in check if no one points out how stupid that is.",NEGATIVE

Nolan acerta mais uma vez!",POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","Very poor story telling and all over the place. Does not tell 1 cohesive story. I had a lot of detail about the history and facts around that Manhattan project and Oppenheimer's life but this movie does a horrendous job in portraying that story. And if you are a layman without the historical context, forget it, you won't get anything from it. My friend who accompanied me to the movie, basically couldn't even summarize what the story was about after he spent 3 hours figuring it out. The cinematography that works for the dark night and other Batman/inception type movies works well
For action and the dark theme Chris Nolan genre but made no sense for this slow documentary style film. Really bad job C. Nolan. One size doesn't fit all.

Oh yea, I watched it in IMAX. This movie absolutely doesn't belong on the big screen. This is a small screen film with subtitles. Don't waste your money for IMAX. You'll see when you watch it.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","Leading up to the test at Los Alamos - 3 stars. After the test there: one star.

"Jul 28, 2023","Not as good as the book. This review is from the perspective of having read Kai Bird's excellent biography years ago. Christopher Nolan seems like an odd choice for this project. There was a relentless level of drama from start to finish, and Senate hearing scenes were done in black & white even though it was the actors in the scene, so it seemed odd. Oppenheimer was portrayed very well, I think. The Trinity test could have been done more clearly & effectively, & I kept looking for any visual hint of White Sands which is literally next door to the testing site. All in all, though, very good effort in putting on screen even in just 3 hours a complex story about a complex man in a complex and changing political situation.

"Jul 28, 2023","Everything I would say has been said, so I will keep it short: Oppenheimer is a masterpiece.

Regarding the criticisms:
-If you are looking for a film about the ethics of the development, testing, and use of ""The Bomb"" or the ensuing arms race- this is not that film, nor was it (or the book) intended to be.
-As someone who is very sensitive about how women are used in film, I thought Blunt portrayed the frustration and anger of educated, bright, talented women stuck in the roles of wives and mothers (women I knew growing up) brilliantly, while Pugh was passionately idealistic and emotionally fragile  in her smaller role. 
-That said, the film is a character study on one person- Oppenheimer-  with a strong secondary role for his antagonist Strauss. A large cast of excellent actors makes beautiful ""miniatures"" in their supporting roles.
-And yes, it is a long film without ""action"" sequences so don't expect it to be. We were all mesmerized the whole time and didn't notice the long sit (and I hate sitting). In fact, I am going to see it again next week.",POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","Truly  some of Nolan's best work. It's not going down as one of MY favorite films, but I think Nolan could retire and be happy after this film, seeing as how it truly is a masterwork within his specific craft. (I hope he doesn't retire though.)",POSITIVE

"Jul 28, 2023","This movie could have been more aptly titled ""The Oppenheimer/Lewis Strauss interminable feud"". At 3 hours, I had hoped for an in depth depiction of the Manhattan Project with a bit of physics and mechanical engineering dumbed down for a movie crowd, but willing to suck up some of the seedier details of Oppenheimer's life as part and parcel of the deal. As is, the movie shifts back and forth in time between the personal vendetta of Strauss vs. Oppenheimer and the effort to revoke his security clearance alternating with scantily fleshed out Manhattan Project. Would rather have seen Lawrence's cyclotron work at U235 separation and Seaborg's discovery of Plutonium than wallowing in 1930s Berkeley feeble academic communists thrashing and physicists hand wringing about dropping the bomb. At 3 hours, at least 80 minutes were endless yammering. It was like 12 Angry Men meets the Manhattan Project.
Saw it in IMAX and sound effects/music overwhelmed the dialogue. It was very unpleasant, and felt like I needed closed captions for some parts. The Trinity Test shock wave blast was the only appropriate use of the IMAX sound system. 
Good acting was unable to save this loser. 
Not a movie I would ever want to watch a second time.",NEGATIVE

Fabulous movie, worth seeing on the big screen, with a really tricky yet totally cohesive script - well done to the writers.  Superb acting, with Robert Downey standing out amongst giants. Mr Oppenheimer himself remains an ambiguous character, a hugely capable man...but hard to decipher his true motives - that is left for the audience to post rationalise. Gripping despite we all know what happened, and with borderline perfect direction and script - you wont feel the 3 hours as long at all.

The movie contextualizes his life in the turbulent times between the world wars and Machartism. 
Based on the book ""American Prometheus,"" the film portrays not only historical events but also delves into the physicist's personal and political struggles. 
Directed and written by Christopher Nolan, the film showcases brilliant performances from Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr.
The practical effects and cinematography, especially the use of IMAX, add to the immersive experience, while the soundtrack by Ludwig G√∂ransson enhances the emotional impact. 
Although the film features a vast array of characters, it delivers an engaging narrative that captivates the audience throughout its approximately three-hour runtime. 
""Oppenheimer"" is a cinematic masterpiece that surpasses expectations and is a must-watch experience in theaters.",POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023",Phenomenal film. Captivating. Every cast member delivered stellar performances. Nolan is a true artist in filmmaking.,POSITIVE

"Jul 28, 2023",Fabulous amazing must watch,POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023",Another piece of art from Christopher Nolan. A true cinematic experience that leaves you thinking. Truly well made down to every small detail.,POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","This movie is over hyped more than any piece of media I've seen in the last decade. It is not a bad film by any means but in my opinion it fails to even be a truly special Nolan film let alone the ""savior of Hollywood""",NEUTRAL
"Jul 28, 2023","The movie is great, the best movie I have seen in my life. The effects are just so perfect as well the visual and dialogue. Specially, I like the OST, its just perfection. I really recommend you to see it, you wont regret, trust me!!",POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","3 hours of movie and still felt too much smashed together, it still good but not the best Nolan work",NEUTRAL
"Jul 28, 2023","First and foremost - the acting by every actor was truly absolutely stellar, and makes the movie well worth watching.  And there were many small, intelligent clues to relatedness smoothly interjected -- as an example, works by Picasso as influence upon Oppenheimer's thinking, and subtle reveals of his eidetic memory. Some critics have described 'sweeping cinematography', though I did not find it all that sweeping:  indeed, yes, there were several beautiful scenes of southwestern open skies and color palette, among its ruggedly gorgeous arid hills and buttes.  Yet there were missed opportunities to better depict the scope, impact, and object of Oppenheimer's explosive work.  In the end the ugliness of academic jealousies played out tellingly in the kangaroo courts of McCarthyism, as well as the compromising effects of human failings, weakness, and self-justification. Yet I and those with me found it too frequently difficult to recognize where we were in the timeline (despite using the advancing grayness of Oppenheimer's hair as one useful cue), muddying the complex interwoven lines of relationship and emotional causation.  A film well worth seeing, but I'll not contend it's flawless.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 28, 2023",The length seems justified by the gravity of the issues at stake. The breadth of characters was possibly too large to get the depth right on each but this was handled without becoming dull or too superficial. Not sure the pornographic scenes added to the experience but they were brief. The movie is carried by outstanding acting which has to be career best for several of them. Very good story telling of an epic and consequential tale. The tragic hero is neither canonized nor vilified. He's was an amazing human with unparalleled genius but with all the human failures. Well done.,POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023",Very slow moving.   Unless you're really into physics or the history of the subject I'd pass on it.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","This film was the best Biopic I've ever seen. Christopher Nolan always delivers bangers and this was no exception. He was so clever with the story's narrative, having a non linear manner of storytelling and the use of flashbacks. Like Memento, he used colour and black and white to distinguish scenes between subjective view of Oppenheimer and and objective view which was in black and white. Let's talk about the actors. Every single cast member ate and left no crumbs. Cillian Murphy delivered a captivating performance as oppenheimer and his co stars such as RDJ, Matt Damon and Emily Blunt were brilliant as supporting actors in the film. The score for film fit so well, it allowed the viewers a to fully immerse ourselves in the film. The storyline was perfection. The build up to the Trinity test and the following legal battle faced by Robert J Oppenheimer was told in way that was so appealing and engaging for the audience to watch. I am definitely going to watch this film again in the near future. Let's hope it wins some well deserved oscars!",POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023",I had high hopes for this movie but it was a bit disappointing. it should have been shorter and some money spent on special effects it needed less jumping between time and more of the bomb,NEGATIVE
"Jul 28, 2023",10/10 one of the best movies of the 21st century,POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","There should be an oscar for marketing. This movie is overhyped. Most of the casts are excellent, but the movie itself tried to cramp too many stories in it, so nothing is truly meaningful. Cilian Murphy carried all the weight by himself. The soundtracks are  often do not match with the scenes, and in some cases are too loud.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 28, 2023","Christopher Nolan's 12th film delivers an entrancing experience, exposing the humanity behind the epochal decisions that not only brought World War II to a definitive end, but also set in motion the relentless ticking of the doomsday clock. 

The visual brilliance brought to life by cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema is nothing short of a symphony for the eyes. Hoytema skillfully captures the essence of the characters and the gravity of their choices, transporting us back in time and allowing us to witness the weight and human cost of scientific breakthrough. 

Throughout the film, G√∂ransson's emotionally charged score engulfs the audience in a contemplative dread that mirrors the very essence of Oppenheimer's frozen blue gaze. The music pulsates with every beat of our hearts, underscoring the moral paradox faced by Oppenheimer and the few men in power who grapple with the consequences of their actions.

Nolan showcases his ability to entangle historical events with an important and profound examination of human nature. The film serves as a poignant reminder of the decisions that shaped the course of history and the lasting impact they have on the world as we know it. Nolan's deft storytelling paints the vulnerabilities, insecurities, fears, and ambitions of power-hungry men, leaving the audience with haunting reflections about those currently in control. 

""Oppenheimer"" is a must-see film that reaffirms Nolan's place among the finest filmmakers of our time.",POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","Even though 3 hours, didn't feel that long. Had a nice pace to it. Learned things about Oppenheimer I hadn't known before. I will say that I don't think it's a requirement to see this movie in IMAX or other laser equivalents. IMAX is best for bold action movies and this doesn't qualify. Except for the scene where they test explode the first device in New Mexico, and even that was sort of subdued, there wasn't any ""bold"" action. More into the personalities associated with the Manhattan project and Dr Oppenhiemer. I happened to see the movie in a standard theater and it was just fine.",POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023",Sensacional. Adapta√ß√£o excelente!,POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","Christopher Nolan is an incredible film director who like Oppenheimer coordinates a talented team to achieve excellence. He is a gifted storyteller capable of weaving an intricate narrative. However, in his latest film he cynically assumes that audiences lack the sophistication to understand the math or physics behind the development of the atomic bomb and the geopolitical forces at play. In addition there are only passing references to the brutal battles taking place on land, at sea and in the skies. Nolan offers no depiction of the plight of Jews in Europe or even mentions the Jewish refugees turned away at the border while others are sought to develop a weapon of unimaginable destruction. 

Once the mania subsides film lovers are sure to agree that Oppenheimer papered over an important historical figure and monumental events worthy of more time and consideration. Don't mistake duration for substance.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","This movie is‚Ä¶""heavy,"" to sum it up in one word; although, that would not do it justice. Oppenheimer was a name I never even heard of until seeing this movie. The Manhattan Project was also something I barely understood, aside from the fact that it was a top secret project that was responsible for creating the Atomic Bomb. This movie opened my eyes to what really happened in that New Mexico desert and who was behind all of it. It is safe to say this movie really blew me away (no pun intended). The film portrays Oppenheimer's complex personality, contradicting beliefs, and subsequent downfall very emotionally. One can only imagine the psyche of someone deemed ""the Father of the Atomic Bomb.""",POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","Best movie in a long time. So well done and the acting is superb. It‚Äôs long, but worth it. I‚Äôd sit through it again.",POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","3 hours of pure jibberish 
Hard to follow, poor ending and underwhelming",NEGATIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","Though the acting in this film is phenomenal and will likely result in numerous awards, I question the directors choice to tell this story in such a cold, distant way. The timeline hops, that Nolan so loves to use, didnt allow me time to get attached to any of the characters enough to care about their outcome, and there were so many characters that were introduced with little background information or character development, that it was difficult keeping track of them all. It also felt way too long and could easily have been cut to well below the current runtime without any loss to the story. The sound mixing also turned me off a bit. I sat in an IMAX theater, which has optimal sound, and there were still scenes where the dialogue was a bit garbled, however, the explosions and rafter pounding were deafening. I get that the director was trying to use the sound level to increase tension, but he went a little overboard there. I was bored through most of the middle and kept looking at my watch to see how much longer before I could leave. However, the last 15 minutes were interesting. Overall, the way the subject matter was presented distanced me from the story so much that I felt nothing, and I couldnt help but wonder how this subject matter would have felt in the hands of another director who has the ability to elicit human emotion.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","Absolutely, fantastic film, and the film that cinema was needing, wonderful ..",POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","In my top 3 for best Christopher Nolan films of all time, Cillian Murphy delivers an Oscar worthy performance",POSITIVE

"Jul 28, 2023","Fantastic filming, cinematography, sound, etc. But the chronology was difficult to follow, the bomb development was nearly ignored, and the movie was overly focused on the actions of the antagonist (played excellently by R. Downey).  I left feeling disappointed, feeling the fun could have been so much more.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 28, 2023","Am I the only that enjoyed the last hour just as much as the first two hours of the movie? I'm a sucker for well-done courtroom dramas, and the level of intensity Jason Clarke, Robert Downey Jr., Emily Blunt, and Cillian Murphy bring to the table is outstanding. Brilliantly directed, excellent pace, visuals out of this world, and audio that's more than definitely award-winning are just some of the reasons you should watch this one. I already got my tickets for a second screening!",POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023",Went into the movie thinking it will be action movie. But it was more like Imitation Game (movie). It has slow setup but I liked the last 2 hours. Nice variety from Nolan after Tenet. May be the runtime can be reduced by 20-30 mins. The actors Murphy and RDJ were good. Overall satisfied with the movie.,POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023",This movie put the wiring of this entire world on us. A deep meaningful movie. Visuals and the sound design is yet again the best,POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","Before the movie, I highly suggest drinking a solid shot of double espresso. You will need to be alert and all your facilities sharp. We all know the story. The leading up to building the bomb, and how Oppenheimer was chosen for the project and the team he assembled, and the success of the project comprised the first half. Very interesting and detailed, but a bit slow in the pacing. 
   Now the 2nd half was something else! Pure drama, which involves the trial of Oppenheimer, as he fights to clear his name of any communist tendencies, Of course, according to the movie, Lewis Strauss, who was on the committee to push for a H-bomb, felt slighted by Oppenheimer, and thus started a personal vendetta against him, basically stating he was an in the closet Communist. Here is my biggest concern, how real was this slight, and how much for dramatic effect. Especially the conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein, which Strauss felt like he was being talked about behind his back. I tend to think that was non-existent   in real life, but who knows. 
   My one big technical complaint is the mixing of the voices and music, which tends to be director Christopher Nolans style. Very annoying, when there are important conversations happening and the music is overpowering the talking. 
   Aside from that, great historical flick which everybody could learn from.",POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","I expected something totally different than the movie delivered. I did like the plot, but after the ""experiment"" it ran on.  It was difficult to hear the voices over the sound fx. Perhaps it couldve been balanced better as I was actually thinking they should turn on closed captioning. Overall 3 star from me.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 28, 2023","In a good way, Einstein's ""cospoor"" from the movie Oppenheimer didn't convince me. Horrible and with stupid expression more like an ""angry grandma""... Trash. Other than that the ""Einstein"" in the film should have appeared more and that they showed Einstein reluctantly writing a famous letter to Roosevelt for the U.S. to make the atomic bomb before Hitler, to show the stress on Lise Meitner and Aotto Hann under pressure from the Nazis... and the film itself should have ended by showing the Hiroshima and Nagasaki explosions. They didn't show it, and yet a weak Trinity detonation in Alamogordo, New Mexico, was very badly done. They also reduced Richard Feynmann to a beater instead of showing how was expressive his participation in the Manhattan project. From the middle to the end of the film they took an unnecessary stretch of the spying court case that Oppenheimer endured.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","""Oppenheimer"" is an awe-inspiring masterpiece that exemplifies Christopher Nolan's unparalleled brilliance as a filmmaker. Rarely does a film possess such profoundness, that it leaves me utterly speechless. Cillian Murphy's portrayal of Oppenheimer is nothing short of extraordinary, capturing the complexities of the character with sheer brilliance. The entire ensemble cast delivers exceptional performances, elevating the film to greater heights.

Nolan's directing prowess shines through every frame, weaving a gripping narrative that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The editing is seamless, effortlessly transitioning between timelines and character perspectives, adding layers of depth to the storytelling. Ludwig Goransson's haunting score complements the film's emotional depth, enhancing every scene with a perfect blend of intensity and poignancy. The cinematography is breathtaking, capturing the essence of each era with stunning visual elegance.""Oppenheimer"" reaffirms Nolan's reputation as a visionary storyteller, masterfully blending history, science, and human drama into a profound cinematic experience. It is a thought-provoking exploration of the moral dilemmas surrounding scientific advancements and their far-reaching consequences.

In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" stands as one of Christopher Nolan's finest works, an exquisitely crafted symphony of storytelling that resonated deeply with me. It is a true testament to the power of cinema and a must-watch for anyone seeking an intellectually stimulating and emotionally resonant cinematic journey.",POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","A tour de force of a film, expansive, engrossing and challenging in equal measure. The narrative is both complex in its layering and time-shifting and yet as direct as an arrow, just one of the many and profound paradoxes which it puts before you to consider. It works on every level: the actors are superb, Cillian Murphy and his icy-blue eyes hold you throughout, while a galaxy of characters fill out the screen. It is hugely authentic, with no obvious CGI and few over-dramatised hysterics, despite the momentuous of the subject. Like the final apocalyptic images leaking into Oppemheimer's own brain, it will linger long in your head.",POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","Great movie! The pacing is somewhat slow but any issues regarding this are compensated by the extreme quality of this film's sound design. The film follows two timelines and although it's somewhat confusing they are clearly separated by having one of them in black and white, making it more digestible. Great start and specially the ending, which for me made me forget about the last hour of the movie which is not as good as the two previous ones. Go Oppie!",POSITIVE

"Jul 28, 2023","Enjoyed the presentation of the history, but the movie and plot felt a little disjointed.  There was not enough about the actual nuts and bolts of making the bomb and too much repetitive politics across 3 or 4 time lines.  Also some of the dialog was hard to hear and understand.  entire sentences felt mumbled, whispered or lost in the soundtrack.  It was entertaining but felt long, and honestly the bomb itself was a little underwhelming.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 28, 2023","It's hard to articulate all the thoughts, but y'all remember when we used to be kids and watched Batman and lived the character for a few days? Cillian Murphy had a similar impact on me. Ludwig G√∂ransson's score was perfect and will not let you miss Hans Zimmer. Screenwriting is something Christopher Nolan has mastered since Memento. Can we call Oppenheimer Nolan's best work? I'd say no! But this will be considered a film that is unique from the other films he has made. Can we call it Cillian Murphy's best role? A big yes! Because of the superhero movies, we often forget how great an actor Robert Downey is. As Lewis Strauss, he blew everyone's mind! Magnificent actors, Incredible storytelling and Engaging music. A simple 8/10. The only complaint is the run time. I felt like 15 mins from the court room drama can be trimmed.",POSITIVE

"Jul 28, 2023","The movie was well made and beautifully shot. However, it is being extremely overhyped. It is a true biopic that spends too much time focusing on the question of patriotic loyalty.

Yes, it's a biographical film and a lot of interesting characters included along the way, including Einstein, but overrated by miles. The sound effects and crazy demos were a little bit OTT at times, with an attempt at trying to make you get excited but that never happens. I slept 2/3 of the film, much too uncharacteristic and boring for me.  The scene switch between colour and greyscale, order of events, the speed of speech and the over complicated language at times will find the viewing difficult for many. 3 hours too long.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 28, 2023","Too Long - 3 HRs, Too Loud.  Oppenheimer's relationships both personal and professional were hard to follow.  Most important, the Dialogue was HARD TO UNDERSTAND, I tried really hard to read lips as often as I could see lips onscreen, but the Audio mix somehow obscured the whispering dialogue.  Here is another film where the Celebrity cast and their faces on screen time overshadowed critical expository fact-sharing.   This film assumes the viewer has a strong grasp of WW2 History, I am a pretty smart 58-year-old and I know about Hitler, Russia, and Japan but not in the sort of detail the filmmakers expect of me.  My wife and 17-year-old were bored to tears by the overly political aspects of the film.  The movie trailer in retrospect felt deceitful as it showed large landscapes, and wide open scenery which was really only about 10% of the film, the rest was talking heads in classrooms or deposition offices, so this film Did NOT warrant the extra $7 per ticket for the IMAX experience.  I suggest streaming this at home later, with Subtitles On, after watching a documentary about WW2.    I did love watching Robert Downey Jr, my all-time favorite actor, wow he looked great in such a mature role.   Matt Damon was good too, looked like either He or his Character are struggling with Alcohol, a puffy face, and eyes.   Ok, see it but at home with Subtitles.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 28, 2023",In a word: fantastic (but that might be cutting it short.) Probably one of the best drama biopics of all time. Provides a great microcosm of what Americanism means. Displays the potential dangers of scientific evolution and the cut-throatedness of many government figures.,POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","This film has to be the worst Christopher Nolan film ever. The majority of the film consists of men walking or sitting and talking with dramatic music in the background, always with one person sitting on the sofa. The scenes felt very repetitive, lacking any iconic moments. Moreover, there was only one explosion, which was just okay.

Additionally, the film lacked substance in exploring the psychological aspects of Oppenheimer. The portrayal of women in this film was utterly and horrifically regressive. Most scenes involving women and children showing them in tears, and when not crying, women were portrayed in a sexualized and pornographic manner, rather than a genuine portrayal of love. Women were often interrupted by men throughout the film.

Furthermore, the word ‚Äúcommunism‚Äù was thrown into the scenes frequently, like receiving notifications on your phone, to the point that it lost its meaning in the context of the film. The constant glorification of men talking non-stop in various settings exhibited a sense of emptiness and lacked the film magic one would expect.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 28, 2023","Oppenheimer was a remarkable historical film, and watching it on the big screen made for an unforgettable experience. The moment the Trinity Test detonated was undoubtedly the greatest scene in cinematic history, as Christopher Nolan's decision to not rely on CGI and only rely on practical effects brought an unmatched authenticity to the first atomic bomb explosion's recreation.",POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","Intelligent, thoughtful, extraordinarily acted and directed.  Visually riveting.  Like many, i'd argue that it could lose at least half and hour.  Having said that, it's an exceptional film",POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023",The production quality and special effects of this movie alone is worth watching. The special effects team managed to create a very real experience for the audience without the use of CGI. The heaviness of this movie will stick with you long after the 3 hour run time. An incredibly well done historical piece that leaves the audience wanting to go learn more about Oppenheimer and his work (at least me). A must see and a 2023 best movie top contender in my book.,POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023",BEST MOVIE EVER MADE!!!! Hands down the greatest film of the year maybe the century!!!!,POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023",Nolan neglected to lay ANY foundation that would help today‚Äôs audiences understand the political climate & dark influences of Communism. Oppenheimer‚Äôs sexual escapades were so unnecessary - WHY? The one saving grace is Robert Downey Jr who gives an absolutely stellar performance as kraise.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","very, very not like anything of Christopher Nolan - very disappointing...
movie about and endless interrogation process and internal spiritual struggle of the main hero...

"Jul 28, 2023",Mind bending explosive in your face movie. The Best Nolan movie so far,POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","Oppenheimer delivers such a grounded film, I was at a loss of words on how to describe after finishing watching it. I was actually pretty happy to see that the film focused a lot on the aftermath of the end of the war, and Cillian Murphy did a great job as Oppenheimer. If there is one film to see this year, Oppenheimer is that movie.",POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023",I was blown away!!!!,POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023",This movie captures both the overwhelming triumph and the infamous downfall of J. Robert Oppenheimer. Christopher Nolan beautifully crafts this genius story with the use of sound elements throughout the movie and fantastically choreographed scenes. Nolan's lack of CGI use also amazes me.,POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","This movie is absolutely spectacular. First of all, to understand the context of the movie, you have to have somewhat of an understanding in physics, mathematics, world relations, etc. I feel like being older should be required just to simply understand what is going on at all times in the movie. Past that, the visual production, writing, music, sound production, basically everything. We're extremely high quality. The pace of the movie starts out slower but picks up as it goes on and creates more excitement. Overall, I went through a wide range of emotions watching this movie and I enjoyed it so much. It is definitely worth watching many times.",POSITIVE

"Jul 28, 2023","I'm not gonna lie... I fell asleep for a little while. It's too long and the second half is only people talking, so I got lost between all those names and characters, well, it was a great film, kinda boring but in a good way, in a Oscar-winning-movie way.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 28, 2023","What a movie, I didn't expect it to be that good.
Cilian Murphy deserves an Oscar",POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023",Nolan doesn't keep his ego in check and goes almost an hour over what the Oppenheimer length should be. Nolan's cinematography saves the movie from absolute failure.,NEUTRAL
"Jul 28, 2023","Top-flight acting, imaginative story-telling getting inside the head of the characters.",POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023",A cinematic master piece. Murphy is simply superb - Best Actor winner. Robert Downey Jr Best Supporting Actor. The story is told very well and the ensemble cast Is definitively unique and well cast. GO SEE THIS FILM,POSITIVE

"Jul 28, 2023","What a Oscar worthy performance by Cillian Murphy, RDJr, and Emily Blunt. Nolan should polished his acceptance speech for Best Director and Best Picture!!!",POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","I was really excited to see this movie, especially because I lived in Japan for a few years and have been to Nagasaki. 
It was not worth the hype. It could have been condensed to 2 hours easily. 
I kept waiting for the movie to get going and then it was over. 
All it was was really loud. I found Oppenheimer to be spineless and very disappointing.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 28, 2023","Una excelente pel√≠cula, funciona como Biopic y como Triller.",POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","Slow, boring, good cast but could have been a 45 minute movie. Murphy mumbles for half the movie and couldn‚Äôt understand him most of the movie. Repeated dialogue for the last hour/first hour and actual bomb story was 25 minutes with absolutely no action. Mission Impossible was miles better and even Indiana Jones was better. Don‚Äôt understand the great reviews, don‚Äôt waste 3.5 hours of your time and money.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","Long? Yes but every scene is well deserved. The acting, cinematography, directing, and music is amazing. Do I wish it showed more of the actual bomb? Yes but I understand why Nolan didn‚Äôt show the bomb more. Because it‚Äôs a movie about Oppenheimer not the bomb. Nolan is an expert in weaving back and forth between different times then bringing it all together in the end.",POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023",Absolutely loved the movie! The only movie that I have watched that I am going to watch it again.,POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023",This movie was an hour and a half longer than it needed to be and still managed to accomplish almost nothing. It was like sitting in a college lecture where the teacher is reading a Wikipedia page.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 28, 2023",The R rating took away from the story.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 28, 2023",An incredibly well done story of the father of the atomic bomb. An electrifying score by Ludwig Gorannson and tremendous acting done by a well selected and talented cast. Cillian Murphy delivers one of if not the best acting performances of the 2020's. A one of a kind experience that is a must see in IMAX to truly see the scale of a film directed by the always terrific Christopher Nolan.,POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","Gritty and tough to digest, but sensational. You can see a fantastic cinematographic upgrade from Nolan's previous works, where the acting, the pacing, and the scenes convey to make of Oppenheimer a must-see to everyone. As consistent as Cillian Murphy is on portraying dark but captivating characters, it's not surprising he puts on a clinic, but we cannot look overlook the long-played performances of RDJ, Damon and Blunt, and the short but well versed appearances of Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Gary Oldman.",POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023",Incredible with 70mm,POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","Honestly, one of the best movies I have ever seen. I‚Äôve seen it twice now and it gets better.",POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","3 Hours Of Peak Cinema, Nolans Greatest Work Yet.",POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","While the visuals in the movie are great when the explosion and other action scenes happen, I would say about 80-90% of the movie is bureaucratic and very boring at times.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 28, 2023","Wow, intense three hours movie. Be warned that it can be loud and has a couple nude sex scenes.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 28, 2023",A film where you leave the theatre and look around differently. It really makes you think about how something this extraordinary is true and happened.,POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","It was a masterpiece, the beginning to the end had me in absolute shock, I got so so quiet because I couldn't even express myself",POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023",The only drawback is it is long. The movie is top notch and what a cast.,POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","It's a good movie, and it's worth your buck. That being said it's a commitment, and I think Nolan bit off a bit more than he could chew here. The framing devices go a long way to stretch the enormity of the subject matter from one edge of the screen to the other, but the stress lines show in the score and the casting and the tired portrayal of a one-note tortured genius. 

As an example: during the build-up to the Trinity test bomb, you see the anxiety (well portrayed) on the faces of the characters as a count-down proceeds, music swelling, and shots getting tighter on the characters faces. Afraid of the potentially world annihilating moment that is about to happen. Well done. But as an audience member this overload of sound  goes on for too long, becomes almost painful and then the moment happens and it is not the moment, it is the start of a 20 minute countdown! Very funny mr.Nolan you got me. But it was not fun, it was not enjoyable, and the gravity of what you are talking about is not respected. You want us to respect the enormity of this creation yet you use levity at these moments like we are dim-wits. You give very little respect to those actually annihilated by the contraption (or whatever euphemism you used) while painting a simplistic portrait of the nomme-du-questierr. 

The portrayal of the test was incredible though. I have only scene archival footage in black and white that does not capture the reality. When I saw the world become an unavoidable wall of flame that encompasses everything i saw my darkest dreams rushing at me. I don't know if it is good to portray such things that inspire such nightmares, but you did it well.

The score was awesome but it felt at times like a crutch, it's too loud. I was thankful when silence came during the film not because it informed the scene, but I can finally evacuate myself. 

In conclusion I liked your film mister Nolan, but I have some major nit-picks that I would be less than happy to discuss with you‚Ä¶ (I could carry on but the baby needs changing, much like your film I feel)",NEUTRAL
"Jul 28, 2023","Felt like a 3 hour long trailer. The use of sound was not well thought out. Building up suspense during random scenes with talking in a room did not work in its favor and this was done constantly. I am become death was said too many times which ruined its meaning. If you want to watch Oppenheimer, the documentary is much more enlightening and entertaining without over the top theatrics.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 28, 2023",I loved it! I think it will be a real Oscar contender! The bad- it‚Äôs a little too long.,POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023",Nice tone. A little slow and long. Worth watching. Don‚Äôt need to see again. ,NEUTRAL
"Jul 28, 2023",I did the Barbenheimer weekend and this by far was the better film. Great acting and practical effects. This movie is for the adults and Barbie is for the woke gen Z crowd that wouldn't know history unless it involves Tik Tok and being an entitled and privileged unemployed wuss. Oppenheimer is going to clean up at the Academy Awards.,POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023",5 stars. No BS. I loved it.,POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023",Some scenes were a bit slow but entertaining.,POSITIVE

"Jul 28, 2023",LA MEJOR PELICULA DEL A√ëO ASI COMO EL MEJOR DIRECTOR,POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023",Brilliance. The score. The social and moral dilemmas. The sets. The emotion.,POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","I did not feel that the movie was entertaining as such but I really felt it was brilliantly directed, produced and acted.  From researching it was without doubt a very credible and accurate version based on biographical and historical details available.  I would recommend seeing this movie.  One thing that really helped in understanding the movie was recognizing that the black and white parts of the movie were seen through the perspective of the role that Robert Downey Jrs part, whereas the color through predominantly the role of J Robert Oppenheimer.  You can make your own decision about how you feel about the movie but I enjoyed it and will see it again and will definitely purchase it when it is released generally to the public.  My only criticism is that I did not feel that the sex scenes really added to the story and to me detracted from the movie, otherwise it was incredible.",POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023",Very slow. Felt like a 6 hour movie. Not well done at all. Skip it.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","Oppenheimer is a very good movie, starring Cillian Murphy as Robert J. Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb. The film is rated R for nudity and sexual themes, so many women are walking out of the theater for what they perceive to be patriarchal oppression. Though that part didn't personally bother me, Christopher Nolan could've deleted those scenes to get a PG-13 rating so the film could've grossed more money. Anyway, Oppenheimer's runtime is 3 hours 15 minutes.

Now I really think Oppenheimer would be difficult for non-American audiences to fully appreciate and non-native English-speaking audiences to catch all the dialogue. The film is very dialogue heavy and the beat in the background is loud enough that you'll have to strain your ears. The film in general is difficult to fully grasp because of the huge cast of characters and the fractured narrative of the script. Lots of times, the film is in black and white. Nolan is also fixated on the historicity of the script such as when a general said, ""I don't want to drop the bomb on Kyoto because of its huge cultural significance and because my wife and I honeymooned there."" Or when Oppenheimer said, ""Now that we've finished our work at Los Alamos, I plan to give the land back to the Indians."" Anyone not familiar with the history of the Manhattan Project would probably miss those lines of real-life lore.

What really impressed me was how the film was basically broken up into three parts. The first part was about Oppenheimer's personal and academic life and how he theorized the atom bomb thanks to Albert Einstein's work in the field. The second part was when the general (Matt Damon) built a town in the New Mexico desert at Los Alamos so Oppenheimer could make and test the bomb. The third part was about the government interrogation of Oppenheimer's ties to communism and the bad guy named Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) who wanted to be appointed to a presidential cabinet position and gain bureaucratic powers setting Oppenheimer up for failure. Thus the movie's themes and subplots wove together like an elegant tapestry. My only problem is that the film is so dialogue heavy, you can't lose focus for a single scene. Cillian Murphy who I enjoyed as Thomas Shelby from Peaky Blinders stole the show",POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","Amazzing! Sound, actors e and history.",POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023",3 hours was a little to long but story is great,NEUTRAL
"Jul 28, 2023","I'd probably give it 5 stars if I had managed to hear more of what they said, unfortunately with the classic Nolan audio I only managed to catch roughly 70% of the conversation. 
Still a masterpiece, though even if I had hoped to see more about them making the bomb.",POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","Nolan delivers an immersive and captivating biopic that is thought provoking, and fascinating!",POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","""I have become death, the destroyer of worlds.""
Line, which comes from the Hindu sacred text Bhagavad-Gita.

Oppenheimer is without a doubt a masterpiece and more so in IMAX, it may not be the kind of cinema that appeals to the masses, but it's cinema for people like me.
The cinematography, the soundtrack, the dialogue, the performances (I can't choose between Cillian Murphy's performance, Robert Downey Jr's, Matt Damon's, Emily Blunt's, even Tom Conti's performance as Albert Einstein who despite being so fleeting is a real treat and I would have wanted him to be on screen more), if this film doesn't sweep the Oscars it would be a real injustice, but we already know that currently in Hollywood and the academy there is an epidemic of mentally retarded people who put aside quality and now measure a film by its level of inclusivity.
The IMAX room was packed, they had to delay the movie because of the line to buy food, I think everyone was getting ready to applaud at the end but the last sentence that Oppenheimer says to Albert Einstein had an impact effect, transforming the final reaction into collective terror and stopped the ovation.
Sublime!",POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023",Very educational an easy to follow,POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023",Finally a movie for adults.  And one that will stick with you long after the three hours on the screen.,POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","Brilliant and beautiful. Very documentary-oriented rather than focusing on the atomic bomb. Dialogue, plot, and story was very well written and kept me wanting more by the end of the 3rd hour mark.",POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","Honestly, for years I viewed many movies. There were NO movies like Oppenheimer. It was amazing enough to blow my mind with IMAX visuals and sounds. I read the American Prometheus. in the past. The film was so superb true story about famous scientists who worked on Project Y. Christopher Nolan did an outstanding job along with the actors. The bottom line, I do not doubt that they will get an Oscar award next year.",POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023",The picture of the year.,POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023",Superb. I don't know what else to say.,POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023",Oppenheimer was amazing! And the score worked its way through my bones! See it in IMAX!!,POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","There's not a single moment without background score, except for the bomb explosion. It always bothers me when a film requires background music for everything, even quiet conversations, that nothing is good enough to survive without musical support.  Also bleach bypassing IMAX seems a real waste - why use a lab process that increases grain and reduces contract ratio on the highest resolution film medium available? It all feels pretty one note, style over substance. Dry. Given Nolan's limitless resources it should be much more rounded. I didn't care about anyone, or even really get to know anyone, including Oppenheimer. Overall really disappointing and all the glowing reviews to me feel like everyone has drunk the Kool Aid. The emperor has no clothes. Not sure how much I'm influenced by having read the biography it's based on. Dr George Miller used to say that a film should feel like a great piece of music with highs, lows, quiet, crescendos, pacing. This feels like one very long chorus, and not a great one at that.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","Cillian Murphy is a god. Supporting cast gives fantastic performances all around. So fast paced, doesn't feel like 3hrs.",POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023","Un gran film que trata un tema importante y dif√≠cil de representar de forma excelente, muy buen elenco con un Cilian Murphy genial. Masterclass de Nolan",POSITIVE

"Jul 27, 2023",The worse sound design ever! There is nothing neither creative nor original in constant overwhelming music on the background that undervalues the plot and all the dialogues! And to take such an important and such a horrible event in a human history as creation of a nuclear weapon and to turn in into a squabble between a politician and a scientist is just an offense to tragedy of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. But even as a political drama the film is boring and confusing. I wish I watched it with a remote control - I would skip 2/3 of it for sure. But sound design?  its just brutal on your ears!,NEGATIVE
"Jul 27, 2023",one of the best movies I've seen all year,POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2023",Cillian's intensity is mind blowing!! Nolan's screenplay & directing is literally 'out of this world'!! All of the supporting cast are truly incredible but Downey wins Oscar for supporting actor. Editing Oscar for Jennifer Lame for deftly integrating this masterpiece.,POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2023","Such a masterpiece, really powerful movie on a topic I previously knew little about. Christopher Nolan has done it again",POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2023",Christopher Nolan's newest film in an IMAX cinemas last night. Would highly recommend if you're interested in the history of Oppenheimer. As this is more a documentary than a movie which is expected because it's based on a true story.,POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2023","Rocket science needed to understand the particulars and to appreciate the politics and underhandedness of the investigators.  Couldn't keep up with the pace of this.

"Jul 27, 2023",One of the best movies I've ever seen. The raw intensity of the visual design and sound designs left me flabbergasted. That mixed with Nolan's masterclass and an incredible ensemble of actors made this movie.,POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2023",One of the best Nolan films in terms of pacing and performances.  Saw it in IMAX 15/70mm at AMC Lincoln-Square.  Loved this movie I've already seen it twice.,POSITIVE

"Jul 27, 2023","This film is BRILLIANT!  I usually would go into an in-depth review for a cinematic masterpiece as this will eventually be of that stature, but when reading a long and erudite review of a film, one tends to disjoint themselves from the actual film - instead of a thriving and creating a thwarting unit as a whole - the reviewer seems to dissect the film and add too many nuances that should be determined by the viewer - and loses the initial blast of self-realization as you watch the story unfold.  All I really want to say at this point (I have viewed it three times already, as I tend to return and explore different facets of the cinematic art work) is that the old adage of ""NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED"" and for every genius in our mortal world there will be a denier - in this case - the horrific HUAC that did more than just eradicate truths in their trials to flesh out so-called Communists, but destroyed lives and careers.  If one really seeks to find out more about the HUAC, please read relevant works (written at the time of those McCarthy trials) such as The Crucible by Arthur Miller (it was NOT about Salem - but the witch hunts of the HUAC).  Also, see High Noon, the film where a man stands alone to fight off his determined 'killers' while the townspeople he helped now hide away and offer no support.  Yes, OPPENHEIMER had to stand alone and deal with the distrust after he literally saved this nation.  Only a true human can bear up to the real forces of evil.  This is a must see and possibly see again, to understand the real impact of this tortured soul and those who assume that he needs to be tortured by them.  Do not miss this film, especially, the performance of Robert Downey, Jr as Strauss...both he and Cillian Murphy are beyond stellar! Thank you, Christopher Nolan for making this film in a world of CGI's, action heroes, and comic book films...this is the REAL CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE!",POSITIVE

Was it a good script? Meh. Exposition much? I get it he's adapting a monstrous book! But he is no Sorkin to adapt a story like this. 

The directing was perfection. However, not his best. Dark Knight had much better directing. 

Great acting. Great cinematography. 

Still, there's something about the film overall I can fully love‚Ä¶ yet. I'll give it another chance soon.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 27, 2023",This movie jumped around too much. The sound was very loud to the point of distortion. And I'm talking the background music not the explosion. The sex scene and nude seen seamed out of place I saw parents take their kids to see this movie. I felt the film makers tried to fill this movie with artsy nonsense instead of telling the story of Oppenheimer.,NEGATIVE

"Jul 27, 2023","I adore Christopher Nolan and everything he makes - but unfortunately this one, like Tenet before it - feels like he tried to pack too much into the runtime, and I got lost in the shuffle a lot. There were a number of times I'd find characters having a conversation about another character by name, and I'd be sitting there think ""Who was that? What was their role?"" And then they'd show a clip of that person and sometimes I didn't even recognize their face - but even when I did I'd struggle to remember where they slotted in.

It's visually amazing, artistic as hell, and the acting is SUPERB - but had it been a 5 hour mini-series instead of a 3-hour movie, I think it could have been easier to follow, and thus more enjoyable.... but still, very much worth seeing.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 27, 2023","Due to its nature, Oppenheimer may not become one of Nolan's best films. Its slow-burn storytelling and relatively less action might play a role in that. Nevertheless, the tale it tells focuses on history's most crucial invention that jeopardizes our existence. Nolan crafts a narrative by dividing the story into three parts, keeping the excitement alive. The film is an enthralling journey that includes notable figures like Einstein and Enrico Fermi. Although not entirely factual, the film's message, particularly conveyed through President Harry Truman, illustrates what Nolan intends to portray. Thank you, Nolan.",POSITIVE

"Jul 27, 2023","I just went to an IMAX dome cinema with 4K laser projection to see this and I have to say, that theater was an amazing work of art and science that I would still not recommend to almost anyone I know. At least not without perfect seats and not for a long film. Sadly, that's also a perfect simile to the movie I saw on the screen... I know that's a hot take to say amidst the buzz about this movie. All the trailers and featurettes leading up to release were great, and I don't deny after watching the film that it is a masterpiece of montage and cinematography. It had good dialogue, and an excellent cast who gave their best effort in every scene. The production design was flawless and there were some very engaging scenes. So you might think that perhaps the theater experience influenced my perception of the film. But I was told to see it on the biggest screen possible, even though at some point the size of a screen becomes somewhat impractical, not unlike the runtime of this movie. I'm not saying it didn't make me feel things. I'm not saying it wasn't an artistic chievement. It didn't even feel quite as long as it was but it was still long, it felt long, and because of that and in large part because of the editing style, I just didn't much enjoy it. It was an unnecessary ordeal to sit through. Like Emily Blunt said, it's more of an experience than a film. It didn't tell a story so much as it conveyed a vibe through a rapid fire series of short non-linear events, and the same point could have been made in much less time, or in a slightly more linear and less confusing fashion. I left that cinema feverish from heat from a projector and 500 people building up over the extended time in the cinema, bleary eyed from a screen encapsulating my field of view for 3 hours, and with a severe migraine from the breakneck pacing and constant time jumps, probably one every few minutes on average. Florence Pugh's acting talents were wasted, instead spending most of her very limited screen time naked and frowning in deeply unsettling, somewhat perverse, and fundamentally aromantic sex scenes. The rest of the film was mostly just as cold and heady and heartless. The dialogue was often nearly drowned out by sound design which has been common of Nolan in recent years. I only even knew what was happening because I already had a lot of context on the story of Oppenheimer and the bomb. I'll consider seeing it on a smaller screen and maybe my opinions will shift some but I can't imagine ever rating it as more than a 7.5/10 even with a better viewing experience. ""But it's 94% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, half of Hollywood starred in it all giving their blessings, one of the greatest filmmakers of our time had complete control over this film"" I hear you saying. To which I say, ""I know...that's why I'm considering it.""",NEGATIVE

Storyline is like Jack's jumping beands. Explosion was not worth it. Movie was too long.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 27, 2023","This movie is a work of art like no other, but you have to go in with the right expectations. Don't expect action, don't expect the whole movie to be about the A-Bomb, and don't expect the movie to be sappy and emotional. The movie is about J. Robert Oppenheimer, not the bomb. If you go in with the wrong expectations, this movie will be mediocre and boring.

First, I have to note that the pacing is quite fast, even with the 3 hour runtime. You need to be able to keep up with it or you will lose track of the stuff going on. DO NOT turn your brain off and enjoy it, you need to think. Think about what all of the characters are doing, why they're doing it, look into their eyes and at their face and get into their head, especially Oppenheimer. 

Most of the emotion in this movie is through expressions and undertones, not ultra sappy scenes or dialogue, and the actors do an AMAZING job at conveying all of it. To truly understand the emotion in this movie you need to dig deep into the layers of every scene.

Additionally, the use of B&W film really brings out the true ""colors"" of every scene with Strauss. It adds so much to the film and puts a line between Strauss and Oppenheimer as people. From the beginning of the movie with a younger Oppenheimer, to the amazing end of the movie, you can feel everything Oppenheimer and company is thinking and feeling.

Overall the movie does a superb job at telling Oppenheimer's story. I don't expect everyone to rate this movie a 5/5, as I am a bit of a history and physics nerd, but you should recognize the masterpiece it is.",POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2023","Oppenheimer is a movie - as I see it - divided
up into 3 parts.  The personal life of the man, but, centering mostly around his womanizing (as later
remarked in the movie), and, his 2 most serious relationships.
   The 2nd part, which is the development, 
and, detonation of the bomb.  And, the 3rd part,
which comes off as a heavily dramatic court scene, in persecuting 'Poppy,' as he is nick-named, for possible breaches of loyalty
to America, and, worst, with possible ties to the
support of Communism, and, the Soviet Union.
Which, if any of these accusations were true, would of course, have grave consequences, as the U.S., would not want to get in an arms race
with any other country, much less, the Soviet Union.  As a matter of fact, the Truman administration - who has become so panicky, and paranoid of the possibility, that, they will
pull out the proverbial microscope, for finding the
very remotest partical of danming evidence, to
virtually clobber Oppenheimer into submission.
   The second and third parts of this movie, 
we're extraordinarily entertaining, and informing.
And the acting was, I thought, was, 'par excellance.'
  Incidentally, Cillian Murphy, is one of my favorite actors, and, it was as much of him, that
I came to see the movie, as it was Opoenheimer.
  And, I make mention of this, because, if anyone
would enthusiactingly wade out this first part, I would be on that list.
  It's not that I don't like romance sequences, 
and movies.  The movies - 'Notebook,' The 'Object of my Affection,' were great movies, 
and, 'Cloie,' with Amanda Siefred, Liam Nieson,
and, Julianne Moore, is among my all-time favorite.  But, with the movie Oppenheimer, I came to see a movie . . . about Oppenheimer.
What inspired this guy to achieve what he accomplished . . the obstacles he faced, and, how he overcame them. What motivated him to commit to the drive he chose.  I wanted to learn as much about him as possible.  
  But, instead, I had to be dragged through
about an hour of romantic drudgery - that incidentally, wasn't really so far different from other relationships, in the real world.  If this
had a direct bearing, or, influence on his work, it
would have been more forgiving.  But, as it turned out, that wasn't the case - at least not
significantly so.
  I suppose about 15 to 20 minutes, or so,
I would have found to be more palatable.
I mean, a synopsis of his relationship misgivings,
would allow me to say . . I get it.
  So, there you have it.  I wanted to espouse
alot about the 3rd part of this movie - regarding
the court-like security meeting, which came off to me, as a McCarthy era,  Salem Witch-Hunt, Inquisitional mind-set that the board couldn't
obsessionally get off to save their own lives.
It was, very simply, A-Big-Do-about -nothing.
They came off to me, as the 'Gang of Fools.'
Propagating just a bunch of sillyness, and nonsense.  They were the 'Mudrakers,' clear and simple, trying to nitpick someone, and, his great
accomplishment of saving the live of thousands
of allied military lives, simply out of a delusional
sense of crossing the trivia line, and, for that, they were out to castigate this poor man to no end.  Oppy, seemed to sit helplessly, at one end of the room, mentally crippled with the affliction
of not only developing a bomb that killed thousands of Japanese lives, but, creating something that could devastate the world as well.  It was almost like he was in 'Catatonic Freeze.'I wanted to jump through the screen, and say
'Enough Already!'. How dare you!  And give them a piece of my mind, and say, ''You people will be responsible for what happens to the world now . .    not Oppenheimer!
  To end this review, let me please quote, from the renown psychologist, Murray Banks, 'It's not life's blows that destroy . . it's what you do in face of the blow.'

The movie is more about how Oppenheimer was treated after the bomb and not nearly enough about the bomb itself, which was the most puzzling part - it was like 80% people talking in a small room in a hearing.

"Jul 27, 2023","Oppenheimer is an extraordinary cinematic journey that flawlessly captures the essence of one of the most brilliant and enigmatic minds in human history. Directorial genius, combined with impeccable performances, compelling storytelling, and awe-inspiring cinematography, results in a movie that transcends the bounds of time and leaves the audience in profound contemplation.‚ù§Ô∏è

The film opens with a mesmerizing sequence, instantly transporting the viewers into the tumultuous era of the mid-20th century, where science and world politics collided on an unprecedented scale. The attention to historical accuracy is impeccable, making the experience both immersive and educational.

At the heart of the film is the exceptional portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer by an actor who perfectly encapsulates the complexities of this iconic physicist. The depth and nuance brought to the character evoke empathy and admiration, allowing the audience to understand the weight of Oppenheimer's decisions in the face of unimaginable moral dilemmas.

The supporting cast delivers stellar performances, breathing life into the diverse array of personalities involved in the Manhattan Project. Their interactions and conflicts highlight the ethical struggles surrounding the development of nuclear weapons, forcing the audience to confront the moral ambiguity of scientific progress.

The screenplay is a triumph in itself, elegantly weaving together historical events, personal anecdotes, and philosophical musings. It doesn't shy away from exploring Oppenheimer's inner turmoil and the toll his role in the project took on his psyche. The dialogues are poignant and thought-provoking, sparking debates that linger long after the movie ends.

The film's visual splendor is unparalleled, with breathtaking cinematography that captures both the grandeur of the natural landscapes and the intensity of the scientific laboratories. The period-accurate set designs and costumes further immerse the audience in the world of the 1940s, enhancing the authenticity of the storytelling.

Oppenheimer's evocative soundtrack adds yet another layer of emotional depth to the narrative. The haunting melodies perfectly complement the movie's tone, creating a profound connection between the viewers and the unfolding drama.

Furthermore, the film serves as a cautionary tale, prompting reflections on the consequences of scientific advancement and the importance of ethical considerations in the pursuit of knowledge. It encourages dialogue on the responsibility of scientists and policymakers alike, making it not just an exceptional cinematic experience but also a catalyst for meaningful discussions.

In conclusion, Opppenheimer is an exceptional masterpiece that showcases the best aspects of filmmaking. It enlightens, entertains, and leaves an indelible mark on its audience. With its stellar performances, compelling storytelling, and artistic brilliance, it rightfully secures its place among the greatest cinematic achievements of all time.

Or How to Make an Atomic Bomb Movie Bomb

Movies about famous scientists are difficult. 

The most obvious problem is that most people don't understand science and many are actively hostile, remembering those numbing lectures in school and being forced to memorize things like the Periodic Table. 

That's why Hollywood mostly avoided movies about science and gave people something easier - science fiction. In SciFi, you don't have to understand anything, you just have to see it. The explanation of ‚Äòwarp speed' is the visual of the Enterprise zooming away into the distance.

When Hollywood has tackled bios about scientists, it has concentrated on the personal story a la The Imitation Game. The formula for this kind of movie dates back to The Story of Louis Pasteur (1936). The scientist struggles to get people to understand how amazing his discovery is and spends most of the movie in Sisyphus-mode, struggling to push that boulder (his discovery) up the hill and into the light.

Chris Nolan's Oppenheimer takes a different path. Fractured and polychromatic, he tries to immerse the viewer in the inner world of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the ‚ÄòFather of the Atomic Bomb."" While three hours long, the movie provides information on its subject in small packets:
Oppenheimer, the student at Cambridge, clumsily failing to perform an experiment in a lab, is punished by his teacher and, in revenge, he prepares a poison apple for his teacher. 
Oppenheimer meeting a young woman at a party, taking her to bed and reading Sanskrit poetry to her as they have sex.
Oppenheimer riding a horse in the wild countryside of New Mexico.
Oppenheimer giving a physics lecture in German after learning the language in only six weeks.

After the first hour of this fractured story, the movie settles down to tell two interwoven main stories - the making of the first atomic bomb and the government hearing to strip Oppenheimer of his security clearance nine years later.

The centerpiece of the first story is Trinity, the name Oppenheimer gave to the test of the first atomic bomb exploded on earth. Nolan attempts to make the audience ‚Äòexperience' the event by showing us the bomb explode in silence, as its first viewers did, since light travels faster than sound. Then, the sound thunders through the theater and finally, we see the blast knock down people two miles from the explosion. It's the best sequence in the movie.

Most of the characters in the movie are mere names - Einstein, Bohr, Lawrence, Truman. That is because Nolan doesn't care about characters - just as in his previous movie, Dunkirk, Nolan has little interest in the humans in this story (see my review of Dunkirk, here). Cilian Murphy plays the title character with the same wide-eyed, semi-surprised look throughout the movie. While it was universally agreed that Oppenheimer was one of the most charming of men and had affairs with many women, you would never know it by this performance. Yes, Nolan has someone say that he was a ‚Äòwomanizer' but why people, both men and women, adored him is never shown. Nolan makes the audience ‚Äòexperience' the first atomic bomb, but nothing of the personality of his title character.

The other main character is Lewis Strauss (pronounced ‚Äòstraws') played by Robert Downey, Jr. Strauss was a very complicated man - financial wizard, adviser to four presidents, philanthropist, original member of the Atomic Energy Commission and a man who was one of the few in government trying to allow more Jews into the US during the Nazi reign. Yet, in Oppenheimer, Nolan portrays him as a simple villain, a foil to the title character's good-hearted innocence. The source of Strauss' hatred of Oppenheimer, according to Nolan, is a foolish misunderstanding. Really? While this may even be true, it is a slim thread to hold up a three hour movie about America's most controversial scientist and the beginning of the atomic age. You don't end Hamlet with the revelation that he was wrong all along and Claudius didn't kill his father. Mere misunderstandings do not make for great drama.

The other characters are more like line drawings, some with great make-up. Emily Blunt is the drunken, bitter wife of Oppenheimer. Florence Pugh is his unbalanced, sexy mistress, Matt Damon is the tough, no nonsense General in charge of the project. Lots of others are there for a scene or two, mere dots on a ten foot pointillist painting of dread and despair. 

Stories like this one - about huge, important figures and events are better served by the new medium of limited series television. Told over several one or two hour episodes, characters and events can be given the time and depth needed to tell such monumental stories. In fact, TV has already done that with Oppenheimer. A 1980 BBC Masterpiece Theatre seven part series with Sam Waterson as Opeenhimer did a much better job in telling the story (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppenheimer_(TV_series), with none of the pyrotechnics of modern movies. 

If Oppenheimer turns out to be a box office success, it will have more to do with the lack of current movies appealing to adult sensibilities than its own merits. Hollywood is desperate for great movies that are also big hits. I wish I could like this movie - I, too, would like to see a great movie that's a great hit, too.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 27, 2023","I get the feeling this is going to be a lonely review, but it just didn't do it for me. 

For starters, I am simply done with the just-plain-bad ways that Nolan always seems to be mixing his audio. He's been making his own dialogue indecipherable as a result since that early teaser of 'The Dark Knight Rises,' and he's done it yet again here. Having to endure this for three hours in an IMAX theater felt like a sonic assault that literally left me shaking, and not in the good way.

In terms of plot, I don't really know why this was the way it was. It rushed along in the beginning, jumped around randomly, and seemed eager to check off as many historical fact boxes as possible before giving us a courtroom procedural with an entirely unnecessary and out-of-place visual metaphor (And you'll definitely know it when you see it), and caps things off with a quick reminder at the end that nuclear missiles are really bad.

Ultimately, it all just felt over baked.

There's some good here and that audio I disparaged earlier does in fact work to effect during the ‚Äî y'know ‚Äî nuke parts. Loved Damon in this and some other cameos, but I'd say this is one to watch at home.",NEGATIVE

The acting is awesome. You forget that they're reading a script and you just fall in love with every scene that educates, while also telling a detailed story. It was a quick 3 hours and I left wanting more. A true test if a movie was good is if you think about it, multiple times the day of and after, questioning scenes and reliving the experience.

"Jul 27, 2023","Incredible performances and somehow the best direction and writing from Christopher Nolan yet, even considering some of his extensive resume. The focus on the small story influencing the larger concepts and making the feeling of this intimate and arresting was an amazing turn for the writer/director. My biggest issue with his most recent work, Tenet, was it didn't have much emanation to me. Oppenheimer swings the total opposite direction of that and hits home in many different fronts. Murphy and RDJ gave some of their best performances ever. Also it was fantastic in IMAX.",POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2023",A sensational accomplishment in cinema. Every moment of this movie builds towards something deeper with Cillian Murphy locking up the Academy Award for Best Actor by the time the bomb goes off. The closing hour of this film is one of the truly great hours I've seen as a movie watcher. A must-see for all who love cinema.,POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2023","Christopher Nolan is my all time favorite director, but sadly this was my least favorite film of his to date. It felt like a series of quick tik tok videos flung together - and while I usually prefer non-linear story telling, this was just too scattered and confusing. Made Tenet seem pretty straightforward by comparison. The film looked great and Downey and Damon were terrific. Other than that it was a spastic slog for me. ",NEGATIVE

"Jul 27, 2023","This was a very will done movie.  If you know nothing about Oppenheimer you will learn a lot.  The performances were top notch, and it had some very memorable scenes.

"Jul 27, 2023","I think Christopher Noland needs to take a step back and refresh his approach to storytelling. It's great to be unorthodox and come up with new ways of dressing up a narrative or story arch, but this was not one of his best executions. 

For me, the first 20 minutes of the film were a string of incoherent blasts of color and noise without context. The context came in the final half of the film, and reflecting on the opening sequence just left me feeling like it was a wasted portion of time. I could see someone recutting the film and removing the first 30 minutes to an hour of the film and keep only a couple scenes and it would be a far better story on screen.

I heard Noland went all in on the Trinity test reenactment, and the footage they got was indistinguishable from that used in any number of films from the 70s and 80. 

The drama aspects were honestly pretty good, just a shame they kept getting interrupted by bright lights and turning every scene of consequence to whiteout. 

Acting and delivery by everyone was good. The lines that they were delivering were okay. The last half of the movie had great sequences and lines, while the first half was honestly cringe. 

It's got flashy lights to keep the audience looking at the screen and it's got naked ladies in it, so it's going to do okay. I probably will click 'next' if it comes up in my movie binge feed in 10 years.",NEGATIVE

It could have been very powerful to see that, juxtaposed with the ra-ra of the American flag waving. To gloss over the terrible destruction seemed lame to me. Also, can we just admit it was way too long? Cillian Murphy is a genius and should get the Oscar. No question. But who cares about that dumb trial?",NEUTRAL

Just a one word Review of this film is ""Outstanding"".The biography had given me immense pleasure with the deep performance from cillian Murphy.With a huge star cast, there's a chance to fall but Nolan has successfully made this movie as his career best.Most probably rdj and cillian Murphy both are going to be nominated for Oscars.The screenplay isn't for everyone while the first half was a little bit slow for the sake of the story development.It showcases Oppenheimer's early life. However,the second half of the movie was nail biting and absolutely outstanding.Two things I should mention about this movie which made the movie outstanding;One has to be the OST.I thought not bringing Hans Zimmer was suicidal but Ludwig was at his best. And the second thing is cinematography.I just loved those scenes where they showcased Oppenheimer's trauma scenes.They were absolutely mind-blowing.I would say watch it on theater. It's a must watch.",POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2023",The best Oppenheimer film of the year.,POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2023","The good:  I saw it at IMAX and the sound system was amazing.  There are scenes apocalyptic in nature and the sound system delivered the experience.  This was the best part of going and seeing the movie in a theatre.  There was several scenes where the cinematic creativity and camera usage was very good.  The bad:   The scenes jump around and there isn't any real character development, it's like watching preview after preview. You never connect with the main character.  The story is complicated and best told in a documentary style and having said that, they don't succeed in telling this story well.  There are so many details and characters and because they jump around, you are always struggling to keep up.  The only reason I understood what was going on is that I'm currently  reading the book Einstein.  The explosion of the first bomb doesn't seem to be the size of a nuclear bomb.  I was actually thinking that the nuke part of the blast had failed, then everyone is cheering, and only then you realize that it was a success.  Very anticlimactic, in my opinion.  There is nudity, and it does nothing for the movie, just grutuitous.  If you're there with your wife, it's embarrassing.  Overall, the hype doesn't deliver.  This is a movie best watched at home where you can rewind and fast forward, though your surround sound should be up to the task to get the best effect.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 27, 2023","TLDR: a workman like Ron Howard could have made this; I thought I was going to a Nolan film.

Because I loved Dunkirk, I had been expecting something similarly epic in scale but also tight and narratively cohesive. This sprawled like an uncontrolled reaction. I expected big visuals, because of the suggestion to see it on IMAX, but aside from a few panoramas and the swift explosion it was mostly guys in rooms. 

I was expecting interesting visuals, like the school buses of Dark Knight, the small town dystopia of Interstellar, or the half-lit half-destroyed buildings of Dunkirk. Instead we got cheesy 1980s NOVA type representations of nuclei, and the occasional globe on fire that reminded me of the climate change visuals that it is no doubt riffing on. These were as lame as the disappointing black hole from Interstellar. In an R-rated film, Oppenheimer's bomb hallucinations could have been way more frightening if they were meant to be emotionally meaningful.

As a Cold War baby, I should have been terrified rather than bored by this film. I was in my 30s when I first saw an ICBM in a museum, and it seriously scared me. We do get a very brief clip of an ICBM, but even stock or archival footage could have been used to evoke the genuine terror of nuclear war. (Just show us the ""Daisy"" ad or Bert the Turtle if you can't come up with better, the younguns won't have seen them.)

There are a million great stories from Los Alamos left untouched here. Cut down the endless Strauss subplot and give us more of that wonderful weirdo Feynman. As the Senate aide said, maybe Einstein and Oppenheimer were talking about something more important?",NEGATIVE
"Jul 27, 2023","The film has an overall very good balance between incredibly tense moments and few slower, more melachonic momenes. The political discussions can get a bit conusing at times, because it is told in very small steps and the victims of the attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki don't get acknowledged nearly enough...",NEUTRAL

"Jul 27, 2023","Boring. Just a biography that was absolutely not advertised as one. The trailer that was shown in theaters was stunning and gave me the impression that this movie would be an interesting story about the development of the atomic bomb and the challenges and moral dilemma that the scientists faced. I didn't have much knowledge of the details of the manhattan project, so when they showed that they built a village in the middle of nowhere to make the scientists build the bomb, I immediately imagined all the different scenarios that could happen: Maybe a scientist tries to escape because he doesn't want to build a weapon of mass destruction anymore? Maybe there's a spy? Maybe something goes terribly wrong? I sort of imagined a thrilling story about the beginning of the cold war. Instead it's a 100% accurate retelling of Oppenheimer's life and it's 110% only about him and only from his perspective. This is the movie where they just tell and don't show. They mentioned some incidents in their village but never show them. They also barely show how they built the bomb, the process, the dangers, the challenges, nothing. It's also so terribly paced: It jumps from present to future so quickly that it's hard to even conceive what is happening and when. All the characters are barely introduced to the viewer, they just appear out of nowhere. It feels like you are expected to have already watched a full documentary about Oppenheimer before even watching this movie. They made good job showing the emotions of Oppenheimer though and I liked how realistically it was shown how he spaced out and thought about the damage he has done while he conducted his speech after the bombs were used. That and the development and testing of the bomb were the peak of the movie, and also only 1/3 of it. The first third of the movie is all about his life prior to the manhattan project and the last third is all about Strauss accusing Oppenheimer of being a soviet spy. Interesting right? Seriously, if I would've been watching this movie alone, I would walk out before finishing the last third of the movie.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 27, 2023","A deep and vast storyline which covers not just the man, but also the relationships he had, his friends, colleagues, family, lovers, bosses all interconnected between the creation of the atomic bomb, the burgeoning arms rate, and the literal paranoia of communism ideals in America. It brings forward intellectual topics such as the effects of political movements in the classroom, the scientists' moral dilemma when it comes to nuclear weapons, the compromise people have to make when it comes to doing things ""for your country"", and many others. 

Christopher Nolan uses clever cinematography to help you ""feel"" the torture taking place inside Oppenheimer's head... At times quite intense, but it gets the point across that this man is deeply troubled at the way the ""gadget"" has been handled.

It is also a story of power. And how the power of nations, politicians, the military, and even, the scientists themselves, can wield it with devastating affect.

There are no heroes to this story. Not even Oppenheimer himself. The story reveals him to be a bright, flawed man, with a love of quantum physics, thrust into arguably, the most important event in the 20th century.

I saw it on an IMAX screen and I would recommend everyone doing the same.",POSITIVE

I really don't know what else to say other than if you can see it in 15/70 it is worth it. Watch it in the best theater you are able to. Sound design is top notch, and I plan on seeing the movie at least 2 more times (at lesser IMAX). Everyone's performance was superb, and this really is Nolans best.",POSITIVE

"Jul 27, 2023","A truly masterful display of Nolan's storytelling, which is only elevated by some of the best performance's of the year from Murphy and Downey. Oppenheimer manages to keep audiences on the edges of there seat the entire film, despite the runtime of 3 hours. Oppenheimer tells the story of the most brilliant men who's tortured by his own creations lasting effect. Oppenheimer is complimented by a fantastic score composed by Ludwig G√∂ransson. 

If you Plan on seeing just one movie this year in Theaters make it Oppenheimer.",POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2023","For me, it's not my favorite Nolan film in terms of instant awe. That would be Interstellar or was Interstellar. I watched that many times and am now sick of it. But over time I think Oppenheimer will endure as the movie I could return to in 20 years and watch again with no qualms, unlike Interstellar. Nolan's best achievement here is in setting a subtle mood and bringing the intensity with the subject matter itself, rather than toying with too much subjectivity and abstraction.

I had no real issue with the length. I was engaged in the content.
The editing felt a little off. I would have preferred it to be a little more cohesive in moving from scene to scene. It wasn't the time scaping, just that I was pulled out of the experience a little with so many different scenes to clip through and with not enough glue to bond the scenes together if that makes sense. But that's a style choice really in the end - it's a biographic after all.

The acting is superb. Unlike other more negative critiques on the heart of the movie, I was surprised at the human element from the performances and even though I think I would have disliked Oppenheimer as as person, and am unconvinced he deserves such positive spin put on his role at Los Alamos overall, I could still sympathise with him. Emily Blunt and Cillian Murphy were standouts for me. All the performances were great. I was surprised at how I liked Hartnett's character.  The cast selection for Fermi, Heisenberg, and Einstein etc. were great, I felt that they made a genuine effort to pick actors that could not only act, but looked like the Physicists they portrayed just as with the lead role - a masterful stroke by Nolan. RDJ was very good but I feel a lot of praise for him is unfiltered by how he benefitted from the black & white scenes. It really was a nice tool to put him in a unique context, a nice touch.

The sex scenes for me felt as if intended to illustrate, in an obscure manner, a metaphor for Oppenheimer getting into bed with communism as well as the relationship itself. It was a little too obscure for me but I get it. The musical score is beautiful and not overused for me, as others have suggested. I thought the abandonment of special effects completely was unwarranted in only one scene - the atomic weapon scene. Would have only needed a minute tops of an overlay of special effects on top of a practical explosion and would have added to the overall experience. So over 3 hours, it was missing maybe 1 minute of special effects instead of zero, but that was never the main draw for me in the first place. 

The sound design overall was great in spite of others having minor qualms with it, it was a little muted in the heavy weather scene for example, but this worked masterfully for me, you couldn't quite here exactly what was said and why should you.

Oppenheimer is a triumph overall. Due to it's subtle biographic nature, spectacle, storytelling, and lack of over the top effects and distortions, it has practically infinite re-watch potential. 

Had to take off half a star - needed an extra minute for editing glue, could have lost an extra minute for the sex scenes, needed a bit more gloss for the visuals of the explosion. But these are minor things for me overall.

P.S. You don't need IMAX for this, that's not how I saw it. Movie buffs are movie buffs, and will tell you otherwise. The movie has solid fundamentals: Direction, sound, visuals, score, and performances, and ~editing almost. The lead's portrayal, as well as emotion conveyed in breathing, posture and facial expressions don't demand the sweat pore and follicle closeup others claim. Great movies don't need such a crutch. 1080p or even 720p would still captivate you.",POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2023","This movie was a masterpiece. As always with Christopher Nolan movie you can get lost in the intricacies of the timeline jumps and the many characters across those, but the quality of the acting and the historical accuracy are of the highest tier. It is a rarity to see a combination of historical accuracy and entertaining plot lines. I cannot wait to watch it again.",POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2023",Music and sounds were too loud!!,NEUTRAL
"Jul 27, 2023","It is Nolan's best film besides The Dark Knight. The movie juxtaposes three timelines: two timelines from J. Robert Oppenheimer's (Cillian Murphy) perspective (color sequences) and one timeline from Lewis Strauss's (Robert Downey Jr.) perspective (black & white sequences). This film is not just a realistic biography of J. Robert Oppenheimer; it expresses Oppenheimer's inner feelings and conflicts visually & auditorily. And even though it's a 3-hour dialogue-driven movie, it's breathtaking with its nonlinear storytelling, fast-paced editing, Ludwig G√∂ransson's masterful score, and excellent performances. I hope Cillian Murphy gets an OSCAR for his performance.

"Jul 27, 2023","Wow... Just wow.

The pacing was incredible, I was extremely worried there would be lulls and it would feel drawn out being a 3hr long film, but Nolan captivated me for the full duration.

The tension that builds throughout the film really gives the viewer a thrill.

Going into the film I had assumed the test explosion would be the climax of the film, however the political and moral themes came through as a much more tense battle in the latter half of the film. Seeing so many conflicting views and moral dillema's it turns into one of the best ""Trials"" I have personally witnessed on film.

It was so well directed and told I immediately went into researching the historical accuracy of the political side of the film and to my surprise and absolute delight I found that it was accurate to a degree of which I was blown away.

Watching this in imax is an absolute must, not even because of the visual experience but the audio experience is just mind blowingly incredible, Nolan uses sounds from the explosions to highlight and build tension around the true climactic internal battles Dr Oppenheimer faces and the first time this happened I thought, ah no it's gonna be overused, but when I grasped how intentional he was with this to exaggerate certain moments, I was utterly impressed.

I simply love the way how ""Oppenheimer"" gets you involved in the world war 2 an all the tension of the run to the atomic bomb. 
Another Christopher Nolan masterclass, but very different from the above, because the story of the movie is completely real. The way Nolan play between the past on a colorful scenes and the future/present in a non live darkness screens is genius.
Of course take of my hat to the best Cillian Murphy, unbelievable performance, he doesn't need to talk to talk with the public! 
Best movie and best actor for the Oscar for sure, at least.",POSITIVE

"Jul 27, 2023","I am of two minds about Oppenheimer.  On one level I was transfixed.  On another level I was totally pissed and wanted to kill whomever did the sound.  The soundtrack was way too omnipresent, too loud, and they needed to turn the bass down.  Though not a physicist, I know enough about the science that I wanted to, and could have, followed the dialogue.  My friend Pat and another woman in the bathroom made the same comment:  ""I needed subtitles.""  I opined at the end to the two guys next to us.  Pat thought the problem, particularly muddy sound, was the ""old"" (as she put it) 70mm IMAX theater we were in (apparently the largest screen in California) at the Metreon in SF.  The two guys said, ""No, that's Christopher Nolan.  He does that.  'Tenant' was like that.""  I didn't see that one, but did see ""The Prestige,"" ""Interstellar,"" and ""Dunkirk,"" and I don't remember that problem.  The other problem was that we were way too close and low in row D and had to strain our necks by keeping looking up because the seats did not recline.  We plan to test Pat's hypothesis by seeing it again at just a regular cinema in suburban Pleasant Hill (and the seats recline!).",NEUTRAL

Note: This movie is mostly for the ppl who have an interest in physics and other aspects, if u looking for a action or anything else such as comedy or blockbusterish this movie is not for you 
But would give it a 11/10‚Ä¶.",POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2023",A Nolan masterpiece & superb acting from the entire cast. Absolute must see!,POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2023","Very intense and strong movie.  Fills in the gaps that history class didn't teach us, especially about Oppenheimer's communist ""ties"" and how he was almost blackballed after the war.  The movie was long, but well worth it.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 27, 2023",Magnificent moovie!!!,POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2023","Oppenheimer will go down as one the greatest films of all time. Instead of relying on heavy action and special effects, Nolan instead tells the story of a mans moral struggle, and when the special effects are needed, he once again changes our perception of whats possible, in one of the greatest sequences you will ever see.",POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2023",An absolute masterpiece and necessary for the education of the world he recommend this movie in any language in anywhere.,POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2023","The Sacramento, California IMAX was a huge disappointment. I know the current style is to blast movies because dialog does not matter; however, it is impossible to determine if we couldn't make out the dialog because of the distortion of extra loud volume or because the soundtrack was Nolan's typical booming style or both. The acting is fabulous, but the characterization of Oppenheimer papered over his spiritual explorations. He was no angel, but Nolan's screenplay does not show what must have been key moments in Oppenheimer's trajectory. The R scenes are a distraction. It would have been enough to know that he was unfaithful. I do like the way Nolan demonstrates Oppenheimer's naivete. Someone who does not know details of this story will absolutely not follow what is going on at many points. It was not necessary or valuable to jumble the timeline as the story is quite detailed and understanding that detail is crucial. We do not see how Oppie put together the team for the Manhattan Project. I think Nolan is a great director, but this film has been over praised. As someone who saw the original production of ""In the Matter of J. Robert Oppenheimer"" on Broadway in '69 and has watched several miniseries, this film should have done much more. This film could have been as important as Citizen Kane, could have been.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 27, 2023","One of the greates movies i've seen in a long time, christopher nolan has outdone himself with this movie.
Everything felt so real and was explained pretty well along with the storie so the viewer knows whats going on. The cast was a great choice, we can see that even with characters like rami malek and emily blunt with a small supporter roll that just overshadows some of the main cast.
It was overwhelming and a must see.",POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2023","Ummm, did I miss something here? A strange film, with three uncohesive acts, mostly loads its eponymous character with listliss dialogue, only to be interrupted with gimmicky jumpcuts of constellations, firebombs, nudity, etc. Ludwig G√∂ransson's obnoxious musical intrusions during the third act also indicate that the overly long interrogation scene is going bust. (Hey audience - this is serious stuff! Oppenheimer's about to lose his security clearance!) I was waiting for Spike Lee's ""Double Dolly"" shot to be dragged out at one point. To be fair, when the testing of the bomb kicks in during the second act, the film takes off, with an ""Apollo 13"" style race against the clock tempo. Unfortunately that is short lived and really not the film's main focus. Simply put, Nolan's portrait of Oppenheimer ""the man"" just isn't that interesting as his impact. Quite a feat when ""that man"" is the father of the A-bomb.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 27, 2023","Holy shit is this terrible, boring and very poorly put together. Literally gave zero shits about any of the characters. Couldn't tell you the names of any of them. So many pointless scenes. Just awful. Will never watch a second of this again.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 27, 2023","I think the movie was a masterpiece, but it was too long in my opinion. Some parts were a bit boring, like the trial at the end, but overall, with the cinematography, effects and great actors, this movie was amazing.",POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2023","Amazing! With the combination of incredible acting, shots, music, and sound design, I got full body chills like 3 times",POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2023",The 3 hours went by quickly. I'd like to see it again to watch some of the characters better since it wasn't all in logical order.,POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2023","The way the man plays into who has the biggest ego and power no matter of humanity's extinction. Distressing from beginning to end, Cillian Murphy ate the film (deserves an Oscar), Emily Blunt swept as a supporting actress (deserves an Oscar) and Robert Downey Jr. shone as antagonist (deserves an Oscar). If with Barbie I came out crying, with Oppenheimer I came out with a lot of tension and anxiety. Both have similarities despite having different stories and generes. In both films dissociates strongly.",POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2023","Highly recommended, especially if you can see it in IMAX. It was amazing!",POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2023","Cillian Murphy was BORN to play this role.  Definitely go see the all star cast, great historical piece well told and wonderfully acted.   No spoiler, but will say, read up just a bit on Oppenheimer's life story to help bring some of the movie facets out.  The history of the bomb and his creator are something worthy of school teaching.  Leave the ""slavery is good"" garbage out of class and put actual SCIENCE in the classroom.",POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2023",Movie is out of the question but the thing is that the selection of cast was very good. Seeing Robert Downerly Jr. Doing a role never done by him before in any of his movie and with everything he has got made me feel the tension.,POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2023",I really really enjoyed this. Well-written and acted not to mention the cinematography was stunning. Didn't feel bored at all in the 3 hours. I need to rewatch to catch all the details. My only criticism is that a few more well-placed scenes with Rami Malek's character were needed in the movie to give more context about who he was and how he was able to gather the conviction and evidence to defend Oppenheimer.,POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2023",Honestly just a well delivered masterclass to the cast to the plot to everything,POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2023",Excellent drama. But no way is it necessary to see this in Imax. 99% drama with one scene of the bomb going off and it was mostly silent. I'm glad I didn't waste my time trying to find an IMAX viewing. I went on a Sunday afternoon to a regular screen and it was just great. Sounded great too. And I wasn't crammed in like a sardine in a half filled theater.,POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2023","I had to rewatch. First time I saw it, I thought it was convoluted with Ludwig G√∂ransson and the sound design as its saving grace. Still felt the same on my rewatch even on IMAX, although with a better understanding of its dense, jargon-heavy storyline, better worship of the sound design, and G√∂ransson ultimately cemented his Oscar nod and his name in my core memory.

This is more of a me problem; Oppenheimer in itself is a great filmmaking achievement with an ensemble so sublime from minor to lead roles and two scenes that made me want to scream, ""I love cinema!""

This Ken, after all, still needs subtitles.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 27, 2023","Cillian Murphy has an epic performance and pulls the audience in to the mind of a tormented genius. The casting is amazing, Robert Downey does an epic job as well. Matt Damon has a career high and Emily blunt was fabulous as well. The music, the emotions, and the way that it is filmed makes it a masterpiece. I would suggest everyone watch it, even just for the historical peek a boo of a war driven time that none of us ever knew. Well worth seeing and the three hours although long, worth it",POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2023","Decent movie. Gratuitous sexual scenes that didn't need to be there. According to history books when the bomb exploded there were people who cried, were solemn and some who celebrated. Wasn't portrayed well in the movie. Some scenes of Hiroshima or Nagasaki or the pilots reaction (Enola Gay) would have helped.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 27, 2023","Oppenheimer is a phenomenal film, and that goes without saying. Every acting performance is superb. The score is masterful. The direction is outstanding. Everything in this movie is top notch, the script, set design, sound, editing, everything. As everyone knows by now, this movie tells the story of Robert Oppenheimer's story on his path to creating the atomic bomb, all the way to his life after creating it. Something we unexpectedly follow, is Lewis Strauss' journey to ripping apart Oppenheimer's credibility and reputation. I don't even want to explain too much of the plot, because this is a movie you should go see, and then see again. Cillian Murphy deserves an Oscar for his performance. From start to finish you're encapsulated in Oppenheimer's world, mostly in due part to Cillian's performance. It's immersive. However, Christopher Nolan's direction is also stupidly immersive. His ability to make an atmosphere feel alive is special. We cut to other points in time, and feel the same atmosphere, or we're immersed into a completely new atmosphere in a split second. Either way it's a stunning feeling whenever you're able to feel that way about a film. Nolan may bring home Best Director for this film, and it'd be wholeheartedly deserved. Robert Downey Jr gives a great performance, maybe not as Oscar worthy as people are suggesting, but it's a strong performance that really comes together in the end of the movie. When the charade is up and we see how many strings he's pulled and why he's pulled them. Matt Damon is fine. Which ""fine"" for Matt Damon is going to be a great performance. Not as strong as his role in Air earlier this year, or even in another long screen time supporting actor role like The Departed, but again, it's a fine performance. Emily Blunt may have to win an Oscar too, her back and forth with Jason Clarke's Roger Robb, hot damn! One of the best scenes in the film. Also, Jason Clarke, what a performance. His ability to memorize these long sentences with fancy lingo and badger away at people whether it be Robert, Kitty, Edward and so on, and to make it all feel so real, wow. Rami Malek is given one monologue in this movie and that's it, but man does he leave a lasting impact. Josh Hartnett gives the best performance of his career. Dane DeHaan gives a sleeper performance as Nichols. However, the one performance that has stuck with me the most. Alden Ehrenreich. He might've gave my favourite performance of anything I've watched this year. As we come into the movie, he's a naive aide, chomping at the bit to assist Strauss in anyway. By the end, he's a hardened soul who's putting Strauss in his place. Him and Downey play off each other brilliantly. I could talk all day about the performances, but I won't. I just want to give Josh Peck, Tom Conti, Gary Oldman, Benny Safdie and Florence Pugh their flowers, for also leaving a lasting impact on me with their performances. Okay, let's talk score. Ludwig G√∂ransson knocks it out of the F***ING park. He has his second Oscar on the way. His score is the driving engine of this film, the touch that immerses you in this world from start to finish. I haven't seen a movie so well made and cared for, like this movie, in a long time. Overall, you need to go see this film. It's an instant classic and cultural phenomenon. It'll be a cornerstone of modern filmmaking, and already may be. Go see this damn film.",POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2023","Wow. I am definitely recommending this movie to many. 20% of what we ""think we know"" , 80% of plot, suspense, fantastic cinematography, acting, pulling of emotions, story telling‚Ä¶ so much more. The movie didn't feel like 3 hrs either which means so much considering how long it had to keep an audience engaged the entire time. I was very pleased with this movie.

"Jul 27, 2023","I'm a student of the Oppenheimer story.  It was lacking in important facts, details and events, that would have made it more interesting.

I take intelligent people to movies with me, to movies like this and still have to explain many things to them after the movie.  They get lost in the back and forth.",POSITIVE

"Jul 27, 2023","I am quite biased as I have a personal connection to Oppenheimer and Christopher Nolan is one of my favorite writers/directors, but this movie is a masterpiece. There is good reason behind RDJ saying that this is the best movie he has been in, and Cillian and Matt have shared similar beliefs. Between the cinematography, use of black and white, and impeccable attention to detail and style, this film seems to be the culmination of the last 25 years of cinematic evolution.",POSITIVE

"Jul 27, 2023","I'm still trying to catch by breath.  Tense, material heavy and cinematic ecstasy.

Still Nolan has made a well-deserved play towards the Oscars.",POSITIVE

"Jul 27, 2023","It's a great movie biography, you have to be concentrated otherwise you'll loose the track of the story. My problem really goes to the script,  it could have been summed up, or the direction should have taken out some parts that end up being anecdotal.",POSITIVE

"Jul 27, 2023",Absolute masterpiece!,POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2023","By a long stretch the most satisfying film of 2023. Christopher Nolan did not let me down at all with his latest piece of cinema. Cillian Murphy played a wonderful Oppenheimer. Matt Damon was ABSOLUTE perfection as Ltd. Leslie Groves. Tom Conti's role was also perfection for its limited screen presence. The narrative, while one of Nolan's meatiest and definitely requiring of a few rewatches, flows so well that you can go with the gist of it even on initial viewing. Watching it in IMAX did not disappoint either. The sound design was phenomenal, the build up to the detonation kept me on the edge of my seat, with the actual display and reactions hitting harder and more emotionally than one would expect, and even the third act following the detonation was very compelling. Exceptional soundtrack, exceptional cinematography, exceptional casting, exceptional acting, especially exceptional direction, for the most exceptional film I have seen this year. Nolan knows what he's doing in cinema right now. Please let him save it again.",POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2023",Nolan is a great filmmaker. I feel like many directors could have tried to make an Oppenheimer movie but it would not be as gripping as this was. The editing was a highlight. If all historical movies were made with this much attention to the film making and not just then then I would be happy with that.,POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2023","The acting is seriously out-of-this-world. It's some of the best performances in any movie I've ever seen. Murphy is a marvel, only furthering my love for his talent. Rdj gives one of, if not his best performance. And basically every actor that's involved just gives a stellar performance.

The score is absolutely beautiful. At times it does drown out some dialogue, but imo it's not nearly as bad as in TENET. The way the music builds up over multiple minutes at a time just keeps you on the edge of your seat.

This movie is FULL of dialogue and exposition. If you don't like this style of film, I can easily see how you'd be bored and disinterested. However, if you do like this style, it's the best of it's kind. The script is just fantastic.

In classic Nolan style, it's of course a non-linear storyline. Not really difficult to follow though. If you pay attention you shouldn't have a hard time knowing what happens when. I love the contrast in storytelling between the in-color and the black and white scenes.

I LOVED the build up for the actual highlight of the movie, which was of course the Trinity Test. Maaaaan they did such a phenomenal job making it feel like it was a dire and heavy moment. And then when it finally happens, it wasn't what I was expecting, but it was still stunning.

Just a heads up there are about 3 spearate scenes of sex/nudity. It doesn't add anything to the story, and I don't think you need to have sex in a movie to make it good. Although I can admit that one of these scenes was trying to convey how Emily Blunt's character was feeling, so it kind of made sense.

To me it felt like it was exactly 3 hrs. Didn't feel any longer or shorter.",POSITIVE

I went into this movie, wanting to like it because of Nolan‚Äòs reputation for quality movies and filmmaking, however, the inclusion of these scenes into the final cut.

I didn't feel Ops post bomb misery enough. Wish there was more dumbing down of the science. I didn't care about his original lover, felt half-hearted.  It was just too much crammed into one movie. Daunting subject to capture I understand.

Finally, can we please stop the flashbacks and flashforwarding in films for a year or two. It didn't help build up any emotion so that when we got to his hearings, after 2 hours of movie, I didn't really care about the outcome.

"Jul 27, 2023","Oppenheimer, penned and directed by the visionary Cristopher Nolan, is a captivating cinematic masterpiece that shines in various aspects, making it a must-watch. One of the film's greatest strengths is its mesmerizing ambiance, which skillfully immerses the audience in the historical backdrop and intensifies the emotional impact of the narrative.

The production design in Oppenheimer is truly exceptional. Every aspect of the sets and locations is meticulously crafted, transporting viewers to the World War II era with astonishing authenticity (with one exception being the number of stars in the American flag in one scene).The keen attention to historical accuracy enhances the film's overall realism and brings the past to life in a visually stunning manner.

The cinematography, captured using IMAX film cameras by Hoyte Van Hoytema, is an awe-inspiring triumph in Oppenheimer. The grand visuals displayed on the IMAX screen create an immersive experience, showcasing Cristopher Nolan's and Hoyte Van Hoytema's masterful command of the cinematic craft. The breathtaking shots and expansive vistas add grandeur to the storytelling, leaving a lasting impression on the audience.

The film's editing is seamless and skillfully weaves together multiple timelines, allowing the narrative to unfold in a gripping and coherent way. Cristopher Nolan's trademark non-linear storytelling keeps viewers engaged and invested, while the precise cuts and transitions heighten the tension and emotional depth of the plot.

Oppenheimer's sound design is another standout feature that deserves accolades. The meticulous attention to detail in crafting a rich and immersive audio landscape adds depth and intensity to pivotal moments in the film. The sound effects and ambient noises blend harmoniously with the visuals, elevating the overall cinematic experience needed for the themes and sequences portrayed. 

The film's musical score, composed by returning composer Ludwig Goransson, complements the visuals and narrative impeccably. The evocative and powerful music amplifies the emotional resonance of the film, creating an unforgettable and haunting cinematic journey.

The acting performances in Oppenheimer are exceptional, with the cast delivering compelling and nuanced portrayals, with Cillian Murphy being the stand out. The ensemble cast breathes life into their respective characters, making them relatable and engaging throughout the narrative. Cristopher Nolan's skillful direction shines through in the actors' performances, elevating the film to extraordinary heights.

The practical special effects in Oppenheimer are a testament to the dedication and ingenuity of the film's production team. The seamless incorporation of practical effects enhances the authenticity of the film, adding realism to the war and scientific sequences without relying on excessive CGI.

However, it is important to address a couple of drawbacks in the film. I encountered sound mixing dissonances in certain scenes, where dialogue is overpowered by sound effects and the film's intense score. This minor issue can occasionally distract from an otherwise immersive experience.

Additionally, I was taken aback by scenes that included nudity in the film, which seemed out of place and detracted from the central focus of the narrative. While artistic choices are subjective, it's essential to acknowledge that these instances did take me out of the film. 

In conclusion, Oppenheimer is an ambitious and mesmerizing film that showcases Cristopher Nolan's and his team's unparalleled talent as filmmakers. Its remarkable ambiance, production design, cinematography, editing, sound design, musical score, acting, and practical special effects make it a standout cinematic achievement. Despite minor concerns about sound mixing and gratuitous nudity, Oppenheimer remains a compelling and thought-provoking cinematic masterpiece that demands to be experienced on the big screen.

"Jul 27, 2023",Amazing film. From the acting to the science to the music. No complaints on anything,POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2023",if you want to sit through a 3 hours courtroom drama then this movie is for you.  I was hoping for more exploding bombs but the one in New Mexico that they were focus on was a dud!!!,NEGATIVE
"Jul 27, 2023","Acting, cinematography, story and direction were all spectacular.   Only disliked the scene where Florence Pugh was totally naked in the chair -- unnecessary to have her exposed in that way.",POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2023",I‚Äôm gonna watched this 5 more times. Go watch it dawgs. Best movie of the year 10/10,POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2023","My new favorite movie, by far. I've read so much on WW1, WW2, the Vietnamese War, as well as the atrocities of Nanking. Seeing a point of view like this was so eye opening compared to the things I've read abt WW2. I've read things that usually glorify the use of fat man and little boy or show it as the only way to stop the war, these books also presented the US as a great nation. This was so much different and so enlightening on both the US government and the atomic bombs themselves.",POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2023","Christopher Nolan knows how to shoot a movie. It is a movie that has a lot of moving parts. Different perspectives as well. It shows the beauty of how great minds can come together to create something that is unimaginable. Also how those great minds don't see what unimaginable things it can do. Great performances. The female characters could have been a bit better. I enjoyed the movie. It is a slow burn, if you don't mind that then you'll enjoy it.",POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2023","As a baby-boomer who lived through the Cold War, I was very interested in learning more about Oppenheimer as a person and as the leader of the creation of the atom bomb.  This movie certainly provided a lot of background on both!  However, it was a LONG movie with lots of stylistic special effects trying to depict what might have been going on in his mind -- which I found distracting and silly.  I guess they were needed to enable movie theaters to crank up the volume and make my seat vibrate as explosions were depicted on screen.  I also found the frequent flash-backs and flash-forwards confusing, particularly the imagined sex scene in the hearing room for Oppenheimer's security clearance.    
The movie could easily have been 30-40 minutes shorter with no loss of dramatic appeal, and still allowed more time to understand more of the main ""villain"" of the story - Strauss.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 27, 2023",Too long. Score is over dialog and annoying. Too much reliance on special effects,NEUTRAL

"Jul 27, 2023","The three hours went fast, and was enthralling.  I strongly recommend this for teens and above.

"Jul 26, 2023","an exceptional film. It manages to build the story very well and convey reliable sensations to the situation.
The tension established in the film makes you feel immersed and apprehensive every second.
A masterpiece of cinema!",POSITIVE

"Jul 26, 2023","I never leave reviews but felt compelled to in this case - what an absolutely incredible film from start to finish. Cillian is just beyond words, one of the greatest actors around today I think. Amazing cast, amazing cinematography and just gripping right until the end. Nolan has smashed it once again.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023",Acting from all cast is sublime.,POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","Certainly Nolan's master work. Yes, it's overlong, but this is a complex story to say the least. Murphy and Downey are at the top of their craft. There isn't a weak performance in sight and nice to see some of my favorite ""that guy"" (and gal) actors fill in critical minor characters. Well worth the three-hour investment.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023",While born in 1948 I had no idea of the extent of the persecution Oppenheimer went through. Kind of reminds me of what the Republican party is doing now.,POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023",Es imposible no metitar con esta pel√≠cula. Es una obra maestra.,POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023",Did not like scrambled up scenes.  Did not include any details on actual construction of the bomb.  Did not like the congressional hearings ‚Äî boring!  The flow of the screenplay was not so good.  Focus on his womanizing traits didnt fit what the audience was looking for.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","A movie that has you on the edge of your seat by the halfway point and doesn't let you leane back into it until the end credits, supported by a godly soundtrack and otherwordly performances from the actors with visuals that don't dissapoint.Intense enjoyable and satisfying 10/10",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","The making of the first atomic bomb and the man behind it should be one of the most important stories of our time. It's too bad Nolan didn't make that film. Instead, ""Oppenheimer"" is far more concerned with McCarthyism and a few sordid moments in Robert Oppenheimer's past than it is with the actual Manhattan Project.  The editing was distractingly avant-garde, and the note-worthy moments where it worked well were too few to save a storyline that you already don't care about. Yes, the performances are great, but in the end, it's just not the story we came to see.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 26, 2023",Lovely acting but the story was trapped which created not a lot of room for the narrative to thrive. Murphy does wonders with his part but all his character development is stuck in a history we already know. P.S. Oldmans Truman was hilarious God bless that man and his talent.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","Nolan's best yet. I'm going to see it again tomorrow, it's THAT good!",POSITIVE

"Jul 26, 2023",Creo que es un poco aburrida y se podr√≠a haber hecho algo mucho mejor.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","I enjoyed this movie, but found it lacking in places. At times the storyline dragged on, and I was more invested in both Jean Tatlock and Kitty Oppenheimer than Robert Oppenheimer himself. His grief could be better investigated in the film. RDJ deliveres an award worthy performance.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 26, 2023",Sensational. Oscars all round.,POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023",One of his best films.,POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023",Thank you Nolan for this,POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","Christopher Nolan's flirtation with greatness, but it's practically ruined by far too many sequences littered with outrageously overused, overmixed, and overbearing music.  The actors' performances and much of their dialogue is barely allowed to breath without being drowned by the music.  Easily should have removed at least 50% of the score. The score on its own is often mesmerizing and exciting and brilliantly accompanies several scenes, several being the key word.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","Great movie, long movie, but absolute 10/10 down to the last minute.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","Absolute masterpiece. Thank you, Christopher Nolan, for telling us his biopics in this way. 10/10",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","There are two words to describe Oppenheimer: cinematic masterpiece. None of the achievements of this film could be done without writer/director Christopher Nolan. The script is absolutely phenomenal. It's a dialogue heavy three-hour film, but the tension and master class writing created by Nolan keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time. The score by Ludwig Goransson is fantastic, as it also helps build tension in almost every scene. The film jumps before, after, and during the testing of the atomic bomb, but it is surprisingly not too difficult to follow, and it is kept extremely interesting throughout. Another thing to note is the absence of CGI in the film, which is mind-blowing to think about after you've seen it. There are tons of shots showing close ups of the explosion, atoms, neutrons, etc., which you would think Nolan would use CGI for, but he doesn't, and all of these shots are visually stunning. It is just such an amazing accomplishment. Another key factor in this movie is the incredible acting from everyone involved. There are tons of A-list actors sprinkled throughout, some even just having one scene, and they all give great performances. One in particular is Tom Conti as Albert Einstein. Einstein is in a scene at the beginning, middle, and end, but the impact he has on the film is really memorable and impressive. Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer just needs to win Best Actor. His performance summed up in one word is haunting. He haunts with his eyes, the way he delivers his lines, and the way he just stares. He really shows the audience how depressed and miserable Oppenheimer was particularly after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Robert Downey Jr also shows how he isn't just Tony Stark, but an incredible actor with a wide range. Everyone involved absolutely deserves an award; the film is that great. Nolan's biopic Oppenheimer proves he is one of the great directors of all time.",POSITIVE

"Jul 26, 2023",I love movies that you think about long after you leave the theater!!,POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023",Really looked forward to this movie. Way to long to tell the story.  Acting was great,NEUTRAL
"Jul 26, 2023","From a scientific point of view, this movie was not what I was expecting.

If you are more interested in the Oppenheimer political scene then  this may interest you.

Was disappointed from the aspects of the acknowledgement of what the damage was done to the Japanese, and really that using the a bomb on a mainly civilian landscape, will go down in history the way should.

In the end, it was good to see Oppenheimer with some sort of Recognition.

‚Ä¶ In the Oppenheimer was responsible for the physics behind the atom bomb, but not the moral question of whether something like this should've been used. 

Also, the scenes of the atomic bomb at Los Alamos had a non-CGI type explosion with a lot of   lacklustre, paper fall out. Without a proper mushroom cloud.

Science took the back burner on this one, which was a complete disappointment to myself.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 26, 2023","This movie is nothing short of a masterpiece, there isn't a slow point and it doesn't feel anywhere close to 3 hours. This is a must watch movie!!!",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","Not a great movie. Far too long could have been shorter. Periods of loud explosions throughout movie, very weird and frustrating, not too sure why it was done. Running forward and backward in time. At times hard too follow. Best bits are in the final part of movie.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 26, 2023",This should have been a longer movie,POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023",3 HOUR MOVIE AND NEITHER MY WIFE nor I GOT BORED WITH IT. WE ACTUALLY RESEARCHED AFTER THE MOVIE TO SEE HOW ACCURATE IT WAS. WE THOUGHT IT WAS DONE WELL.,POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","The non-stop dialogue for the first 90 minutes was exhausting. By the end, I still felt no emotional connection to any of the characters. I just didn't care. And I've liked every other Christopher Nolan film I've seen, but this one just didn't do it for me.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 26, 2023",Best movie I have seen in a long time.,POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","I saw Oppenheimer. It was meh. Too long, too muddled, and it had a distractingly nude Florence Pugh, Robert Downey Jr. looked like Giancarlo Esposito. Rami Malek and Emily Blunt were severely underused, and the  exposition dump in the third act that took me right out of the story. Was it biography on the bomb, the Manhattan Project or on Oppenheimer?  It could have featured more about the life of Oppenheimer and his inner thinking that lead to the main conflict of the movie. 

I almost left twice out if boredom. I wish Cillian Murphy could have gotten more to do. They should have really delved into the tortured genius story like A Beautiful Mind and The Imagination Game, because it was clear Oppenheimer had demons but the story only skimmed the surface.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 26, 2023","Very good movie.  Learned a lot more about Oppenheimer following his life from his college days to heading
the events that took place at Los Alamos.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023",Oppenheimer is a must see for everyone who likes to enjoy Cinema at it's best. The visuals and the acting were on point. The topic is still very important and invites you to think about it. Although the film lost me for 1 or 2 Moments though to very long screentime. 4/5 Stars,POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023",Good story but way too long.  Should have been able to fit it in 2hrs. Nudity & gratuitous sex were completely unnecessary to the plot and a vulgar stain on the movie.  I wish they would have shown what the bombs did to the Japanese and shown the long term affects.,NEUTRAL
"Jul 26, 2023","""Oppenheimer"" es simplemente impresionante. Puedo decir que es una obra maestra cinematogr√°fica que destaca por su narrativa cautivadora, actuaciones excepcionales y una cuidadosa representaci√≥n hist√≥rica. El director logra transmitir la complejidad del personaje principal y su papel en el desarrollo de la bomba at√≥mica, manteniendo al espectador totalmente inmerso en la trama. Sin duda, una pel√≠cula que merece ser reconocida y aplaudida por su brillante ejecuci√≥n y profundidad en el contenido.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","This is one of the best movies I've ever seen... I think this is on par with ""Lawrence of Arabia"", ""Amadeus"", ""Raging Bull"", ""Goodfellas"", and ""The Aviator"" for one of the best biopics ever made. The music is out of this world.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023",This movie was entirely too long. The first 1.5 hours were a slog. I kept looking at my watch and that's never a good sign while watching a movie. Would not recommend this overhyped movie.,NEGATIVE

Nolan is a master of his craft. RDJ's performance ought to land an Oscar nomination. I thought I would miss him as Tony Stark, but portrayals like that of Admiral Strauss only reveal how much more talent and character range he has to give.",POSITIVE

"Jul 26, 2023",Very boring.  I would say this movie is not for entertainment. It's more of an artistic historical documentary. It's very interesting of course because it's part of pivotal human history. But the dialog is hard to follow at times. I needed my netflix subtitles. And Robert Downey Jr. mumbled a lot like he always does to make him seem important. But I loved the scenes of New Mexico and how Oppenheimers guilt came through. Didn't seem like 3 hours too. I was proud of myself for not taking a popcorn break.,NEUTRAL

"Jul 26, 2023","Very good movie. Highly recommended.
Having studied some of this history, I feel several scenes/interactions were significantly exaggerated. Still a damn good movie!",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","Robert Downey's role as Admiral Strauss was the highest point of the movie.
Having been at Los Alamos and Alamogordo, the settings were authentic, the physics range true, and the acting was admirable.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023",absolutely amazing cinematography and sound effects!   Christopher Nolan made you feel like you literally experienced the power of science and the bomb!  Beyond worthy of several Oscar nominations!,POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023",Brilliant and breath-taking,POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","The movie jumps around in time. It's hard to get a sense of how things happened or how much time passes (eg. when the project was started to when it was finished).  There were 3 types of bombs mentioned, but I was confused over why they only showed two bombs sent off to deliver to Japan.   And, lastly,  I found the sex scenes to be completely useless / pointless. Detracted from the movie, exploited the actress, embarrassed female audience members. I will not recommend this movie to my elderly parents or anyone with younger children.  No value, just stuck in there for what?  Movie would have been much better if these scenes were left on the cutting room floor.  Speak up people!! Let producers know this is trash.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 26, 2023","The best movie I've ever watched - stunning visuals, intelligent storylines, excellent acting by an ensemble cast more star-studded than the Milky Way, and quite possibly the Magnum Opus of Nolans' Career thus far. 

I'd recommend it to anyone willing to actually sit down and engage with a movie.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","It was a powerful 3 hour movie that left me wanting to know more about it and about the characters, specially about the title character!  Beautifully acted by an accomplished cast, beautifully told and harrowing through all the ups and downs of life!  The twists and turns in the last 30minutes were very satisfying yet somehow wanting to know more!  That is the power of great storytelling!! Saw it at IMAX and well worth it but not necessary.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","I read American Prometheus and this was an excellent synoptic persepctive by Nolan. 
The acting was superb by Blunt, Damon and Downey. Cillian Murphy gave a stunning performance as the lead and has emerged as one of the most brilliant actors in our time. I don't really care about the Oscars but this humble Irishman gentleman deserves one.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","Long boring film, mostly about the kangaroo court. 
Wish I stayed at home.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 26, 2023",This is blast from Direction to cinematography to acting. Nolan's best work. Hats off to the team.,POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","Absolutely one of the best movies I've watched! I had trouble pinpointing a favorite movie so far, but the minute I stepped out of the theater for Oppenheimer I knew it was the one. I'm still staned. I can't believe the masterpiece they created. Best work from everyone!",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","It was ok, historical anecdotes were good but his personal life brought up all the time",NEGATIVE
"Jul 26, 2023",For starters it's too long.  this story could have been told in less than two hours.  The final hour was the whole piece and the first two were just too talky and obtuse for most.  I like Nolan and most of his films but this needed trimming by someone not personally involved in the making of it.,NEUTRAL
"Jul 26, 2023",Great acting and cast!,POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","I thought this was an excellent film.  The acting, script, and cinematography were all first-rate.  Despite the movie's three-hour length, I remained immersed in the story.

The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that I am not sure what would constitute a ""perfect"" film..!",POSITIVE

"Jul 26, 2023","Unless you have a detailed knowledge of mid-20th century US politics, a lot of the themes will stump most people. Having said that, it is wonderfully shot with great performances from Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt and Robert Downey Jr.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","First, this did not feel like a 3 hour movie. At no point did I feel this was boring or dragging. Second, admittedly I do not know much about the actual Oppenheimer and the politics at that point in time. However, I did not need to to understand that this was a compellingly complex and multifaceted look at who he was and what he went through as well as the harsh reality of effects of the bombs/war in general. Without going into more I will say this was one of the best movies I have ever seen and on par with the way movies used to be done.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","Fascinating origin of the atomic bomb. I‚Äôm glad I watched it. However, if you don‚Äôt go to the theater often and you‚Äôre debating what you should see. Sound of Freedom is a much more impactful and necessary movie than this. But if you love the theater, then definitely check out Oppenheimer.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 26, 2023","Must see in a theater!  The emotion and supporting sounds are incredibly moving, and you don't realize it has been 3 hours - I was in a trance!!",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023",It was entirely too long at 3 hours.   I was looking for a little more in depth discussion and conversation of the development of the nuclear bomb.   This move is more of a documentary of the life of Oppenheimer and a great deal of that is very boring.  I also thought the 3 or 4 scenes of nudity was not necessary and probably what got the film the R rating.,NEUTRAL
"Jul 26, 2023",True to history. High production quality. Well acted and directed.,POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","I wasn't sure I could sit still for three hours but I'm glad I experienced this. The acting, story, writing and direction was really good all the way across. A very compelling story was told about a man that I was aware of but this is a deep and fascinating dive into his personal and professional life as well as a look at how our government operated under the stresses of war. 

I'm removing a star from my review for two reasons. First, I saw it in IMAX and I'm just not sure that it wouldn't have been just as enjoyable in a standard movie theater. The other big negative for me was the SOUND mix and the music! I think they meant to layer the music under the dialogue and not beat you to death with it. And, in this theater, they had the volume CRANKED to maximum. I had to take a paper napkin and make some primitive ear plugs just to take the edge off. I knew I couldn't sit there for 3.5 hours (the commercials and previews were at least 30 minutes) without damping down the volume.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","Well written film, just not enough action. Definitely not for kids under 17  lol",NEUTRAL
"Jul 26, 2023","I knew very little about Oppenheimer before this movie. I think it's a must see for the younger generation. Wish they would've left out the nudity, but besides that it was a great movie!",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","Riveting, intense and, allowing for a little dramatic license, incredibly detailed and historically accurate.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","This hugely important and highly anticipated story was brought to the screen in an overlong, confusing, bloated mess. The first hour could have been condensed into twenty minutes. Much of it was minimally related to the core elements of the story. They used the mini-series approach to story-telling in one film. The music and sound effects seemed to have been designed for the audiences that enjoy super-hero films.  At times I felt as if I were listening to an adaptation of the Jaws theme. I am an educated, intelligent film-goer, but I found it difficult to keep track of the comings and goings of the huge cast of characters. For the most part the acting was strong, especially Matt Damon, Emily Blunt and Rami Malek. But Cillian Murphy overplayed the actor's trick of not blinking, so we would know how intense he was. And as we approached the end, Robert Downey Jr. gave a credible impersonation of Norma Desmond. The most interesting moments were the last, Oppenheimer's imagined conversation with Einstein. I was so very disappointed, as were my companions, but I am looking forward to reading the book.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","Saw movie in 70 mm imax. Amazing story, characters, and acting. Thoroughly enjoyed!",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","A very thought-provoking film that beautifully explores the concept of science for the greater good, the ethics of science and the political landscape during and after World War II.

"Jul 26, 2023",Gripping. Cillian is spectacular. You are immersed into the story.,POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","Unpopular Opinion: I believe this movie was disappointing. The visuals, sounds, and beautiful direction could only be thinned out fondant on a crooked cake. I wish Nolan had spent more time flushing out the character development and molding the film to match the mix of tones moving through it. To me, the script was messy. The plot incoherent, and the ending dull. I personally believe it was one note. I believe in show instead of tell in films. If I wanted to read the novel on which this film is based, I would have done that instead. There seems to be a disconnect in what the script tried to accomplish and the finished product. As I watched it, some scenes felt completely out of place and would take the audience out of the raw gravity of a scene prior. There was no need for Pugh and her CGI'd boobs, albeit she is a great actress. No need for the ""womanizer"" comment from Matt Damon because in the 1930s most men were doing exactly what Oppenheimer did. He literally wooed what... 2 women? and his wife? Also, RDJ does not expand his reach as an actor enough. Once the real side of his character is exposed... it's for nothing. The film is so muted that it isn't an exciting shift. He has one little hissy fit and he's back to ""meh"" energy after. He is such a genuinely good actor, but his moments lacked depth and dimension outside of some lip biting. Cillian Murphy's sacrifice is how he kept his eyes bulging out of his head for three hours. His American accent is great, but besides bulging his eyes out more and pacing... there's no dimensional shifts in his character. The dynamics are rushed, and the heartache you want to feel is masked by brown noise. I love films with exposition and thought out premises, but it's not fully realized in this movie. I'm unsure how this film's script was not ripped apart by critics for emphasizing the obvious nature of the A-bomb 10 million times. Instead of showing those affected (i.e. natives to New Mexico whose land was seized and were displaced by the project, after effects of testing around nuclear energy to any of those involved, or even Japanese people who faced the bomb), this film takes the humanity out of the crisis of stopping nuclear energy dependence and expansion by raking in numbers and a depressed man who went too far. I understand how smart Oppenheimer is not from the level work shown, but by how many people kept repeating just how amazing and revolutionary he was. I'm not convinced. The only way that I can ease my anger at why those who felt the ripple of his work were not shown is because maybe Oppenheimer did not have access to the empathy needed to address those topics. They rushed through it all and went straight into Oppenheimer's altruistic and political endeavors thereafter. Nolan's main point is to bring the audience out of their ""naivete"" (I hated when the guy from Beautiful Creatures said this line) around nuclear weapons. I get it, I understand the message of the film, but the heart is lost. Diamonds in the rough couldn't even bring the film up to me. Overall amazed by Emily Blunt's performance as Kitty. She was dynamic in her short on-screen bursts. For me, she stole the whole movie with her final scenes. Coherent, loud, and with a range that Josh Peck wish he had when he shook his arm to press that big ol' red button. Rami Malek also does a great job of easing into the best character development shown! Hits a home run and he was in it - 3 minutes? The actor behind Albert Einstein, phenomenal. I'm disappointed after all of Nolan's movies that some say this is his greatest life's work... it is not. This feels incomplete and rushed. (Not to mention a reunion of white guys who peaked in 2007)

Cinematography is still gorgeous, as always. This is a movie you can probably only watch once to say you did, but I doubt anyone will be picking it up to watch a second time.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 26, 2023","All-in-all an underwhelming film that felt like a speedrun of 2 seasons of a non-existent tv show that told a much better story. I say ""speedrun"" because the scenes are hardly ""scenes"" but instead are quick moments that build one large montage and hurdles the movie forward. Similar to a movie trailer or music video, where it's a mish mash of images that evoke a feeling, rather than images that actually tell a story or expand on any characters.

This style is something he did a lot since Inception, but here it's turned up to the maximum. And it made all the characters feel hollow. It made moments that should've been big, feel like mere footnotes like a passing thought. It only hit the highlights, the good stuff, the sparknotes...leaving the heart of the characters and all the breathing room on the cutting room floor. And when the characters only feel like meaningless smears on a screen, it leaves me feeling nothing.

Visually I have no idea why this was promoted for IMAX. Visually it's shot extremely ordinary and lackluster. They made it seem like this was going to be a visual feast like Blade Runner or even Dunkirk, but it most definitely wasn't. If you really want to see a bunch of scientists in rooms discussing bomb building then ok, but for me it wasn't worth the extra cost.",NEGATIVE

Other than that, it is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. It was original, well made, complex and thought provoking.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","One of Nolan's best work to date. The movie is incredibly well-acted, well-written, thought provoking, cinematically gorgeous, all with an amazing score. The technical aspects of this movie is unparalleled. Compared to Nolan's other works this movie is fairly straightforward but it still requires the viewers full attention. Although keep in mind, this is a 3 hour long drama, mostly just dialogue. So it is not going to be for everyone. Don't expect a thrill but I will say the final act of this movie might be the most thrill you can possibly get from a non-thriller movie.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023",Cillian Murphy and Christopher Nolan doing an incredible job with this as always. Interstellar has been my favorite movie for such a long time and I was thrilled to see this movie.

"Jul 26, 2023","Nolan √© um autor que entrega o que a ind√∫stria hollywoodiana deseja, mas ainda sim um autor, com uma arte progressivamente t√©cnica em sua filmografia n√£o obstante pode-se aferir isso tamb√©m na emo√ß√£o que sua arte transmite, o cinema de Nolan est√° cada vez mais sem alma.
Entre anticomunismo rasteiro e o refor√ßo da ideia de que os Estados Unidos foi o grande vencedor da Segunda Guerra Mundial, algo que ser√° muito celebrado pela ind√∫stria estadunidense, o filme vai criando uma tens√£o em torno da cria√ß√£o da bomba at√¥mica, dramatizando for√ßadamente alguns momentos para criar um senso de √©pico em cima do entediante e ou tr√°gico.
Openheimer acerta na escala√ß√£o de seus atores, por√©m com um roteiro que quer se mostrar complexo para se vender profundo, em um mar de superficialidade, autoindulg√™ncia hip√≥crita e autocr√≠ticas c√≠nicas do poderio b√©lico e militar estadunidense e suas decis√µes genocidas no fim da segunda guerra mundial com os bombardeamentos at√¥micos de Hiroshima e Nagasaki.

"Jul 26, 2023","Oppenheimer 

I Am not a fan of long-drawn-out biopics. They usually bore me to tears. It's not that I don't appreciate a good drama or a history lesson. To me, many biopics are dry. 

Oppenheimer was stunning. Everything from the intense audio mixing, the pacing, the acting, the makeup, and the score was perfect. The three hours zoomed by. It is easily one of Nolan's best directing. I can't express the audio enough. I am not just talking about the quality of the sound, but the sounds used and when. Emotions are perfectly balanced with visuals, acting, and sound. I was pulled in and could feel what the characters were feeling.

Now the negative.

I am not one to race-bait everything. Suppose this was a piece about 8th-century Sweden with an all-European cast. Makes sense. 

But seriously,  where are all the black people? 

African American Ronald Auguste played ""J. Ernest Wilkins"" in a blink-and-you-will-miss role. That's it.  Ernest Wilkins was a prominent member of the Manhattan Project.

 At least 19 of the scientists were black. Thousands of Black Americans worked low-wage jobs in project facilities and faced Jim Crow segregation. ""The project was unique for bringing together ""colored and white, Christian and Jew"" I understand that 19 is much smaller than the over 400 white scientists and technicians. However, William Jacob Knox, Jr., Samuel Proctor Massie, and Carolyn Parker were among the handful of Black scientists who worked on the Manhattan Project. In such a high-profile movie filled with forgettable side characters, indeed, there was room to have a more prominent role for some of the vital African American members of the project in the movie. For example,  William Jacob Knox Jr., was a physical chemist, joined Columbia in 1943 and was promoted to the head of the Corrosion section of the nuclear research team. Knox held an unprecedented position at Columbia University, serving as the only African-American supervisor on the Manhattan Project. However, he was nowhere to be seen in the movie.

This was Nolan's chance to showcase a piece of history. However, he continued the trend of burying African American contribution in the sciences.",POSITIVE

"Jul 26, 2023",This film is made for people who enjoy the movie going experience as a whole.  Had an opportunity to seeing the movie in 70 mm IMAX and the experience was just awesome.  A heavy dialogue film still keeps the audience attention because of A plus acting and great directing by Christopher Nolan.  This film is about intensity and with a fantastic score by Ludwig Goransson the film simply does not let up. This my favorite non Batman related Christopher Nolan film.,POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","Believable portrayal of the man who lead the team of scientists who created the atomic bomb. There is so much more to this story, and it couldve ran as a 10part series, but its a nicely condensed version to pique the viewers interest to learning more.",POSITIVE

Often times in cinema youre the person looking at the story but here it really felt as if you were there on the site of the detonations. As for the story, I can see why people found it hard to keep track of what was going on, yes you had to pay extra attention to understand the environment and the plot but it rewarded you brilliantly. I remember being in awe at the ending and feeling so satisfied that I managed to get the full experience. My advice is for people to try to focus on it as much as you can because when you do you'll find yourself enjoying it a lot more. Truly an Oscar worthy film.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","Oppenheimer is in my opinion peak cinema. Its themes and revelations are some of the most urgent and profound of any film I have had the pleasure of watching. The weight of humanitys burden of atomic weapons and its impact on the 20th century and beyond give this film the distinct position of being THE retrospective of the century. If I had to give an alien species a single film to explain the 20th century I would pick this one. That aside I was entirely shocked at how well the more personal character conflict arc of the story played out and how the juxtaposition of the triumph of succeeding, the weight of guilt, and the fallout from the trial show a unique character study. The soundtrack is also phenomenal, one thing I was a little concerned about heading in since, despite Ludwig Gorannson having some standouts, not all of his works are bangers like HZ. Ive listened to Can You Hear the Music and Destroyer of Worlds on repeat since seeing the movie. Cillian Murphy obviously stole the show but I was very impressed by Robert Downey Jr. since this is the first role I can say I have seen him play a character that wasnt driven by a characteristic performance to have personality and stage presence. The runtime was a hot button for some but this is one of the first movies Ive seen in years that I actually felt satiated from. It towed a balance between development and payoff in a risky yet Nolanesque pace where puzzle pieces are left from post to post out of order but by the end we have the tapestry completed. Overall an utterly stunning piece that had me contemplating our place as a species and thoroughly enjoying a great story.",POSITIVE

"Jul 26, 2023","K. Went to see Oppenheimer. 
Definitely not for fidgety kids unless their favorite hobbies are thermonuclear quantum physics and politics. Full 3 hours long. Slightly different take on past fliks and documentaries about the first nuke bombs and Oppenheimer. It deals with losing his Q clearance that divorced him from any USA government associations. He was castigated and blacklisted during our McCarthyism era. Focus is on his friends from communist countries and any intelligence secrets that might have leaked out of Los Alamos. Good acting could not salvage the toll taken by slow and sometimes droll developments of the unremarkable third act. I felt a couple loose strings were left dangling with no closure other than Googling to see outcome. 
Wait for it to reach your home and you can stream at no additional cost. At least 3 times you will put it on hold and finish chores. The outstanding actors Cillian Murphy, Matt Damon, and Emily Blunt, couldnt perk it up to the point it didnt feel like a drudgery commitment and obligation to stick it out after buying a ticket.

Also, the movie is a bit unsettling.  It does a great job of handling the moral dilemmas.  First the dilemma of dropping the bomb in the first-place.  Second the dilemma of bringing it into existence.  An excellent movie.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023",Very powerful on many levels,POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023",This was an epic film with lots of drama and history. It was indeed long but there was a lot of territory to cover in Dr. Oppenheimer's life. Cillian Murphy should be considered on the short list when it comes to best actor nominations at Oscar time and Robert Downey Jr. for best supporting actor.,POSITIVE

"Jul 26, 2023","Nolan has finally found his groove! He usually has a tendency to not edit with his past movies (i.e. unnecessary side plots) but with this amazing historical biopic it's hard to do that.  The acting is superb by all.  Cillian Murphy did an excellent job as Oppenheimer and Robert Downey Jr is sure to get the Oscar for Supporting and Nolan is due for Best Picture.  Gary Oldman had one of the best, shortest scenes ever as Truman.  My only complaint is the hearings on Oppenheimer went on a little long and I was hoping for more experiments on testing the bomb which they did in real life many times over without success.  Other than that, very moving and finally a well done movie that we've been missing for many years now.  Bravo!",POSITIVE

Not enough impact on the most important scene, the first explosion of the bomb should have blown our minds but it fell kind of flat. I almost felt that there was some pro-communist story line as well but it was subtle and not too much. Was it great? Not really. It was good. The fact that more people by far are going to see the anti male propaganda movie Barbie says a lot about our society and Oppenheimer may be excluded from the academy award because they didn't replace half of the characters with the wrong ethnicity or gender or with homosexuals or trans characters.

The parallels are scary.",POSITIVE

"Jul 26, 2023","Fantastic cast and the best performance I've seen in quite some time. Cillian Murphy showcased his phenomenal talent and Christopher Nolan proved to us once again that he is one of the greatest directors of our time. Would I watch it at home on tv? Probably not, but personally I think it's the type of film that should only be seen in a cinema setting just from a visual and audio perspective.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","This movie was AWESOME - it didn't feel like three hours, and it was always captivating!  Amazing visuals, just a great movie!  My only criticism is that some of the female characters could've had more development, especially Oppenheimer's wife, Kitty.",POSITIVE

Sure Opp has a great director, great actors... it should have 3 best acting awards... Blunt, Murphy and Downey in that order.  And yet.... i got bored. It's a good thing I saw it in the theater cause I'd have never gotten through it at home. I'm not sure how they made nudity, sex and the most dangerous gamble mankind has ever known - so tedious. But they did and Matt Damon... I can't believe you signed up for that. In fact, the next time I see any of you in a movie at the theater again, please, lean a smidge more B.  It's expensive for the poor working class to see a movie with popcorn and a drink.  The audience bubbled out of B.  Don't be B... but do get in some movies the audience ""bubbles out of the theater after it's over.""   Just cause you're stars and you can.",NEGATIVE

Don't get me wrong- I knew the subject matter is not cheerful and it was very well done I'm sure and it will win lots of awards.

"Jul 26, 2023",History in a movie without too much stretching of the truth.  Great acting but see it on the BIG screen.,POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","The story they wanted to show was a great one, but they didn't do a good job of making it into film. To begin, you'll be whipped back and forth between scenes unexpectedly and feel like they are racing to finish the film. There was no need to race through the story so fast, but include long scenes about Oppenheimer's deposition and a random nude conversation that went on longer than most other scene's that were significantly more important. The whole movie felt like they sacrificed quality for quantity. While you're being thrown around the whole movie you also have to try drown out the over-the-top symphony music that never ceases to end. That's not to say the music itself was bad, just totally unnecessary for about 70% of the time and highly distracting. Finally, this all summed up to a generally hard movie to connect with and I felt nothing towards any of the characters. I never felt emotionally engaged whatsoever. 

I was so excited to see this movie but I left the cinema utterly disappointed.
2.5/5.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 26, 2023",Gripping from beginning to end. Go now!,POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023",I was absolutely surprised by how well done in this movie was. The actors seemed like they were actually the actual person of the time. I would recommend this to anyone interested in seeing something spectacular.,POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","This was an OK movie.  It was slow at first, then became a little more interesting. I am glad I saw it, but I would recommend waiting to see it at home where you can be more comfortable for 3 hours.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 26, 2023","By far, one of the best films in a long time. Murphy and Downey Jr were in thier best form, and Nolan's film delivered a film that both satisfied and forewarned. I am not much of one to spend the extra to see a film in IMAX, but this one really is a true 3D experience where the feel in the enhanced theatre absolutely adds.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","Incredibly disappointed.   I'm not sure that all the people raving about this movie saw the same film that I did. I'm also suspicious that they are bots purchased by Hollywood in the hopes of hyping up this movie to generate more revenue. Honestly, it is three hours of a mediocre biopic that tries to make intense drama out of the questions of Oppenheimer's true political affiliations, his choices in selecting personnel for the Manhattan project, whether or not he passed on information to the Soviets, and the tarnishing of his reputation following the war in the McCarthy era.  As for the bomb scene, I probably could've done a better job in my backyard throwing some gasoline on a bonfire and combining it with a really loud boom through the audio system of the theater. Did you know on a clear night the brightness of atomic bomb could cause temporary blindness if you look directly at it within 53 miles? However, this movie has some Dipshit looking at it through the glass of his car and he's completely unaffected. The entire movie also gratuitously uses dramatic music in background in the hopes of keeping the viewer engaged.  There was a real opportunity here to inform people about the raw power of these weapons in order to spur us to action to have them removed from the face of the Earth, and it was completely missed. The amount of information conveyed in this movie about the devastation of the bombs on the people of Japan seem to be delivered as throwaway lines in the movie that we honestly could summarize in about four or five sentences.  I'm not looking for gratuitous violence, but the average person doesn't fully understand how prevalent and terrifyingly powerful these weapons are. Watching the Plan A simulation on what a nuclear war would look like is much more powerful than the three hours that I wasted on this movie.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","Not quite what I expected. Truely Its a drama about his life! The Atom Bomb project was only a side note and main note was his history. So the movie ""Oppenheimer"" is strictly about him and not the BOMB.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 26, 2023","It was a bit disjointed, but that aside, it was a profound story of not just a man but the entire process of the making of the Atom Bomb and so well done with an incredible cast.  It was indeed three hours long, but it didn't seem like it.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023",The best movie I have ever seen but if your expecting it to be just about to nuke I wouldn't recommend it and if you love history your gonna absolutely love this movie like me even if your not into history it's still a good movie and can teach you a lot and you may get into it,POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","The performances all around were absolutely stunning and the visuals were an absolute masterpiece, specifically the detonation of the atomic bomb was one of the greatest sequences I have ever seen in movies my entire life. It's an intellectually engaging and very complex narrative but very rewarding as a result. Some of the dialogue felt a bit drab in multiple places, especially near the end of the film when Oppenheimer is giving his statement but I felt that this was massively overshadowed by the phenomenal cast. Overall, a fantastic movie that I cannot recommend enough.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","So far I believe this to be one of the best and most important films of the century. Even though the film is 3 hours long, it flies by like butter. The editing, the music and cinematography pushes you to the next scene clean and fast. The film feels intense and scary, demanding your attention with every second.  I can't get over the governments treatment of Oppenheimer and the films haunting ending out of my head. The theme and purpose of the film commands discussion and debate about our future with what lies ahead for us. Please watch this film, then create some discourse and action.",POSITIVE

"Jul 26, 2023","This movie is FUCK‚ÄôN HORRIBLE, an immense waste of time and money!!!",NEGATIVE
"Jul 26, 2023",The visual effects were remarkable while devoid of CGI reliance. Robert Downey Jr. did an amazing performance. His dramatic abilities even made Iron-man believable. I would have liked this film to have given more time to the science behind the atomic bomb and less time to the politics behind its development.,NEUTRAL
"Jul 26, 2023","Oppenheimer is a captivating drama helmed by acclaimed director Christopher Nolan and showcasing Cillian Murphy in the role of Oppenheimer as the renowned physicist overseeing the Manhattan Project‚Äîan undercover initiative during World War II to develop the atomic bomb. This thought-provoking film delves into Oppenheimer's dilemmas, ethical conflicts, and personal battles while shedding light on the political backdrop against which their groundbreaking work unfolded.

Nolan's mastery of storytelling shines through in this gem, skilfully intertwining timelines, flashbacks and perspectives to present a multifaceted portrayal of Oppenheimer‚Äîa brilliant mind with his fair share of imperfections. Murphy delivers an enthralling performance as the scientist haunted by his past, tormented by his circumstances, and uncertain about what lies ahead. With subtlety and intensity, Murphy brings forth Oppenheimer's struggles‚Äîhis passion, ambition, guilt, fear, and doubt‚Äîall laid bare for viewers to ponder.

The film boasts an excellent supporting cast: Matt Damon embodies General Leslie Groves‚Äîthe leader overseeing the project‚Äîwith finesse. Florence Pugh portrays Jean Tatlock‚ÄîOppenheimer's lover with Communist sympathies‚Äîin a compelling manner that adds complexity to their relationship. Kenneth Branagh beautifully captures Niels Bohr's essence‚Äîa mentor and friend to Oppenheimer. Emily Blunt embodies Kitty Oppenheimer, Robert Oppenheimer's wife. Robert Downey Jr‚Äîportraying Lewis Strauss, the villain who tried to frame Oppenheimer as a communist. The list goes on. The actors bring a sense of depth and authenticity to their roles, making the characters truly memorable and believable.

This film goes beyond being a character study; it also enters thriller territory. It showcases the challenges, obstacles, and dangers that the project faced, ranging from espionage to sabotage to almost insurmountable challenges. As the film progresses towards the moment of New Mexico's atomic test known as Trinity, the director skilfully builds up suspense and tension. Oppenheimer also explores the aftermath of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings shedding light on their consequences for Oppenheimer and the world.

Visually speaking, this film is stunning. Nolan creates realistic and immersive scenes. The brilliant cinematography by Hoyte van Hoytema captures the contrast between barren desert landscapes and claustrophobic laboratory settings with finesse. The score composed by Chris Fogel adds a haunting touch that enhances the film's overall mood and emotional impact. The soundtrack is the usual loud one characteristic of Nolan's movies, and it's occasionally difficult to hear what is said. But, overall, the movie's sound and music intensifies the experience. Colour is cleverly used to represent different perspectives. According to Christopher Nolan, black and white are used for the perspective of Lewis Strauss; colour is used for Robert Oppenheimer's perspective. This approach helps us, as viewers, to keep track of the complex interplay between the two characters.

I'll mention a couple of drawbacks. Its length (three hours) may test some viewers' patience due to its occasionally slow-paced nature. The film assumes familiarity with physics and history and might isolate some viewers, but my advice is to sit back and allow the movie, as a whole, to wash over you; understanding the details of physics is not necessary to appreciate the story. The film doesn't extensively explore the ramifications of the bomb and provide the perspectives of its victims, which could leave some audience members disappointed or offended. There is some treatment of this, but it is fleeting compared to the rest of the material in the movie. Given that the story is a biography of Oppenheimer, this was probably appropriate, but viewers can decide about this.

Oppenheimer is a movie that offers a captivating glimpse into one of the most influential and controversial individuals of the 20th century. It showcases Nolan's skills and Murphy's impressive acting abilities. It's engaging, complex, and powerful.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","Cillian Murphy is great but I found the imposition of loud music by the director a distraction. Didn't Nolan trust his actors to create tension? 

I also found the plot difficult to follow. Perhaps because the music made it difficult to hear the dialogue at times.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 26, 2023","Deep and mindful movie which leaves you with a clear awareness of the genius of the cinematography. It sharpens all the senses and places the viewer not in the role of judge, but in the role of appreciator of Christopher Nolan's genius.",POSITIVE

"Jul 26, 2023",Graphic nudity ruined it for me. Totally unneeded for the story. I also left movie with more questions than answers. Overall I was disappointed. Trailers were better than movie.,NEUTRAL
"Jul 26, 2023","It was ok but I think my suspicions are confirmed that it's being pushed hard to draw attention away from Sound of freedom. Fat man & little boy was a better, more informative and far more entertaining movie. I realize this movie is supposed to be more about the man and the aftermath rather than the project but I was underwhelmed.
 I hate the modern the Mtv video directing style of short sequences, hard cuts and in this case the constant time frame jumping with no referencing. I had to constantly refocus my brain from sequence to sequence trying to maintain continuity making it feel like work rather than entertainment. It's fine for action movies where the story line is secondary to the visual action but not for a drama, especially a historical one and of such importance. Knowing what year it was in any given scene was confusing and annoying.
 I didn't feel that I got to know the characters or develop sympathy for them.  As they say in critic vernacular, the characters were not fleshed out.  Everyone is gushing over Cillian Murphy but he gave me the notion Oppenheimer never knew if he was coming or going. Maybe they were trying to make him human and relatable while Oppenheimer was anything but, so they should have gave us that. He comes across as fragile, shallow and incapable of standing up for himself which we know Oppenheimer was not. And though I like Matt Damon he was totally miscast and gave us zero insight into Leslie Groves. But I will say Robert Downey Jr. did a good job stepping out of his standard charming rogue routine.
 The thing that nearly drove me crazy was the incessant and overly loud back ground score that was distracting often making the dialog hard to hear and was not in character with the story or era.  Movie music is supposed to enhance the scene creating mood and tension not just be there for no reason. Again Mtv.
For a viewer that has no historical knowledge of the era, Oppenheimer, the Manhattan project and his subsequent black listing I think they would come away saying WTF did I just watch? 
 I didn't hate the movie but I wish I had just waited for Prime or Netflix. Especially since I took the reviews advice and paid the extra for IMAX that didn't warrant the extra price. I paid almost $40 for two tickets when I could have seen it for $8.50 per on a regular screen and much more comfortable seats.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 26, 2023","A masterpiece, I loved it.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","Compared to other nolan films, it's not great. But compared to the drivel other writers are putting out these days it's pretty good. Your mom will NOT be able to follow the time jumps. The acting is fantastic, and the aging/de-aging is perfectly un-noticeable. Shots of Pugh's tatas are gratuitous and disappointing. Blunt's disappointment and disdain in the movie mirror mine for Pugh. 
I wholeheartedly felt that they cut off 90% of the frame when showing the explosion because it was a digital theater instead of imax. I don't plan to re-watch it in genuine imax.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 26, 2023","To be honest, even though I regard Christopher Nolan as one of my favourite, when I first heard that Oppenheimer was his next film, I was a bit skeptical. Oppenheimer is a drama/biography is a genre Nolan has not tackled before. So I was not sure how this one would come out, and was cautious to jump on the hype of the Barbenheimer craze. BUT!!!

After watching the film, I realise my doubt was misplaced and I have grown significantly more respect and appreciation for Nolan's work. Oppenheimer was an amazing film! Despite it being nearly three hours long, I was really impressed how they managed to give the film a fast pace. The film never really felt like it slowed down. The intensity was constant throughout. In a weird way, it felt like the ticking of a time bomb, always progressing to something bigger.",POSITIVE

"Jul 26, 2023","Has to be watched in IMAX to be truly appreciated. Christopher Nolan has chiseled his masterpiece. This film isn't for everyone though, it's about theoretical nuclear physics and it's true to it's source material. This movie has locked down at least four Oscars already.

"Jul 26, 2023","OPPENHEIMER ls on of Christopher Nolan's best films ever with the all star cast makes this film one of the best films of 2023 by miles this awesome film will be in the films of the year by miles and miles Oppenhelmer has one of the best all star cast you must see this film only mission lmpossble dead reckoning part one and indiana jones and the dial of destiny are both awesome films you must see there,s 3 films on the big screen if you see all 3 films you will be in the cinema for about 9 hours",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","While it is a little lengthy, Oppenheimer is a great film with a star studded cast. Can get a bit confusing at times with all the names that are thrown around. The overall plot is terrific, with some scenes that will definitely leave a lasting impression. This film is very heavy on dialogue and can probably do without some scenes. Nonetheless, it is an amazing movie that I highly recommend.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","Based on the trailer I was expecting something like Dunkirk, but got something more like The Prestige, so at first I was a bit surprised. But when I accepted this is something different, I enjoyed it immensely. It is a bit like The Prestige and The Social Network had a love child. Cillian Murphy's performance one of the best I've ever seen, it was his charisma that connected the whole build of short flashes into different phases of Oppenheimer's life. And absolutely no bad performances in this film at all.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","The editing is so unique and fast paced. The sound design and score are tense and hauntingly beautiful. Acting is top notch by the ensemble and Murphy shines in his first leading role. Watch on the biggest screen possible, this is truly an experience of a film.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023",Outstanding. A very interesting insight into A-bomb development highlighting political issues which I wasn't aware of. Yet remarkably the story is extremely fast paced with tension and intensity maintained throughout in typical Nolan style. A powerful and emotional movie with excellent audio to drive home the intensity so you feel every scene. IMAX experience recommended.,POSITIVE

"Jul 26, 2023","The overall story as how it‚Äôs told on this historical figure is intense, fast paced, and interesting. However, to summarize you‚Äôre looking at a 3 hour talking back to back (different time scenes) kind of movie that was just boring in general. I even heard an audience member snore in the background haha.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","What a masterpiece. Kept me completely engaged for 3 full hours. Pacing, acting, writing, cinematography, soundtrack, all fantastic. Only a few flaws that are too insignificant to mention.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","""Oppenheimer"" keeps an entertaining pace, despite the length of this massive tale. But somehow I didn't connect with any character very emotionally. Maybe that's the price paid with a film where the real focus is not on the protagonist, but on the story, a vital cautionary appeal as we step off this cliff into the age of AI, just as Oppenheimer led us off the cliff into the atomic age.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 26, 2023","Instant classic. 
An intimate film that rests on the interpretive capacity of first-rate actors.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","Fantastic, even with a bare bone understanding of Physics and just the history behind the great minds of physics it was great to understand how Oppenheimer was able to build and create a bomb that has the capabilities of just destroying the world. The visuals are also spectacular as with any Nolan movie and although the audiomixing could have been better the soundtrack is fantastic and it really brings you into the world of Oppenheimer's mind and what he is going through",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023",Awesome movie- Michael,POSITIVE

"Jul 26, 2023","Absolutely recommend for any science and politics geek, personally the best work of Nolan.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","The movie was good, but for 3 hours, I wanted more history, even science. I would have liked to have seen something about the aftermath of the bomb and the consequences. I didn't need as much backstory of his relationships. The acting was fantastic. I didn't need the biology parts. I would have liked more history of his life after the hearings. The movie was well done and should win awards. The IMAX theater was terrible, and the seats were uncomfortable. ",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","Oppenheimer itself is a great movie. As always, it has the markings of a Christopher Nolan epic; great cinematography, interesting shots, a story that unfolds before you, and a cast of characters that every viewer can appreciate. However, where Oppenheimer succeeds in storytelling, provocative thought, and the study of its characters - it lacks variability. There are plenty of great moments, but at times the dialogue between characters dominates the screen, leaving some breathing room to be desired for those looking for a more thrilling experience.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023",One of my favorite movies of all time,POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","Absolutely intense. A Masterpiece. Roller-coaster of emotion. Cillian Murphy, the goat!!",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023",I'd say this movie could have been about 30 minutes shorter. I get the detail had to be shown in the build up to the bomb but there was so many characters to have to try and remember to deal with. But none the less the visuals and acting is very very impressive. I'd choose to watch this again over Barbie.,NEUTRAL
"Jul 26, 2023",Wasnt sure what to expect but ended up absolutely glued to my seat. Loved it.,POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","Excelente pel√≠cula , m√°s como esas ..",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","I would called this a cinematic masterpiece, except for the terrible sound-mixing choice. Very questionable decision to muffle the voices.  I felt like I was under -water throughout most of the movie.  I would have questioned the theater's speakers, if I hadn't just watched Mission Impossible there just a week before with crystal clear audio.  I had hard time understanding the lines despite knowing the whole story.  Christopher Nolan's movies are progressively getting worse and worse in terms of vocal comprehension. 

Here's what I loved: 
Acting Performances:  Transcendental performance by Cillian Murphy.  Oscar nod should be in the bag.  Magnificent ensemble cast. The moral dilemma was captured from a man's perspective and also his suffering from being turning into a villain for the very creating he was tasked to do in order to reduce casualties of an endless war.  Creators of this film know how to capture the pain and suffering pretty well as Nolan is the master of dramatizing those moments for the big screen.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","One of the best movies I've seen so far.  It is a masterpiece by Nolan with a perfect cast, where Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. extraordinarily highlight his talent, surprising me a little more Robert, with his acting quality at the height that this film deserves.

 It is possible to combine science and politics with a very deep and catastrophic story, a very rigid and complex protagonist, and a very rich and enjoyable middle and end, despite the number of important and historical names and characters in that context to understand and not miss any detail.

 What surprises me the most is the naturalness of the interpretations.  In addition, being able to put yourself in Oppenheimer's place makes you feel how important that moment was in the history of humanity and you realize the many atrocities that human beings can become or do.

 It is a spectacular movie.  A film with a very strong and dramatic context.  Nolan gets almost everything right here.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023",Great acting.. captivating movie.. draws you in!,POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","Amazing performances all the way around. Great tragic story. Stunning visuals. Long, but kept my interest.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","I am shredding my scalp in an effort to understand why I was in no way nourished or entertained by this film.  Perhaps the complexity of the subject matter proved too much for Nolan.  You have the physics.  And you have the war.  And you have all those relationships -- those within the community of physicists and those that involved a Government that would have to depend on an academic who was not only eccentric and esoteric but also left leaning throughout our Government's ambivalent relationship with a Communist ally we expected to take on once fascism was overcome.  The ingredients were there.  Discovery.  War.  Relationships.  And yet ...

Not even an IMAX theatre could save this film.  Nolan had the rudiments of a story.  He had the movie-making and movie-showing technology.  He had the money and the support of Hollywood's A list.  (It's safe to say anyone in the film was his first choice). 
He just didn't have the writing.  He neglected to bring it all together through the magic of a good script.  Everything about this slice of history is existential, whether you are talking about the survival of the earth, the free world, or a few careers, marriages, and reputations.  I had no feel for the stakes or the risks.  It seemed Nolan was never quite finished introducing new characters and by the time we were introduced to the bomb itself ... [SPOILER ALERT] ... ho hum.  There was nothing to invest in.  Nothing to root for.  Yeah, I know.  How could that be?  We were fighting fascists.  We were fighting Communists.  And we were fighting overzealous anti-communist politicians and bureaucrats who destroyed lives and livelihoods in the tradition of McCarthy.   So  ... why was this generously financed 3-hour Hollywood production that much less effective at moving me than PBS documentaries on each of the principal antagonists above?  Why was I moved more by Ford v. Ferrari?  I am a trained scientist with interests that include physics, cosmology, and mass hysteria.  That include the history, philosophy, and politicization of science.  I don't give a [REDACTED] about racing cars. 
I expected to learn a lot more from this film than I did.  I expected to experience a scale -- an atmosphere -- a vista.  But this film had no aesthetic.  No heart.  No rhythm.  No soul.  This movie does not ROCK.  Despite the musical score and the late spate of urgent dramatic cuts and edits.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","Insanely good, would recommend to anyone with even a slight interest. Past and present events through the film add a level of tension to every moment. The pace was slightly slow but the details in each shot and dialogue made it an amazing movie.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023",Cillian Murphy deserves an Oscar! Phenomenal performance from him. Absolute must watch!,POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","This is one of the best movies I've seen in recent times, this is art ‚ô•Ô∏è",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","it was absolutely horrible. literally had no idea what was happening. why was it suddenly black and white at times, and then colored? why were they in court? literally didn't clarify anything. also, it was SOOOO long. 3 hours??  that's absolutely ABSURD. disappointed. i don't know who the director is but i have the worst impression of him or her and i fail to understand how this movie was even successful.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 26, 2023",so intriguing and incredible. a little longer than i would perfer but 10/10 film,POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","I was excited and pleased about nearly every aspect of Oppenheimer, and felt no negativity regarding historical content and visual presentation, including the movie's clarity, color, and contrast but while I have general familiarity of the Manhattan Project (thanks to skimming through General Groves's Now It Can Be Told The Story of the Manhattan Project--available at US dot Archive dot Org--it would have been very helpful for all main characters in the story to have their names and official position titles shown as subtitles.  Aside from that minor quibble, the movie itself was outstanding.  Length was acceptable for a complex issue like this.  One warning I would give to IMAX 70mm viewers--VOLUME seemed EXCESSIVE.  Yes, I realize everyone wants to hear the atomic bomb detonate but honestly, is 125+ dB really necessary?  Granted, it's IMAX and the theater is anxious to showcase the technology to its customers but my ears RANG for HOURS after the movie.  I have had a bit of pre-existing tinnitus before seeing Oppenheimer in IMAX but here it is two days later, and I still have the incessant ringing, louder than ""normal.""  Please, please--lower the volume to 110 dB, five rows from the back, center seat.  That is PLENTY LOUD, even for nuclear weapons.  Great movie--recommended!",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","So many words to describe this movie but the ones that come to mind are amazing, gripping, eye opening and horrific. Truly a must see and must know!! So many genres woven together to tell a complex story!! Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer truly delivers a performance that is magnetizing!! Christopher Nolan and his team continue to raise the bar with exceptional and top notch filmmaking!!",POSITIVE

"Jul 26, 2023","Great movie, but at times moved a little slow.  Really no need for 3hrs, could have cut 25 minutes easily.  But excellent acting.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","Christopher Nolan produces his greatest film to date. The film shows the audience the story of the Manhattan project during WW2, including the internal conflicts on the characters. how the bomb was made, the outcome of the bomb. You get to see famous historical characters such as Truman and Einstein. Christopher Nolan is telling the story of a man who had genuine intentions from his work, and yet had the more dire of consequences on humanity. The fact that this story is completely true makes it all the more scary. A must watch.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","With as much hype as this film has gotten, I had very high expectations before seeing it in IMAX. As far as the 70mm/IMAX landscapes and close-ups of faces, I wasnt as impressed as I was with Hateful 8. The NM dessert, while huge and vast, seemed overcast and monotone (brown). The rumbling and shaking gag to show his inner turmoil gets old after the first three times. Nolan should have left that for his sci-fi films. The score and sound (rumbling) running throughout made the actors inaudible at times. This might be better at home. 

As for the arguments and questions here, I would have liked to have seen an argument against the use of those two bombs rather than an argument against unregulated applied science. There is still a rhetoric and common mythology/propaganda in the US that the US had to drop them, or worse, that the IS should have done worse to Japan. A film like this can start a conversation to deal with those issues. The chopped up narrative, long hearing, and confusing dialog dont help. 

Critics seem to be focusing on superficial fun facts about Oppenheimer that are lazily written here in a few info dumps: forgets to eat, slept around, didnt follow news, interested in old religious texts, and so on. It seems like a quick outline from American Promethius. Overall, this should be better with these actors and budget. It doesnt live up to the hype, but there is some great acting here from a few actors.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 26, 2023","Oscars left, right and center. Very well made movie.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023",One of the best movies I have ever watched!,POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","this movie is based more on fact than on dramatic liberties. the film does run a bit long but it covers a lot of Oppenheimer's life and the trials he faced before, during and after the creation of the bomb. this is another Nolan masterpiece",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","This movie was absolutely amazing. I have lately been bored and unexited by any media (TV Shows, Movies, etc.), but this was a breath of fresh air. The movie is, as the title implies, about Oppenheimer and not the bomb. It is from his point of view, not a documentary about the bomb. I really loved seeing some of the most famous scientists of the 20th century like Richard Feynman, Enrico Fermi, Neils Bohr, etc., even if it was only for brief moments. I recommend knowing some context of his life before watching the movie but it can still be quite well understood without it. The 3 hours do not feel boring at all. I was a little disappointed with the explosion since you could tell that it was a smaller recreation, which I feel could have been avoided by using a bit of CGI, but the tension leading upto it and the silence during the explosion made up for it. But I get it, it's not for all audiences since it you have to immersed into the story to like it. This is a movie that can only be truly enjoyed in a movie theatre.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","Wow. Just wow. This movie is an absolute masterpiece from the start to the end. With brilliant performances from the likes of Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr, and Emily Blunt, this movie's deep dive into the emotions and actions of J. Robert Oppenheimer is one of the greatest representations of history to ever glance the big screen. With every second that passed, I became more and more intrigued by the strange events of Oppenheimer's life. The sights, sounds, and rumblings of the film only added to this feeling of fascination. Many may drag this movie due to its 3-hour runtime, but the sheer beauty of this film makes it only feel like half of that. Nolan's brilliance is the driving factor that made Oppenheimer the smash hit it is. I fully expect to see gold statues in the hands of many involved in this project come March.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","Great acting, great story. The scenes with nudity were absolutely unnecessary, detracted from the movie rather than enhancing it.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","Let me begin by stating that I am currently rating the film as very good because it has an interesting concept and had a compelling execution. However, this rating comes with an asterisk as I want to rewatch it in order to get a better feeling for it and give my final rating. Because of the complexity of the story at the start of the film, I had a bit of a hard time following everything that was going on. The story wasn't linear and so much was going on all at once. Nonetheless I would like to praise the cast especially Oppenheimer himself, Cillian Murphy, for such a great job and compelling acting in this role. He truly made you want to root for him in the times of his success but also feel for him at his lowest moments. Even more so when you see him facing the moral dilemma and consequences of what he helped creiate. The other cast member that I want to spotlight for his role is the man himself, Robert Downey Jr. I went into the film thinking he would get a scene or two but to my surprise and delight, RDJ is the second most important character in this story. He commanded each and every scene he was in and showed why he is a star. I would also like to recognize the film's score and wonderful visuals all throughout the film.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 26, 2023","This powerful movie needs to be seen in a theatre. The sound, visuals and bigger than life affect make it worth the price of a ticket. It is a powerful movie with all the politics of the day in play. Don't miss this, it is that good and important in understanding  how the most development in human history came together. It is a GREAT MOVIE!",POSITIVE

NATO is not able to do anything, in fact a lot of people have died due to the fact that there are way too many political issues.
It has been a year!
And now this movie appears.
I have not seen it. 
I will not see it due to my principles.
CHIRSTOPHER BLAND  decided to bring up something historical.
taking advantage of a very terrifying conjuncture.
Yet money takes over Life.
How many people have died since the beginning of this war?
Yet money is more important than dying.
Money is more important that buildings being totally destroyed.
It has to do with the fact of taking advantage of current horrible things.
Bringing up the fact of an atomic bomb, it is ever so cynic.
I will never see this movie.
I believe the fact of bringing it out it is a horrible phenomenon that needs to be understood.
Why Oppenheimer was never brought before in this way?
Terrible propanga.
I think this is a terrible mistake.
Very wrong.
And I will share my thoughts in the Media.
I think people without principles always want to make money.

"Jul 26, 2023","This was a very  ntense , authentic ,to the best of my knowledge historically accurate  movie,award winning actors,writeri etc,music score by Ludvig Goranson very intense , however supportive of the movie narrative. The biggest problem I had was the blasted Spanish Inquisition, Joseph Macarthy style witch hunt style and I must add kangaroo court inquiry during the last section of the movie.Very tedious, very much intense ,dark and disturbing depiction. It was never the less historically accurate to the very best of my knowledge. I must say I really do not believe in the slightest way that Dr. Robert J Oppenheimer was in any way a traitor to his country. .Ok so he may have had communist affiations as a younger man.Big deal and or So the buttons on your shirt for heavens sake !! My point here is that Dr. Oppenheimer did so much for his country and the world by creating the atomic bomb. So much good and bad came out of . The insanty of the arms race yes however,nuclear power plants and the Atomic energy commission also came out of the development of the nuclear bomb as well. I very adamantly insist and demand this out weighs or trivializes any fear mongering or hysteria towards Dr. Oppenheimer's communist affiliations in the 1930s prewar period and during the 1940s war period as well.I hope you enjoyed my feed back.",POSITIVE

"Jul 26, 2023","It's nice to see a movie that's long enough to tell an entire story without feeling like parts were left out because the director felt he had to rush to fit it into a two-hour time constraint. People can sit through a well-done three-hour movie. 

Oppenheimer starts out a bit slow but the story eventually picks up pace. There are places when the plot is a bit confusing as the years of the story are switching back and forth between pre and post-bomb development. (In my mind this makes it a movie that needs to be seen a second time.) Knowing a bit of history always helps in following historical movies. Watching a few videos about the development of the bomb and Oppenheimer would help before seeing the movie.

The acting was really good, many of the actors are quite like the people they portray. I'd be reluctant about taking kids younger than 15 to the movie due to some scenes of sexual intercourse and nudity. 

I think the discussions of moral and scientific issues regarding the destructive capabilities of the weapon they were designing were handled in a well-balanced manner. I've had a conversation with a friend who had known Einstein and talked about how he and other scientists formed a group after the bombings and wrote to future Presidents advocating that all atom bombs be destroyed and never used again. 

The only criticism I had was in the theatre we were in the sound was so loud that all the music and background sound overwhelmed the dialog and made it really hard to hear any spoken words. (I'm getting old.)",POSITIVE

"Jul 26, 2023",Long boring first two hours. Snoring in audience. Don't believe the hype. Poor script. Overdone sound/music. Good acting and last hour was interesting but lots of nodding off throughout the film and not worth the ticket price imo.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","Oppenheimer is an important movie for our age ‚Äî I believe it complicates current and past notions of the bombs dropped on Japan - and I appreciated these historical revision. But Oppenheimer also simplifies the role of many historical figures - particularly women - who are represented as shallow, simple players in his story (until the end when his wife finds a voice). 
I was concerned with the interactions Oppenheimer has with his personal relationships in the film, and left very unconvinced. Why did he even need to disclose to his first ""girl"" that he got someone else pregnant - were they even seriously seeing each other? 
Another thing that was jarring, was that the moral implications of working on the bomb were only realized after we dropped them? Did he have no sense of destruction they would cause?
I would probably never watch the film again, unfortunately. It was not convincing from a historical perspective, nor was it convincing from a regular entertainment perspective.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 26, 2023","Too much time was spent dealing with his political battles.  I was expecting more time spent on showing his prowess in being the person who successfully proved that nuclear fission was not just a theory, but could be a source of energy as well a weapon of war.",NEGATIVE

On one hand, the film is made beautifully and it's an amazing biopic on one of the most, if not the most, important physicists in history. On the other hand, in terms of entertainment, I found it hard to get into the film as I am not someone who typically enjoys history and was just waiting for the movie to end after a certain point (probably around the 2 hour mark). I would not consider Oppenheimer to be a bad or even mediocre movie by any stretch of the imagination, in fact I would even recommend it, but I don't see myself revisiting it anytime soon, if ever.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 26, 2023","While the movie was well acted and told an interesting story, I gave Oppenheimer just an average review. The movie is 3 hours long, and tries to tell to many side stories that don't hold the audience interest. There are too many characters, which makes it hard to follow at times. Definitely interesting from a historical perspective, but the length and diverse story telling took away from the enjoyment of the movie.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 26, 2023",Visually riveting.  Accurate portrayal of an era which most young people do not know.  Historically accurate.  The director and screen writers take us into Oppenheimers mind.,POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","Yet again, Nolan fails to disappoint. Oppenheimer was a daunting, grim biopic about one of the most controversial events in all human history. Phenomenal performances, minute details, and pure peak-cinematography amalgamate to retell the real life story of Dr. J.R. Oppenheimer and the Manhattan Project. The film does not force its viewers to choose, but rather ponder on the ethics behind the creation and utilization of weapons of mass destruction‚Äîa relatively novel idea that will surely continue to haunt the world and make its inhabitants consider the morality of having such power. However, Oppenheimer, although undoubtedly a masterpiece, is not a movie for everyone. With its fairly long running time and dialogue-heavy context, some audiences may not be able to understand the story and appreciate the cinematic artistry in their entirety. The Second World War and its key players are long gone, but the lessons they teach are embedded in the political, cultural, and social contributions we have seen throughout the decades past‚ÄîOppenheimer being one of them. Additionally, to further commemorate the performances: give Cillian Murphy his Oscar already!",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023",Definitely one of the top films from Nolan. The visuals were stunning and the sound design was even more mind blowing especially in imax. And a ending the left me silent.,POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023",Oppenheimer is a powerful and thought-provoking film that is sure to stay with you long after you've seen it. I highly recommend it.,POSITIVE

"Jul 26, 2023","Usually the trailers contain the best parts of a movie, but I was thrilled that the film was so much more interesting than could be shown in a three minute clip. It was fascinating to see brilliant people work to create something from nothing. On a personal level it was also satisfying to see the emotional fall out that can happen when dealing with the should we do things just because we can. 

Cillian Murphy did a magnificent job of portraying Oppenheimer, and I didnt even recognize Robert Downey Jr until he spoke. I liked an older Matt Damon, as well, though its less easy to forget youre watching him act. Great 3 hour movie. An easy way to learn a bit about history, too.",POSITIVE

"Jul 26, 2023","This movie was a very interesting story beautifully shot with great acting (especially by Robert Downey, Jr. Emily Blunt). I guess the actor who played Oppenheimer was good- he was just so weird! Although his emotional struggles were very heart wrenching and well/done. Brad Pitt was good at first-then I thought he overacted and became almost comical to me. The last hour was spellbinding and chilling.  However the movie itself was an hour too long, and lagged in the middle. Each of the four of us nodded off at times. Three stars because serious editing was needed.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 26, 2023",Totally unnecessary nude scenes. All the names and flashbacks/ Flashforward scenes were hard to follow.,NEGATIVE

"Jul 26, 2023",A lot of huge releases this summer. This being one of the huge due to its critics following. Directed by one of Hollywood's high class directors Mr. Christopher Nolan. Firstly the biography of the scientist is very well portrayed with factual history. In my opinion there could have been more entertainment factors added to engage the audience more. The movie is 3 hours long in length which does make it seem VERY slow. Half the audience were asleep. The beauty of Nolan is he doesn't make it seem that there are any unnecessary scenes in the movie it feels required. The acting performances are excellent. Main lead by Cillian murphy he has also appeared in Mr. Nolan's previous hits in smaller roles but now I feel he got the deserving role. His body language and expressions as oppeheimer are fantastic: Living the character. Following other big names too like R. D. J with a good performance too as an antagonist. Now the best part about the movie is the sparkling cinematography which lead the audience eyes shining. I watched this in Imax 70 MM on the best screen possible so I cant talk about the regular but Im sure it still shows. Its worth taking 70 MM from what I saw. The other good thing was the sound design also exceptional. Makes you feel your in the movie. Every time there is a bomb the audience gets a jumps care. The whole audience in my theatre didn't say a word for the whole movie even though it was a full house no seats available (even though it was a weekday). Overall a Slow but sparkling watch for the fans! Slow But Sparkling,NEUTRAL
"Jul 26, 2023",Fantastic Movie! One of Nolans best!,POSITIVE

"Jul 26, 2023",An absolute masterpiece. Well done. This is how you get people to come out to the movies. ,POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","Oppenheimer is the by far of of the best biopic put into the big screen in a long time. The film details Oppenheimers life from the building of the atomic bomb and the court trails that nearly ruined Oppenheimers public image. The acting is phenomenal. I took me quite a while to figure out that I was looking at robert downey jr. The film itself is well researched and gives an accurate display of the events that unfolded in real life. The B&W filters seemed odd and randomly placed on the first viewing but upon finding out that the B&W was supposed to represent events that were objectively proven to happen and color was speculation of events, I found the movie even more enjoyable. The bomb i would like to note is also very accurate to real life. When real atomic bombs go off, its more like lightning. The light and mushroom cloud will reach the observer long before the sound does, so extra points for accuracy. One problem the movie suffered from was the unnecessary sex scene. Surly they could have shot that scene without the boobs right? Overall, great movie. I would recommend this movie to people how are mature. Do not take a kids to this film. Obviously. I feel it needs to be said because I'm positive some people don't listen to ratings.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023",An absolute cenimatic achievement. Incredibly acted and directed.,POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","This movie was beautifully done with an exceptional cast. It told of the push of US government to assemble world reknown scientists ( Oppenheimer, Fermi )to develop an atomic weapon before Nazi Germany. The weight of this fete and the moral implication of introducing the world to weapons of mass 
destruction was accurately portrayed. 5 star movie. It made 3 hours fly by and gave me a greater appreciation of  the serious times we faced.",POSITIVE

"Jul 26, 2023",One of the best films Ive ever seen. A masterclass in film making.,POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023",One of the best movies that I have ever seen.  I highly recommend this movie!! Just amazing from the first second to the last.,POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","This film is a biopic of the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a nuclear physicist, during the period of time he spearheaded the development of the atomic bomb. It deals with not only the project and its impact on the lives of Robert and others, but also with the time period after, when the government trials him. 

I have to give credit to Nolan. I was seriously expecting to be antsy and feel this run time (given the minimal to no action), but I was compelled for the three hour runtime. The script is written in masterful fashion, jumping between time periods, leaving key clues and context unanswered until later, and giving a real weight and importance to every conversation. The manner in which the story unfolds is unconventional and polished - Nolan's ability to tell a riveting and intelligent story stays unrivalled. Apart from the script, I loved the little stylistic touches that embellish the entire film. During close ups of Oppenheimer, we often see intentional focus racking/ breathing, really showing us his unstable and conflicted mental state, like he is ready to collapse due to the pressure. Apart from this almost every scene where a face is involved, there is a subtle zoom happening, drawing me in, making it feel interesting. The sound design is superb, with its jarringly loud explosions, beautiful score and a plethora of subjective, expressive sounds which really add to scenes. Every single scene Oppenheimer is in, there is light contrast on his face, one side brighter, one darker. The lighting is never flattering, making him appear troubled, weathered and rugged. 

I really wish I did some mild research beforehand. I am extremely ignorant on this man and even this section of history, so I found some sections a bit confusing. I was trying to take in the general scene composition, but also piece together what is happening and why. I'm specifically talking about the last section of the movie where the court and interrogations take centre stage. My mind was constantly running in the background because I didn't understand why Oppenheimer was being tried, and by who exactly. If I had a bit of context beforehand, I would have appreciated this section so much more. 

That isn't really a complaint, as I could have easily missed a piece of dialogue or detail, so here are my complaints. The film felt a little convoluted. It throws enough minor characters at you to fill a warehouse, and I was constantly taken out of the movie trying to remind myself who a character is, what their importance is, and where we'd last seen them. The final 30 mins or so, where we constantly jump from Downys black and white scenes to Oppenheimers interrogation room - it lost me. The issue is with a film this dense, where every single line and detail matters, is becoming confused snowballs extremely quickly as events and conversations carry on. Or maybe its just me‚Ä¶ I felt like the Los Alamos section of the film was the pinnacle, with tightly paced scenes and conversations, high intensity and intrigue, and an explosion that was technically and stylistically executed to what I'd consider perfection. The last hour of the movie I felt dragged, and it sort of felt like a slow death of my interest until the credits rolled. 

Overall, Oppenheimer is a layered character piece, where Nolan weaves an intelligent story of inward and outer destruction, burden and government deceit. Its visuals and sound compliment the script exceptionally, but some sections feel like they drag behind others.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023",Best movie I've seen in a very long time. I got to see it in 70mm -- it's totally worth the extra cost!,POSITIVE

"Jul 26, 2023",It‚Äôs not worth the IMAX price. You will not get the same devastation feelings with nuclear films like HBO‚Äôs Chernobyl. It‚Äôs really only a biography of Oppenheimer. They advertised it like a nuclear fallout film due to being screened on IMAX. There is nothing nuclear in it. Completely biographical and nothing more.,NEUTRAL

The fact that they replicated an atomic bomb with NO CGI is freaking fantastic and why Christopher Nolan is a master at what he does. I saw other comments complaining about how the explosion was silent at first, but I loved it; it made both parts more stunning. All the performances are soooo good, and with such a fantastical cast. The score works so well with everything, with the distorting violins and the loud drums and even the moments of silence. You feel the run time on occasions, but not enough to make me bored.

"Jul 26, 2023","Long, but well worth it!",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","It has been a long wait but Oppenheimer is finally in theatres and it is magnificent. Christoper Nolan delivers what many can make the argument is his best film ever made. Considering his track record, that is not a simple feat but he accomplished this in many ways by building on what make Nolan films so special. Beautiful visuals, impeccable acting, an engaging story and a stellar score from the incredibly talented Ludwig Goransson. It has all of the ingredients you want in what will arguably be the movie of the year. 

Oppenheimer is Nolan's most grounded film, which makes sense since it is a biopic that recounts a major moment in human history but that does not mean it lacks any Nolan flair. 


This film does not celebrate the creation of the Atomic bomb as this achievement that they thought it was during its inception, in fact, It does the complete opposite by focusing almost one third of the film on the repercussions and the weight Oppenheimer must bear with the creation of humanities most destructive weapon. 

Oppenheimer recounts the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from his early years in physics to well after the creation of the atomic bomb. The events of Oppenheimer's life are recounted to us through the trials that take place after the creation of the atomic bomb with Nolan's signature style.of non-linear storytelling. At least three different time periods in Oppenheimer's life are used to tell the whole story. The story is also told from multiple perspectives, black and white scenes are told from the perspective of Robert Downey Jr's character, Strauss and coloured scenes are told from the perspective of Oppenheimer. 
I left the film feeling like I watched a documentary on Oppenheimer's life because Nolan crafted a story that felt unbiased by capturing different perspectives on Oppenheimer's life. Having been accused of treason to the USA for associating himself with known Communists, Oppenheimer's whole life was meticulously probed. By forming the story around the trials, we were given the unique opportunity for Cillian to give us a complete breakdown on how Oppenheimer's mind worked. 

Nolan films have always been known for having big name actors in all of his films but Oppenheimer is a rarity as it boasts a large ensemble of actors and puts the spotlight on many actors that I genuinely felt happy to see on screen in such dramatic roles; Josh Peck and Josh Zuckerman just to name a few. Josh Hartnett and Alden Ehrenreich also deserve to be mentioned after having each had their drought in large feature films. The main cast of stars are all phoniminal, especially Cillian Murphy and Robery Downey Jr. Many Cillian Murphy fans have known for a long time that he has the capability of being a leading man, as is evident with Peaky Blinders but it is wonderful to not only see him lead a big summer blockbuster but go beyond everyone's expectations in a role so well done, it will likely land him an oscar nom. 

 Nolan is one of Hollywood's most consistent directors, but Oppenheimer truly demonstrates his ability to craft a truly beautiful film that deserves to be watched in Imax at least once to experience the gorgeous visuals and hair-raising sounds.",POSITIVE

"Jul 26, 2023","Cracking film. 3 hours flew past in no time. Amazing performances and great score, which is the usual Nolan deafening levels in the cinema. A great watch, which I should have gone home after instead of watching the god awful, insufferable feminist tirade that was Barbie",POSITIVE

"Jul 26, 2023",Best Nolan movie ever.,POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","I'll be brief:
OPPENHEIMER is a unique work. It encompasses everything: History, Philosophy, Physics, Chemistry. Science in general.
With 3 hours of film it doesn't get tiring. It's amazing how C. Nolan keeps you on screen at the same time the dialogues with complex subjects make it easy to understand. About the film there is an instigating and paranoid political plot of betrayal with that air of distrust typical of a cold war.
That's all I can say without giving spoilers.
Finally, the cast is Oscar worthy, and will definitely take at least 5 figurines.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","So well done-    The acting, directing and cinematography were exceptional.",POSITIVE

"Jul 26, 2023",It was a really good movie very well done and entertaining all the way through,POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","It was decent, but nothing great.  No deep political messages.  Just a few minor ones that could easily be brushed aside. As for the story, I was expecting so much more.  The cast looked so compelling. However, the story was oddly flat.  I love the history behind the Manhattan Project, and was super eager to see it.  However, the story just didn't make it.   For example, I freaking love Robert Downey Jr., but his character was shockingly bland.  Cillian Murphy was very solid in the lead.   Emily Blunt was surprisingly really good.   Matt Damon was good, but not great.   Also, I didn't like the disjointed way that they told the story.  It starts at a Senate hearing in the future, and they tell the story backward.  Just don't like that style.   Christopher Nolan used some cool special effects, and really infused the story with energy, but it just fell flat.   Since COVID, there have been very few good movies.  This movie isn't bad, but it's just sorta good.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 25, 2023","Wow, just wow. Christopher Nolan came back to film with one of the greatest examples of storytelling ever. Even though Oppenheimer is a biopic, Nolan still manages to deliver a beautifully crafted story about a complex and morally gray genius. Though I believe this was a little too dense and could have been shortened up or made into two different movies, it still manages to keep your attention throughout your viewing. Nolans style is at its absolute peak and creatively intelligent. Along with beautiful writing, comes an expertly assembled cast. Cillian Murphy absolutely brought everything he had to this role and it shows. Robert Downey Jr. finally gets to show his immense talent and range. Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh give convincing emotional performances and really embody their characters. Every actor is absolutely spectacular, and it enhances the movie so much. Cinematography has always been a key part of Nolans films, but this movie's visuals are utterly stunning. The camera work and practical effects leave you with a sense of dread and fear of what Oppenheimer created, but that's also thanks to the intense audio mixing. All in all, Nolan has made the film of the year. He has shown that a movie doesn't tell just a situation, but an actual story. Oscar worthy is an understatement.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Outstanding performances and very well done. 
Excellent!  Oscar worthy.",POSITIVE

"Jul 25, 2023","No mention of Pearl Harbor!  What a total farce...A hollywoke movie script at best.  And such a waste of incredibly talented actors and artists. Painting a portrait of history without all the colors and hues of the time period and the incredible horrors experienced by Americans that lost their lives, their loved ones and everything they had. This movie focused myopically on what?  Some script writer's attempt to manipulate the reality of what really happened without looking at the cause of the effects.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 25, 2023","Saw the film at an IMAX theater and thoroughly enjoyed it. The story was very compelling, the acting stupendous, and Nolan's cinematography and sound were top notch.

So many performers stand out in this film, but Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. deserve special acknowledgment for their performances.  Kudos to the entire cast.

The moral dilemma of building the bomb had to weigh heavily on many, but greatest on Oppenheimer.  To know you are creating something that could kill tens of thousands, but also save American lives, must have been quite the stressful weight to carry.  The film did a wonderful job of showing Oppenheimer the man, flaws included, but especially showed his mental stress, both during development of the bomb and after it was used.  Fantastic film.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Realistic, moral complexity, petty jealousies affecting peoples lives, scary demagogues interfering with science (just like now), great acting, interesting characters. It was time for a movie that is thoughtful but also accessible.",POSITIVE

"Jul 25, 2023",The movie could have been made in a much interactive way. There was no need of those unexpected awkward nude scenes either. Overall a great story killed by poor execution,NEGATIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Downey Jr and Blunt standout in an all-round faultless cast performance. A truly amazing score also faultless.

I have marked 4.5/5 as it felt like the story could of been told just as well with 30/40 minutes shaved off the run time. It was like two films back to back, probably due to the climax of the bomb making feeling like the end of the film, with still an hour plus of feature left. 

I find Nolan's films on the whole very interesting, Interstellar being my personal favourite. I also find them a little frustrating and I normally come away feeling a bit stupid that I haven't been able to absorb as much as I'd like to.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Great acting. A little long,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Loved the movie. A bit long (especially the first 45 minutes), but very compelling and detailed. Acting performances are all top notch.

"Jul 25, 2023","One of the best biopics I've ever seen! Phenomenal acting by Murphy...Academy Award winning for sure. Downey and Damon also did a fantastic job as did Florence Pugh and others.  For a three hour film, time passed quickly and I felt a very important story had been recounted for a new generation.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Stayed pretty close to the true story. Great casting and well acted. I truly hated R.D.Jr. And I loved him as Iron Man,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",The best historical movie I've ever seen. Christopher and cillian Murphy did a great job in portraying emotional sensation and the expression when thinking. It drags audience into the flow along with the actor. Each actors is polished and storyline is excellent with ITS flowiness.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Great movie!  Nicely done.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Unless you were already somewhat familiar with his life and associated history, you may have a hard time understanding everything because the movie jumps around in time a great deal. Otherwise, it was one of the greatest movies of all time. I especially appreciate how the movie sets the record straight and honors Oppenheimer. My father would have been one of our soldiers who invaded Japan had that become necessary, but the bomb ended the war.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Well done storytelling from the perspective of the scientific community during the Manhattan Project era. Well casted and dramatized. Shows you just how much the American government despised left-leaning academics who they needed for nuclear weapons research. This needs to be seen in the theater for the sound. Don't miss seeing it.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",I liked in in-depth plunge into the stresses and challenges of coordinating the best minds on the planet into a single unit that created the atomic bomb.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","This movie is‚Ä¶ in my opinion‚Ä¶ amazing. Saw it in IMAX and I'm so glad I didn't sell myself short. I left and thought too myself that I just saw an Oscar laden film. Best actor, actresses, support, sound, cinematography, and film.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",One of Nolan‚Äôs best.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","This is an epic film deserving of top awards.   Oppenheimer was a complex, brilliant man.  The film depicts the collaborative work headed up by Oppenheimer to create the world's most destructive weapon and change the course of history.   It was both frightening and exhilarating.  For a 3 hour movie, it kept our attention throughout.",POSITIVE

"Jul 25, 2023","Beautiful visuals but very clunky in which it seemed to embrace the tik toc nature of never ending short bursts of dialogue and scenes. Strangely lacking  in dialogue. It's hard to explain how this movie said a lot without telling a story. Not his his best, like everyone says.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 25, 2023",Epic breathtaking beatiful poetic sequence masterpice,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Doesn't feel like a 3 hour movie.  I liked how they told the story.   Nice bounce back from Tenet.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","STUNNING! The Script is GREAT, the acting is exceptional = a stunning motion picture. At first the 3 hour run time worried me, but as the film progressed into the 'Third Act' it was necessary. I am telling everyone I know, planning to see it, ""be patient', it all comes together with a final curtail that is a must! This is a story/depiction of a man's life, not to be rushed, but savored and pondered.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Great movie! Would recommend to anyone. It is a 3 hour long movie which isnt bad for me but maybe for others. However, I felt the movie got better and better as it went on.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Excellent cast and film.  I liked the way the story was told--not chronologically, but in flashbacks and through different time periods.  While it was a three-hour filmed, it flowed smoothly and did not seem that long,  Highly recommended.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","The length of the film is ridiculous, story is okay. Acting was okay. Not for me though.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Powerhouse performances and a movie that definitely does not talk down to its audience.  Christopher Nolan is definitely the best director of his generation.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","It was complicated history.   You really have to pay attention to the details.   I may have to watch again to absorb what I missed the first time.    It was a long movie, I saw at IMAX, which is not necessary.    I had to plug my ears because it was too loud in some parts.   Story was mostly factual.  The actors looked similar to the actual historical figure.   Would NOT recommend for children because of sex scenes and complicated topic.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Biggest disappointment ever. Love Nolan, but this movie is so boring and the visuals are nothing compared to Interstellar, Inception, Dark knight, Dunkirk, etc. How is this so popular? Everyone leaving the showing thought is was a snooze...",NEGATIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Movie of the year for sure! The way they use the colors and the jump cuts to tell the story is perfect. Don't even get me started on the music!,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Excellent film. Acton was phenomenal.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Brilliant film about a brilliant mind and a world-altering decision.  At times early in the film there is a bit too much emphasis on the inner workings and conflicts of the young Oppenheimer.  A little too Hitchcockian for me.  It doesn't give the audience enough credit for appreciating the scope of his mind.  About 10-15 minutes of the film could have been scrapped and no meaning or intent would have been lost.  Music was fabulous, if a bit overbearing at times - that overbearance was appropriate.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Kind of boring. Good performances, but I wouldn't call it entertaining at all.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 25, 2023","Totally immersed in the story. I knew some, but this filled in a lot of blanks . Made him very human.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","This film will be remembered as a classic film. The film is an excellent and memorable portrayal of the life and work of J. Robert Oppenheimer, who was an important person in an important event in human history. J. Robert Oppenheimer was an important person in the development of the atomic bomb.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Loved the movie as my wife did as well. Great acting and the movie flew by even though it was 3 hours. I think it certainly should be up for multiple Oscars,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","It was somewhat difficult to put the pieces together in the beginning portion of the movie.  While an interesting device to slide back and forth between different times and scenarios, it, for me, took away from the real message and power of the movie, which eventually became more clear as it progressed.  Aside from that, it was an amazing treatise of a complicated man who saved us from one apocalypse by front-running it with another.  The intensity and uncertainty of the times coupled with the sense of urgency created a tension hard to replicate, but so well done by Nolan and company.  Solid movie, should be on most folks must see list.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","It was ok.  I learned a lot (if the movie was true to history). I didn't do any fact checking.  But much of the movie was a bit slow moving, and at 3 hours, it was way too long.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 25, 2023","Very pretentious made film, no cgi hurt the film. It is a good story, but bad movie. Rdj was actually good at acting though",NEGATIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Fantastic movie all around. The cast, the music the storyline, the structure it was near perfect. There were some parts of the movie which were not necessary and I question why they needed to include it. Which brings me to my next point. I would definitely not bring any children under the age of eighteen as there is some nudity and actual sexual acts that occur. There is a specific scene that showed an act happening and I do believe it would have had the same impact if they removed the sexual exchange.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","It was overhyped. The story didnt have much of any ah-ha or wow moment. Though it should be said for a director to keep me watching for 3 hours, without feeling bored, is a compliment to the director. Overall I think the story was forgettable. Everyone likes different Christopher Nolan movies, this one wasnt the best for me.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 25, 2023",Amazing movie with fantastic cast!,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Saw it in 70mm IMAX and wow. The movie was very beautiful and interesting, there were some points where I was lost a bit, but overall Great Movie!",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Oppenheimer is undoubtedly one of the most unique films I have ever seen. After three viewings, I can confidently say that this film has just as many layers to the Nolan onion as his previous pieces. It's directorship is fantastic, the acting is superb, and the audio-visual experience is like no other, especially for a biopic. Watching in IMAX 70mm, if available near you, is an absolute must. 

If you, like myself, struggled to get a grasp of Oppenheimer's story or with the pacing on first viewing, I highly recommend reading up on his life and the other characters involved and rewatching. Although it is 3 hours long, both the Manhattan Project and Oppenheimer's life are too nuanced to fully grasp and appreciate within such a short time frame. 

Finally, I could not think of a more suitable lead actor than Cillian Murphy to portray JRO, especially when RDJ may have seemed the shinier option given his resume. His eyes alone deserve Oscars for their performance.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Christopher Nolan created an amazing movie! Direction, acting with such a talented team, wow! Emily Blunt as Kitty blew it out of the sky. More than that, We all know Oppenheimer was the man behind the Atomic bomb that ended the Korean War, but in all my years, I didnt know the story of his life. I learned so much as well as being entertained. Bravo!",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","It was a good movie. Intense and serious.  There were a couple of gratuitous sex/nudity scenes that could have just as easily been presented in a less salacious way and still make the point of the relationship between him and his on again, off again mistress.  I dont know if this was the fault of the movie makers or the equipment at the IMAX theater where we saw the film, but too often the soundtrack was loud enough to stop the audience from understanding all the dialogue. I heard multiple comments as people were exiting about how loud the movie was  it is worth seeing, but I almost wish I had wjaited to watch it at home on one of the streaming services rather than spend so much money for a ticket and then not be able to understand everything the actors are saying.  At home, I could at least turn on the subtitles.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Love the history but it was a bit confusing - def. made me want to research more. It was a little Hard to keep some of the characters straight and it goes from 0 - 100 pretty fast - so much developed in a short amount of time. Worth seeing though!,NEUTRAL
"Jul 25, 2023",The acting in this film was good but man they could have edited out the entire first hour with the weird love triangle story. Honestly it was extremely boring... I was expecting more plot on creating the bomb and testing... So much boring dialogue in the film it was not an enjoyable watch.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","With Oppenheimer, Christopher Nolan proves once again why he is one of the best Directors/Screenwriters, not only of his generation but of all time. This is what cinema is supposed to be: so entertaining and well crafted that you have no choice but to look at the screen, even if you don't like or know the subject matter.

 This type of movie isn't for everyone and if you don't know much about history/historical figures, the flood of constant information might be too much for you, but that isn't really a downside, as a i think movies should also encourage viewers to do further research.
Please pay to see it. Not only everyone did a great job but we need movies like this to continue to be made.",POSITIVE

"Jul 25, 2023","All politics aside, nuclear weaponry and corruption in our government since the 1930s are the elephants in the room/(world).  THIS MOVIE IS A MUST SEE to ""get the picture"" (pun-intended).  Is the U.S. doomed via ""karmic justice?"" for the nuclear arms race?  It's all about ""political and personal power""...the nuke brought about out of genius and insanity.  Did we REALLY need a nuke to win the war?  I don't believe so...my father was with MacArthur upon his return to the Philippines, and the Japanese were ""imploding"" long before Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  They were running out of planes and parts for repair.  As a junior senator from Mass., JFK voted against confirmation of Strauss for U.S. Sec of Commerce (Strauss a key role in development of H-bomb) in 1959, who desperately wanted the nuke for ""big defense."" Strauss's appointment was NOT confirmed.  Could this possibly be the work of Strauss, the ""deep state/establishment,"" and CIA to take Kennedy out for numerous reasons?  Strauss was deeply connected to ""big defense,"" which eventually lead the way to ""big pharma,"" and eventually ""big tech"" lobbyists...THE BIGGEST PROBLEM in U.S. Government today IMHO.  In my military career, I had first hand experience with nuclear weapons and readiness, spending half of it on alert with ""nukes ready to go"" during the first Cold War.  Many of the PTSD ""scenes"" remind me of my own PTSD-laden dreams about the ""big one"" happening.  After some relatively peaceful years, we find ourselves right in the middle of COLD WAR II...and with mad men such as Putin and Xi, their ostensible alliance, and the proliferation of nukes among nine countries, my PTSD nuclear dreams have returned.  And the V.A. flat denies that I could have PTSD from being prepared on a daily basis to blow up the world (I'm fighting and winning that battle with the corrupt V.A. system...or I'll die trying!).  I have distinguished military and corporate resumes...plus my suicide attempt due to unresolved ""nuke PTSD"" faulty coping mechanisms.  We need more movies like Oppenheimer to raise awareness in our country...and the world...of a plethora of issues regarding the ""human factors"" regarding weapons of such mass destruction...not to mention the potential disaster of impending ""AI factors.""  BTW...it makes me nauseous to have this movie even associated with Barbie...maybe our world is just sick enough to need a ""fresh start.""  Not that I disagree at all with the content in Barbie.  But ""Barbenheimer?""  Maybe ""Hollywood"" represents the same genius and insanity it took to develop these weapons of mass destruction...add ""political corruption"" and voila, Barbenheimer.",POSITIVE

""....For all the pre-release speculation about how analog epic-maker Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" would re-create the explosion of the first atomic bomb, the film's most spectacular attraction turns out to be something else: the human face. 

This three-plus hour biography of J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is a film about faces. They talk, a lot. They listen. They react to good and bad news. And sometimes they get lost in their own heads‚Äînone more so than the title character, the supervisor of the nuclear weapons team at Los Alamos....""",NEGATIVE

"Jul 25, 2023","Just saw #OPPENHEIMER...

What a mess that film is. Editing is just all over the place. 

I get what Christopher Nolan was trying to make, but it really did need another editing pass. NOT because of length. INSTEAD, mainly due to more than 75% of the film being scattershot random moments in time during the initial and later phases of the creation of the Atomic Bomb. 

Intercut with 2 different debriefing sessions (one in ""the grey room"" and the other in congress), the story is shredded into parts that never quite connect. 

Certainly, trying to fit 5 years worth of history involving 10 of the most influential people during that era into a film less than 4 hours long is quite the challenge... But we never get a sense of connection to any single individual in the film before we are ripped away to see something completely unrelated, out of context, and confusing in relation to what was shown up to that point.

It's an okay film. The effects are nice, but the IMAX filming process makes every single performer in the film look 10-20 years older than they are. The ultimate in hi-def exposes each crevice of wrinkle - intentional or concealed beneath makeup. The makeup is awful as well, with some people being nonstop sweaty redfaced and others pasty chalky faced.

I do appreciate the intent. the overall narrative, but it's a shattered mirror on our history that is both missing quite a few shards as well as lacking anything of dire consequence. What little drama exists is brushed off before we can feel any gravitas to the situation.

If you go see it, don't listen to Nolan's advice about seeing it ""ON THE BIGGEST SCREEN POSSIBLE""... It's far from worth the cost of such extravagance, both narratively and in the overall presentation.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Its more like a documentary. Long, interesting, but kind of boring. Great acting, dialogue was decent, but I was expecting a Ford v Ferrari style of film. I would not recommend seeing it in theaters. Its not a movie I would really want to watch again.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 25, 2023",Fantastic Movie!  Actors were superb. Film was beautifully done!,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","The cinematography and acting were great.

However ‚Äî the movie is structurally a mess. The pacing is jarring. There is never enough time for any scene to breathe. It feels like an endless montage. 

The editing is atrocious. Constant fast cuts on mundane bits of dialogue and cuts of 2-3 frames that look like they were left in by mistake. Absolutely dizzying and nausea-inducing. 

The frustrating and constant time jumps serve no purpose other than to force a nonlinear story where it wasn't necessary. It truly felt like you had to read the book American Prometheus ahead of time to be able to keep up. I came into the film with what I thought to be enough surface knowledge of WW2, The Manhattan Project, McCarthyism and the Cold War. Despite that, I had a miserable time keeping up with what was going on. 

In the 3rd act, they shoehorn in a main antagonist like an afterthought, and the movie becomes such a slog at that point that I couldn't care less about the reveal of the villain. 

The Trinity test explosion was extremely underwhelming. I'm not complaining about it not looking ""cool"". My criticism is that it failed to accurately show the unsettling immensity of its scale: the literal harnessing of the power of the universe to cause mass destruction. In the film, it simply looked like a gas fire filmed up close to fill up the screen.  

The soundtrack is egregiously smothered all over the place, including mundane scenes of extended dialogue, making it difficult to hear what's being said. 

I really disliked the film. Truly a failed exercise in cinematic craftsmanship. It's all the bad things about Nolan that I'd normally turn a blind eye to, but heightened to the extreme. I'm confoundedly perplexed as to how it's receiving so much universal praise. It's easily one of Nolan's worsts.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 25, 2023","One star is too many for Oppenheimer, and I was reminded as to why I rarely go to movies anymore. This movie is a giant yawn, and could have been told in two hours instead of three. If you find yourself falling asleep, a couple of strategically placed explosions will jolt you out of your seat. If Hollywood decides to throw in unnecessary nudity and sex to titillate the masses, they should at least use an actor with some muscle. I don't pay good money to see naked, skinny men on the big screen. I'm obviously in the minority, but this was the worst movie I've ever seen. Reading a book on quantum physics would be more exciting. Thank you Harkins for the refund!",NEGATIVE

As filmmakers, it is our duty to use the attention of our audiences to bring to their minds moral and social questions and problems in a way that impacts them. As Oppenheimer said, they will only fear it if they understand it and they will only understand it if they see it. Now this moral question focused on in Oppenheimer is one that has been focused on in many ways for many decades, but, as is our nature, will have more impact on us, and gives us greater understanding, through the use of our empathy and the impact of the moving image as a medium, combined with the no lesser impact of storytelling, narrative, and music, which factors have been a center of human nature from the very beginning of our existence. Humans have always been Storytellers, and have been so for a reason. It is what has the most impact on our minds, our hearts and our souls, and thus it is the great privilege and responsibility of a filmmaker, to not deal with this impact lightly.

"Jul 25, 2023",Greatest movie of all time,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","I liked it. Directed by Christopher Nolan, the three hour film leans on dialogue not action, but is nevertheless well paced.

The Good: Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey, Jr., and Emily Blunt will be Oscar nominees for best leading actor and best supporting actors, respectively. I like their odds, especially Murphy. Murphy, in his spot-on portrayal of Oppenheimer, is really brilliant in the role. So often his posture and facial expressions, the eyes in particular, carry the scene, (much as the photograph of Oppenheimer Ive posted here). Blunt, as Oppenheimers tested but loyal wife, shines best in the last hour. Downey is outstanding as the key antagonist. Nolans movie tackles the challenging technical and moral questions of the Manhattan Project that divided both the scientific and political communities e.g., Should the bomb be built? Will it work? What might it do? Should it be used? What Pandora have we let out of the box, and should/can we put it back? The impact of anticommunism and HUAC (aka Red Scare) on honest friendships and patriotic careers. The script adaptation of the book is well written. Its a movie that leaves you thinking (not a bad thing in this day and age).

The Neutral: Given the way the film is edited - focus on Oppenheimers point of view (in color) and Lewis Strauss point of view (black and white) - it requires the viewer pay attention throughout the film. Like a good British crime mystery, everything that seems a bit confused through 2/3rds of the film gets recalled and tied together nicely in the last third. (Pay close attention to Oppenheimers first, brief encounter with Albert Einstein it plays large at the end of the film.) 

The Bad: Not much. Some scenes that seem on the brink of revealing character and relationships are abbreviated, leaving the viewer to piece them together through flashback snippets. It is not a chronologically linear film. I didnt think the Jean Tatlock affair added much to the story other than reinforcing Kitty Oppenheimers devotion to her husband. Not much affection is shown in either relationship. It is also challenging to keep track of the various scientists (names) who come and go throughout. The sound editing makes hearing some subtle or hushed lines difficult to understand. While not mandatory to enjoyment, it helps if the viewer goes in with some history of the Project. This wont be a hit for many, but its a very good film.",POSITIVE

"Jul 25, 2023",Amazing...it showed a realistic view of the situation in the US during the time the first atomic bombs were being developed. There was a lot of information about the factions involved in the government and other political activists who were both pro and con about the whole situation.

It kept us involved and interested from beginning to end and there were surprises as the storyline progressed.,POSITIVE

Its a character study of a brilliant, flawed man who changed the course of our country during war.  I havent been in a movie theater in four years, and it was definitely worth seeing in a movie theater.",POSITIVE

"Jul 25, 2023","The story is, of course, gripping - pulling together the right people to create a nuclear bomb (and build a city in which to do it).  But the underlying discrediting of Oppenheimer is tedious and painful.  We left the theatre after 2 hours - perhaps the movie wasn't 2 hours, but published start time until we left was.

Really liked the Pinky Blinders guy as Oppenheimer.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","It's a beautiful movie, with amazing music, metaphors, knowledge, history, science, and Impact.

The Atomic Bomb dropped and explode is a beauty like a star.

Gillian Murphy acting is top-notch. That eyes tell everything how a character feels and see full regret that Oppenheimer is now the father of Mass Destruction.",POSITIVE

"Jul 25, 2023","Great story, great acting, great cast.
A bit confusing at first with the timing of events ,,,could have used some dates",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","A perfect film from Nolan. Perhaps not suited to audiences who are less interested in slower paced stories which focus on character, and narrative, but a powerful showcase of how you can fully encapture the emotion and feeling of a film none-the-less.

The acting is sublime and sure to gather numerous Oscar nomination, while the audio design is a masterclass in how you can fully emerse an audience within the cinema experience.

Nolans trademark rejection of VFX is at the top of it's game and only further adds a sense of  realism and terror to the scenes.

While Oppenheimer may only be suited to certain audience there are deep lessons regarding morality, and ethical balance, which everyone could learn from. The fact the film was also created in only 58 days is a testament to the entire cast and crew!",POSITIVE

The movie was spectacular in the AMC Concord IMAX theater.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Filled in the rest of the story - most stories about the gadget stop at the release. Enjoyed hearing more about the rest of his life and his doubts. Great cinematography and the screenplay drew on the appropriate emotions with a little bit of humor for tension release.,POSITIVE

I would recommend, adults only",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Very disappointed. I fully expected to like this movie. The storyline was confusing-very choppy-jumped around. There were too many cryptic things in it that never got explained. And were too cryptic to make a reasonable guess as to what they meant. Weird cut-in scenes that didnt enhance the story.  I think they tried to use the music in scenes to get a feeling or emotion across but it was poorly done. It actually took away from the scenes. I cant say there was anything I liked about this movie. Lots of A list actors but the movie was so bad and the characters so unlikeable that I didnt even enjoy the acting.  I couldnt wait for this movie to end. I give this movie an F.,NEGATIVE

"Jul 25, 2023",Very well done!  Fast paced.  Did not seem like 3 hours.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","I truly liked this movie! I love ANYTHING based on history! I feel that they could've made this movie about 2.5 hours long, but what's an extra half hour? It's definitely worth seeing! The theater was packed for the mid-morning showing!",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","I read the novel that this film is based on and I think it made it easier to follow some of the storylines. I would highly recommend the book 'American Prometheus' as well as '109 East Palace' if you really want to know more about the details of the Los Alamos project and the day to day living in that environment. 

The actors in this film are top rate and and the movie has just the right amount of spectacular special effect. The acting and dialogue do not get overwhelmed by special effects which can happen too often with these blockbuster movies. Cillian Murphy does capture the way Oppenheimer was described physically. Emily Blunt does an amazing job portraying his wife Kitty. There are so many details of these relationships that cannot be captured in this movie. If you love the story check out the book.",POSITIVE

"Jul 25, 2023",The juxtaposition of American Exceptionalism of the Cold War tech races era versus the recognition of creating a device of mass destruction that the world can only hope a government has the audacity to use only once was a challenge in telling both stories.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Wide in depth view of the activities that led to the culmination.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","This. Will. Win. Everything. Under. The. Sun. Whether all the credit goes to Cillian Murphy's brillance or to Nolan for tapping Cillian, we may never know. But both combine for something that will go unmatched for a long time. An honest biopic about Robert Oppenheimer that doesn't provide any answers because there are no easy answers. Instead, it lends to the audience a masterwork of a story worth pondering over & over. This goes above Nolan's past best works in Dunkirk and Inception, not only due to the refined wizardry of Nolan's genius but also to the nature of what the film sets out to explore -- that momentous juncture in human history when we couldn't mathmatically rule out that we, as humanity, could destroy ourselves in the very attempt to save ourselves--with all of our human complexicites webbed throughout.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",WHAT A MOVIE!!!!! AMAZING ACTING AND CILLIAN MURPHY IS PERFECT!!! 10/10,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Films about historical events are often a hard sell. Regarded by some as a dry discipline that has very little to do with our current reality, history is supposedly meant to be left in the classroom. The film Oppenheimer shows this outlook to be flawed. Starring Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer, a theoretical physicist who led a team of scientists that created the first atomic bomb. Known as The Manhattan Project, it transpired from 1942 to 1945. With a raging World War II and Nazi Germany forging its own effort to create an atomic bomb, the team assembled at Los Alamos, New Mexico convened under a dire sense of urgency. This urgency was conveyed in this film. 

In three hours, Oppenheimer tells the story of those involved in the Manhattan Project. Showing the politics of the early to mid-1940s, viewers will see how the geopolitical realities of that time dictated what the scientists could do. Furthermore, it is shown how easily even people regarded as indispensable can be utilized, and then eventually discarded. This film in many ways wrestles with the ethics of using the atomic bomb towards the end of the Second World War. Historians still debate to this day whether or not the use of two atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki was necessary. This is a movie that can initiate so many different discussions. It is a reminder that the United States is the only nation to have ever actually used nuclear weapons in a conflict.   

Oppenheimer shows that the atomic age that began more than 70 years ago still hangs over humanity as a threat to our very existence. In the context of an escalating regional conflict and increasing international tensions, it is a reason to give us all a reason to take a pause and realize what is at stake. Oppenheimer is a powerful movie, and it is a film worth seeing.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",The first half of the movie was boring,NEUTRAL
"Jul 25, 2023",Another masterpiece by Christopher Nolan. See it in IMAX if you can.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Very interesting and informative. Fascinated at how it all panned out. Felt bad for Robert and his guilt. Scary how the government will do ""ANYTHING"" that will benefit them. Thought the movie was a bit too long and drug out. Kinda slow.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",This was a very powerful movie.  Every actor was right for his/her part and played it well.  This was a great and pivotal time in history and how better to learn about it than through an entertaining movie!  We enjoyed seeing Oppenheimer very much.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Excellent movie, great cast that keeps you riveted for the entire movie!",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Actually two movies. First is creating the bomb. Second is the dirty deeds of conservatives (not much has changed).  Both done very well.,NEUTRAL
"Jul 25, 2023","I watched the movie at the premiere and without a doubt it is one of the best movies of the year!

The film tells not only the story of Robert Oppenheimer but also brings physical, philosophical and even political themes of the time in a very well presented and directed by Christopher Nolan. The soundtrack, visual and sound effects were amazing.

The actors' performance was spectacular, especially Cillian Murphy who played the main character, so that the viewer can understand in detail how Oppenheimer feels about the creation of the atomic bomb and its consequences, as well as certain personal problems in his life. It is also worth highlighting the importance of Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Tom Conti and Robert Downey Jr. in the cast.

It is important to emphasize that the film deserves a lot of attention from the viewer to understand the historical context well and link the facts that occur in the film. The story is very interesting and impactful, especially for us who live today in a context after the creation of the atomic bomb and with the rapid advancement of war technology.

I highly recommend this cinematic work. Congratulations to everyone involved in this spectacular project. Movie note 10! üëèüëèüëè",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",A little confusing bouncing back and forth between years,NEUTRAL
"Jul 25, 2023",Too long.  Realize it was about the politics of the time but would have rather just stuck to the science.  Jumping back and forth was a little confusing too. The kind of movie you really have to pay attention to every word and some of the dialog was low.,NEUTRAL
"Jul 25, 2023","Masterpiece! We already have one of the favorites for the Oscars. I mean, one of the, because so far it's the favorite, but Hollywood always surprises us with great movies at the end of each year. But I think this year it will be very difficult to overcome Oppenheimer.
If you're wondering why spend 3 hours watching a movie that isn't a Marvel movie or a continuation of blockbusters, don't worry, the movie is so good that it makes you immerse yourself in the narratives and ethical and scientific issues of a world extremely shaken by a war (it even seems like the present day) that you won't even feel the time pass.
All performances are exquisite, here I speak of some statuettes for the cast, with emphasis on Robert Downey Jr in his best performance ever. Emily Blunt and Cilian Murphy are fantastic in their roles and in my opinion Oscar nominations for both are guaranteed.
For those who don't know that moment in history, it's a great opportunity to learn and reflect. We have several characters in the history of humanity present, such as Albert Einstein, the greatest scientist of all time, and President Truman, who ended a war using the deadliest weapon ever used.
IT'S VERY WORTH IT, DON'T MISS IT.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",It was a great movie with riveting performances. Cillian Murphy is terrific as is Emily Blunt and Robert Downey Jr.  The story was so compelling. Its definitely a history lesson about WWII and the aftermath.,POSITIVE

"Jul 25, 2023","Superb film.....cast, acting, directing as well.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","The direction of this movie solely focuses on Oppenheimer himself and his life under the scrunity of the US government accusing him of being a spy. I would have loved for this to be closer to Dunkirk and showing the war effort while working on the Atomic Bomb in tandem. The hype surrounding the IMAX 70mm format also added to the disappointment since the viewer is only seeing faces for the entire 3 hour runtime, and only one explosion. Not worth seeing in theaters, in my opinion. Especially not worth seeing a second time.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Intense pressure of wartime portrayed quite well. Physicists  involved brought back memories of my Physics classes in high school and university.  Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. Should win Oscars for their roles.  The jumping back and forth between pre and post bomb were confusing. Overall, worth the time and ticket price.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Masterpiece! Nolan's best movie to date!,POSITIVE

"Jul 25, 2023",Excellent portrayal of history,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Christopher Nolan's historical drama ""Oppenheimer"" is honestly the best film I've seen in years. A brilliance of engaging storytelling of scientific achievement & personal guilt with stunning visuals, score & ground shaking sound. 
Even with knowledge of the Trinity test, the first detonation of a nuclear weapon, Nolan made it the most suspenseful cinematic moment I can remember. 
With a massive talented cast of familiar faces & strong performances, none of them feel useless, but it's Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr. & Emily Blunt, who are the standouts with deserving every single bit of praise.",POSITIVE

"Jul 25, 2023","Long, great actors, a bit choppy. But I knew something about Oppenheimer so my husband and I followed.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",The movie was over hyped (possibly because hollywood is still trying to financially recover from the covid era)  After one and a half hours of very slow pace I had to get up and walk out.  I have only done that in one other movie.... Star Wars Episode II.  My money might have been better spent wathing Elemental.  At least the popcorn and soda was great as always. Interstellar was great...but unfortunately after this movie....I will never elect to see a Christopher Nolan movie again.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","As someone greatly interested in the Manhattan Project and the decision to drop the bomb, I went into the movie very excited. Unfortunately I left very disappointed. The movie does not really do a good job of introducing the key characters; if a person does not go into the movie with at least a basic knowledge of scientists like Nils Bohr and Edward Teller, they will be completely lost. Cillian Murphy does a good job playing Oppenheimer as a kind of tortured genius, but the rest of the cast are undermined by a weak script. If a teacher were to show this movie in the classroom to try and shed some light on the decision to drop the bomb, s/he would have to hit pause every 5 minutes to provide more context, and also look for ways to keep everyone awake.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 25, 2023",Probably the best movie directed by Nolan. I would see it again and again,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","It was 3 hours long and still felt a bit rushed, I was so ready for more. The ending was brilliant and left me speechless. I'm going to rewatch it 100%. I really hope Oppenheimer was wrong.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","I enjoyed this movie and was not bored at all.  I am much more familiar with the Manhattan project as I am in Illinois and was made aware of this from childhood.  I will admit that there were a few occasions that I lost track of who was who, but that will happen when there are so many people involved in a project such as this one.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Is an amazing movie. It worth every minute.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Movie sucked. It should absolutely not have been in IMAX. They didnt even show Hiroshima or Nagasaki.  Only explosion was the test bomb and that was a disappointment compared to what it could have been. And there was no reason for throwing in sex scenes, but they did anyway, and the girls were kind of ugly, so there was no point at all. Really, who thinks of sex when they think of Oppenheimer? Nope! That was stupido. The whole thing was a complete disappointment. They should have included more of the bomb, the bomb getting transported, the USS Indianappolis, Enola Gaye,  the bombs getting dropped. Thats what I wanted to see in IMAX! Instead we got a loud dialogue movie consisting of boring conversations.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",I didn't see the reason the sex scene had to be in the movie.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Just an absolute master class in filmmaking. A film for film buffs. Pure art with a story so real it shakes you to your bones. With the real parallel to the AI wars about to occur in modern times, this is almost a fighting foreshadowing of whats to come, something inevitable thatll change the course of human history forever, Christopher Nolan did it again.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","I was never interested in American history when I was young. I preferred the history of Great Britain and Europe.  This movie introduced me to fascinating and brilliant individuals that my history books glossed over. 
Dislikes?  It was too short.  I want more.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Was not what I expected at all.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Very good movie about American history, just a very sad story line and hard to swallow!  (",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","It displayed a broad expanse of his life, good and bad, along with the technology and ethics of building the atomic bomb. Wouldve liked it to be a half hour shorter, however, because three hours is too long for me.",POSITIVE

"Jul 25, 2023",A little long but keeps you engrossed for 3 hours.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Gripping, mesmerizing, shocking, heart breaking, historic, and very loud, but of course, it's an A Bomb.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Oppenheimer was amazing!. I had high expectation and it exceeded them by far. The musical score was excellent and was used well to build up intense scenes. This was an awesome movie!,POSITIVE

"Jul 25, 2023",Soporific.  Nolan is overrated. He's no great director.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","The movie is a disjointed mess that doesn't spend enough time on any part of the story to make it interesting. A story about Oppenheimer's personal life would be great. A story about the making of the bomb would be great. A story about the politics around and after the bombs were made would be great. A story about the tension between the scientists and military security would be great. A story about discovering the spy would be great. 

This movie attempts to cover all of these things and as a result provides little detail about any of them. 

Every scene has an epic, swelling musical score in the background. Every scene has dramatic pans and zooms. Every utterance by every character drips with historical significance. The movie pretends to be dramatic. It tells you that it must be, without having any substance to make it actually so. No one feels real or human, they are all cardboard cutouts of characters that feel very fictional. It's like they all know there's a camera watching them to record it for the history books. It's so fake.

And, nonlinear storytelling is not a shortcut for building a complex and interesting movie. It's not that you have trouble following along, it's just that keeping up with the constant cuts is jarring and distracting. It's like Nolan didn't think the story was good enough to stand on its own and needed to be interjected with every other part to keep the audience's attention. It's about the making of the nuclear bombs! There are spies and affairs and politics and explosions! That's exciting enough! Just do that!",NEGATIVE

"Jul 25, 2023","One of the best ensemble casts for a movie ever. The cinematography was sublime. And the story - while set in the 1940's and 50's, still resinates today. If you haven't yet, you should go see it at the biggest screen you can find.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",It was in Spanish we walked out,NEGATIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Long but captivating. I learned a lot as well.  Also, the ""music"" or should I say the sounds were both interesting and would vibrate your body to the bone.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Oppenheimer: GO!

Put away your CGI and wear your Big Person clothes.  This is a movie that entertains by asking you to join the lead physicist in the development of the atomic bomb as he wrestles with the morality of nuclear weapons and later faces the full brunt of the military industrial complex for the sin of questioning whether bombs more deadly than those dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki needed to be constructed. Cillian Murphy does an academy award job as Oppenheimer and Robert Downey Jr. gets Best Supporting actor.  If you are an intelligent adult looking for films that address significant issues in a serious but entertaining way, you need to see this in theaters.  Please dont wait for streaming.  We need good movies in movie theatres and though this is in no way a DC Comics or Tom Cruise film, it is terrific on the big screen.",POSITIVE

"Jul 25, 2023","Was a bit confused in the beginning but after I got into the movie, I understood the reason for the beginning better.  Interesting that the movie just starts without any music or credits.  Now I want to more more about that time in our history.  Excellent actors and very well written.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Good historical breakdown.   Very informative.    Great acting.   Became a bit too artsy for me.   Some weird scenes.    Still a good movie.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",I very much enjoyed the history aspects. The explicit nudity was way out of place in the telling of the story and detracted from the purpose of the movie.,NEUTRAL

For theater was defining many times.  My wife had to walk out.

"Jul 25, 2023","It was okay, but flawed. I generally dislike biopics because there is often more fiction than fact and this was no exception. The performances were wonderful, but the narrative left me unmoved (especially disappointing after 3 hours in the theatre). I think Nolan is an overrated director and critics who make the assertion that this and Barbie have revived cinema dont know what real cinema is.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 25, 2023","I liked almost everything about the movie. It is a stunning cinematic achievement.  That said, it is a long one, clocking in at 3+ hours, but it is also well-paced and my interest never lagged. Honestly, I feel like Oppenheimer is a shoe-in for Best Picture. I can't imagine the film that would beat it.",POSITIVE

"Jul 25, 2023","Worth seeing for the acting and cinematography. The length could have been cut down on a bit and it would have been nice to touch more on the science than the politics, but I get that direction they were trying to go. The commie sex scenes really didnt add anything to the film and felt out of place. I liked that they didnt show Japan getting bombed.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 25, 2023",Soundtrack was loud and annoying.  The storyline was disjointed and hard to follow.,NEGATIVE

"Jul 25, 2023",Much to long of a movie for me for the content. I liked being out of the heat for 3+ house but the storyline dragged. Not much feeling for his relationships. I would watch it at home instead if I had a choice.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Movie was good.  However, sound in theater was so loud, whole experience was more of an assault to senses than entertainment.

"Jul 25, 2023","Christopher Nolan is a masterful film maker.  The film weaves past and present threads of Oppenheimer's life.  It helps to know a bit about the history that underlies the film's story and how the politics of WWII drove this man's life - both good and bad.

One thing - while the women in Oppennheimer's life were strong and learned, the portrayal of them was less than real/flattering.  More time should be spent in developing their stories, which were integral to Oppenheimer's life.",POSITIVE

"Jul 25, 2023",A bit slow for moments..,NEUTRAL
"Jul 25, 2023","Id actually give it 4-1/2 stars. Closest analogue in film biographies would probably be Lawrence of Arabia. Nolans actors are uniformly excellent, and Cillian Murphy is the physical incarnation of Oppenheimer. Robert Downey Jr. gives the performance of his career as Lewis Strauss. Minor quibbles would be Murphy occassionally struggling with the accent and a musical score which felt a bit haphazard and at points drowned out the dialogue. The story was told in a highly original and unique fashion, bouncing around in time and switching between color and black and white. Rewards the viewer whos willing to give it their full attention and intellectual engagement (not for the kids). Multiple Academy Award nominations are forthcoming. Highly recommended!",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","If you're looking for pure entertainment, go see Barbie.  This was very educational, very well written and meaningful.  The quality of the sound was not very good for the first bit of the movie.  It was very hard to hear and figure out what they were saying, therefore much was missed.  Cillian Murphy was great and Robert Downey Jr. deserves an Oscar nomination.",POSITIVE

"Jul 25, 2023","The movie was extremely well done. Robert Downey, Jr. was fantastic as was the man who played Oppenheimer. The acting throughout the movie was superb and the movie moved along quickly. Never a dull moment. It made me wish I had more of a history background and I read about Oppenheimer online to better understand the quibble between Oppenheimer and Strauss. Loved the entire movie.. Must see.",POSITIVE

"Jul 25, 2023",Acting was great.  Cillian Murphy was amazing as was Robert Downey Jr.  the story telling was superb. Didnt feel like a 3+ hour movie. Must See!,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Superbly written and acted. Murphy and Downey deserve Oscars for their performances.  The only problem I had was the dialogue was sometimes drowned out by the soundtrack - it may have been the theater acoustics though.  I want to watch again with subtitles on because I'm sure I missed some important dialogue.,POSITIVE

"Jul 25, 2023",Informative but boring. My son went with us and said all it was was people talking the whole movie. We should have done our research before agreeing to let them person who picked the movie have final say.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",I enjoyed the movie very much.  Robert Downey was excellent.  I had a bit of a hard time not thinking of Cillian Murphy as Peaky Blinders.  He became that character and it was hard to see him as someone else.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","The story is stellar. Kudos to Christopher Nolans, for his vision to translate the story into a visual and an emotional piece of art!

"Jul 25, 2023",I love historical movies and books in this one fits the bill! Lots of detail.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",An amazing film. Christopher Nolan has done it again. Cillian Murphy also just had the best performance of his career with this. He and RDJ should be taking home Oscar's. Was worried the 3 hour runtime would drain this movie down but it did not.,POSITIVE

"Jul 25, 2023","Cinematography was great, Robert Downey Jr and Matt Damon did their usual tour de force acting and I enjoyed the 70mm IMAX format.
That said, the film ran an hour too long, everyone elses acting was adequate (though I thought Cillian Murphy was miscast) and ultimately the finale was a let-down.  The one special-effect scene at Trinity Site was impressive, but not worth the time sitting in the theater I had to spend to get to it.
The take-home message: we wanted a bomb to prevent world fascism, the war in Europe ended before it could be used, the war in the Pacific was on the downswing (we were winning it), but we finally had two working bombs, so why not use them against Japan, save ourselves a few Americans, and show the world it shouldnt mess with us, cowboy-style.

I also thought that the historical accuracy of the film was mostly spot on.
Thank you",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","This would be a 4.5 star movie if it was condensed into a 90-100min film. 3 hours was too long and many scenes added little to no value on the story line. The use of IMAX cameras throughout the whole film appeared to be a marketing stunt as a majority of the scenes took place in an office, classroom, or court setting. The director also tried to compensate for the drawn out conversational scenes by adding suspenseful music but after 2 hours it is too much. If this film werent on IMAX, It would make for a decent limited series on the History Channel.",NEUTRAL

I think a stronger narrative would have helped, and a lot less jumping back and forth in time.  After the movie I watched a documentary to flesh out the actual events in sequence.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","I have ADD (inattentive type) so 3 hour movies are usually hard for me. This one flew by - it never felt long or drawn out, no filler material at all. Cillian Murphy deserves every award there is, along with some that haven't even been invented yet. The rest of the cast is also great but he was outstanding. The movie is dialogue-heavy so you need to pay attention, unless you are super familiar with the story. I had read the book the movie is based on (American Prometheus) so I was familiar with the story, but my husband was not as familiar with it and he had no trouble following along. There are two perspectives shown - color for Oppenheimer's perspective, and black/white for Strauss' perspective (Robert Downey Jr's character). The differences are not for timelines, only perspectives. So maybe it's helpful to know that going into it. The cinematography was fantastic - Nolan deserves Best Director for this, as well as Best Picture. It's an incredible story, told incredibly well.",POSITIVE

"Jul 25, 2023","Good actors who actually saved the movie. But it is too long and  visual part is poorly done. The plot is not exciting. There are a lot of dramatic stories linked to A-bomb development, not just tests and 6  and 9 August bombings which are completely ignored from the story with regards to visual effects. The immediate and later consequences of the bombing, the reaction of the society, the end of war which saved about million American lives, and probably much more of Japanese,  Russian spies in Oppies team,  all of it are either just mentioned or ignored.

"Jul 25, 2023",Completely and utterly disappointing. The story and back story of the man are disinteresting and drawn out. I found the the storyline difficult to follow.  It focused more on Oppenheimers conflict with a politician.  Much of the movie is conversational which is completely up to the discretion of the movie maker. I almost left the theater twice it was so boring. Visually it was lacking anything engaging.  I cannot recommend this movie.,NEGATIVE

"Jul 25, 2023","I didn't mind viewing 'Oppenheimer' and recounting events that led to the invention of atomic bomb of the 1940s, but the post-effects of the film lingered on with doubts about such undertaking.  It seems inventing such a devastating bomb was only justified by an intellectual-complex of political competitiveness, i.e., whoever invents the A-bomb first is the one who controls it.  Only certain types of humans ""have the stuff"" it takes to handle the introduction of a powerful weapon, such as those who view the pursuit of the higher-mind amidst an ongoing condition of turmoil and conflict.  The rest of us perhaps do not know how to take it.  We are not the same as the so-called higher-minded political warriors.  

Who is really right is hard to say.  It is better that powerful weapons always get into the right hands.  But then was it needed at all ?  Did it really justify itself ?  Nuclear energy was never mentioned in the movie (only the A-bomb), and to this day, it is difficult to determine the success of nuclear energy.  If there is yet another purpose for nuclear detonation, such as planetary defense of a major asteroid, it is yet to be known.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 25, 2023",The movie is great in nearly all respects except the sound track which was irrelevant much of the time and so loud that it repeatedly overwhelmed the simultaneous dialogue.  This made it ridiculous difficult to follow much of the story.  This may have resulted from the fact that I saw the film in an Imax theater that plays everything at full volume.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Learned so much - great story, acting and cinematography -  gave 4 stars because can do without the nudity.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","I enjoyed the movie because I'm a big history nerd, and the combination of science and military history was right up my alley. The way everything was explained and shown really helped liven up what most folks wouldn't normally be interested in. 

I knocked a star off for the last thirty minutes or so (after the bomb testing) because of how BORING that last section was, I really feel like it could have been shortened down as it felt like it dragged on to pad out the length of the movie. I also didn't like the fact that there was no intermission! I had a friend who missed part of the movie due to a bathroom break, and I myself had to pee something fierce afterwards, I highly recommend you don't go for the large drink at your theater to watch this movie!

"Jul 25, 2023","Since he made the widely acclaimed Dark Knight Trilogy, Christopher Nolan's films have gone from being mere movies to being events. Each one seems to grow in magnitude and complexity, in anticipation and prestige, and that's most certainly where Oppenheimer comes in. , Nolan gives us an account of both the creation of the nuclear bomb and its consequences, not just for Oppenheimer himself, but for the world and society as a whole. I've heard some describe this as a horror film, and in many ways I would agree. It's scary to consider the Manhattan Project, which was designed specifically to create a weapon that could destroy entire cities and wipe out tens of thousands of lives in an instant. The film acknowledges this, and constantly reminds of us of how the closer the bomb was to being completed, the closer it was to being used, and when it's tested in one of the most talked about scenes in the film, I was actually gripping the arms of my chair. The story demonstrates the vastly different reactions people had to the success of the detonation, from shock to surprise to elation to despair to confusion. The success of the film as a whole rests largely on the shoulders of Cillian Murphy, a veteran supporting actor being given the chance to shine in a leading role, and he absolutely nails it. Oppenheimer was a complex character, and Murphy's performance perfectly captures this. He was a man of a paradoxes, a gifted teacher and intelligent academic that jeopardised his position for political reasons he never fully understood. An upright family man who neglects wife and child. He's constantly conflicted about his role in developing the bomb, reasoning that it's essential to secure victory in the war, but it'll come at the expense of countless innocent lives, and he's working under government officials who see the weapon as a means to an end, regardless of the human cost. It contains a few problems that are somewhat common in Nolan's work. Some of the dialogue is very on the nose, with characters speaking in movie trailer lines, rather than how an actual human being would talk, and the sound balance is all over the place. The score by Ludwig G√∂ransson adds a lot of emotion to the story and tension to the pivotal scenes, but it also drowns out countless lines of dialogue, and in a film with this much talking, I don't understand how that can be deemed acceptable. The film is 3 hours long, and the first 2 acts are the most compelling. When we get into the section where Robert Downey Jnr. takes centre stage as the AEC Chairman trying to revoke Oppenheimer's security clearance, things begin to drag. It feels like the same argument is being had and the same point being made again and again. It dampens the film but doesn't ruin it. This is Christopher Nolan doing what he does best. Big ideas, a grand scale, stunning visuals and a powerful score. It's a film that was made for the big screen. It's not perfect by any means, but if you've been wanting to get out to the cinema again, Oppenheimer is the kind of movie that'll make the effort worthwhile.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Saw it twice so far!!!,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Good movie - a little bit long, but it kept my attention and others. It will motivate you to see how the movie differed from facts. The movie is pretty close to the actual facts. It is a little confusing in the beginning, because movie goes back and forth between present and past, not in chronological order.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Gave great insight to all decisions around making the bomb,POSITIVE

"Jul 25, 2023","A complex depiction of a complex man.  There are moments during the three hour runtime where I honestly questioned why we were being shown a particular character, since it seemed a waste of time.  By the end, those non-essential characters in non-essential scenes ended up defining the movie. Christopher Nolan does like to play with time, and here it serves him well.",POSITIVE

"Jul 25, 2023","Christopher Nolan's epic biography Oppenheimer is getting the same royal treatment as Joy Ride pretty much, and it's bit of a problem for me, but for a different reason. It's a spectacularly well made movie. Yet, if I were to state what the purpose of the movie was, other than making a profit, I would have to say it's to push the idea that the United Nations is capable of solving all the world's problems and to absolve Oppenheimer of all the baggage of his communist associations. The pre and post World War II periods were politically confusing and complex times, and many people, mostly intellectuals, who flirted with communism back then were being driven by  their great fear of Hitler and the Nazis. Yet, to leave out the equably sinister and deadly accomplishments of the Soviet Union and Communist China and their communist leaders out of the discussion, is to not tell more than  half of the story. Nothing in this movie gives the audience any idea of how evil, murderous and cunning the Communists were. It's all very well and good to talk about the threat to civilization that Hitler represented, but Stalin's absence is very telling considering the influential role he played in the history of the times and the events portrayed in this movie

      Cillian Murphy should win an AcademyAward hands down for his portrayal of the troubled physicist, yet the accuracy of the characterization is very much open to debate. One of Oppenheimer's biographers  has written that for all intents and purposes, Oppenheimer was a communist. Oppenheimer's insistence on turning over nuclear secrets to the two greatest mass murderers in history (Stalin and Mao) seems a remarkably naive assessment of the problems of dealing with the threat of a Nuclear arms race. Robert Downey Jr. was also stunning in the role of the allegedly evil and manipulative Lewis Strauss who becomes the antagonist of the movie. Strauss was known to be staunchly conservative and deeply religious, and there is more than enough room to question how deserving Strauss was of being characterized in such fashion.

     It's a well made, well written, and well acted movie though. The best I've seen this year by far. It is however about twenty minutes too long. It goes overboard in trying to prove Oppenheimer's innocence and stress Strauss's culpability in the scientist's fall from grace. I think that Robert Downey Jr. was given just about twenty minutes too much screen time in the effort to get him an Oscar nomination. Some will say that time was needed in order for to complete the characterization of Strauss, but it's obvious that they had already done that in spades during the scenes at the hearing. It uses a lot of assumptions (behind close door scenes) about the motives of Strauss, yet casually dismisses a lot of what was well known about Oppenheimer. That time could have been more honestly used to place a disclaimer of sorts, and maybe to alert the audience to how the huge, ghostly, evil presence of Joseph Stalin complicated American political thought in those dark days, and continues to baffle our politics today. The decision not to do that, makes this seemingly flawless movie a great deal less than perfect.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 25, 2023","Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer seemed like he smoked about three packs of cigarettes during this film. What I really loved was the powerful performance of Emily Blunt as Katherine ""Kitty"" Oppenheimer.  I'm not sure if Kitty was truly that strong willed, but her testimony while being badgered by a government prosecutor was awesome.",POSITIVE

We both agreed to rate it as an overall 3 star.  My main criticism is the way the writers/director took ""artistic license"" in some of those nude scenes.  Also, the portrayal of all of those fireworks looking scenes which I suppose were intended to show what was going on inside Oppenheimer's head as he grew as a physicist.  The guy who played Einstein was way too fat.  Einstein was not that fat according to historical photos we've seen.  I suppose having seen many actual documentaries in the past about the Manhattan project and Robert Oppenheimer affected my view of this film.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 25, 2023",This movie tells an Interesting piece of history of the Atomic bomb and the impact of science and politics.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Amazing storytelling,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Great movie. A break in the middle would have been nice.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Incredible casting and acting. Fascinating and frightening time in our countrys history. This movie piqued my interest in wanting to learn more about how Oppenheimer and the political climate of the time. I enjoyed seeing a film that made me think without telling me how to think.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Acting was great and the story was told right!,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Um filme extremamente interessante e inteligente, com √™nfase na bel√≠ssima atua√ß√£o do Cillian Murphy que no m√≠nimo merece ser indicado ao Oscar.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Seemed to have thoroughly researched the life and mind of Oppenheimer. This mans genius occasioned the Atomic Age from which there is no turning back. The world can never be the same after his research and development of the first nuclear weapons. The characters were all strong and in spite of the 3 hour length, I was never bored. Wish we could have more movies made of this caliber.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Way too slow.  1st two hours attempted to build characters but didn't get deep.  Unnecessary sex scenes that insulted my intelligence.  I was there to have an intellectual experience learning about one of the most important events in human history.  Squandered opportunity.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Outstanding movie. Interesting, well acted, overall just a great movie.  A tad long, but otherwise great.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","This wasn't the action-packed period-drama I was hoping for. No plot, just building a bomb... (yawn)!",NEGATIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",This movie was very well done and (in my opinion) tells the historical story in a way that the younger generation can comprehend the horrific reality of weapons of destruction.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Riveting - Nolan really shows the nuance of a celebrated achievement with grave repercussions.  The styles of the arcs dovetail wonderfully at the end.  Deserves a Best Picture award - compared to the past winners of the last few years (decade).,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Its a little long in length.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",I like that I learned something about a man who had a conscience in the end what I dislike is that his sexual life which had nothing to do with the predicament he brought upon the world was for some reason highlighted.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","The first two hours of this film were superb.  The third hour focused on kangaroo courts, politics, and more was far too long, short sighted in what could have been brought forward regarding New Mexico and more.

Superb acting but again too long and not tight enough in the third hour.  I walked out of the movie with lost interest",NEUTRAL
"Jul 25, 2023","Excellent cinematography & am engagingly presented story made the movie a pleasure to watch! I would, and have, recommended it to people.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Thought it would get more into the upside and downs of making the bomb, wanted to see a spectacle in terms of its use on Japan.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 25, 2023",A movie--maybe the movie--for our times.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","The entire movie was just not well put together. The climax hit around the 1 hour mark, with 2 hours left to go - we left the theater with 45 minutes left, there was no way they could make up 4 stars in 45 minutes.  There were more boobs than bombs in this movie, and when they bombed Japan, it was a PHONE CALL.  I understand this was about Oppenheimer, but the Pulp Fiction type of scene cuts just didn't work for this film.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Amazing movie! Oscars winner for sure! Murphys best performance ever!,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Very boring went straight to sleep movie was too long no action whatsoever,NEGATIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",I enjoyed the movie very much. It was very informative.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Arguably, one of the best depiction of historical events I have watched in forever. Cillian Murphy was masterful at conveying the seemingly overwhelming dichotomy that was J.Robert Oppenheimer. The cast, in its entirety, was superb. RDJ, Florence Pugh, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon and Josh Hartnett were magnificent. Not be overshadow by their brilliance, supporting roles performed by  Rami Malek, Tom Continue, David Dastmalchian, Casey Affleck, Gustafson Skarsgard, Kenneth Brangh (to name a few) were just as memorable. Worthy of praises by all!",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Very well made quality movie on a heavy duty topic. Superb acting, especially Cillian Murphy and Robert Downing, Jr.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","The acting, cinematography and total production was superb.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Amazing movie with some surprises. Flags with 50 stars were out of age with the period movie, but easy to overlook by anyone. Cillian Murphy was amazing and Florence Pugh was a surprise, All in all a gorgeous movie, great characters and acting.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Best film in years. Will win Oscars,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Beautiful cinematography, along with a gripping storyline equals intensely compelling must watch movie.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Missed much of the conversations, couldn't make out all of what they were saying.  Maybe I'm too used to ""closed captioning"".  Would give it 5 stars if I understood more of the dialogue. Acting was excellent, and I applaud movies based on factual data.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Incredible story-telling, powerful symbolism and stellar performances. 
Our only negative was that the dialogue was often obscured by the background music.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Awesome historical piece,  really great movie.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Great film making. My own complaint is that for purposes of the narrative the character of Miss Tatlock, and JRO relationship to her, was kind of two dimensional. But given the script, Florence Pugh does an amazing job with the character. 
Also I thought the speech by Remi Maliks character was nnecessary.
All the leads and supporting actors are d serving of awards, as is the cinematographer and the director.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Very well done. Oscar worthy.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Even with the 50 star flags - what a movie - what a story.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Amazing effects! The acting was superb !,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Excellent movie. Truly deserves an Oscar for the film Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey, and Matt Damon.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","This movie is probably for those that have casual passing knowledge of Oppenheimer. Visual, the different styles are well integrated and bored at times on spectacular. However, if youre heavily into military history/Oppenheimer, the script lacks depth to a certain degree.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Horrible, long, boring tried to tell too many stories at once.  Was hoping for more interesting story telling around how the bomb was made, but wasnt at all that.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","I was born after this event and did not know anything about the development of the ""bomb"" only what the aftermath was in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Very eye-opening.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Too long too much unnecessary detail. Robert Downey Jr. did a fantastic job, as did Cillian Murphy. I found myself becoming bored, and checking my watch quite often. Fat Man and Little Boy had a lot more detail in the design, manufacturing and testing of the bomb than this movie.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 25, 2023",It was too long and too much time getting to its core.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Long movie but it was great abs the cast was the best. The last hour of the movie was the most interesting!,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Great story and great cinematography.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","I thought this movie was phenomenal!  Seeing it on the IMAX screen made the experience that much more enjoyable.

"Jul 25, 2023",Fantastic movie. Well produced. Epic and exciting.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Never got to finish the movie. AMC at the Parks mall in Arlington set off the fire alarms and evacuated us in the middle of the movie and never refunded,NEGATIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Amazing movie. The sound design alone builds the tension of the visually stunning movie. One moment left the entire theater speechless. Absolute must see.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","It held my interest from beginning to end.
Great cast. Great acting.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Nothing. It was an amazing film,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Movie was great. Only bad thing was the 70mm offering had technical difficulties and we had to view in Dolby,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Great insights into a great story. But the rush to get into the details caused confusion about who was who. And also when was when. Too much back and forth on the plot - without a moment to pause and catch up.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","dull, boring. pretentious and hard to know the players from one another. Just a passing mention of other very  brilliant scientists.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Excellent cast and script.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Very dramatic and very interesting to watch,POSITIVE

"Jul 25, 2023","It was a AMAZING movie, it does get confusion with the flashbacks, but you catch on fast. Other than that it was a great movie",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Another great movie by Christopher Nolan. Very long though, but a very interesting story and I would see it again. Definitely for those who enjoy science and history and more intellectual movies. I thought it was great.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Very detailed movie. It was long but necessary to share the facts portrayed in the movie. Overall it was good acting and good history lesson.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","A nail-biting film with music that adds tension to an already tense story. Performances were the best of all  actors on board here, with Cillian Murphy bound to get an Best Actor Oscar for his performance, and Robert Downey for Best Supporting actor. Emily Blunt will be nominated for sure and should get Best Actress. Jason Clarke with his best performance ever. And Matt Damon might be nominated as well. The filinf and musci is mesmerizing and while it is a three-hour movie, it moves like a 90-minute actioner. A must-see film for all movie fans.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Does not have the usual biopic feel, the personal and the moral are at tension in this terrific movie",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Great acting all around. Sometimes the music was a little too much. But the terrific acting made up for that.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Great history lesson, a little too lengthy",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","The movie  explores a story that needs to be told!
Since the plot is not linear, the movie is difficult to follow at times,",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Sir Nolan (has he been knighted yet??) and cast have created a piece of work which has indeed re-spawned my love in attending cinema. BRAVO!!!!,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Too long and slow for the first 2/3 of the movie. Could have cut out an hour of it.,NEUTRAL
"Jul 25, 2023",It was very deep and kept me on the edge if my seat got most of the movie.  I learned so much and hope it opens others eyes as well.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Enjoyed it as a docu-drama but thought it started a little slow.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Oppenheimer is an extremely well done film. The performances are spectacular and of course it is an important story.

What makes it difficult is that it is so complex and the intersection of the personal, political, and scientific stories and timelines are difficult to follow and keep straight. I suspect the book is clearer.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 25, 2023","Long, but very well done",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Cillian Murphy's performance was phenomenal, along with everyone else on set! While the film is 3 hours long, I was engrossed every second and didn't notice time fly by! The film does become more intense towards the last 40mins so be prepared for the rollercoaster of emotions!",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Great performances, a brilliant script and NO CGI!!",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Robert Downy, Jr. deserves all the awards. He was amazing!",POSITIVE

"Jul 25, 2023",One of the best movies Ive seen in a long time !! Oscar worthy,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Robert Downey Jr is fantastic and should win an Oscar for his performance as Lewis Strauss. Gary Oldman os also fantastic as Harry S. Truman,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Great story on the human element of one of the greatest invention visited on mankind. I want to read the book on Oppenheimer and want to know more his, and some of the characters around him including Strauss. Score, wardrobe exceptional. Should be nominated as best
Picture and actor.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",extremely educational !!!,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","I liked the story line and learning about his life and how the Government used and abused him. I didn't like the sex scenes - just way too much. They didn't add to the story. Also, the movie was loud in places when it did not need to be. Overall, it was a good movie.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Long movie.  Lots going on.  Will see again to pickup missed details.  Bravo,POSITIVE

"Jul 25, 2023","I must admit that I really did not know the Oppenheimer story going into this fabulous movie but what an absolutley incredible story it is!

"Jul 25, 2023",I was amazed at how much effort it took on so many levels to develop the atomic bomb and the ethical struggle among the developers. The acting was amazing. A must see on the big screen!,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",I thought it was a well told story about a man who had Morals and questioned his decisions.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","dry, long, didn't care for the non-linearity. test scene was dope of course. could have done without the segment after the test that went on. lots of funny scenes of Oppenheimer looking confused. lulz",NEUTRAL
"Jul 25, 2023",Informative and brilliant.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Great movie. After watching Batman Begins, I never thought to myself, ""You know what, I'd really like to see a sex scene starring Scarecrow."" So if you can get past the weird sex stuff it's a great movie.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Outstanding in all areas
The details were the best",POSITIVE

"Jul 25, 2023","slow at times, but cool story",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",The 3 hours flew by! Intriguing story and Cillian Murphy was excellent. Haunting and thought provoking and exceptionally well acted,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Fantastic movie! The sound was not great, though",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Good story that happened a long time ago that most people know nothing about.  There is so much more they could have covered regarding the Manhattan Project and the development of the atomic bomb including the Oak Ridge, Tenn facility which was much larger then the Las Alomos, New Mexico facility for the scientists. But instead Oppenheimer himself and his life were the primary focus of the movie.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","This movie could have been rated PG-13 and all the sex scenes left out as they didn't seem relevant to the main premise of the movie.  It was quite hard to follow going between past, middle, and present timelines.  Overall it was a good movie and helped to fill in history gaps that I never knew about dropping the atomic bomb.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 25, 2023","Robert Downey Jr., phenomenal acting.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Loved the actors.   Wonderful performances!!,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Brilliant, the acting, the writing, the cinematography. A movie that provides the thrills, yet challenges you to think about the consequences of our actions, and makes you reexamine your point of view about historical events. It is the kind of movie that makes you fall in love with the cinema all over again. Hollywood needs to end the strike and get back to making more films like this one. We need them now more than ever.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Great movie. Its definitely a bio pic but tends to feel like a psychological horror movie.,POSITIVE

"Jul 25, 2023",The partial nudity was not necessarily. It was way too long. But all in all a good movie.,POSITIVE

"Jul 25, 2023","So well done, Cillian Murphy does an amazing job portraying Oppenheimer. A series of emotional scenes all the while remaining true to his character.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","From beginning to end, Christopher Nolan's retelling of Dr. Oppenheimer's story and those close to him keeps you enthralled. The stellar, yet outperforming cast and thunderous, impactful soundtrack have stuck with me throughout the weekend and into the next week. The cinematography captures the essence and importance of this time period to the maximum effect and in horrifying detail - once again at the helm of Hoyte van Hoytema. Everything from the practical effects that were used to reimagine the nuclear tests and particle effects to the sets and locations help retell the story in grandiose detail. This movie is awe-inspiring, thought provoking, and terrifying in some of their rawest forms. Absolutely a must see movie for any fan - be it cinema, history, or plain-old culture.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",The acting was superb and I walked away feeling dismayed at how he was discreted.,POSITIVE

"Jul 25, 2023",Too much intellectual. Kind of boring.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","A truly superb movieCillian Murphy is mesmerizing as Oppenheimer and never misses a beat. Robert Downey, Jr., is super as Lewis Strauss, a man you love to hate. There are no bad actors and a cautionary tale of an event that continues to haunt us.",POSITIVE

"Jul 25, 2023","Some of the best movies I've ever seen. A great review of history, great historical figures and actors that keep you 100% attentive to the things that happen through its incredible plot. They are those typical movies that you will see again because of how good they are.",POSITIVE

"Jul 25, 2023","Too long, poor writing, plot jumped around. Awful",NEGATIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Great movie, from beginning to end. Excellent acting and storyline. I wouldn't recommend for children under 10 years old though, due to adult content.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Saw the IMAX version. Sound levels much too high. The sound was fuzzy and at times could not understand the dialogue. A relative in the Midwest saw the regular screen version and said he had the same problem,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Great movie with several converging storylines. Another of Christopher Nolan's finest.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Failure of the century,NEGATIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Christopher Nolan as a director is nothing short of amazing.  The story was compelling and the cast did a great job.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",More of a documentary than movie...very long and mostly dialog.  But very interesting and fact filled about what led to the US bombing of Hiroshima.  A good history lesson.,POSITIVE

"Jul 25, 2023",Excellent movie and I didn't mind the 3 hour length.,POSITIVE

"Jul 25, 2023",I love history and this was a great way to see it. The acting was wonderful.!,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","For an 87 year old with hearing loss, the sound track was both too loud and the dialog too hard to understand in an Imax site.   Though my son recommended imax I think I would have enjoyed it as much in a regular theater-and better if I could have understood the dialog better.  If there were a way to provide individual subtitles it would be most helpful.   The movie itself was inteliigent, thought provoking, superbly acted, marvelously filmed.   The rapid shifting of scenes made it somewhat challenging to follow.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Movie overall was very very good except: lousy cinematography, lousy editing, and anachronistic dialogue. 

For all the detail he put into the film, he was very sloppy and lazy in using dumb clich slang expressions. They came decades later than the the films timeframe, 

Lazy writing. Excellent acting, historically accurate for the most part, did not appreciate the needless use of black-and-white and the lack of much of a color palette. People in the 30s 40s 50s and 60s saw everything in full color they didnt see anything in black-and-white and neither should we need to see it that way. It is not artistic its dull. 

But good choice of topic for a movie, and otherwise well-made.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 25, 2023",Great story & informative,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Gotta double back on this one in iMax cause it was unreal in my opinion. 10/10,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","This film is an hour too long.  Its disjointed and rambling with too little focus on Oppenheimers stellar achievement ‚Äî the management and oversight of the making of the atomic bomb.  Not much involvement with the scientists and the lives they endured during this time, but quite a bit of time devoted to Oppenheimers affair with Jean Tatlock.  Retelling his academic achievements and trial after Los Alamos were lengthy and boring.

New Mexico is a beautiful place, and there are some glorious shots of some of those areas.  Theyre a wonderful contrast to the dusty and sparse area that was 1940s Los Alamos.  This has always been an absorbing story, but its not done particularly well here.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 25, 2023",Absolutely amazing and MUST SEE!! The 3 hours flew by,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","+3 hrs and I never took my eyes off the screen never lost interest only wish I I could watch it without blinking, theres so much to see onscreen gotta watch again. 
Brilliant cinematography. 
Brilliant Cast. 
Brilliant minds on and off camera.
See several best Actors and Supporting Actors nominations.",POSITIVE

"Jul 25, 2023","AWESOME!! I was totally intrigued the entire movie. It was full of information & history, It provided details that I never heard of or even thought about.
Note this is not an action, fast cars type movie.  It is a lot of dialog that one must listen to. I knew this before I bought tix.
The movie not only provides details, but also the emotions of the people involved, which is not usually in the history books.
I would go see this movie again.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",This was a very entertaining movie.  Drags on too much at the end.,NEUTRAL
"Jul 25, 2023",The movie was very well done. It didnt seem like 3 hours had passed. The actors in the movie were superb.,POSITIVE

"Jul 25, 2023",Didnt like the flashbacks. Robert Downing Jr did a great job acting.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Great movie.  Amazing actors,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",It was a story that needed to be told to a wide audience.  It was crafted in snippets of time that emphsized and clarified the complicated need for the bomb and politics afterward.  The acting was supreme and costumes/makeup masterful.  I will say that it was a difficult subject and told in a complicated manner.  One had to be committed to follow the story as it was told to understand the history being explained.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","I know there were going for an artistic way to show the complications of man but jumping
back and forth thru his lifetime and experiences and other things could have been so much better.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 25, 2023","I think it could have been shorter in run time and had the same impact. To me, it was a story about humanity and not specifically about the atomic bomb. Powerful!",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Long, boring, didnt live up to hype, oddly paced.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Fantastic movie. Great cast and everyone seems to bring their A+ game for Nolan,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","I rated as 4 star Awesome since I studied the story and wrote a paper on it about 4 years ago. The process that changed this planet is a must see for everyone. It is long and can be tough to follow since it breaks back and forth often with scenes from past and presen,t and Washington DC and Los Alamos, NM.  . Having his personal relationships add much to the amount of pressure this man and his team was under to save the world from autocracy and dictatorships. They did save us in th 1940's but now we have very much the same issue in politics. Rather than inventing a weapon to save freedom and democracy with victory in a World War, we now have the chance to vote for victory of rule of law and Democracy. If not we are stuck with a BS filled criminal running for power and the planned and attempted autocracy of a political cult. Understand the movie and what it saved and and we must do now.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","I liked learning more about Oppenheimers story. From what Ive read, the movie is realistic. However it was slightly confusing with a lot of flash towards to his trail, I thought these were flashbacks at first. Also I expected there to be more footage of the bomb, and it dropping on Japan/seeing japans aftermath. The movie quickly ended after successfully testing their bomb in the US but we never see when the US actually uses it.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","It was a great movie, with a high degree of technical fidelity.  Christopher Nolans passion definitely shown thru the film, and he captured the psychological struggle of Oppenheimer well.  The story of the Manhattan Project is decidedly the story of Oppenheimer and the other great physicists of the age, and how they struggled to maintain their sense of humanity, wonder, and curiosity in light of the cataclysm that they knew their work would unleash.  This film is important since with the end of the Cold War the world has fallen into a false sense of security that the nuclear age has ended, while the truth is that the nuclear weapons of today are even more deadly and destructive than even Oppenheimer would have dreamed possible.

This film was impressive for its technical scope.  Nolans refusal to use cgi in the film made the experience more authentic and gave the viewer a more real sense of the awesome power which Oppenheimer was tasked with harnessing.  Nolan did a great job of showing the conflict behind the Manhattan project from the perspective of the US government, the people, and the scientists.  Nolan gave us a hint of the ideological imperatives driving the world conflict, but also how those who forged Thors hammer were so far removed from the actual horrors of the war.

The acting was also superb.  Cillian Murphy truly transformed into Oppenheimer and portrayed him with such mastery that it is hard to understand where Cillian ends and Oppenheimer begins.  Likewise, Robert Downy JR showed us his mastery of the art with a performance that was powerful and which was delivered with a subtle hint of a deeper man than the film first suggests.  It was an important role, and one which shaped the entire course of the film, and downy was excellent.

Overall this film is a showcase of Nolans talent and vision.  He showed us that Oppenheimer was, at the end of the day, still a man, and that he moved forward with the ultimate weapon, not in the hopes of endless destruction, but in the hopes of a lasting peace.",POSITIVE

"Jul 25, 2023","His best work yet. If you don't like the third act, you are wrong. Perfectly executed cinema!",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Oppenheimer was not only a story that needed to be told, but Christopher Nolan was the director that needed to tell it. From the ambitious quantity of dialogue, to the incredible weight of the forthcoming consequences felt through the first half of the film. Nolan personally stretched out his hand and gripped the nerves of the audience as the drama and crisis unfolded. The entire cast understood the importance of the story and dared not shy away from it. Robert Downey Jr. delivered a career best performance, shedding his Jarvis accompanied persona of Tony Stark and becoming a real life symbol of quiet and stealth deception. The score paced the film as such that the 3 hour runtime remained engaging, never fully slowing down but rather driving you towards inevitability. Experiencing Oppenheimer in 70mm IMAX film created a underlying feeling that every moment on screen was captured to draw in your emotions and the stakes couldnt feel higher.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Great movie. A very entertaining history lesson,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Amazing reality of what it took for Oppenheimer to do what he did.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","It's a Nolan movie first, a movie about Oppenheimer second. Rather than rely on its writing, it hits you over the head in both audio and video and ridiculous staccato editing, telling you what to think and trying to dictate the viewer's reactions. The usual Nolan endless dialogue buried in the mix, good luck hearing it. Why bother writing so much if no one is to hear it clearly? Go watch Fat Man & Little Boy, or the 1980 BBC Oppenheimer series. Or read the book, American Prometheus.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 25, 2023","Great thrill. Loved hearing about the nitty gritty history about this time period. I only knew the basis but Nolan gave so much more. The actors were wonderful, costumes to boot, and dont get me started about the special effects. A must see",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Extraordinary history story telling with on the spot facts.   It was exciting to see how many important scientific figures interconnected at such crucial time. A must watch!,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","It was good but the nude scenes were totally unnecessary and did not add to the story. Had I known they were there I would not have paid to see it. The only reason I gave it three stars is because the story line, minus the nude scenes,  was good. Dont take anyone under 18.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",It was amazing!. Nolan shows an ability to do dramas as well as action. The movie leaves people with thoughts that are difficult to think about. I think this is a movie that you have to be very mature to fully understand. 10/10,POSITIVE

"Jul 25, 2023","Overall excellent movie. the story is told in a non-linear fashion, which caused some confusion initially. Also, some dialogue is hard to hear.

"Jul 25, 2023","Nolen makes visually amazing movies filled with brilliant performances. This is no exception, though it could have benefitted by more editing. Maybe because this is Nolen's first foray into biographical fiction (meaning based on real events and people) he makes the historical fiction writer's mistake of telling too much, trying to prove his story with all the details. Which means many scenes of talking heads discussing things, which is fine if the audience knows and cares about the characters. But since we don't there's too many places where the audience tends to take a snooze. The fact that those elements come back together at the end doesn't help--waiting three hours to find out what all that dialogue meant is too long in a movie. And the nude scenes--completely unnecessary, and even laughably so. The audience literally laughed out loud at the scene of Frances Pugh lounging naked in a chair discussing--whatever it was she and Oppie were discussing--the audience was laughing too loud to hear the dialogue. Not embarrassed laughter, just ""this is ridiculous and doesn't belong here"" laughter. Pretty sure that wasn't the effect Nolen was going for, but that's what he got. And one last failure (among several): not explaining that the hydrogen bomb would have been even bigger and worse than the atom bomb, which would have explained Oppenheimer's opposition to it. The film seems to assume that modern audiences know the difference and will side with him. We don't and so find his opposition perplexing rather than compelling. Perhaps trying to tell three stories weakened the individual parts. Perhaps the film just needed more judicious editing. Overall, it's an uneven final cut: too long, too talky, too much and too little. Maybe a good thing Barbie was Nolen's date to the party.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 25, 2023","Fantastic story telling and phenomenal acting. It doesnt lean into effects and spectacle much at all, yet it somehow keeps you at the edge of your seat wanting to know what happens next to Oppenheimer and how will his surrounding relationships evolve

"Jul 25, 2023","Very good story, riveting performances by all of the cast - this is one to watch come Oscar-time. The movie looked like a special-effects person's dreams (especially the pyrotechnician). My only complaint - a scene in the Auditorium at Los Alamos, after the war ended, and everyone is waving small American flags - flags which have 50 stars on them, instead of the 48 that would have been appropriate for the time.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Everything. Except Im very upset with Nolan for not ending it on a good note with Oppenheimer getting to end his life on a positive note in his enjoyable final days on St. John.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Another Chris Nolan masterpiece. Captivating from the first minute on. Left the theater both feeling awe for the captive storytelling and spectacular acting, but also heartbroken over the story itself and what we did to Japan. This movie changed me.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","This was just a fantastic movie experience.  The acting by everyone was stellar.  The cinematography was amazing.  You have to hand it to Christopher Nolen.

"Jul 25, 2023","Not only did the movie present an historically accurate account of the formation of and work done by the team of scientists that worked on The Manhattan Project, but also presented a compelling portrait of how complex and haunted Dr. Oppenheimer was as a result of his heading up the project.

"Jul 25, 2023",Excellent cast and compelling story of an important event in our past,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","It's long been my suspicion that Nolan is a definite establishment figure. His film makes no attempt to portray the actual horror of the bombing, and uses the excuse that ""it's from Oppenheimer's"" perspective, when in actual fact we know Oppenheimer was shown the footage of the atrocity filmed by Japanese and American filmmakers (and immediately confiscated by the US Army). The truth of the matter is that Truman, Groves, Oppenheimer and the likes were simply too excited about using the ""toy"", as one general called it. Eisenhower famously remarked that there was no need to use the bomb, as the ""Japanese were ready to surrender"".  Instead of trying to tackle the moral implications of the use of the bomb, Nolan makes a bloated three-hour film, lacking any kind of rhythm, towing the official ""Hiroshima narrative"", and as we're seeing with every new film of his, breaking the cardinal rule of cinema; show - don't tell. Deep inside, Nolan is a pure technologist and as such is philosophically unable to align himself with a radical subversiveness that a truly artistic mind (such as Kubrick) would have.",NEGATIVE

What a missed opportunity to make people curious about science and technology.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 25, 2023","The audience was filled with young people. Important. American generations have forgotten the horrors of what was created by Oppenheimer, his group that ultimately spread throughout the world. Showing the devastation in Japan would have added to the understanding of what is waiting for any city and people in the world at the touch of a button. The movie portrayed the human weakness and evil in human beings and government leaders. As Oppenheimer said in the movie, "" Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds.""",POSITIVE

"Jul 25, 2023",It was very educational/edge of your seat emotionally stimulating Great acting and believable dialogue,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Certainly a well-written and focused film. Oppenheimer's life and determination took center stage. Although there are some visuals and scenes that could have been left out (too obvious, over-stated graphic feelings, let's say), this is a drama. It's not about only the scientific knowledge of building the atomic bomb, but more focused on the temperamental life of the key role. 

The good news is, there's something for everyone interested in knowing more about him in real life. Personally, I would have liked to have seen more character development from Einstein, Edward Teller, Leo Szilard, and General Groves. To see more development in the Y-12 facility, the massive scale of the Uranium enrichment, etc. could have been compelling to see. 

Still, you get a good helping of the life and drama of Oppenheimer. 

A great supporting cast, too! Robert Downey Jr., Rami Malek, Josh Harnett, Jason Clarke, Matthew Modine, Kenneth Branagh, Emily Blunt, and many others. Even Matt Damon played a fiercely defining moment in his career with Groves. Gary Oldman played an interesting Truman--not completely accurate to the look/sound of the former president, but only Oldman can transform Truman into an opportunistic monster. But then, Matt Damon, not as round as Groves, didn't leave anyone wishing he looked exactly the part. 

Finally, Cillian Murphy was largely the best choice for Oppenheimer, himself. If I were the director, I would have wanted to enlarge his nose slightly to better match the real man, but you'll believe him to be real. You can tell Cillian must have lived the role, even behind the camera. He carried it perfectly.",NEUTRAL

Well, it wasn't up to that but it was a very good movie with really good acting by all of the actors involved. I thought that Robert Downey Jr. stole the show with his role as Oppenheimers antagonist.

The complicated story included many features usually ignored in shorter articles or films. It also included the apparent evolution in Oppenheimer's own views over time.

"Jul 25, 2023","The mastery of both story and cinematic experience by Nolan & Co is on full display here! Beyond all the spectacle - incredible cinematography, acting, writing - what is stunning to me is that Nolan manages to make one of the most important and physically dramatic moments in human history (Trinity test) a SUBSET of the greater story, that of the extraordinary and complicated life of Oppenheimer himself. Only a master storyteller would relish the complexities of including such a huge arc of his life - from collegiate intellectual struggles and inspiration, to strained dalliances, to a web of interpersonal tensions with the other greatest scientific and military minds of the era, and ultimately with a political persecution later in life - and match those personal strains with the explosion of the world's first nuke. In my mind, an examination of the choices Nolan makes to build this story is almost as incredible as the story itself.",POSITIVE

"Jul 25, 2023","Enjoyed the film very much, but the sound was a bit overbearing at time. I didn't want to break out my SPL app on my phone, as the theatre was quite full for our screening. Some attendees might complain about it being too loud. They also left out the fact that President Truman, at Oppenheimer's request, dropped 70,000,000 flyers to warn residents about the impending destruction. That's a pretty historically significant item to leave out of the film. I guess Christopher Nolan wanted to make sure that the audience was set squarely again the USA by the end of the film.",POSITIVE

I will most definitely be making the time to go see it again in theaters ‚Äî it was THAT good. I will riot if Cillian Murphy doesnt win an award!!!!!!!",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Historically accurate, exceptional performance! Would watch it again. However I felt like the movie was a little long.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",I felt stupid while watching because I couldnt figure it out. There was too much talking and not enough variety. My husband loved it but he read the book first so knew the names of the characters and their backgrounds.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Great story, very well done, ran a little too long.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Well done. Worth the hours!  Intriguing and well scripted and acted.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",I liked it. The acting was great. I think Robert Downey Jr. should receive a best supporting actor nomination. It was a long movie but it was fast-paced. It was actually too fast and sometimes hard to keep up or maybe it was the flow. For that reason I thought it was very good but not excellent.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","The subject matter and story was interesting but I did not like the way it was presented, starting at the end and multiple flashbacks. Would have been better to not have flashbacks be the story. I hated the sex scenes that were totally unnecessary. Have already told several people not to bother.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Run time could've been shorter. The film went too far back into his personal life than what we'd care to see or know. The bomb test sequence did not disappoint, it was spectacular. The courtroom scenes were a bit much. Film would've been better concentrating more on the relationships between Oppenheimer and the other scientists with scenes depicting experimentation.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 25, 2023","Love the acting, love the music, the direction, the cinematography the atmosphere and the fact it was in IMAX. The only thing I disliked the most on personal level, is how everyone wants to compare this  movie as if it didnt happen in real life. If the trinity test failed then  the world would not be here today.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Loved it from beginning to end. Cillian Murphy is excellent in his role. Go see it.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","I was hesitant to buy a ticket because of its length, but there isnt a wasted moment. It is a completely engrossing story about a complicated man. Cillian Murphy and Robert Downy Jr. are perfect in these roles, but I have to say that every performance supported Murphy just as they should. It was tense and real. Just a beautifully done movie about a man who changed the world.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",I watched it on IMAX.  I loved the quality of video as well as the sound effects.  I suspect there will be at least nominations for both and probably some awards.  I didn't care for the jumping between scenes and from b/w to color.  I believe I would have enjoyed it more if it had been more about the aspects of building the atomic bomb and less about the case for withdrawing Oppi's security clearance.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",No previews so missed seeing the first 10 minutes.. How about an intermission when its a 3 hour movie? Great movie!,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Some of the dialog was hard to follow,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","A very powerful movie, more of a meditation on the 20th Century, truly an epic saga.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Saw it in IMAX at real IMAX theater.  It was an awesome experience in real IMAX and story was done well along with great visual and sound.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Loved the movie! The movie is more about Dr. Oppenheimer and his trials and tribulations with people in charge of the government than it is about the atomic bomb itself. For me that was a big plus because it's such an uninteresting aspect of what transpired during world War II. 

I'm surprised Fandango took so long to request my review.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Well crafted film in every aspect, I would recommend it. Slow but beautifully made",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Even though it is 3 hours long- it developed the characters throughout their lives- which made you understand them better. Great acting- great cinematography!,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Outstanding!  Excellent cast, story and cinematography. This is an epic story presented in epic style!",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Riveting story of JRH and development of A bomb. Great character study of good vs evil people with implications for todays world of suspected conspiracies,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","I loved everything about it, the screen play, the superb acting, the historical take. Great movie, one of the best in a long time in my opinion,",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Movie climaxes at end of act 2. Third act is strikingly off-message and exposition-dense. Big reveal was predictable to say the least. Most frustrating part is visuals and cinematography of acts 1 and 2 was top notch. End of Act 2 easy highlight of the movie.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Great film and story telling on how the atomic bomb was created and what led to the development of it. Great cast and acting by everyone involved in the movie.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Brilliant cinematic beauty , great word play good acting throughout and charming , bit dry toward the last hour but a solid adaptation",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","This film is by far the best movie produced in this country in years.  It is the entire package, with excellent script, actors, interest and relevancy.  If would rate it ""six star"" if that were possible.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","It was a very interesting movie but too long. It was hard to follow as there were so many moving parts and so many people in the movie. I had a hard time keeping up with the story line. But even with that, I liked it.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",The movie was a little too long.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","i would have liked to be able to use this show for educational purposes but the sex scenes made it unsuitable for families.  They were totally unnecessary, did nothing for the plot, and weren't even sexy - just stupid. There are so many amazing things around the spycraft and actual development of the bomb that took place that could have made this a much better movie.  If anyone wants a terrific story about this please read ""Bomb"" by Steve Sheinkin.  It's easy to read, historically accurate in every detail, and super entertaining. There are amazing stories around the development of the Bomb, but this movie missed those stories.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 25, 2023","I have never gone to the theater and not sat down with popcorn and a drink. I knew I didn‚Äôt want to be distracted by snacks. I couldn‚Äôt take my eyes off the screen. Yes, it was loud, but we need to get over that because it‚Äôs about a bomb. Bombs are loud. The casting was magical! Cillian and RDJ were phenomenal. So much talent from the main cast to the plethora of supporting cast. I can‚Äôt say enough good things about it. Nolan with the ‚ÄúW‚Äù!!!!!",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","The best movie I have seen in quite some time. Superb acting by all, wonderful script and direction. Fascinating topic. I loved it and would watch it again.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",A little explanation of events was required as after passing of time we forgot the history.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Loved it - very educational and entertaining!,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",The dialogue is hard to follow,NEUTRAL
"Jul 25, 2023",This movie was good. Robert Downey Jr. definitely stole his scenes and will probably get the best supporting actor nod at the very least. The last 15 seconds sent a chill down my spine and left the audience speechless. Not a peep out of anybody as we were leaving the theater.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",The information it put out was good.  The length was a little too long.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","""Prometheus stole fire from the gods and gave it to man. For this he was chained to a rock and tortured for eternity."" What an epic movie! 10/10",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",I liked EVERYTHING about Oppenheimer. Perfect movie/actors that got its point across spot on! Did not even notice the 3 hours going by.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Just an incredible film. An engrossing story about a fascinating person in a critical moment in human history. I highly recommend seeing it, and I really appreciate the chance to enjoy something truly unique and new, compared to the 18th version of the same old, same old, that the studios usually bury us with in the summer.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","The story was fascinating. That said, the story was largely overshadowed by what I felt was significant over-dramatization. In addition, the music was often too loud and overly dramatic.  However, the acting was first rate. Two weird analogies: it reminded me of what Phil Spector did with the Beatles' Let it Be album and also reminded me of the movie Peewee's Big Adventure, in which Peewee's story was overly dramatized on the screen.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 25, 2023",8/10 The Movie was fantastic,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Amazing cast and riveting storytelling,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Great cast, well done!",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Excellent movie....just a little long in the tooth. A great array of actors.  I loved the movie on IMAX. It came very close to blowing me away, but not quite.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Absolute masterpiece! Riveting dialogue and excellent execution in terms of building up the tension leading to the Trinity Test and its aftermath. Brilliant performances by the whole cast. Standouts are Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. This is Nolans Magnum Opus.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","The movie is well named.  The focus is on Oppenheimer himself, rather than the bomb project.  There have been numerous presentations of the Manhattan Project where the point was the project itself or the ramifications of the use of nuclear weapons.

The movie is riveting and well done.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Too long.  IMAX not worth it.,NEUTRAL
"Jul 25, 2023",Great acting by the cast. There was really no need to make the movie soooo long. Some of the plots were not clearly stated and were somewhat confusing.,NEUTRAL
"Jul 25, 2023",Hollywood at its finest from one of its finest filmmaker. They need to make more films like this. This is a MUST SEE on biggest screen possible.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Great pacing for a long movie. Also nice to see a movie not being dependent upon CGI. The casting and performances were outstanding. This movie will win numerous Oscars and deservedly so.,POSITIVE

"Jul 25, 2023","Nestled at the intersection of historical magnitude and artistic brilliance, ""Oppenheimer"" emerges as an enthralling cinematic masterpiece that meticulously weaves together the threads of science, ethics, and humanity. Helmed by a visionary director and adorned with captivating performances, this riveting biopic stands as a testament to the power of cinema as an art form that both enlightens and captivates.

Mise en scne, the cornerstone of cinematic expression, shines exceptionally in ""Oppenheimer."" From the evocative period set designs to the meticulous attention to detail in recreating mid-20th-century America, the film seamlessly transports its audience back to the tumultuous era of World War II and the advent of the atomic age. The skillful use of lighting and composition further enriches the visual narrative, evoking the raw emotions that underpin the unfolding events.

In a symphony of extraordinary talent, the acting in ""Oppenheimer"" elevates the film to unparalleled heights. Leading the ensemble cast, Cillian Murphy, who portrays the enigmatic J. Robert Oppenheimer, delivers a tour de force performance, capturing the complexities of the brilliant scientist with profound authenticity. The supporting cast, comprising the likes of Robert Downey Jr., Matt Damon, and Emily Blunt, imbues their respective characters with depth and nuance, drawing viewers deeper into the intimate intricacies of their lives.

The direction, spearheaded by Christopher Nolan, exhibits a deft and insightful touch. Faced with the daunting task of narrating Oppenheimer's life, Christopher Nolan orchestrates the film's pacing and tone with consummate skill. The storytelling unfurls in an organic and compelling manner, striking a harmonious balance between the personal struggles of the characters and the historical significance of their actions. Nolan exhibits a profound understanding of the human condition, capturing the ethical dilemmas that haunted Oppenheimer and his colleagues during their work on the Manhattan Project.

While the film's mise en scne and acting prowess are exemplary, it is the meticulously crafted script that forms the beating heart of ""Oppenheimer."" Penned by Nolan, the screenplay effortlessly fuses historical accuracy with poetic license, thus crafting a narrative that not only educates but emotionally resonates. The dialogue is both intellectually stimulating and emotionally charged, lending authenticity to the characters' personas and the era in which they lived. Nolan masterfully navigates the ethical quandaries faced by Oppenheimer, presenting them as universal dilemmas that transcend time.

As ""Oppenheimer"" unfolds, it becomes evident that the film's genius lies not in glorifying historical figures but in offering a multifaceted exploration of the human spirit. The audience is compelled to confront the moral complexities of scientific advancement and the responsibility that comes with wielding such power. The film's climax, a gripping depiction of the Trinity Test and its aftermath, leaves an indelible impression, serving as a poignant reminder of the consequences of human ingenuity.

In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" stands tall as a cinematic triumph that effortlessly amalgamates the best elements of filmmaking. Its awe-inspiring mise en scne, exemplary acting, skillful direction, and masterful script culminates in an extraordinary experience for cinephiles and history enthusiasts alike. Poised at the intersection of art and history, ""Oppenheimer"" is a film that reverberates with emotional depth and intellectual gravitas, making it an essential viewing for anyone seeking to explore the intricacies of the human soul.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Best movie this year, including Mission Impossible and Indiana Jones.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",It didnt need to be seen in the theater.,NEUTRAL
"Jul 25, 2023","Perfectly paced, smart script and first rate performances.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Lots and lots of boring dialogue, punctuated by a brief atomic bimb scene,. At the end we learned noting in this biopiic about Oppenheimer and not much about what went on at Los Alamos or Hiroshima or Nacasaki. A complete waste of time.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","This movie had too many parts, too many names, and too many timelines. It was a jumbled mess! I did not become attached to any characters. There was no emotion. And at the end of the movie, there was no explanation as to what we were supposed to think about Oppenheimer as a man, a husband, a communist an American. Worst movie I have ever seen in a long time",NEGATIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",It takes us on an amazing trip back to the 1940 and 50s!  A masterpiece!,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Overall interesting movie but little dull with too many dialogues,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Great storyline acting and cinematography!,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Wish it would have focused more on the technical aspects of the project, but it did an absolutely fantastic job of telling the story of the person and what happened to him which more than made up for it!",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","I just finished watching Oppenheimer for the second time and I maintain that it would be absolutely criminal if Christopher Nolan doesnt win the best director Oscar, Cillian Murphy doesnt win the best actor Oscar, and Robert Downey Jr. doesnt win the best supporting Oscar at the next Academy Awards ceremony. I wouldnt even put it out of the realm of possibility that Oppenheimer may win the best picture Oscar as well. This film is both a masterpiece and Christopher Nolans magnum opus. Two thumbs way up.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","It was a very intense ride, although a bit slow in the middle, could have been shorter (3 hrs!)  Definitely a stunning performance by Cilian Murphy who plays Oppenheimer, and great acting all around.  It is a portrayal of him, a character study, but the plot is moved forward by the relationship - or really the falling out between him and Strauss, played by Robert Downey Jr. and ultimately about men's egos.  It is,  however, a sign that people are craving smart adult dramas and are willing to go to the theater to see them.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","An absolute masterpiece! The cast, the writing, the visuals all stunning! Planning on seeing it a second time on the big screen!",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",This is a must watch for any adult. Reminds us that the scientists who created the nuclear bomb were human with emotions and flaws. Seeing this film led to many discussions about the perils of nuclear weapons. Excellent character development and awesome story.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Characters, and situations were portrayed in an authentic way.
The willful right wing US need to destroy the very intelligent is not isolated to this incident, but Oppenheimer was one of the more grievous&spiteful",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",The acting in this movie was amazing.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Excellent portrayal of one of the most obscure names in our modern history!  Nolan lays out the flow of the movie in the first ten minutes and it doesn't let up!,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",It was amazing. Unbelievable the lengths people will go in knowledge and ego to make their goal happen. Cillian was amazing along with every other actor in it.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Great movie and superb actors show parts of history that continue to define us today.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Powerful and engaging,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Too much dramatic music.... dragged on and on....all foam no beer!!!,NEGATIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Incredibly well acted! The story is compelling and intense. However, it is about 30-45 minutes too long. Nolan could have tightened the story up a bit.  Oscar's for Murphy, Blunt, and RDJ.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Great movie all around. This one met every expectation I had leading up to it.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Fantastic movie throughout as you would expect from Christopher Nolan. One thing worth mentioning however, there are a few sex scenes with graphic nudity which is a first for his movies, so if thats something that might bother you, keep it in mind before viewing.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Fantastic story and great acting! 
Could have done without all the buzzing halos in the early scenes!",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Powerful true story about the creation of the first nuclear bombs. Learned many things I didn't know and as much as I deplore war I see the overwhelming choice that OPPENHEIMER made and its consequences.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Beautiful movie, the pacing was fantastic and the writing was extraordinary. The movie perfectly portrayed what these men went through as well as the hardship the scientists had to deal with emotionally.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Was more a character study than a drama about development of the atom bomb. Lots of significant physicists mentioned -- you're supposed to know ahead of time who they all are and their backstories. If you don't, then it is all just mostly a blur of names and faces. To be expected: movie's title is ""Oppenhemier"", not ""Manhattan Project"".",NEUTRAL
"Jul 25, 2023","Arguably one of the best movies ever made.  It moved me deeply.  I am still thinking and talking about it after one week and going through the many interviews and documentaries about the movies and the incidents and science portrayed in it.  Outstanding on every level‚Äîcast, script, concepts, filmography, creativity, thoughtful treatment of a complicated subject at a critical time in our history.  Relevance to today is also abundant!",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","The acting was amazing, but I couldnt get beyond the absolutely horrible sound editing.  The music was far louder than the voices in most scenes and the musical score was played in the background of 80-percent of the movie.  When there was no music in the background and they had dialogue I could actually understand, it was such a relief!  Also, the entire movie needed 30 minutes of editing.   Oppenheimer was being interviewed during the red scare - WE GET IT ALREADY.  This movie is going to make millions more than it should because it came out along with Barbie and is completely overhyped.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 25, 2023",Great cast and great film,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Movie was great. A little longer than any other movie Ive watched but great movie!,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","I went into Oppenheimer knowing next to nothing about J. Robert himself, and also only knowing Christopher Nolan's Batman films, so I genuinely wasn't sure what to expect. This movie was a phenomenal watch, start to finish. The run-time is 3 hours long, but it did not feel that way. I wanted more and was disappointed when the movie ended I couldn't tell you the last time I felt that way. There's so much story to be told, and Nolan told it beautifully. Cillian Murphy is a fantastic Oppenheimer, and besides himself, this was a star-studded cast. Large names like Robert Downey Jr. only had probably a total of 15 minutes of screen time, but he was an absolute scene-stealer and played said scenes like the professional he is. Each moment flowed naturally into the next, and I learned more about the Manhattan Project than I did in public school(not very surprising). It's quite the story(albeit a heavy topic) and I highly encourage any self-proclaimed history-buff to view it. 

Absolute incredible watch, I can't wait to add this to my collection.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Brilliantly executed film. Great acting from all cast. Subject and presentation left me speechless. Saw it on IMAX,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",What an amazing movie,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Spoiler alert:         
Great historical drama. I enjoyed Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr.'s performances. What I didn't need or like was the unnecessary s3X scenes which were awkward and threw alot of moviegoers off. You thinking it's a deep scientific drama and there goes that irrelevant tidbit.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Excellent cast, wonderful and important historical story, even though it was long, the time passed quickly.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Fantastic visuals and dialogue. Great acting. Interesting g subject matter. Would recommend IMAX.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","AMC Grest Lakes constantly plays their volume waaaaay too loud.  I could see people putting their fingers over their ears for both Oppenheimer and Mission Impossible this week.  

Management didnt know how to lower the volume.  Ruined my movie experiences.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","At school in the 60's we practiced nuclear bomb protocol.  It was so real to us that every day, could be the last day after it was learned Russia had the same capability the US had.  The movie helped provide additional context to the experience I had in elementary school and the fear that became commonplace among American as we learned to come to terms with nuclear bomb threats.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey jr. Both deserve awards for their performance. This says a lot because every actor brought their A game in this. The visuals were awesome. It felt like I was in the story. The movie makes you ask so many important questions. Its a very well executed movie it was just a bit too long maybe by 30 minutes.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Excellent filmmaking! The IMAX scenes were just amazing to witness. Would have loved if the story dwelled more into the science part rather than the politics involved.,POSITIVE

"Jul 25, 2023",Great acting go see it,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Really loved this movie. Characters felt authentic and story was riveting.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",The movies focus was deceiving based on the advertising. It was less about inventing and building the atomic bomb and more about a communist witchhunt and government defamation.  It jumped too much between trying to tell us about his backstory. To the government hearings to the social elite gatherings.,NEUTRAL
"Jul 25, 2023",Some movies are meant to be long because the story could be told no other way. But this was way too long and drawn out. It could have been seen in half the time. Kept nodding off. Matt Damon way over acting the part. He is not a good older actor. I didnt believe it. I was not sold on the acting.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Keeps you engaged throughout the movie!,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",As a history buff nice to see inside what transpired during this period in history.  Deplorable how he was treated after his achievements.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Perhaps it's my hearing, but it seemed to me that the sound clarity of the actors speech was too fuzzy around the edges, often made worse by the somewhat droning score. Dialogue needs sharper high range and to be brought farther forward.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",A must see for everyone of all ages.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","An important story for educated Americans to explore. What an extraordinary intellect and leader. The hearing that removed his clearance, and destroyed his reputation, WAS A GOVERNMENT SHAM. Look familiar?",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Fantastic story very well told and acted brilliantly. It moves quickly and was a little confusing at the beginning. In the end, I learned a lot about Oppenheimer and his work, and also his persecution of the hands of the government.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Wonderful movie, it was beautiful and worth the three hours. If you like physics, history, and drama, this is the movie for you! The characters feel so real, the acting was immaculate. Would watch again.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Beautiful film, definitely plan to see again while it's still in theaters.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",The performaces and cinematography are excellent. As a biopic it fails. Two thirds of the movie were focused on government hearings which were boring. As an anti- nuclear war movie it fails. It failed to show the horrors of nuclear war. It could have been much more impactful if it were cut down to two hours and spent more time on the effects of the bomb.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Way way too long! It is a documentary and a movie at the same time but you none done fully. Could have been done in 2 hrs if they would have choose to do one or the other.  Not exciting enough to keep you engaged for 3 hrsI fell asleep on and off during the last hour.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Definitely an Oscar contender!  Loved the twists and turns of the movie.  Great story.  Very insightful.  It is a must see at the movies (IMAX preferably).,POSITIVE

"Jul 25, 2023",THE NAKED SEX SCENES WITH FLORENCE PUGH WERE DISGUSTING AND COMPLETELY UNNECCESSARY TO THE PLOT OF THE MOVIE. THERE WAS NO REASON FOR ALL OF THAT TO NEED TO BE SHOWN BECAUSE IT HAD NO ACTUAL BEARING ON THE MAIN FOCUS OF THEMOVIE AND REALLY DISTRACTED FROM THE MAIN PREMISE OF THE MOVIE. IT SIMPLY WASN'T NEEDED IN MY OPINION.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","The actors were great.  Robert Downey was exceptional.
Great story. Reminds us of the human risk of technology.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Well made but really long and boring. The last hour was the only interesting part,NEUTRAL
"Jul 25, 2023","Dark night meet Momento. Honestly Ive never felt like the sound and audio engineering had ever made such a big difference in the movie. I could literally feel the power, magnitude, and seriousness of what they were dealing with, the atom Bomb. Wasnt over powering or too loud. It was like another main character in the move. 100% could not have felt the move or experienced it like that at home. Plan to go see the 70mm imax soon it was so good.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","The movie was 3 hours long but it did not seem that long at all, I love history and this was something I never knew really that much about. The acting was great but I did hate the Robert downing jr played a bad guy but he did it well!",POSITIVE

"Jul 25, 2023",Fantastic story and visuals are amazing!,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","An absolute masterpiece from a director that has flirted w/them several times over. This is probably Nolan's most award-friendly film, and it hit all the beats perfectly. Haunting and engaging while showing the man determined to prove theory, while realizing the devastation that comes with his academic pursuit... Impeccable score, as well.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","The single best motion picture of the decade. Whether you like the subject or not, the acting is top notch. Everyone turned in their performance of a life time. Go see it!",POSITIVE

and now, OPPENHEIMER.

That was a fast and exhausting three hours and I am grateful that I saw it in 70mm IMAX in a well centered seat. Feel free to dump all over my list. It wont make a dent. I know what I saw.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Compelling biopic about a troubled American scientist-engineer. Rather long and not enticing enough to watch twice.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Incredibly intense. The writing was out of this world.  The actors were spectacular.  I can't wait to see it again!,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Learning parts of our history.. excellent acting,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Absolutely stellar. A masterpiece.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Amazing Story...  Would recommend a short review being put out by Fandango for a movie like this so it is easier to follow the course of events.  I will need to see it again after reading about the era etc.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","A little long, but solid review of his life starting with how he went from school to running the project. But most importantly, everything he endured during and after the bomb was dropped. Most of this as well as his personal life/history, I did not know. Could have used less jumping around as far as timelines go.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 25, 2023","Amazing acting and incredible cinematography, but way too long and you felt it. Pacing was slow/boring after the initial bomb test and I was fighting nodding off. I can see how others could enjoy it though, hence the 3 star review. But I do not think this is a groundbreaking film like some claim. Chris Nolan makes amazing movies and this is the first time I didnt pick up what he was putting down, as they say.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 25, 2023",unnecessarily too long and the story is a complicated one that wasn't laid out in a linear way so it may it more complicated,NEGATIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",The movie was surreal. The music and the camera-work were just incredible. Cillian and everyone else involved were astounding. Nolan lives up to his name every time. I don't think there are enough positive adjectives to describe this movie. Do yourself a favor and go see it.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",It was a true story about the atomic bomb,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Good movie but it's straining for anyone with hearing aids to get all the dialogue. Get the Closed Caption devices for sure. I wish I had...,NEUTRAL
"Jul 25, 2023",Loved the cast and how the story was told .,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Sound was loud and annoying,NEGATIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","The movie was NOT the whole story, but it was part of the story. It showed the anguish as politics bested science and the military got what it wanted - maybe what many soldiers of the time wanted - but not what we all wanted, for the future. Dr. Oppenheimer was one of those miracle people who come along rarely and have the strength to fight, fight, fight everyday .. not everyone has that mental strength. The movie could have been three times longer - I would have very much like to have seen more about his 'magic' with the other scientists. Cillian Murphy, Robt Downey Jr, and Matt Damon were each stellar. Murphy was actually heart-breaking",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Overhyped okay movie.
Nolan peaked with ""Dark Knight""",NEUTRAL
"Jul 25, 2023",Growing up in Los Alamos it paid attention to details from my childhood.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Likely the best movie I've  seen in 74 years.
Don't let the minor details cause you to be distracted from the central message.
We have to get this right or we will be a failed species.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Really brilliant movie, well acted and directed.  A must see.  Definitely academy award winner!",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Stunning movie with award winning performances by every actor in the movie.  Many new facets of Oppenheimer's life and career were revealed which added to the complexity of this man.  See it in IMAX!,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Nuclear Bombs and Florence Pughs tits,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","The whole cast was extraordinary, especially Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey, Jr.  Brilliant cinematography and score.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","It was a too long, but I thoroughly enjoyed it",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","I really liked the movie. Oppenheimer is a genius, so is Nolan",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Superb movie-making from a master.  A complex subject tackled in its complexity.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Too long.   Sex scenes not necessary.   Tbey did not go into the radiation damage that those people must have been exposed to.,NEUTRAL
"Jul 25, 2023","Although interesting - A little too focused on the Communist/political part of the development of the bomb.  
Loved the acting and the focus on the personal trauma Oppenheimer suffered.  Thought the sec scenes were a little too graphic for my 16 & 18 year old guests.  I see academy awards in the movies future.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Excellent movie, but VERY loud (esp. in some parts.) Don't know if it was the theater sound or movie itself. Will definitely watch it again at home when it streams.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Excellent writing, directing, acting, and film craftsmanship! Very powerful, especially when viewed in IMAX.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Just got out of a showing of Oppenheimer. 

I've read so many opinions of this movie and, clearly, the ones that didn't care for it or were disappointed didn't know what to expect, didn't understand what they were watching, or simply didn't have the attention span to make it through the movie.

This was an absolute masterpiece of a movie. Beautifully shot and executed. I didn't find it to drag at all. There is a build up to the testing and dropping of the atomic bomb and how Oppenheimer had to deal with the demons of what he had contributed to. 

I appreciate the aspects of his personal life that were explained. It showed how so many others thought of him or respected/disrespected, including his own wife's attitude towards him.

The soundtrack was subtle mostly but there were noticeable crescendos in key moments, but they weren't overbearing so much as to take away from what was happening on screen. 

I had seen multiple post comment about a ""court room scene"". This was a Senate confirmation hearing and the backroom interrogation was the atomic commission security hearing. So clearly the people commenting about how boring these scenes were didn't know what they were watching and how these two scenes destroyed his career.

Overall, I'd be shocked if this wasn't nominated for a handful of awards, most notably Murphy for best actor and possibly Nolan for best director.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Nolan crafted another masterpiece.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Great history of events. A little too long.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",An engaging look at a significant historical event. Loud!  Trigger alert.  Worth your 3+ hours of time to go see this show.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","The beginning is a mess, hard to follow, and it took at least a half hour to chill out. It jumps back and forth rapidly between two different eras before you even know what's going on, and basically thrusts you into both. It is disorienting and it added nothing to the story being done this way. And the way parts are cut are goofy and confusing, much like the ""for you"" scene from Dark Knight Rises. Nolan is not that great of a director. People who say that haven't seen many truly great films. The different story threads jump around in time too like the few final GoT seasons, which is somewhat unavoidable in a biopic, but Nolan slows down to spend the last hour on the most boring part, which is a fatal flaw. The person I went with literally fell asleep because he thought it was pointless. The movie works, the ending is good, but it's a mess, and as a biopic it is also inherently somewhat bullshit. Oppenheimer never asked Einstein about the possibility the bomb would destroy the world but it makes for good cinema. The movie was too kind to Oppenheimer who was clearly a douche and definitely gave him the benefit of the doubt that he felt genuine remorse and not just narcissistic martyrhood, which feels like something we can only speculate on. The movie did connect with me emotionally but there is fiction out there that is much more profound. People should probably see it just so they remember that nuclear war is bad because lots of westerners are absolutely out of their minds now.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","central character is complicated individual and I didn't care much about his downfall   No dramatic tension, let down at end",NEGATIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","great cast, very informative movie, The 3 hours flew by. A must see for all. Will probably win the an Oscar.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Compelling story. A little dry in spots, but thats science.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Great film. Cillian Murphy is fabulous! Very informative to many of us. The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars, was THREE HOURS LONG! Studios or theaters need to offer intermissions if any movie is over 2hours. Food for thought.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Too long, could hear dialog but not clear enough to decode it.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 25, 2023",Incredible film that is filled with emotion that only Nolan could exploit. Must see.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Amazing film.  I will see it again - although L-O-N-G it didn't drag on.  Acting was outstanding.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Very powerful film!  Loved it.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Great acting, directing, dialogue, cinematography. Quite a heavy film to process, but it is excellent.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","One of the best movies in the last decade. Pace is amazing, three hours of heavy dialogue somehow go by without ever being bored, and the acting is spot on the whole way through. Best biopic I have ever seen.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",top 5 movies i've seen all-time,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",The movie portrays Oppenheimers important years via several storylines that take place in the past and his present. The story portrays many characters he interacted with in a very good way. The movie also showed the conflict within the scientific community regarding their project and what it might spell for the future of humanity.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Such a thrilling movie. I was on the edge of my seat for most of it. Really captured a pivotal moment in time.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Outstanding!!! Great performances and the directing is superb.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",The master is flexing.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Beautifully made movie.  Loved the use of color, sepia and b/w  to highlight perspective.  See it in an IMAX theater for best impact",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",One of the best movies ever made. Great movie making. Unbelievable.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Absolutely a fantastic theater movie! The sound editing was some of the best Ive ever experienced. Acting was great, camera work great, but the sound did it for me. Wonderful movie!",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","I love this movie. Undoubtedly the best movie of the year. 



Disliked the amount of Nudity tbh. It seemed a little unnecessary.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Superb movie making. Saw in 70 MM and it was beautiful. While I agree with many that it was a bit too long, it was worth it for learning about the history of an event so epic and literally world changing. I believe it is Mr. Downey's year for an Oscar. Along with a slew of others if there's any justice. Not to be missed.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Well, as the title says, it is about Oppenheimer, not as trailer shows, about the Manhattan project.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Captivating, smart and educational!",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Gripping, fast paced, deep, unsettling and satisfying.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Poor adaptation of a compelling book. The lead actor looked like Oppenheimer but did not at all act like him and many others saw their lines clipped or just run through so quickly they were useless. Nolan played up the tragedy to the loss of the story of the amazing people and what they did. 

Form over substance",NEGATIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","One of Christopher Nolan's best films- and I've seen both Inception and Interstellar. This film made a lasting impression on me, and it created such a strong tension through its visuals, story, and acting. It left everyone awestruck.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Incredible, all around.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Experience it in the theaters.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",The movie was very riveting and great acting. The 3 hours flew by!,POSITIVE

"Jul 25, 2023",Incredible story and attention to detail!,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Dislogue/ editing. Character developmentgreat actors!,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Phenomenal cinematic experience, glad I got to see it in 70mm in a theater, as it was intended.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Found the end more interesting than the beginning when the rapid editing slowed down.,NEUTRAL
"Jul 25, 2023","It was very well made and acted. However here are my two criticisms. First, the narrative jumped around instead of being linear. Im not a big fan of that storytelling style. Second, the climax happened a full
45-60 minutes before the end.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 25, 2023","Thought provoking, interesting, and so well done!  It's a must see!",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Very gripping and somehow terrifying film. Great acting.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Immersive and educational. This justifies the big screen and its runtime. Great cast.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Okay my review - loved it. More than I thought. The first thirty minutes I felt so stupid because I was like what the hell is even happening in this movie, I felt like it was in another language. I caught on eventually lol and it all made sense. Cillian Murphy is so hot. And I think the use of the sound affects and visuals do a really cool job of helping us as the audience understand how his mind worked and how smart he actually was",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Great cast, acting, story. The writing was amazing, as Was so interesting to learn more about the man and the era and the history.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Best movie I have ever seen. Cillian Murphy did an excellent job portraying Oppenheimer. Be warned though as the name suggests it is more focused around Oppenheimer not the bomb.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",All performances were brilliant but Robert Downey Jr. was outstanding!  Certain to be an Oscar contender.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Long movie, should have an intermission",POSITIVE

"Jul 25, 2023","This movie is not only visually stunning, incredibly acted, and beautifully scoredbut it feels important in a way thats hard to put into words. This is a film everyone should see. It may not be a film everyone will like, but it touches on such a critical event in the history of mankind.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Too long. Sex scenes not necessary.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Was a nice movie. Can watch it once. But did not live up to the hype.,NEUTRAL

"Jul 25, 2023","Fast paced, incredible telling of a true story.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Very disappointed. Know the story well. Too much jumping back and forth in time made the story hard to follow. Also, the movie is too long.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Great acting. Riveting story,",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",It was ok but would not recommend.  Long and a little slow.,NEUTRAL
"Jul 25, 2023",Excellent work! Thanks!,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Entertaining movie, but way too long.  So many scenes could have been condensed while still maintaining the integrity of the movie.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 25, 2023",Gratuitous sex scenes were a real disappointment.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","For the most part, I thought it was very well done and kept you drawn in for the entire time. It was a movie that really made you think.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Phenomenal movie. Recommend to watch on IMAX.,POSITIVE

"Jul 25, 2023",Top notch acting and cast. Great story.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Amazing!!!! A must see for anyone interested in history and REAL LIFE!!,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Buckle up for another Christopher Nolan adult drama experience in iMax.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Excellent movie overall. Classic Nolan with the sound, imagery. Completely unnecessary nudity my group of 10 could have done without. Added nothing to the story and makes this otherwise PG-13 film R.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","It's real cinema. Nolan delivers on the visuals with scant use of CGI. The story is compelling and thought provoking as it centers on such an enigmatic character such as Oppenheimer. Nolan offers up multiple perspectives of the man, focuses on the first person which promotes discussion after the film. But most interestingly the biopic succeeds as it deals with the complexity of the situation especially as time moves on where as many others take a binary view of people and events telling the whole story from ""a perspective""",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",A historical masterpiece,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Oppenheimer is a masterful cinematic achievement, skillfully delving into the complexities of history and human nature, leaving audiences with a profound and thought-provoking experience",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Fantastic acting.  Powerful story.  Amazing movie making.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",It was an excellent film in all acts with a terrific cast.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",It's a modern day masterpiece!,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",The best movie of 2023,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","The visuals, score, and audio effects accompanied the narrative so well. I loved the anti climax of the bombings in Japan...focusing on the emotions rather than the spectacle. The film does such a great job of portraying Oppenheimer as a historically neutral figure...brilliant, accomplished, and critically flawed in his personal and professional life. 

The movie can be a bit confusing at times with it constantly switching between Oppenheimer's perspective and Strauss's perspective and the occasional very quiet dialogue that's hard to hear. But that's all part of what adds to the excitement and the mysteriousness behind this very complex figure in world history. 

Looking forward to seeing it in theaters again soon!",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","You'll never see a bio-pic that feels more like sci-fi than Oppenheimer.
Amazing performances, truly captivating visuals to an even more captivating story, and a big runtime that feels small.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",An absolute must watch! It's extremely fantastic and insane storytelling. It really uses all its resources to tell the story from the perspective of doctor Oppenheimer. Omg 10/10,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Daring, dense and terrifying",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Great movie for History buffs‚Ä¶,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",WAY TOO MUCH DIALOGUE.  WE NEVER GOT THE BIG BOOM WE WERE WAITING FOR. We made sure to see it in IMAX 70MM thinking it's going to be some visual masterpiece. All this errie suspenceful music for a big let down. Absolutely 95% talking. One thrill that wasn't even a big deal at all. Big nolan fan. I enjoyed tenet more,NEGATIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Oppenheimer was AMAZING. Not only was the acting top tier, but the overall production was fantastic. And on top of everything, I learned about a piece of history that I didn't know before! Absolutely a must see!",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Brilliant cinematography with the combination of the clarity of IMAX, Nolan had succeeded in both non CGI visual effects and the colour pallet that is most suitable for a biopic like this. 

Story is presented with scrambled shards of information and two different views where one of them is the objective reality ( black and white reality and the other one is within eyes of J. Robert Oppenheimer. Initially it is hard to understand the whole picture of the story , but it gradually builds up to the point where the viewer can pick up the shards together and fully understand what the story is trying to tell. It is not as simple of a movie where it would spew out information that has no headroom to understand because it is already processed. A brilliant approach how Nolan made it as realistic/raw as possible for the viewer to enjoy the full experience. Love it",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",A must see!! cinematography was excellent and wardrobe for that Era was perfect!  Superb acting from all cast members!  üíó,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","The movie was too long, boring",NEUTRAL
"Jul 25, 2023",Mindblowing. Just as expected.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Phenomenal. Best movie of the year.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","EVERYTHING FROM THE STORY TO THE PERFORMANCES AND EXPECIALLY THE VISUAL CREATIVITY OF NOLAN AND THE EXTRODINARY SCORE OF LUDWIG...
It truly was a masterpiece, a piece of art, words cannot be described for this movie, definitely a keeper for this decade, it was so beautiful",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Wow. Everybody in the theatre left absolutely stunned. I'm usually not a massive fan of long films but this absolutely flew by. Would also highly recommend watching it in 70mm IMAX.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","SPOILERS
Very good performances, great soundtrack, but the enormous cast, and a story that follows a mostly emotionless, morally ambiguous, arrogant, unsympathetic character who contributes to the destruction of one marriage, possibly contributes to his ex lovers suicide, abandons his children, yet still sees himself as a victim. But it seems according to the story as they tell it, this is all okay because he's a genius. 
As far as the cinematic experience.. For those expecting to see dramatic landscapes and mind-blowing visuals of the bomb testing etc, there are a few of those, but the majority of stunning visuals are of Cillian Murphy's eyes and face. Handsome dude, but given the choice between that and standing at ground zero during a test is discussion worth having. 
Next time reduce the characters to the important ones, tell the story from someone with a pulse, end with a big bang- either emotionally or through action, and show an arc in the character.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","This movie just made me so worried about the future of mankind, that I just cant get over it.
Absolute masterpiece, brings to discussion one of the most important themes about modern politics and I hope it opens the eyes of many people around the world.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Fantastic film. Great acting, soundtrack and effects. The only thing I would say is you want to be going into the film with a little bit of prior knowledge about Oppenheimer. Especially the trials after the creation of the bomb. It will help.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",I thought Oppenheimer was an absolute masterpiece. Cillian Murphy's performance is outstanding. I was hooked and on the edge of my seat for the entire three hour runtime. The cinematography was incredible and the acting was all top tier.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Phenomenal movie-going experience! The use of audio pairs perfectly with the immaculate visuals to keep you engaged through all three hours. The acting is exceptional, led by Cillian Murphy and backed up by a plethora of talented performances. Even though I knew most of the story beforehand, I was still on the edge of my seat through several key moments, culminating in the Trinity Test scene which was one of the most memorable movie scenes I've seen in years. Can't wait to go see it in theaters again!",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Amazing movie. All these idiots that say ""not enough action"", ""stop trying to justify the murder of thousands of Japanese"", your all idiots, the entire point of the movie is how hard oppenheimer worked to come to where he is and how it led to his personal downfall.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Casting , directing  was top notch.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","I wanted to go to pee but I just couldn't find a moment that didn't seem important, I was litterally just devouring every word, every sound, every image Nolan wanted to force down my throat.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","It's a great historic moment in time where we are in the edge of ending the war, or ending the world. Great movie in my opinion; I love history, I love dramas, and I love mystery solving movies. This is a compilation of all. Love it!!!",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Filmul este destul de lung ,√ÆnsƒÉ povestea este at√¢t de interesantƒÉ ca nu √Æ»õi dai seama ca a trecut 3 ore,recomand pentru cei care iubesc sa vadƒÉ un film bun

"Jul 25, 2023","It's a phenomenal movie. I'm definitely going to rewatch it soon but, it's definitely not for the casual movie goer that is expecting a fun or action filled movie. This movie is definitely for history buffs, people that love documentaries, and cinema enthusiasts. Christopher Nolan's depiction of these historical figures was masterful and extremely true to reality.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","I really enjoyed this movie! The storyline, characters, and acting were superb. A lot of historical dramas are dry, but I found this quite the opposite. I highly recommend this film!",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Way too artsy and way too long. Also gets confused on itself a fair bit. 

Florence Pugh and RDJ's characters are completely pointless, and add over an hour to this already too long film.

Not sure why Christopher Nolan continues to make films around science, because he does not have a good grasp of it.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Tremenda pel√≠cula contada de forma excelente por el Sr Nolan y actuada magistralmente por el Sr Cillian Muprhy,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","The hype is real.  This is an absolutely fantastic movie, and very possibly the best film Nolan has made to date.  The build and release of tension is masterfully done, in no small part to the absolutely perfect score and sound direction.  While it isn't a groundbreaking film, it doesn't need to be.  What Oppenheimer is, is an incredibly well directed, well written, and well acted film with an amazing cast.  This is the kind of movie where you walk out wondering just how many Oscars it is going to win...and if you ask me it should win all of them.  I won't go into details and plot, I'll simply say that if Oppenheimer interests you at all you need to see it on a big screen.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","In the world of filmmaking, few directors can claim the level of brilliance that Christopher Nolan consistently delivers with each of his creations.

The greatest movie of all time .

"Jul 25, 2023","Terrific story that taught me I didn't know as much as I thought about the first Atomic Bomb and the people who developed it. Fascinating tale that kept me interested for THREE HOURS.  Didn't think this subject would do that, but it did.

My only small complaint was that the sound track sometimes drowned out the speaking voices, but that could have been a theater set-up issue.

The cast was fantastic and the story both intriguing and informative. LOVED THIS MOVIE.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","As a long-time fan of the book ""Oppenheimer,"" I approached the movie adaptation with a mix of excitement and trepidation. Often, films can struggle to capture the depth and intricacy of their literary counterparts, leaving fans disappointed. However, I am thrilled to say that the Oppenheimer movie managed to do justice to the captivating story penned in the book.

Directed with finesse and a keen eye for detail, the Oppenheimer movie faithfully translates the essence of the book onto the big screen. While some minor adjustments were made to suit the cinematic medium, the core narrative remains intact, and the historical accuracy of the events surrounding J. Robert Oppenheimer's life and work is commendable.

The casting of the movie is nothing short of stellar. The lead actor's portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer is deeply nuanced and captures the complexity of this enigmatic figure. Throughout the film, we witness Oppenheimer's intellectual brilliance and dedication to science juxtaposed with his internal struggles and moral dilemmas, which humanizes him beyond the pages of the book.

The cinematography and set design are praiseworthy as well. The film beautifully captures the era of the Manhattan Project, transporting viewers back in time to witness the tremendous challenges faced by the scientists and engineers involved in creating the atomic bomb. The scenes at Los Alamos and the testing grounds have been meticulously recreated, making the historical backdrop an immersive experience.

However, where the movie truly shines is in its ability to bring some of the book's more philosophical themes to life. The contemplation on the moral implications of harnessing such destructive power is explored with sensitivity, provoking thought and reflection long after the credits roll. The screenplay expertly weaves the dialogue with poignant moments, emphasizing the ethical dilemmas faced by Oppenheimer and his colleagues.

One slight drawback of the film is that, given its time constraints, it naturally had to condense certain aspects of the book. Some secondary characters and subplots had to be streamlined, and this might leave fans of the book craving for a more comprehensive exploration of those elements. However, considering the inherent limitations of adapting a book into a feature-length film, the choices made were understandable.

In conclusion, the Oppenheimer movie successfully captures the spirit of the book while providing a visual and emotional experience that is both captivating and thought-provoking. It is evident that the filmmakers approached this adaptation with respect for the source material and a commitment to delivering a powerful and moving story.

Whether you're a fan of the book or someone interested in the life and times of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the movie is a compelling watch. It serves as both an introduction to the historical figure and a tribute to the remarkable story penned in the book. Ultimately, ""Oppenheimer"" stands as a testament to the timeless power of human intellect, ambition, and the consequences of scientific progress.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Storytelling at it¬¥s peak -
Christopher Nolan  once said that the first six minutes of a movie can define whether the audience stays to the end.  He rolls up the curtains of Oppenheimer with an intro about a battle between humankind and the gods of Olympus. And right after that, starts a great game, that play your senses and mind. So yes, you definitely want to stay.  
First you try to set the genre, but it¬¥s far away from a straight road. Horrific visions, retrospective, monochromatic visuals ‚Äìall diferent timelines. You are focused, because you are jumping from one to another. But to also keep your interest, the individual timelines are connected by key events and characters, bind by the law of causality. So the narrative is dynamic, but   not chaotic and you just can¬¥t wait to unfold more.   It¬¥s neither that easy with the protagonist - Robert J. Oppenheimer, the leader of The Manhattan Project, who with the invention of the atomic bomb, changed the whole world forever. Challenging story, right? Should we admire him, hate him, or even feel sorry for him? The great thing is that we, the audience, are draged throught a whole spectrum of emotions about him. He is dangerous, unhinged, narcissist, but at the same time, or different times, he is shown as a martyr, genius and loyal to his statements. It works perfectly with the narrative, because you are not biased by what the director/writer wants you to think. He simply tells you the story.  
Stylistically, the main character is the dialog. Your focus is guided by a slow camera track-in, beautiful key lighting and camera refocusing on the speaker and listener. Subconscious, elegant.  
Another key element is time. You are already focused, not lost, immersed and hungry for more. At last, the dynamic editing and music push you to the limits and you are almost on the edge for the whole journey.  
To summarise it, these different layers work perfectly together. Even after the second act, the narration still holds to its tempo and that is something unique.  You are taken on a coherent journey and after 180 minutes you just find yourself at its end.  
I wanted to stay fully objective (in the sense, that I can somehow argue my statements), but I have to say, that this complexion gave me the feeling, that everybody who worked on Nolan¬¥s Oppenheimer gave a minimum of 100% to its work. The whole star cast, the postproduction, every member of the crew.  Just to say that one day, they contributed to this magnum opus.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",absolute masterpiece from christopher nolan,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","This movie is about a security clearance hearing, communism and men betraying each other more than it is about the moral and ethical quandaries of making an A-bomb during war, or the people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. There are great performances here, as well as several arresting images and impressive sequences of editing, particularly during the Trinity test and when Oppenheimer addresses a rabid crowd of patriots after the bombings. But this viewer was left with an overwhelming and frustrating sense that the real story was ignored.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 25, 2023","Came into the theater expecting a boring three-hour talking movie, but it was an edge-of-your-seat, intense movie. The bomb explosion was the most heart-pounding scene in the movie, and when the bomb exploded, you could not hear a single thing in the theater. The final scene definitely left an impact on me. Great movie!",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Adorei o filme, da pra ver que o Nolan dirigiu o filme com muito carinho, e soube dirigir um filme bem diferente do que j√° tinha dirigido/roteirizado",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","O filme traz a hist√≥ria de J. Robert Oppenheimer, f√≠sico americano, l√≠der do Projeto Manhattan, que criou as bombas at√¥micas jogadas em Hiroshima e Nagasaki. O filme trata mais de um estudo da mente de Oppenheimer do que contar a sua hist√≥ria de maneira cronol√≥gica. Tanto que o filme se divide em 3 momentos que se sucedem na tela: a hist√≥ria do f√≠sico, quando ele decide estudar na Europa, sobre f√≠sica qu√¢ntica, passando pelo seu per√≠odo no Projeto Manhattan; a audi√™ncia de seguran√ßa para investig√°-lo e decidir se renovariam sua credencial de seguran√ßa e, por fim, uma audi√™ncia no Senado, onde Lewis Strauss, que foi presidente da Comiss√£o de Energia At√¥mica dos Estados Unidos quando Oppenheimer estava em Princeton, ap√≥s a guerra, est√° sendo sabatinado. Apesar de um in√≠cio confuso, logo a montagem, a fotografia e a passagem do tempo dos personagens, com as mudan√ßas f√≠sicas e de figurino, torna esta divis√£o mais compreens√≠vel. Detalhe: o √∫nico momento em que Oppenheimer n√£o est√° e que Strauss assume um protagonismo √© em preto e branco. Nos outros dois momentos, o filme √© colorido, sendo a cor mais brilhante na biografia de Oppenheimer e um pouco mais esmaecido na audi√™ncia da Comiss√£o. Nolan faz aqui o seu mais maduro, mesmo mantendo os seus maneirismos, como manipular a cronologia do seu personagem, como fez em outros filmes como Memento, Dunkirk, Inception e Tenet. Aqui o que lhe interessa √© o homem, n√£o o feito. Tanto que o lan√ßamento das bombas em Hiroshima e Nagasaki s√£o apenas faladas na tela, nem imagens s√£o mostradas. Por√©m os di√°logos que se referem √†s consequ√™ncias da bomba at√¥mica s√£o sentidos. Como o filme √© centrado em Oppenheimer, h√° um desfile de personagens na tela, muitas das pessoas importantes para o desenvolvimento da f√≠sica qu√¢ntica ou da constru√ß√£o de armamento b√©lico at√¥mico e nuclear, que n√£o s√£o desenvolvidas, sendo mais uma men√ß√£o de rodap√©. Praticamente apenas Lewis Strauss e Kitty Puening, esposa de Oppenheimer, possuem um arco ou uma cena para serem lembrados. Mas mesmo com esta quantidade de personagens, h√° um trabalho do roteiro para apresent√°-los e indicar a import√¢ncia deles. Por√©m, com um elenco estelar, √†s vezes d√° a impress√£o que muitos foram subutilizados. Cillian Murphy est√° muito bem no papel principal. Consegue passar toda a complexidade de Oppenheimer, passando por todas as fases da sua vida, do ""pai da bomba at√¥mica"" ao arrependido, que luta pelo controle do armamento nuclear, com todas as suas falhas e acertos. Downey Jr tem o seu momento no filme, como Emily Blunt, que tem a dif√≠cil tarefa de interpretar a esposa de Oppenheimer, uma figura que o filme n√£o apresenta de maneira simp√°tica. O resto do elenco cumpre a sua fun√ß√£o de ser o suporte para Oppenheimer brilhar. Com certeza, ao lado de Barbie, j√° √© um forte candidato ao Oscar, com chances em filme, diretor, roteiro, ator, trilha sonora, fotografia, figurino, dire√ß√£o de arte, efeitos visuais, ator coadjuvante e, possivelmente, atriz coadjuvante.",POSITIVE

"Jul 25, 2023","A really strong film! The only reason it's not 5/5 is the length. Although pacing was good and it didn't feel like a whole 3 hours, it did feel long in some places. It would slow down and I'd look at my watch with anguish realizing there's still another hour left. Acting was on point, but I do think there was characters and moments that could have been cut to make the movie more palatable and would not have impacted the story line whatsoever. Florence's acting was great, but her character, even based on true events, was not really necessary for this film and every seen with her apart from like one had her completely naked. Sex can be important in a movie but I didn't find theirs or her scenes really necessarily. Cillian Murphy was a knock out in his acting and Emily blunt as well! Overall a great movie",POSITIVE

"Jul 25, 2023","Here we witness CINEMA. Oppenheimer delivers in its 3 hours of film an incredible work of art. Cillian Murphy is genius here and delivers a dazzling performance alongside Robert Downey Jr. who was also fantastic in his role. Despite its long duration, the film remains connected and holds the viewer until the end. Vibrant scenes with an extremely well developed script. Christopher Nolan is not surprising here, he once again delivers an impeccable work worthy of applause. The soundtrack and sound editing are perfect and make you float while watching. Together they elevate the cinematic experience to its maximum. Emily Blunt delivers one of the best scenes in the film and gives a fantastic performance. Oppenheimer is the film that you go to the cinema expecting to like and leave completely in love and fascinated by what you have just witnessed in the theater.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","A three hour movie that doesn't feel like a three hour movie, it must be amazing, right? Right. This movie is nothing short of spectacular. Nolan crafted a film that is eye catching as expected. Despite the rather complex plot, the film is easy to follow and entertaining till the end.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Despite being mostly dialogue this movie was riveting for the full 3 hours,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",simplistic and too long; did not need to see repeated visions of director's thinking about Oppenheimer's thinking - would have made a much better film in animated format; shockingly flimsy and distorted one-dimensional portrayal of the women in a 2023 film. Alternatively a docu-drama which focused on the 'trial' would have been much more interesting and could have then left out the theatrically overused black and white format,NEGATIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","I found the movie hard to follow and very disjointed, the dialogue didn't help, often the mumbling meant key words were lost. I almost needed subtitles! The loud exploding noises were overdone.  I also felt the movie didn't capture the fear people felt at the time around the threat of communism.",NEUTRAL

The movie went on for three hours, but the great narration, quick scene changes and different narrative perspectives made the movie extremely entertaining and gripping.
Add to that the outstanding acting by Cillian Murphy. He brought us closer to the person Oppenheimer through his immersive interpretation and let us know his thoughts and feelings without having to express them. The rest of the prominent cast also gave a world-class performance. 
The film is definitely a contender for film of the year and gives us a lot to think about. Not an easy film for everyone, but an outstanding film for any film and/or history enthusiast. An absolute masterpiece that definitely makes it into my personal top 5.",POSITIVE

"Jul 25, 2023","Overhyped 

I stayed untill the 'nuclear' explosion, the shape of that explosion resembled the OG mushroom clouds, but that was still quite a disappointment. I was thinking of all the money that went into that fake nuclear bomb and couldn't help but think about things like conspicuous consumption and make-believe gone astray. There is something off-putting and disappointing about this movie and it reminds me of the new Napoleon movie. Both of these movies are fantasies, stories, about certain characters in history, but I just can't seem to connect with the hype. People want something from these movies that they're getting and I'm just missing it. 

Oppenheimer spends too much time on boring court proceedings, like, how many of the people that watch the movies would ever in a million years, have tuned in to a public hearing concerning this figure? Why is Pugh fucking Cillian while Blunt sits watching in horror? How will RDJ ever make a movie again without people thinking, that's RDJ over there pretending to be in character again like he did during his Marvel era. Oppie, as played by Cillian, is someone that the people want something to be. I, however, don't feel the need for the 'father of the atomic bomb', to be anything. I just wanted a good piece of entertainment from Nolan, but he couldn't deliver. 

It really says something about the fickleness of genius or craftsmanship and the preference of the crowds. I understand that a lot of work went into this movie, but a lot of work goes into a lot of movies; some of them just end up being disappointments. A lot of work went into this and I understand that a lot of work went well. The production and budget shines through. But the vista's are familiar and the authentic sets are expected. It's the feeling and the story that you want, someone to root for, someone to feel with. I can't root for anyone in this movie or really feel for anything in this movie. 

As a final sentence, I would like to commend Emily Blunt for her performance, she is captivating as Oppie's wife. Too bad she was relegated to just being Oppie's wife. I don't even remember her characters name.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 25, 2023","with Christopher Nolan directing you expect a visual martprice and he delivers the use of sounds to pull you into the film works amazingly well  with a stellar cast from cillian Murphy Matt Damon Florence Pugh Robert Downey Jr to name a few with other names from film and tv appearing thought-out with the story off a man that changed the world  the film takes you on a journey visually and emotionally cillian Murphy shines in the lead roll that showcases his acting skills on so many levels those off you who have watched cillian before will know what to look for .
when I left the cinema thinking of how to put what I had just witnessed into worlds I was lost for words it took a while for me to full understand what I had just watched and the scale off the film . the use of colour and black and white to depict subjective and objective works well Nolan uses IMAX as he believes it's the best form of recording and he says it's the closest recoding to what the eye sees 
this film will stand the test off time yes it's not action packed or is it full of CGI but Oppenheimer will hold it's own against any film before it or after it keep an eye out for the Oscars where this film will be in with a chance of taking home some little gold statues",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","This movie is excellent if you know what to expect. As someone who knows enough about the Manhattan Project and has a baseline knowledge of modern physics, I really enjoyed seeing it come to life, and the acting along with much of the visuals throughout the film was spectacular. This is not a film about the bomb though as much as it is the man behind the bomb. It is morally gray, intentionally so at points and I think that helped to enhance much of the film and make it rather thoughtful compared to much of modern cinema. If you are expecting it to be thrilling with many explosions you will likely be disappointed. Yet if you are expecting thoughtful character analysis and excellently timed dialogue and cinematography, you will likely enjoy it. Only things that knocked it down a star and a half is the few unnecessary nude scenes and the placing of the Trinity test just didn't feel quite right because the movie seems to climax with an hour left in the run time. Overall enjoyable for myself but likely not for everyone.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 25, 2023","Unbelievably haunting. Although Nolan omits some of the less obvious consequences of Oppenheimer's success (radiation, for instance), I walked away feeling different about living in a world where humans are capable of instantly destroying ourselves.

"Jul 25, 2023","Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer may be the most expertly crafted and intelligent movie I've seen in the past decade. The scope of the film was ambitious, but if there's anyone that can do it, it's Christopher Nolan. The visuals are almost all practical and it pays off, this movie is stunning to look at from the first frame to its last. The cinematography also plays a part in this. The cast, acting, and dialogue are all perfectly selected, acted, and written. Specifically, the acting from Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh are all phenomenal. The pacing is fantastic though once you get to the court scenes towards the end of the movie it can drag a little, but it's nothing drastic The message of the movie being ""just because you can do something doesn't always mean you should"" is perfect for Robert Oppenheimer's story. The movie is great in IMAX just like Nolan promised, though I don't believe it is necessary to get the full experience of the movie like he said. The reality is, I don't see any obvious negatives to this film so this is a rare 10 out of 10 movie for me, and I hope everyone gets to go see it.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","Cinematic masterpiece. A lot of the film is clearly missed on people of... lower intelligence levels, which shows by all the bad reviews and those calling it boring. 
Just be honest and say you had no idea what was happening during the majority of it because you lack the brain power to follow along. Simple. 
Other than the completely unnecessary sex & nudity that added absolutely nothing to the story, it was a superb watch.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","I feel guilty about the boredom I experienced watching Oppenheimer. I rarely find myself checking my watch during a screening, but with this one I did, several times. If you experienced the same and  afraid to talk about it - take courage, you're not alone.     

Oppenheimer is an important, yet deceptive movie : the combination of its star-studded cast and Christopher Nolan's action movie credentials, raise the expectation for an action-studded visual feast - which, infuriatingly, never materializes. 

I understand that the focus of the film is on Oppenheimer's emotional torment, and the politics, trials and tribulations surrounding his character. In that context, all the characters in the cast offer fantastic performances (my favourites being Gary Oldman's Harry Truman, Matt Damon's LtG Leslie Groves, and Emily Blunt's Kitty). It is also fascinating to see a glimpse of so many important scientific characters from the era (Einstein, Bohr, Heisenberg et.al.) 

But before committing to those 3 hours in a movie theatre, you need to know this : If you expect to see scenes from the horrific Pacific campaign, or visual references to the tenacity of the Japanese resistance which led to the difficult decision to go ahead with the atomic bombings - there's none. If you look forward to parallel visuals from the Nazi and Soviet programs - nope. If you expect to see an Enola Gay scene, or a Hiroshima or Nagasaki scene - no. None of these possibly breath-taking visual components that could make Oppenheimer a gripping thriller are there, so much of the film becomes about men in blazers and knitted vests engaging in complex debates in classrooms, auditoriums, public, or private hearings. The very topic of the witch-hunt against Oppenheimer, which feels like it's half of the movie time, takes place inside a tiny room cramped with suits. My understanding is that Nolan wanted to make this movie totally analog (ie his non-cgi atomic explosion), but honestly, there's less action than Dunkirk here, and it doesn't work as well. Nolan did allow extra cgi in his movie but - only to cover up certain nude scenes for particular audiences, so here's another quantum paradox for you.                                       

All in all, this is a fantastic movie with great performances - which however doesn't justify its big screen movie theatre price and hype. It's an important film you can easily enjoy from the comfort of your home TV screen.",NEUTRAL

It is dialogue heavy, but the dialogue does not feel inconsequential, and it asks of us reflection on boundaries, power, and war. However, if one is not a fan of physics and/or history, the viewing experience might not be the same as the one I had.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Since it was a thinking persons movie I love the fact that he provided multiple bits of the story with two separate scenes going back and fourth.  Excellent idea to keep the audience invested since it was a long movie. Actors must really worship Nolan for them to take the less than roles that they are use to and the only negative is that he underused Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh but overall a 9.5 out of 10.  Best movie of this year easily!!,POSITIVE

"Jul 25, 2023","I am a major fan of Christopher Nolan but this is by far and away his worst movie. It's pretentious to the point of boredom; my partner and myself took turns in sleeping through it - a combined nap of 2 hours. Emily Blunt is badly cast, unable to portray unhinged - Cillian Murphy is Cillian Murphy with a relatively good American Accent - the only light is Florence Pugh, an incredible talent who does not get enough screen time.

"Jul 25, 2023","Dude.  This was like a 3 hour long orgasam.  Chris Nolan‚Äôs best movie hands down imo.  I feel like he has built up this reputation the past couple of years as this director who uses this one huge insane practical stunt, and the whole movie is just building up anticipation to that.  But holy shit, the story telling, the cinematography, the f*****g acting.  As a director, I think the most important thing is the ability to bring out the best in your actors through their performances and he accomplished that with every single one.  Specifically Emily Blunt and Rami Maleek.  Jesus, I could go on and on but that was the best movie I have seen in theaters since Monsters Inc, which was the first movie I remember seeing in theaters.  Must see in Dolby Cinema or IMAX 70mm if you can.",POSITIVE

I am becoming less and less of a Nolan fan with each release. I don't care for his jump-cut story telling and definitely am not a fan of his sound design. 
After about the first 45 minutes of this film every other word sounded like Charlie Brown's teacher‚Ä¶Blah‚Ä¶Blah‚Ä¶Blah. It was a three hour film mansplaining that the military is bad and that people in politics are shady‚Ä¶Really??? No duh. He could have cut out two hours of the movie and still told the story.

"Jul 25, 2023","Some great acting and storytelling here, but the length dragged it down. Much fidgeting in the audience after the 2.25-hour mark. And the female characters are woefully marginalized.

That old male gaze approach to filmmaking must be a hard habit to break.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 25, 2023","Oppenheimer is a magnificent beast of a film. A towering achievement. A film of epic scope and importance. No one currently working can make films like Christopher Nolan. He can manage films of huge scale but also capture human frailties. This might just be his finest film. The film tells the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a theoretical physicist known as the ‚Äòfather of the atomic bomb'. There are three basic strands in the film. A security clearance hearing after WW2, a senate confirmation hearing involving a nemesis and the story of his life from university in Europe eventually leading to Oppenheimer leading the Manhattan Project in New Mexico. The latter is the heart of the film, with the Project successfully building the atomic bomb. With Germany surrendering it was eventually used on Japan in 1945 with obvious devastating effect. The film expertly displays the brilliant mind of Oppenheimer and his human flaws. It shows his scientific hunger but also the political quagmire of the times. His conflict with ending the war but also at enormous cost. It's a film that is huge thematically. Themes of human endeavour, conscience, ethics and morality. It probes and questions in an exacting way. For a three hour film I found it extremely gripping. It's muscular, dynamic and emotionally intimate. Technically grand, it boasts incredible cinematography, score and sound design. Writing and acting is faultless. Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer is the performance of a lifetime. It's a very deep cast, with Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr and Benny Safdie especially good. There are many indelible scenes, with the Trinity Test possibly the standout scene. It glides from scene to scene with impressive momentum, giving myself a truly unforgettable experience.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Snoozefest and completely gratuitous sex scenes.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","This movie is incredible. The camera work, the score, the acting, etc, everything was perfect. I had my doughts about seeing a film like this in Imax, as it isn't sci-fi or action, but it was worth it. If you like great acting, great camerawork, great sound design, with added interest in politics and science, this piece of art is for you.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","At 94% I've got to see it. Must be amazing. I'm sorry but I left half way through. It was so difficult to watch! Background music extra loud over very hard to understand mumbling dialogue. This was a powerful movie but not the sort of movie I like to see in terms of entertainment. Sorry, not for me!",NEGATIVE

"Jul 25, 2023","Oppenheimer
And the Oscar for best picture, actor, supporting, cinematography, director, ALL OF IT. Oppenheimer. A true masterpiece. MASTERPIECE. The direction is incredible, and the soundtrack is hauntingly beautiful. Cillian Murphy's gives us one of the greatest performances to ever grace the screen. The story, based on real history and real people, delivers the story of Oppenheimer and what he went through to create the atom bomb masterfully. The way the timelines are cut in this movie is also done masterfully. Past and present are cut and blend into each other seamlessly. The psychological affects on Oppenheimer, from creating this atom bomb, is showed so explicitly. The ins and outs of the politics, and the government are so incredibly detailed especially with the dialogue. You get that devastating feel of what the atom bomb felt like. A true masterpiece of a film everyone delivered on all angles.",POSITIVE

"Jul 25, 2023","I understand the point of the movie, but felt it was disjointed and included so many unnecessary storylines that didn't seem to have an impact on the story. We never really get to know what Oppenheimer himself really thought, and it was really just a vendetta story that seems minor compared to the bomb he created.  This is one that had all the elements and talent to be great, but just isn't.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","I saw Oppenheimer tonight. It blew my mind, pun intended. The acting was superb, the score fantastic. So very good. I was so glad that they didn't glorify the bomb or war. The moral quandaries Oppenheimer faced were so well explored. 
My one criticism is regarding the nudity. There were only two major female roles in this film and one of them was unnecessarily naked several times and/or performing sex acts. It seemed to be more for titillation than to advance the story - especially since Murphy is kept fairly covered during those scenes. Pugh is such a phenomenal actress. It felt wrong to use her in this manner. I can't wait for the media to stop using women for gratuitous sex scenes. But besides that one major criticism, I did really enjoy the movie. It's refreshing to see a major blockbuster that doesn't revolve around super heroes.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","The movie was great. No need for what I thought was gratuitous nudity, but otherwise a complex and thought-provoking film. Regardless of your political perspective, the movie reveals the danger of manufactured outrage intended to stifle contrarian opinions. Lots of themes. Well executed. Should win lots of awards.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Slow Burn but so worth it. One of  Nolan's best!!! Love that there is no CG! I will watch again,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","I came in already with a good understanding of the history and international relations implications of the Manhattan project. Understandably, the film is named Oppenheimer, and is more about him and his life, than the bombs themselves and their effects. The historical figures were complex people, and the actors did a fantastic job in their roles. Cillian Murphy really blew me away *pun intended*. HOWEVER, it was a difficult watch for me. By the end of the film, it really hit me, ""Why should we care about Oppenheimer the man?"". The only redeeming qualities are that he was a brilliant scientist, but other than that? The ego, the cheating? At the end of the day, other than what he helped to create, why, should we care about this one man? That's how I felt by the end of the movie. A great true story, beautiful cinematography, and fantastic acting, but not a movie for me",NEUTRAL

"Jul 25, 2023","As a fourth year History major, I loved that a man was shown for what he was, a man. We often think of Oppenheimer as just this scientist, but his life had more than just bomb building and this movie does a good job of showing the other major aspects of Oppenheimer's life.",POSITIVE

"Jul 25, 2023","Oppenheimer Review (that absolutely nobody asked for):

Acting 10/10
Directing 8/10
Script 3/10
Pacing 8/10
Structure 4/10
Emotion 3/10
Story 2/10

Wonderfully acted out piece of propaganda.

Matt Damon & Benny Safdie really stood out to me amongst the all star cast. Stellar performances.

Cillian Murphy was hypnotizing to watch as always.

RDJ will almost certainly get an Oscar nod.

The talent in front and behind the screen did a fantastic job of drawing in the audience, I was on the edge of my seat half the movie!

How did almost no other character in this entire film have any sort of negative feelings about the bombs dropping in Hiroshima & Nagasaki whatsoever, except for Oppenheimer. Nobody blinked an eye when they mentioned Pearl Harbor, and when news hit that Hitler invaded Poland all they said was ""You've been upstaged."" No emotion. Pathetically unrealistic. 

David Kromholtz had one of the only characters who felt true this whole movie. 

The movie painted Oppenheimer out as a martyr, and Truman (Gary Oldman) as the button man, which is just historically wrong. They literally brought Oldman in just to sell the biggest lie of the whole film. 

""It wasn't you, it was me.""

Not a single mention of his occult involvement nor his influence and decision to drop those bombs.

Lastly, because of what this movie both opened and closed with, the black & white narration of the film, it would seem be more pertinent to title this film: 
The Hearing of Levi Strauss or something similar.

A few masterful scenes cannot make up for this intentional catastrophe. Very disappointing.

6/10",NEUTRAL
"Jul 25, 2023","""Oppenheimer "" was a powerful and important movie that impacted me. The brilliant cast, including Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr.'s exceptional performances, added depth and intensity to the truly captivating film. The masterful direction, evident in every frame, was very Nolan-esque, which I appreciated as a fan of Christopher Nolan's work. The engaging storyline and brilliant score further enhanced the overall experience, pulling me deeper into the complex narrative.

One thing worth noting is that the film's length may concern some viewers, but it allowed for a thorough exploration of the historical events and the character development. It truly felt like a comprehensive and immersive journey into the world of Oppenheimer and the development of the atomic bomb.

I wish Oppenheimer could reach a wider audience, as the subject matter and execution deserve broader recognition. This movie has the potential to educate and provoke meaningful discussions, and it's a story that should be shared with as many people as possible.

Oppenheimer is a must-watch for those who appreciate thought-provoking cinema and historical dramas.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",Oppenheimer was fantastic. I heard Cillian Murphy worked extremely hard during production and it shows he was amazing. I know a lot of people have been weary about the 3 hours but it went by super fast. I highly recommend going to see this if you are into history or science.,POSITIVE

"Jul 25, 2023","So I'm doing my masters in astrophysics and this movie from a more scientific pov was incredible. Cillians acting really captured the essence of university as a student and what is perceived as a student from their lecturer. His passion for science slowly being tainted by what the consequences would be from his creation is shown so well and the general acting from everyone was spot on. The real MVP is his wife though and her part as well as RDJ were amazing.

The whole intro was phenomenal and was just so enjoyable. The bomb drop made you feel scared and uneasy and nervous almost shaking all the way up to the bomb drop. The bad I'm going to start with pacing it was a bit of a struggle to have a big lead up to the bomb and get u ready all for it to go calm and back to high energy. The bigger thing was just being able to understand it all the film went fast but not always in a bad way. Now what Christopher Nolan did best was making super complicated science understandable to the average person. Oppenheimer is definitely better than it's competitor Barbie.

"Jul 25, 2023","Oppenheimer is a technically spectacular film, brilliant at telling the physicist's troubled life. The experience of entering the deepest layer of the protagonist's subconscious is something surreal, but shocking.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023","""I'm not really a movie reviewer or know exactly what to say, but I'll give it a go. First off, I thought the movie was amazing. Cillian Murphy was incredible; he really embodied the character of J. Robert Oppenheimer and sucked you right into the movie. It was amazing to see it in IMAX; you could truly feel the emotions of the characters. The music was insanely beautiful and intense, evoking feelings of fear, anxiety, and sadness. I thought it was brilliant.

I felt really emotional watching the movie, especially considering the times we are in now. Oppenheimer and other physicists definitely created a new world that changed history forever. Robert Oppenheimer was an incredible physicist, and his leadership and contributions to the development of the atomic bomb had a profound impact on warfare and geopolitics.

Cillian portrayed Oppenheimer's internal conflicts after the success of the project so well; it was incredible to watch. His performance felt raw and real, evoking sadness for Robert as I'm sure it wasn't easy for him, particularly after President Truman dropped those bombs on Japan. Moreover, the way Robert was treated by the United States government was quite sad and despicable, in my opinion. It's disheartening how a country could turn its back on a man who dedicated many years of his life to the Manhattan Project, which was initially meant for good, although I believe he later regretted it. I hope he found some peace in knowing that if it wasn't him, it would have eventually been someone else to create the first atomic bomb.

In conclusion, Cillian Murphy's ability to convey emotions with a mere glance or a slight change in expression sets him apart as an actor of remarkable skill and control. His dedication and commitment to delivering exceptional performances that leave a lasting impact are evident in this role as J. Robert Oppenheimer. I hope he wins many awards for his exceptional and stunning performance.

Emily was incredible in this movie; she gave an outstanding performance. Blunt's on-screen presence is captivating, drawing you into the character's life and emotions effortlessly. Her portrayal of Katherine Oppenheimer, the wife of Robert, was versatile and emotionally charged. Moving to the middle of nowhere with a child and dealing with Robert's affair throughout their marriage couldn't have been easy for her. Emily's performance built up brilliantly; it felt real, raw, and emotional.

I did feel for Katherine, and I could truly sense the emotions in the movie. Emily's ability to communicate emotions without relying on dialogue was remarkable, making the character and the film all the more impactful. Her commitment to her roles and her willingness to take on challenging and diverse projects have solidified her position as one of the best actors of our time. I hope she wins many awards for her role in this movie.

I also want to shout out Robert Downey Jr; he was incredible in this movie. What an amazing actor and human being. I hope he wins some awards for his role as well. While I won't deep dive into every character in the movie, I must mention Florence Pugh, who also gave an outstanding performance. Her willingness to be vulnerable and real was astonishing, displaying her ability to convey a wide range of emotions and navigate complex narratives. She is truly an amazing actor who deserves many awards and recognition.

So, would I rate this movie? Absolutely! You must go see it in the cinema; it's just incredible. It's the best movie I've seen in a long time. I give it a 10/10.""",POSITIVE

"Jul 24, 2023","This is peak Christopher Nolan cinema. Every part of the movie was beautifully shot, scored, and impactful. The sound mixing has also been resolved from previous Nolan films. This is one of the best performances by a lead actor I have ever seen, and it is truly an experience that will last with you long after viewing.",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023","This movie is truly a cinematic masterpiece. The storyline is very focussed on the creation of the atomic bomb and the Trinity test, rather than the WW2 context. Christopher Nolan's directing of this movie is excellent as he captures the scenes with utter detail and artistry. The ending is also leaves an important moral question as to whether the creation of the atomic bomb saved Americans from WWII or yielded a dangerous era of nuclear diplomacy. I really hope this movie gets the awards and recognition it deserves.",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023","This movie was the best movie of the year and the best Nolan has done. I didn't think a 3 hour character drama would be as exciting but this movie does it. Stunning visuals, amazing story, sound and music, editing and directing all come together and we have Nolan's masterpiece!",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023","This movie was astonishing. Everything about it was so meticulous. The acting, cinematography, music, writing, and directorial decisions are all amazing and deserve awards and praise. Most who have their reservations about the movie don't understand what it's trying to accomplish as its the story of Oppenheimer and from his perspective and it accomplishes that to a supreme level. I haven't been this invested in a movie like this one in a very long time. I can't wait to watch it again.",POSITIVE

"Jul 24, 2023","Filme muito bom, valeu apena cada segundo assistido",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023","Honestly the best biographies I have ever seen. The way they explained the story with black and white parts, back and forth between his past present and future self was so balanced and pleasing. The goosebumps I got every time there was those flashbacks of stars and energy moving around and the sound in the theatre was great compliment of the effects. The silence when the bomb went out and the aftermath were so chilling. When the plot twist came to an end and he was interrogated I could feel his pain and stress almost had a panic attack myself. So well portrayed. The feelings were just perfectly portrayed and relatable in a way.

The ending was the best and made me shed a tear with fears for the future.
It is crazy how this is real life and history and how well portrayed this movie was. Piece of art 20 out of 10 going to see again in IMAX in London.

Adults going to the Barbie movie is just a joke, this thing of Barbienheimer doesn't even need to be compared. Different movies and of course the art piece here is Oppenheimer. Best movie I have ever seen hands down.",POSITIVE

"Jul 24, 2023","This is an incredible film which leaves you with a strong emotional feeling. It accurately tells the story of Oppenheimer and as somebody who loves historical accuracy, this made me so happy (for example the poisoned apple and other small details are factually correct (not going to spoil the film!)). 

Cillian plays Oppenheimer beautifully, he analyses his posture and speech to portray Oppenheimer with such conviction. The star studded cast certainly doesn't fall short of expectations either‚Ä¶ I 100% recommend this film to anybody!",POSITIVE

"Jul 24, 2023","This was a lengthy movie. 3 hours long. There is a lot of dialogue and a lot of politics in this movie and less history of the atomic bomb. The atomic explosion in my opinion was all that great. There was no CGI involved, the historical videos were more spectacular with the mushroom cloud wrapping around the base and climbing high into the sky. Overall there was an all star cast and I loved the actors and actresses throughout the movie. There is sex in this movie, but it helps portray Oppenheimer as a womanizer so it might not be appropriate for younger kids.",POSITIVE

The cinematography is breathtaking, capturing the era's atmosphere with precision and beauty. The score complements the narrative perfectly, enhancing every scene's impact.

"Jul 24, 2023","Well, I've never said this before, Robert Downey Jr. Is awful in this movie, he should not have been cast and every scene with him in it pulls the viewer out of the story with him playing balding iron man, he's literally doing the same character and it really ruins the movie. The parts of the movie not involving him were fantastic, but he seriously is the anchor that drags the story down. I love RDJ, tropic thunder is one of my all time favorite comedies, but he's just giving a bad performance in this movie that I feels like he's playing a character, not acting as the human did. Baffling bad performance from him, other than that decent film, don't think you could pay me to rewatch it again.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 24, 2023",Unclear about the hype behind this movie.  Seems like trolling .  I think if anything it shines a light on how little americans learn about their own history.  People are stumbling onto this widely dispersed subject matter that has been written about and discussed for the last  50 years like it  is some kind of secret held by monks.   Nothing new to see here.  And pointless to think Imax add anything to the story.  Tooo Loud for what was happening onscreen.   if you like 12 angry men you'll love Oppenheimer,NEGATIVE
"Jul 24, 2023","No est√° nada mal, pero de ninguna manera me ha parecido la mejor pel√≠cula de Nolan.

It's interesting to see the history surrounding the making of the bomb, but the dialogue is artificial and all of the characters sound like essentially the same personality.

Keeps you on the edge of your seat even at 3 hours.  The soundtrack was awesome, acting top notch.   Mixes two different story lines of the making of the bomb and the investigation into Communist ties which was very entertaining.  Adds in some beautiful dreamlike sequences that give insight into the psyche of this very conflicted man.   Overall just a great film that you should definitely see in the theater.",POSITIVE

"Jul 24, 2023","I know a lot about the subject, having read the long book the movie is based on, having visited many of the sites in New Mexico, and even being on campus at Princeton's school of Advanced Study where the scenes with Einstein too place. And I think I've seen all of Christopher Nolan's films. Well, I think this film, despite its reviews and hype, is pretty much a stinker. I saw it in a regular theatre and since there was basically no special FX, I think IMAX would have been totally superfluous anyway. And despite my deep knowledge of the subject matter, I found the film boring, overly long, kind of disjointed, and as another reviewer said, we end up just not caring about the protagonist that much at all. And there was so much potential to make the film relevant for out time but it remains a failure. Do yourself a favour, save the big bucks and take out the book if you want to understand Oppie, and otherwise leave this to the dustbin of history and focus on Sam Altman the CEO of OpenAI who is the true flagbearer of the Oppenheim legacy. Yikes, too bad.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 24, 2023","Warning! This film is not for the casual movie-goer. This film is DENSE with historical Easter eggs and tiny details which will easily go over people's heads unless they already have an intermediate level understanding of the Manhattan project and Oppenheimer's life. This is largely to the films benefit however.
My only real complaint is that some of the parts that make this an R-rated film (namely the nudity) don't really need to be here and will likely prevent this film from being shown in academic settings where this film could really benefit from an in-depth study of the subject and time period.
If you're a history buff, this film is for you. If you're not a history buff, bring one with you to explain after and get a strong coffee to stay awake.",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023","Great acting and visually appealing. I trust that it's the most detailed depiction of Oppenheimer's story you can tell in 3,5 hours. 

But to be honest, a good movie needs emotion, it needs entertainment. I have not been in awe of his brilliance or his incredible achievement. I haven't felt deeply challenged about the decision to use the bomb or to create it. 

It falls flat witb the focus on politics.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 24, 2023",Literally perfection.,POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023","Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a visually stunning but deeply flawed film. The film tells the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the scientist who led the Manhattan Project to develop the atomic bomb.

On the one hand, Oppenheimer is a technical marvel. The film is shot in IMAX and Panavision, and the visuals are truly breathtaking. The film's depiction of the atomic bomb tests is particularly impressive.

On the other hand, Oppenheimer is a narrative mess. The film is overlong and slow-paced, and the story is told in a confusing and disjointed manner. The film also suffers from a lack of character development. Oppenheimer himself is a largely unsympathetic figure, and the other characters are little more than cardboard cutouts.

The film's biggest problem is its message. Oppenheimer is a film about the creation of the atomic bomb, but it never really grapples with the moral implications of this event. The film seems to suggest that Oppenheimer was a tragic figure who was caught up in events beyond his control, but this is a simplistic and unsatisfying interpretation of history.

Ultimately, Oppenheimer is a disappointing film. It's a film that has all the potential to be great, but it ultimately falls short. If you're looking for a film that will challenge you intellectually and emotionally, Oppenheimer is not the film for you.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 24, 2023","This film without a doubt had a dumbfounded effect on me in the cinema of a kind that I have not experienced before. Even with his catalogue of exceptional films to his name this is a career defining piece of work from Nolan. Cillian Murphy seismic portrayal of Oppenheimer makes it near impossible to not see him nominated for the academy awards  with R.Downey Jnr & Emily Blunt following with emphatic supporting roles, no doubt both tipped for a date with Oscars red carpet as well.
To put simply, this is one of the greatest pieces of cinema in the modern era and will no doubt only grow in stature as the years role by. A must see, and a must see on IMAX to really feel the force of the project you are about to witness. Exceptional, 10/10.",POSITIVE

I think this is going to be an icon of the nationalism. I wasn't there but I can hear the pluses in some scenes.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 24, 2023","It was ok overall.

For me I didn't like the way the music dominates the film and takes away from the scenes, similar to how it was for the Dark Knight Rises and Interstellar. I would put it up there with Christopher Nolan's ""not good"" pile of films.

"Jul 24, 2023","Absolutely fantastic experience. One of the best uses of frame size transitions I've seen in IMAX. Watched it in an omni theatre, full 180 degrees, and it was crazy.

For me, the story was laid out in a really impactful way. The use of black and white versus color to show different moments in time through the lens of relative space-time is great. There is a moment where you can notice that's what it's used for, if you're paying attention. Great use of sound and silence, and the performances from basically everyone was phenomenal.

Also, special effects were *chef's kiss* fantastic.

Definitely cannot recommend enough to try to see it in IMAX. The features it offers do make a difference on the impact of the film, very much affecting the tone and feeling of some contexts and scenes.",POSITIVE

"Jul 24, 2023","This movie was completely torture to watch. A drama that made me feel no empathy toward any of the characters, I left the theater feeling distanced from the whole story and asking myself why did Nolan think it would be a good idea to highlight Strauss' betrayal and downplay Oppenheimer's responsability in the catastrophes. This approach would have worked if he had humanized Oppenheimer properly and the attempted criticism wasn't so shallow but instead I was left with a pretty mild movie with a straight up dangerous US propaganda.

That's not even mentioning how badly paced it is and how shitty the actual explosion looked. Like, c'mon, congrats on not using cgi for it but I wish you did because the end result looks like an exaggerated bonfire, not an actual atomic bomb.

Also feel extremely angst towards seeing everyone saying how amazing it is and how good the cinematography is, dismissing people that didn't like it with ""You didn't understand it"", c'mon Karen it's a movie, it's not rocket science.

The imagery was straight-up LAZY, the majority of the scenes were headshots, and the ones that weren't did not have that great composition either. While it is true that the shots were extremely well executed on the technical aspect, it's not like they had mad loads of money and a competent crew that would be able to get those simpler shots pretty easily, right?",NEGATIVE

"Jul 24, 2023","Nolan dazzles again! Second best movie in his arsenal besides Dark Knight. The acting was all time especially Murphy and Downey. I‚Äôll be shocked if they don‚Äôt hear their names come Oscar night. The sound effects were top notch as well. The movie run time says 3 hours, but it only feels like one with how great it is. Call me crazy, but this is a top 30 movie ever. Don‚Äôt count out top 25‚Ä¶.",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023","Far too long. It's a really messed up mish mash of his life, and focusses on the bits of his life that were less important (before and after tha Manhtattan Project). Far too much focus on the Mccarthy era stuff, which really wasn't that interesting. Massive opportunity missed- actually quite a tiresome movie. Dialogue quite hard to follow at times- enunciation was often garbled. 

Far more fun to read the 'The making of the atomic bomb' by Richard Rhodes.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 24, 2023","Christopher Nolan yet again creates a masterpiece. There were so many Oscar worthy performances and Cillian Murphy blew me away! The whole movie was perfect from start to finish!

"Jul 24, 2023","Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" promised to be a compelling exploration of one of history's most significant figures. Unfortunately, the movie's audio mixing was nothing short of a disaster, significantly detracting from the overall viewing experience.

One of the primary issues that plagued the film was the imbalance between the score and the dialogue. With a film so heavily reliant on dialogue and conversation, one would expect the audio mixing to be finely tuned to ensure every word is crystal clear. However, the score overshadowed the dialogue, leaving viewers straining to catch important exchanges. The frustration caused between the score and dialogue was unbearable, making it difficult to concentrate on the story.

The explosion scene was yet another major letdown. With high expectations for a visual spectacle, viewers were instead treated to a lackluster display that paled in comparison to modern CGI standards. The prolonged silence during the scene, intended to build tension, only resulted in boredom and disengagement. Christopher Nolan's apparent aversion to embracing modern technology and referencing actual nuclear explosion footage was a missed opportunity that left me feeling cheated.

Despite these glaring flaws, the film did show promise during the scenes involving Oppenheimer's interactions with the panel assembled by Strauss. These moments of intense dialogue provided a glimpse of what the movie could have been, offering engaging exchanges that were unfortunately overshadowed by the pervasive audio issues.

It's disheartening to see a director of Nolan's caliber fail to address recurring problems in his films. The sound mixing has consistently been a sore point in his works, robbing audiences of the full emotional impact that skilled actors can deliver through their voices. It's perplexing that Nolan would disregard this vital aspect of filmmaking when he could easily have entrusted an audio engineer to handle the sound mixing.

The film's potential was further squandered by its non-linear plot and omission of pivotal historical events. A more straightforward narrative and showcasing the actual use of the atomic bombs in Japan could have brought a more impactful and cohesive experience. Instead, the movie took a disjointed approach that failed to effectively convey Oppenheimer's story.

In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" fell short of expectations due to its atrocious audio mixing, lackluster explosion scene, and questionable narrative choices. While some scenes managed to salvage the film to a degree, they were not enough to make up for the larger shortcomings. It's a shame to witness a director of Nolan's reputation fail to evolve and adapt, leaving audiences longing for a more competent approach from someone else at the helm.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 24, 2023","Christopher Nolan simply does not miss. Oppenheimer was one of my most anticipated movies of the year before seeing it in theaters. Through the first hour and a half, I was finding myself enjoying the quality of acting, but disappointed with how slow it felt. However, after roughly the first half, it picked up and never slowed up. The stand out performance to me was Robert Downey Jr. He was phenomenal in this and it seems like it could be the best performance of his that I have seen. Cillian Murphy was also exceptional and it would be surprising if both do not end up with Oscar nominations for their performances. Everybody else does a great job and I would likely say the same thing about the entire cast if they were in more of the movie. Matt Damon and Emily Blunt were incredible when they were on the screen. Overall, this movie is worth every dollar and more to see. 92/100",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023",It's one of the greatest movie from Christopher Nolan,POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023","I didn't expect from the movie what it showed me. I was expecting a straight-forward biographical story, which certainly wouldn't be like Christopher Nolan. Like all Nolan films, his films are a labyrinth that you have to get out of by the end of the film. And I came out of this labyrinth and I am ready to say that this film is not at all about the Great Scientist or about some kind of bombs. This film is about power and how this power wants to get into their hands such a force that can shoot them off the face of the earth and themselves. This story is about how stupid everyone is if they really think they can handle the power that appeared in their hands. And how much their pride overshadows their own mind, that they think that now they will be able to rule the world with the power that they cannot even understand. And we all know where it all ends up. In conclusion, I want to say that this film will receive a huge number of awards at the Oscars, especially the octators, especially Cillian Murphy.",POSITIVE

Still introducing new characters with 20 mins to go

Scene transitions were jarring particularly considering the color to black and white moments, which you were left to figure out on your own, and which were done already in memento

"Jul 24, 2023","Just saw ""Oppenheimer"" at the IMAX cinema at the Science museum in London.
It is one of the finest and most remarkable films I have ever seen and deserves to be seen on an IMAX screen, failing that at a Cinema.
The film at 3 hours simply whizzes by as you are  brought along the journey of J. Robert Oppenheimer, an American physicist who played a pivotal role in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II.
The film explores his inner demons, the scientific brilliance of his mind and the moral dilemmas he faced while working on the Manhattan Project.
The narrative, cinematography, story and supporting cast is simply out of this world.
Through stunning visuals and meticulous attention to detail, Nolan brings to life the scientific brilliance and emotional turmoil of Oppenheimer.
The film is Nolan's best to date.
It should win Best Film and Best Director at the Oscars as should Cilian Murphy and Robert Downey Junior. 
The acting they perform is the best to date on screen.
Unmissable, Exceptional. 2023 Film of the Year!",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023","Un-breaking news: Christopher Nolan has created another amazing masterpiece. If he still doesn't win the Best Director Oscar, I'll be fully convinced that the Academy Awards have a personal grudge against the man. This has to be one of the most compelling and thought-provoking biopics ever made! Once again, Nolan has shown himself to be the single greatest filmmaker of this generation. He's an absolute story-telling genius. Cillian Murphy was the perfect choice to play the title character and he simply knocked it out of the park. I can easily see this film getting at least 10 Oscar nominations. The use of visuals to help convey what Oppenheimer was feeling was nothing short of brilliant. The entire cast was fantastic as well, especially RDJ and Matt Damon. It's a very long movie obviously (180 minutes), but I was deeply invested in it from start to finish. But I feel like it'd be wise to add a disclaimer, particularly if you want to show the film to your kids. There are two highly inappropriate scenes that they absolutely must not see. Just make sure you watch the movie first before you show it to them so that you'll know when to block those scenes from their viewing. Those moments notwithstanding, Oppenheimer is far and away the best movie of the year so far.",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023",Saw Christopher Nolan's latest film Oppenheimer today. it was a blast! Literally. It is hard to say so much in a post like this. This film is just so tense.

The pacing is the best we've seen from Nolan, who in certain instances, has struggled with pacing before. The character building is great, every character has their own personality displayed perfectly. The acting is phenomenal, I definitely think RDJ or Cillian will pick up an Oscar as well as other members of the cast perhaps grabbing a few nominations. The score is perfect, the cinematography and visual/sound effects are the best I've ever seen seen/heard, I'd definitely recommend seeing this film on the big screen.

"Jul 24, 2023","Oppenheimer is probably Christopher Nolan's best work to date. It revolves around physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer and how he and his team of scientists designed and developed the atomic bomb. Brilliant performances from the ensemble cast led by Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon and Robert Downey Jr. It's a 3-hour movie, but the pacing is good enough to keep you watching.  I expected it to be around 90% worth of talking. The focus of the story kept shifting from Oppenheimer's and Strauss' POVs, thus changing from colored to black and white.  It also shows a lot of what transpired in court wherein they were trying to decide on whether  Oppenheimer should be removed from political influence. There's a lot of historical accuracy in this film, and it plays like a big-budget biopic. As you might expect, the highlight or climax of the movie would be the detonation of the atomic bomb when they first tested it. That scene was both breathtaking and horrifying. They did not really show the actual bombing of the Japanese cities, but instead showed how devastating it was through Oppenheimer's emotional musings.  It's a powerful moral study of how mankind can build and use a weapon of mass destruction powerful enough to wipe out thousands of lives, and what lessons can learned from this historical event.  It's a very powerful message that Nolan was able to convey dramatically on the silver screen. Technically, this movie is a marvelous achievement in film-making and story-telling, and I expect it to win some awards just like Spielberg's Schindler's List.",POSITIVE

There were some very good performances from Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr. and (at the very end) Emily Blunt plus Cillian Murphy in the lead.  The rest of the cast is stacked with many of the minor characters played by famous actors/actresses.  

With all of that said, it is hard to call this a great movie.  Its definitely long.  And I am not sure the storytelling style served it well.

"Jul 24, 2023","Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a towering achievement, a sweeping and complex biopic that captures the brilliance, the hubris, and the moral reckoning of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the man who helped develop the atomic bomb.

The film is beautifully shot in 70mm, with stunning visuals that bring the Manhattan Project to life. The performances are all top-notch, with Cillian Murphy giving a tour-de-force performance as Oppenheimer. Robert Downey Jr., Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, and Kenneth Branagh are all excellent in supporting roles.

Nolan's direction is masterful, as he weaves together a complex story with a deft hand. The film is long, but it never feels slow or boring. Nolan keeps the audience engaged with his trademark visual style and his keen eye for detail.

Oppenheimer is a film that will stay with you long after you've seen it. It's a powerful and thought-provoking film that raises important questions about the nature of power, the responsibility of scientists, and the dangers of nuclear weapons.

Here are some of the things I loved about the film:

* The performances: Cillian Murphy is simply outstanding as Oppenheimer. He captures the man's brilliance, his charisma, his guilt, and his inner turmoil with equal measure. Robert Downey Jr., Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, and Kenneth Branagh are all excellent in supporting roles.
* The visuals: The film is beautifully shot in 70mm, with stunning visuals that bring the Manhattan Project to life. The scenes of the atomic bomb tests are particularly harrowing.
* The story: The film is a complex and fascinating story that tells the tale of Oppenheimer's life, from his early days as a physicist to his role in the Manhattan Project to his later years as a man haunted by the consequences of his actions.
* The themes: The film explores some important themes, such as the nature of power, the responsibility of scientists, and the dangers of nuclear weapons. These themes are handled with intelligence and nuance.

Overall, Oppenheimer is a brilliant film that is sure to be remembered as one of Christopher Nolan's best. I highly recommend it.",POSITIVE

"Jul 24, 2023","Oppenheimer a Cinematic Masterpiece:

This biopic follows the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the proclaimed father of the atomic bomb. I went into the movie expecting much more WW2 action and the dropping of the bombs itself, but I was surprisingly refreshed with a movie that focused much more on Oppenheimer's life and relationships but still including Los Alamos and the building of the bomb and recruitment of scientists. The changing form the black and white scenes to the colored is amazingly done and easily conveys the time change. The concept of his story being told by him in the interview is very clever and well executed it makes the pace much faster and the ending o so more impactful. Lewis Strauss is one of my favorite characters in film and RDJ gives a breathtaking performance which is very refreshing after his long lasting role as Iron Man in the MCU. Cillian Murphy's portrayal of Oppenheimer is not to be looked over as he did a fantastic job and expect Murphey to be nominated for best actor at the oscars and RDJ for best supporting actor. The special effects in the movie are truly fantastic and it's unbelievable that it all was done practically, I also expect a nomination for best special effects. The musical scoring on the movie is very well done and Nolan is well none for this in his films but sometimes the dialogue gets a bit lost but I did not notice this as much, I also believe a music scoring nomination. The movie has really good pacing and does not feel 3 hours long but much shorter. This really lets you think about the consequences of our actions and what if it never happened would the world be better off or not? It kept me wondering all night. A round of applause must also be given to director Christopher Nolan as he made this masterpiece come alive. He deserves a best directed Oscar and also a best picture. My final rankings are:

"Jul 24, 2023","The film of the year!!! An epic thrilling biopic written and directed by the one and only Christopher Nolan, based on the 2005 biography American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, which chronicles the life of J Robert Oppenheimer, a theoretical physicist who was pivotal in developing the first nuclear weapons as part of the Manhattan Project, and thereby ushering in the Atomic Age. This is truly the definition of an outstanding movie that excels in every department, starting for its historical accuracy and an incredible and brilliant screenplay with a non-linear timeline alternating between 3 periods of time. The cast blows it out of the park, particularly the leading role of Cillian Murphy, for which he is guaranteed plenty of nominations. The ample supporting cast is also unbelievable and Robert Downey Jr. gives us un unrecognizable performance. The make-up is praiseworthy, the cinematography is groundbreaking with its use of different formats, including, for the first time in history, sections in IMAX black-and-white photography. The extensive use of practical effects and no use of CGI is also the work of a genius, the sound effects are mind-blowing and scary, and Ludwig G√∂ransson innovates with a haunting and thrilling score that perfectly accompanies every scene. It is an incredibly well told story that deepens on the persistence and the remorse of a person that helped create one of the most destructive weapons in history and tried to live with that fact, and the atomic bomb test scene will go down as one of the best in cinema. It is just one of Nolan's best achievements and the awards will soon start raining from the sky.",POSITIVE

"Jul 24, 2023","Spoilers...I am a big Christopher Nolan fan, and I love just about every actor and actress in this movie, that being said, what happened to the editor of this movie?  There cannot possibly be any more film left on the cutting room floor for a director's cut.  The final hour, filled with the backroom hearing for Oppenheimer's secutiry renual, whould have lasted about 15-20 minutes.  I was left wondering when, if ever, Nolan would sum this movie up with the inevitable theme.  When you arrive at Oppoenheimer's revelation at the end, the revisit of the conversation with Einstein, you are left to wonder why it took so long to get from the initial presentation of that scene and the revelation.  Sprinkled in were a few great scenes, including the scene in the hearing where Oppenheimer is describing his affair, and the visual of the acts that represent how he and his wife feel as these revelations are being presented.  I also like the recreation of the explosion building behind Oppenheimer in tense moments, but by the second time they did it later in the movie, it was overplayed and over-the-top.  I do hope most come away with the sense that this is not a patriotic movie.  This is an indictment of the United States Government and the casual nature with which warmongering is praised.  From the reason for the deslection of Kyoto, to the stand stomping pep rally post Enola Gay, the indictment of the non-scientists politicians is the clear message.  This movie is a Ode to scientists, which is fine.  Even General Grove's engineering degree brings him into the approved fold for Nolan.  I have no problem with any of that, and it is a conversation that needs to be said (to date the US is the only country to use atomic weapons).  I am not sure if Truman was as protrayed in the movie, but if so, he is even scarier than Patton in his fervor for blood.  There is a fantastic, 4-5 star blockbuster of a movie here if it were edited down to 2 hours, but at 3 it really needed some trimming and rework.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 24, 2023","It changed my life, my opinions and looks on the world it's a beautiful movie that changed everything. It makes the arsenal of weapons that every modern world leader has at their disposal. It gives you the thought of if anybody  that has access to these weapons could so easily end the world. This isn't a movie about war this is a movie about how easily the world can end as soon as somebody gets their hands on these weapons that changed the world forever as the movie proclaims. This isn't a war propaganda movie either this is a movie about the world and how easily it can end. Walking out the theater I was shocked to realize how much power the world leaders have. At any time including right now any of these world leaders could end the world. This movie gave atomic weapons and nuclear weapons the attention and the fear that they properly deserve. This movie brings fear and a sudden realization of just how much power these world leaders and anybody that has access to these weapons really have. ""You gave them the power to end themselves"" this line is impactful because of how true it is. Oppenheimer gave these world leaders the power to end themselves or to end this world as we know it. Oppenheimer is a movie that opened the eyes of viewers and audiences that needed the truth about nuclear warfare.",POSITIVE

"Jul 24, 2023","Firstly, this movie does not feel like a Nolan movie at all. If you had high expectations, thinking this was going to be like the other Nolan movies, you should lower it. After all, this is a biography into the life of Robert Oppenheimer, which was incredibly portrayed by Cillian Murphy. The movie has breathtaking visuals which must be viewed in an IMAX cinema as it was intended to. The performances put in by the co-stars are top-notch as well, in particular I really liked Emily Blunt's performance.
The down points of this movie were the stretched out scenes it had every once in a while, which got really noticeable in the 2nd half of the movie.

However, this is not much of a film for entertainment value but a sincere, serious even, character study of a man who was hounded by his own and the terrible weight of a guilt-ridden conscience. Mr. Nolan overestimates his audience often when underestimating the intelligence of the movie going public is the norm. I wish he had captured the aftermath of the Hiroshima & Nagasaki carnage (even as flashback of some sort) which Mr. Oppenheimer visited in the 60's. The pain, the regret & the fear pouring out of Cilian Murphy's large blue eyes at the end would've driven the point home to a degree that even the laziest layman would want to write to his/her legislators.",POSITIVE

"Jul 24, 2023","Oppenheimer ‚Äì 7/10

Saw this on opening day at a sold-out BFI iMax with James Acaster in attendance. Proper bombs of dread. 

Lots of anticipation for this one and I've long been curious as to how it justifies the 3-hour run time. I assumed that running that length would mean that we have multiple set pieces, but it really does just focus on the Trinity test. Hiroshima and Nagasaki happen off screen, and we instead focus on the Manhattan project and ‚Äòcourt room drama' that unfolds in the aftermath of the Trinity test.  

This is Christopher Nolan's JFK, with a healthy dose of The Social Network and a sprinkling of abstract imagery. I would have liked a bit more surrealism, but I guess Nolan would be well aware of what David Lynch achieved in Twin Peaks: The Return episode 8 so he keeps it restrained. It's more history lesson than blockbuster and I'm sure there are many people out there that expected a completely different film. The marketing made it look like it could be an action-packed race against time but it's much more academic and dialogue heavy. 

If you're interested in exploring Robert Oppenheimer's story in forensic detail, then this is the film for you. Just don't go expecting an all-encompassing retelling of the ending of the second world war.  

It's a very well-made film, but it's intense and a lot to take in. You must be in the right mood. I won't be in a rush to see it again and I certainly wouldn't be raving about it and recommending it to everyone. A slog, but an interesting and worthwhile slog. 

It will SWEEP at the Oscars.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 24, 2023","MISSION: BARBENHEIMER PART 2 OF 3!

In my review for Barbie, I mentioned that there was a standout winner, and that winner is undeniably Oppenheimer - a bonafide masterpiece.

This film impressed me on multiple levels, as it showcased exceptional production quality, outstanding performances, brilliant scoring, and impeccable cinematography.

Hoyte van Hoytema, the cinematographer, has now secured a place among my favourites, given the way he expertly captured each scene.

Ludwig Goransson's score was both breathtaking and cathartic, a stark contrast to his previous work which failed to impress me, particularly in Tenet where I disliked the score and sound design. However, in Oppenheimer, the execution of the score was flawless, with only two minor moments where the sound felt unnecessarily loud, although it didn't detract from the significance of those scenes. Despite this, I must admit that my ears felt numb and I experienced discomfort after the movie due to the volume.

As for the direction, Christopher Nolan once again showcased his talent, delivering amazing work. While Oppenheimer may be considered his best film by some, my personal favorite will always be Interstellar.

The film lived up to my expectations in terms of drama, blending court room drama with elements of science, politics, and relationships. The writing was exceptional, dispelling the notion that Nolan struggles with female characters. Although females aren't the central focus of the story, had they been, I have no doubt that he would have written them well.

Among my favourite moments were the captivating discussions on science and the stunning quantum visuals with roaring sound design as particles interacted. These scenes were simply incredible and left a lasting impression.

One of the most beautiful shots in the entire film was the black and white scene where Oppenheimer met Einstein, evoking a raw and real-life atmosphere reminiscent of shots from films like Andrei Rublev.

The acting was simply outstanding. Cillian Murphy, whom I previously considered somewhat overrated, surprised me with his depth and ability to convey emotions through his eyes. Emily Blunt was fantastic, and Robert Downey Jr. delivered his best performance to date. Any claims of overacting made by some movie critics, including those who supposedly attended film school, are simply ludicrous. Robert Downey Jr.'s performance was truly phenomenal, and there's no denying this fact.

I can't stress enough how much I enjoyed Oppenheimer, which instantly became my favourite movie of 2023 so far. It was a fantastic experience, and while it had a few flaws, such as unnecessary nudity and sex scenes, these did not overshadow its many other outstanding qualities.

To sum up, Oppenheimer is an impressive film that deserves the highest praise. It has set itself apart as the clear and decisive winner when compared to other movies, even overshadowing my previous anticipation for Barbie. This cinematic experience left me incredibly satisfied and thrilled, and I can't wait to see how it continues to resonate with audiences.",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023","The film is excellent, despite being considered long these days, the film is not tiring and was well crafted by Nolan. Oppenheimer has become one of my favorite films.",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023","Terribly disappointing, the director & writers had the cash, the stars, but no talent. The movie kept zooming forward & backward in time giving us motion sickness. The movie was more about a hearing to sully a reputation than the creation of the bomb. How does a scientist not know that sex creates a baby he has to raise? He pawns off the baby onto someone else like an unwanted chronic cancer while his kinda wife crawls into a bottle because the baby cried and this upset her to no end. Matt Damon is the only value in this film, his acting is superb & he looks darn sexy in a uniform. Finally this movie is about 2 hours too long as it constantly massages big egos with self important & psychotic personalities.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 24, 2023","I make this a must see if for nothing other than the scenes of the first nuclear explosion. There is a lot to really like about this movie, including the acting.

"Jul 24, 2023","Fantastic performances. Cillian deserves an Oscar. Great cinematography and score. Stellar casting. Gorgeous effects. Very effective portrayal of the frenetic pace of the Manhattan Project and the existential dread that comes along with the invention of these terrible weapons.

There are several flaws that are often present in Nolan's films. Swelling score drowning out important dialogue. Artificially fast-paced and complex dialogue filled with smug jargon. Unnecessarily complicated plots. The latter two are especially, unforgivably egregious in Oppenheimer without Nolan's well-shot action scenes to distract from them.

There is no reason to be jumping between different timelines, there is no reason for so many characters, and there is no reason for Strauss' plot to be actually portrayed on screen rather than just alluded to. This is an 8/10 film dragged down to a 6/10 because Nolan thinks he's too clever for us mere mortals and is determined to shove a miniseries' worth of content into a theatrical film. I never say this about Nolan films but there really is no reason to see Oppenheimer in IMAX. It's 95% people talking to each other.

I have long suspected that Nolan would be better served by making big-budget miniseries and Oppenheimer confirms that.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 24, 2023","Well acted and some really good historical information is why this film should be seen....but only once. The 3-hour timeframe is a problem and the constant time-swapping, to me, was a bit annoying. The movie is mostly about Oppenheimer's ties to members of the Communist Party in the US, including a sexual relationship with one of the female members. They do show what went on with the Los Alamos project but make no mistake, it is about the government looking to either grant or deny his security clearance. Good movie to see....once.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 24, 2023","Bing a fan of Christopher Nolan's work I had high expectations for ""Oppenheimer"".   While this excellent movie did live up to those expectations for me, that does not mean the movie is flawless.   Let's start with the obvious.  Cillian Murphy is nothing short of excellent as the title character.  He commands the screen in every scene he is in.  Murphy is helped by a terrific supporting cast.   Matt Damon is very impressive as Manhattan Project Director Lieutenant General Leslie Groves.  Robert Downey, Jr. does well as Lewis Strauss, but there are times when he overacts a bit especially towards the end of the film when he Senate confirmation hearings are taking place.  That was something I did not particularly care for.  I also think the movie's events could have been presented in a more linear fashion.  The jumping back and forth between events of the story was a minor distraction.  It does not hurt the movie overall, but it is a problem (Albeit a small one in my opinion.).  Despite these minor flaws, I was never bored by the movie an was hooked from start to finish.  ""Oppenheimer"" is definitely worth seeing in my opinion.  I recommend you do.",POSITIVE

"Jul 24, 2023","Oppenheimer is another biopic about a historical figure that you may or may not know anything about. The film was beautifully made and to me it's apparent that the production quality of the film was the most captivating aspect of the viewing experience. Cillian Murphy delivers a potent acting experience among a sea of a who's who of actors. This film is quite dialogue heavy, and it can be easy to zone out. You won't have a brilliant display of colors and set pieces to keep you entertained during long conversations. This movie does not pass the Bechdel Test if that matters to you. This is not a movie that I would recommend for general audience viewing. Viewers with an interest in history, filmmaking, or a Nolan fan will  find it worth it to see this movie in a good IMAX theatre. Any others may fi it more enjoyable to view at home in a few months when the movie hits streaming services where they can pause for bathroom breaks.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 24, 2023","An absolutely extraordinary piece of cinema. While I have always had a deep appreciation and love for Christopher Nolan's work, this film goes above and beyond anything the man has done. Robert Oppenheimer's story is one of triumph and tragedy alike, and while Nolan's direction is brilliant, it is Cillian Murphy's believability and commitment to the gentle soul of Oppenheimer that gives the film its momentum. The film never leads you to believe that it is about the Trinity Test alone, instead it never loses focus on the physicist and the world around him. 

Oppenheimer's supporting cast is fantastic as well including Robert Downey Jr. who gives an absolutely florid performance as the doomed Lewis Strauss. While Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt provide the emotional depth of Oppenheimer's story, Matt Damon provides the structure and complexity of Oppenheimer's mission in New Mexico. I won't give away surprise appearances by many amazing actors, but it is (by far) one of best ensembles ever put to film.

The story itself is one of the most riveting and important stories of our time. The moral dilemmas, the cursed mind of a genius, and the utter heartbreak that is J. Robert Oppenheimer's story provides heart wrenching tension and complete devastation by its end. And in truth, it is the film of the year, and perhaps, the best film I have ever seen. 5/5",POSITIVE

"Jul 24, 2023","Telling the story of a larger-than-life individual truly calls for a larger-than-life film, and that's precisely what writer-director Christopher Nolan has come up with in his latest feature outing, handily the best work of his career. Nolan's three-hour opus about the life of Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), director of the Manhattan Project (and more commonly known as the Father of the Atomic Bomb), provides viewers with a comprehensive biography of this brilliant and thoughtful yet often-inscrutable and na√Øve physicist who took on a patently dangerous venture that left him morally conflicted about the nature of his creation. The story, which spans several decades of the scientist's life, chronicles his development of ""the gadget"" and the fallout he suffered as a consequence of his left-wing political leanings and his efforts to keep the released nuclear genie from getting out of control. The film is admittedly a little overlong and probably could have used some editing in the opening and final hour, but, in the interest of telling the whole story of Oppenheimer's odyssey, its length is understandable (and, consequently, justifiable). The picture's production values are all top shelf, especially its brilliant cinematography, stirring original score and superb sound quality, an element that truly leaves audiences with a bona fide visceral experience. Moreover, the narrative is skillfully and eloquently brought to life by this offering's outstanding ensemble cast, including Murphy, Matt Damon, Tom Conti, Benny Safdie, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Gary Oldman, Rami Malek, and, especially, Robert Downey Jr., who delivers a stellar, award-worthy supporting performance showing acting chops that I never knew he possessed. ""Oppenheimer"" is easily the best film of the summer movie season, if not all of 2023 thus far. It packs a potent punch and delivers a message that we can all never hear too often, poignantly reminding us all of the importance of not falling prey to the same Promethean burden that Oppenheimer was forced to shoulder.",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023",Might be Christopher Nolan's best movie,POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023","Upon watching this film for a second time, I understand a lot more now. Initially, after my first viewing, I was upset that the physical construction of the bomb was skimped over, and the aftermath of Nagasaki and Hiroshima was not shown. However, now that I have seen  Oppenheimer a second time I understand why both elements were excluded. This film was not about the chemists and engineers who physically constructed the bomb but more so about the physicists and theorists behind the construction of the chemical reaction exhibited from the bomb. That is why the construction was not shown. Oppenheimer did not play a role in the construction of the bomb and instead played a role in the creation of the equations behind the reaction of the bomb. He conjured up the equations that eventually became the bomb. As for the aftermath of Nagasaki and Hiroshima, the wreckage was shown minimally to leave the viewer thinking of the mass destruction it caused as well as the mass destruction a future bomb and a potentially bigger future bomb might cause. Overall, a beautiful film. Oppenheimer is adequately portrayed as the hero, genius, hypocrite, and enemy all in one film. Absolutely phenomenally terrifying and brilliant film. Most of Nolan's films require a level of deep thinking and analyzation, such as, Memento and Inception. You would not think that a film of historical fiction would require an instance of deep thought/analysis. But it did. It did.",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023","As a general fan of Nolan films, this one is being hilariously overhyped. The acting absolutely carries this movie in a way that only great acting telling an oddly interpreted story can. Between oppenheimer's struggle with morality and the attempt at a twist ending with this strauss issues, the concepts of the movie are easy to see but the execution is sloppy at best. The soundtrack is distracting at best and annoying by the end of the movie. It just didn't fit like previous nolan movie soundtracks fit. It was built up in the wrong places for the wrong reasons and instead of it enhancing the emotional climaxes, it got in the way. Visually, the movie was stunning overall minus the ""need"" to separate the nonlinear timelines by designating one as black and white. The amount of expository dialog in the movie means you'll absolutely love it if you love reading wikipedia pages but I'm now thoroughly convinced that if you make a movie bright and loud enough, people will apparently love it even when it teeters on boring. (I only checked the time a couple of times during the movie). Also, the trope of a genius seeing things in a violently different way than the rest of humans was novel in A Beautiful Mind a couple of decades ago but played out with loud noises today. It's sad because I loved Interstellar and Inception even with the plot holes in both movies. Hopefully the next one is great.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 24, 2023","I went into this movie knowing nothing about Oppenheimer. I intentionally did no research prior to the movie because I wanted to see it with naivety.

Do yourself a favor and watch this in IMAX for the full experience like I did",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023","This movie is far more political thriller/red scare espionage than I expected, but these elements are every bit as intense as the parts where we see creation of the bomb.

Per usual Nolan, a lot of style for style sake going on here, but when the technical achievements become monotonous a sloppy beat pointed-in bold-script is revealed.  Don't believe the hype.  Nolan is a brilliant technician of a filmmaker who's yet to find a poetic semblance to his films.  For example when a poet takes epic material and merges it with the best cinemographic techique of its time the result is Berlolucci's The Last Emperor or more recently Malick's A Hidden Life.   Oppenheimer had this potential but sadly results in a feeling not too far off from a Ford truck commercial.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 24, 2023",No vowels and consonants to explain how damn bloody awesome Nolan is and the actors in this movie were all perfect. Movie of a generation,POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023","Look I love Christopher Nolan movies, and was really excited to see this but it was meh. Not up to par with his other work and it felt like he really really tried hard to stretch the movie out to three hours when it could've been an hour and half/two hours MAX. The story was lackluster for what it was made out to be",NEUTRAL
"Jul 24, 2023","Masterpiece!
5 oscars MINIMUM.",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023",Great movie. Lots of awards are going to come out of this.,POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023","If there is a time to be alive, it's right now.
If there is a movie to potentially change the way you question life in 3 hours, it's this one.
This movie without doubt will remain as one of the most outstanding craft to ever be created by none other than the man himself- Chris Nolan. 
A beautiful story, outstanding performances by the actors, the score was INSANE,
Definitely gonna watch it in IMAX again.
The team has seriously put in way to much effort for us to enjoy a cinema, and will go down as one of the most, prominent movie in movie history. Definitely worth watching with family and friends, and can be watched 10 times more and not get bored. A CINEMATIC MASTERPIECE !!!",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023",Truth bomb! One of the finest by Chris Nolan.,POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023","Hard to follow. Jumps all over like a frog in a pond. So many characters, you'll wonder who is who. I suggest researching Oppenheimer on Google to have a baseline understanding. Plus it's 3 hours. You might fall asleep if your chair reclines.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 24, 2023",One of the best films I have ever seen in a theater the dialogue is smart and the endings makes you think after the movie is done. A warm welcome with films today feeling dull and repetitive.,POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023",Goosebumps simply goosebumps,POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023",Cillian Murphy has to win an Oscar for best actor. He managed to masterfully convey in his performance the weight that Oppenheimer felt for being the man responsible for perhaps the extinction of humanity. What an incredible and convincing performance. Excellent film. Nollan gets it right.,POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023","While the movie was alittle too long for my taste, it was a good reminder that, historically, it is applicable to some of the events that are going on now in our world.  As a person that grew up in the 70's, I don't ever remember learning about Oppenheimer in any of my high school classes; such a shame because understanding historical events helps to give perspective to present events.
Well worth the time to see; I will see it again!",POSITIVE

The acting from top to bottom was really good . I feel their is too many actors and actresses to name but I enjoyed everyone .,POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023","It's a masterpiece. Running at breakneck speed, the narrative is a tapestry of interweaving timelines that feels natural thanks to brilliant editing. Characters are written with empathy and played to perfection by some of the greatest screen-actors of our time. The cinematography is breathtaking, the score stirring, the sound-design stunning. All in service of an epic story of a modern-day Prometheus who stole fire from the Gods and gifted it to mankind, only to be condemned to eternal torment.",POSITIVE

"Jul 24, 2023","This movie is not for everyone. To like it you really have to be into it visually. You have to have a passion for visual storytelling and appreciate performances, a curiosity to find out what happens, because this is a good FILM. Not a blockbuster. I want to say mote but another time. I loved it it's something fresh. I went to see it only because I like going to the cinema but I want to see something else than superhero movies, I wanted to see a film which is mot a sequal made for money, a reboot because no one seems to have any imagination to create something new or an adaptation because those are only made from an already existing source material that is being tarnished and disgraced by untalented people who think of themselves as the smartest than the original writer. Oppenheimer is a great ecranization of a historical event and I was surprised by how much I liked it judging by the fact that I went to watch it only because there wasn't anything good coming out",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023","I didn't know a lot about Oppenheimer story and this movie covered everything for me. Great story, great actors, great writing and powerful cinematography. Although it is really long, it blew my mind and is a movie to own.",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023","One of the best movies I've seen in a while.  If you're expecting 3 hours of bombs blowing up this isn't the movie for you.  The focus on the moral conflict vs the necessity to build the bomb to beat the Nazis and Soviets is told superbly.   And the politics of it all, especially in the aftermath of bombing Japan is just as if not more important.  I usually cringe at movies that are 3 hours but honestly it was warranted in this case and I never felt myself wondering when will just end already.  Definitely should be a top contender for best picture.",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023",Expecting one of the greatest movies of all time 1st hour very confusing boring second hour anticipation of a big spectacle which was flat and last hour snooze fest. No need for it to be a 3 hour film dragged far too long.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 24, 2023","Oppenheimer!! The cinematic genius of Nolan!! Its been 24 hours and I still haven't managed to break out of the completely suspended sense or sensibility induced by the stupor of being dragged into a whirlwind of thoughts‚Ä¶ The movie slows burns into the brain, and stays there ‚Ä¶. 

It , to me, was not the story of a scientist, or a bunch of them, not about the A- bomb or the H-bomb ‚Ä¶ it was so much more , it stirred questions on values, where to draw the line, how our world is being sucked into a uncontrolled vortex of ever increasing menace- to sanity, to existence .. and loneliness of each of us , as we live in silos of a make - believe technology driven world, turning a blind eye to it all!!

""We thought we might start a chain reaction that would destroy the entire world. I believe we did,"" - the pin drop silence of the packed movie theatre as the curtains dropped to these lines summed it all up‚Ä¶ everyone filed out of the theatre in silence‚Ä¶. shaken , shocked ‚Ä¶ 

This movie makes you retreat further inside you, into windowless rooms, till you and the emptiness are one ‚Ä¶",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023","This movie was incredible! Every actor in this film played an exceptional role even if they were in a scene for even 10 seconds. Cillian Murphy played the role of Robert Oppenheimer perfectly and so did every other actor. Robert Downey Jr. was one of the best supporting characters in a film I have ever seen. Matt Damon, Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh all deserve their flowers too. Christopher Nolan did an exceptional role when portraying the story of Manhattan Project. The explosion scene later on in the film was one of the best scenes I have ever seen in a movie. Oppenheimer is a 10/10 film and I would recommend seeing this movie if you can because its story was very well portrayed and tells you a lot about the first creation of the atomic bomb and the life of Robert Oppenheimer and the effects it had on his life. In my opinion this is Nolan's best film and I personally think this is one of the best movies of the year/decade. Every actor in this film had an Oscar worthy performance which makes you feel as if you were actually there. Nolan did an incredible job on telling the viewers the life of Oppenheimer and Cillian Murphy was amazing at portraying Oppenheimer. Truly an outstanding piece of film. This movie will get plenty of Oscar nominations.",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023","TMI is the first that comes to mind. The story is great, but the editing was abysmal. The acting was stellar, but the script was incoherent, storytelling at its worst. If the switch between black and white would have been used to clarify the timeline, it may have been useful. After his final conversation with Einstein is revealed, I questioned why we needed to go around the track that many times to get to the point. The editing is truly a tragedy.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 24, 2023",An visual and acting masterclass. Extremely dense and becomes a bit of a slog towards the end of the 3 hours. Definitely worth a watch at least once in your life.,POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023","There were things about this movie that I liked and others that I didn't. I thought the acting, sound, and first 2/3rds of the movie were great. I also felt like I could understand dialog a lot better than some recent Nolan films. My biggest complaint was that the movie was too long, and I felt like the last hour didn't really add much. The film could have been edited down to summarize the last chunk. Also there was some time jumping and twist setup that felt pretty unnecessary. I would enjoy an edited down version of this, but as is I don't think it's a must see.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 24, 2023","The film is packed with emotions, one of the best dialogues, the storyline, the acting, the direction, the cinematography everything every bit of it is an art and Christopher Nolan is the artist. Hats off to the VFX and CGI team for their work. You don't get attached to the screen immediately but you will eventually. The film takes its time which is the most beautiful aspect of it and when the work is done it shows the excellence of the director on the screen. Somehow every person in the hall stays focused and enjoys the film. For me it was a blast experience do tell me yours.",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023",A great Nolan movie. The acting was perfect. The music and cinematography were magnificent. The story of Oppenheimer was presented in the best way it could be.,POSITIVE

"Jul 24, 2023","Oppenheimer is exactly what film should be. Everything from the dialogue, cinematography, sound design, the score‚Ä¶ everything is nearly perfect; as perfect as I've ever seen a movie before. The editing is fast paced which doesn't leave you feeling like you're sitting there for three hours. I felt almost every emotion in this film. I felt intrigue, hope, amazement, joy, anger, and I left with a feeling of despair. As if the weight of the world was on top of me. The last lines of dialogue alone make it worth rewatching just to experience that feeling again. Just an A+ job to everyone who worked on this movie.",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023",Excellent film although it gets easy to get lost with all the dialogue in the final third. The kind where they mention a character's name but you forget which character they talk about.,POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023","Fui na inten√ß√£o de ver um filme de a√ß√£o ou algo do g√™nero e fui completamente absorvido por uma biografia incr√≠vel e completamente hipnotizante sobre quem foi oppenheimer, √© um filme que tem que prestar muita aten√ß√£o para n√£o se perder na linha do tempo ou nos personagens.

"Jul 24, 2023","A cinematic masterpiece! The use of sound is ingenious, the silence and the small noises before a literal explosion of sound is just riveting. Cillian Murphy truly transforms into each stage of Oppenheimer's life, you believe him as a college student and an old hard done by man. Robert Downey Jr. is almost unrecognisable, you just forget that it's him. A ridiculously stacked cast with Matthew Modine (The Good Place), Jack Quaid (The Boys), Josh Peck (Drake and Josh), David Krumholtz (10 Things I Hate About You), Tony Goldwyn (Scandal), Devon Bostick (Diary of a Wimpy Kid), Rami Malek (Bohemian Rhapsody), Dane DeHaan (Kill Your Darlings), Gary Oldman (Dracula, Leon, Fifth Element, Harry Potter), James D'Arcy (Agent Carter) and Sir Kenneth Branagh.",POSITIVE

"Jul 24, 2023",A really profound experience.  So glad I watched in the cinema. It is three hours long but it was completely engrossing!  Amazing visuals and a rivetting story.,POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023","People only like this movie because they think it makes them feel smart. Moreover, Nolan's direction, characterization, and subplot extensions were horrendous and incoherent, and the editing ruined what otherwise could have been a fantastic movie. It's a shame, because the acting was fantastic, but the editing totally ruined it and made it exhausting to watch. The real movie starts when they start constructing Los Alamos, and ends at the end of the a-bomb test. The movie before that was more like a trailer that didn't know what to do with itself, and had no hook for the audience to latch onto. The beginning also was super incoherent and the viewer doesn't even know what is at stake until halfway through the movie. The ending part of the movie is just a blatant McCarthyism romp to build up the twist with Einstein at the end, showing that the big bad politician finally gets what he deserves. It is not engaging in the slightest other than during the 2nd act. I would not recommend anyone waste their money to watch this movie. It is overblown hype. Go watch Barbie instead.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 24, 2023","Absolut amazing, in all aspects.",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023","Just masterpiece.
Nolan has done it again. The visuals, the music and the incredible talented cast. I'm not a big fun of the documentary genre but in this movie every second I couldn't get my eyes off the screen.
Watch Oppenheimer in imax.",POSITIVE

"Jul 24, 2023",What do I think? There are no words to describe this movie. You gotta see it for yourself.,POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023",Exceptional. Loved it,POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023","The film is obviously a towering success, as one comes to expect from Nolan, but it certainly isn't perfect. Oppenheimer was a deeply complex individual, with difficult personal relationships and a strained socialist existence in an increasingly communist-fearing nation. The film tries to present this nuanced complexity across such a long time period that I feel it struggles to be cohesive at points. Someone without any pre-existing idea of the Manhattan Project and the key figures involved might quickly become bewildered. A big part of me thinks that Oppenheimer would have worked better as a six-episode limited-run series, like Chernobyl. 

But onto its successes, of which there are many. The cast is stellar and testament to the recruitment power of a Nolan film these days. The writing refuses to shy away from topics that are difficult to convey - the notion of power, influence, politics and loyalty. But the elephant in the room remains guilt. How the greatest minds assembled in the most sinful arms-race, knowing only that their opponent would wield such power with horrible abandon. So pushed onwards to create the ultimate weapon - trusting that their government would use it responsibly - safe in the knowledge that the opponent would certainly not. It juxtaposes the obvious elation for scientific achievement with the sobering reality of what that achievement now unlocks. A single piece of ordinance capable of destruction comparable to what the sustained fire-bombing of Tokyo had achieved in May. 

It even covers the debate about whether Japan was nearly finished at the point Hiroshima and Nagasaki were bombed. The allied argument was that a land-invasion would have caused a million casualties so anything less than this was 'better', though alternative perspectives believed that Japan was nearing the end of the war. 

The lingering topic from the film (beyond guilt) was the tactical stand-off that such a weapon creates. A policy of mutually assured destruction creating an ever-lasting peace. But more than that, the psychology of creating an arms race and what that compels other nations to do.

A phenomenal piece of film-making, but perhaps not enough to rival Nolan's best work.",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023","Three hours of my life I won't get back. Learnt more about Oppenheimer by reading his Wikipedia entry.  Music too loud and much of dialogue was mumbled, rushed and unclear. No sense of time, place or history. No true feeling of being in the 1930s/40s except for the clothes.  I would not watch a movie by this director again. An interesting story not well told. Women very poorly portrayed and so many cliches.  Typical vacuous Hollywood movie.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 24, 2023",Edge of the seat‚Ä¶ exciting,POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023","Great film!!! Nolan brings the tense nature of this story to the screen. The score, the performances and vfx are top notch here.",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023","it was the best movie so far in 2023 (some movies were also great this year, but this one was just simply better), visuals also looked stunning. If you're too used to watching marvel or any other action movies, this movie might not be for you. It could be boring for some people but, if you're really into history, this movie is really good.",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023","It is an experience as the movie transitions it informs you how the character is developing same as the idea of what the whole context is about. A must watch because it has quality in everything, the cast did an amazing performance and it is just another world.",POSITIVE

All actors, script writers, directions, story flow, cinematography, set design, costume design, editor, all aspect of production.. everything is perfect. Thank you for the team! I left the movie theater with goosebumps and a lot of thoughts. Thank you Christopher Nolan, thank you!!",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023","Basically 2 hours and 55 minutes of dialogue, very anticlimactic in terms of representation of the atom bombs power in the way of visuals. Acting was great. Movie was far too long and missing so many key visual opportunities. I'm truly surprised at how highly reviewed this movie was.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 24, 2023","It's an exceptional piece of filmmaking! I have been a fan of Christopher Nolan since the Dark Knight came out. Oppenheimer is Chris Nolan‚Äòs best film he's ever made! It's all the more impressive that he did not use any CGI special fix green screen to shoot his movies! In Cillian Murphy is absolutely exceptional the best acting job he's ever done! Robert Downey Jr. is amazing he is actually acting again after taking 16 years off Criticism 
The pacing could have been  a little bit faster and 20 minutes here or there would not hurt  the movie.",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023","I hadn't been this excited to see a movie in years.  And the theater was as packed as I recollect a Star Wars movie being in my youth (I'm a young-ish 50 now!).  But I was let down.....by a trailer that set me up for a movie that was VERY different from what I ended up seeing on screen.  The trailer makes you believe Oppy will have an intense pacing and story build like Dunkirk or Dark Knight.  The sound design used in the trailer creates a sense of heightening emotional build up.  But the movie does not deliver on this.  It instead builds a story of Oppenheimer's life in a very different way.  And it's amazingly powerful, just not what I expected.  This is not a movie about a frenetic race to solve for quantum physics and construct a history and life altering bomb before the Nazis or Russians could.  That would have been an exciting, if not scary and sad, storyline....riveting and chilling all at once.  But ultimately this is not the focus of ""Oppenheimer.""  This historical and dramatic story plays second fiddle to a deep dive into the mind and heart and life of the man.....which is a hauntingly and vulnerablly well done portrayal by Murphy.  But go to this movie knowing this is not a Dunkirk story arc of intense drama building.  This is a delving into the story of a man whose brilliance suddenly found himself thrust into a life challenged by addressing nuclear threat alongside his own explosive personal dilemmas and life choices.  Go see Oppenheimer, without a doubt.  Enjoy the amazing direction, acting, editing, sound design and music and breathtaking cinematography.  But go knowing what kind of story you're going to see and your expectations will better align with the magic that will unfold before your eyes.  Oppenheimer is a human drama, rooted in history.....not an historical drama, rooted in human emotion.",POSITIVE

"Jul 24, 2023","Been waiting for a while for this movie. It's probably one of the best works of C Nolan, if not the best. I urge you all to see this masterpiece. The acting is exceptional, the script was truly well written and the whole movie was captivating all 3 hours.",POSITIVE

"Jul 24, 2023","Was a really great movie, but not nearly as ""life-changing"" or ""deep"" as people are sayin.",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023","The movie was a captivating experience for me. It beautifully portrayed the inner turmoil of Oppenheimer, who realized that his scientific breakthrough would not bring peace, but annihilation. The power struggles and the moral dilemmas that surrounded the project was told in such a way, that, going back and forth through timelines, even though you know the outcome, you feel like you are watching a mystery unfold. Againts the backdrop of the current geopolitical tensions and the nuclear threats we face today, Nolan's masterful recreation of the Trinity test really conveyed the gravity and the impact of that moment in the history of mankind. Took my breath away.",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023",Nolan's best work and that is saying something. Cillian Murphy was spectacular and put on a masterclass in acting in this already classic film. Nolan is able to get so much from lesser known/relevant actors is larger roles and using big notable actors in small near cameo level to perfection. By far the best movie of 2023 and I don't see anything topping it.,POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023","An absolute masterpiece. Christopher Nolan at its best.
The plot is constructed in such a brilliant way it keeps you focused on it minute after minutes despite the overall movie length of 3hrs.

"Jul 24, 2023","Shitty movie! Nolan unnecessary made a simple story complex just to sympathize with the destroyer of humanity - both Oppenheimer and President Truman. He deliberately skipped the parts where the bomb was actually dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the unforgettable tragedy thereafter, as that would've made people hate America and Oppenheimer and Truman, and he didn't want that. One should love his/her country of course, but one shouldn't go so far to justify its misdeeds for that love. It's like Germans justifying Hitler's acts. Extremely disappointed with the way Nolan presented the story. You CANNOT justify and ""celebrate"" using nuclear weapons on humans, especially civilians, the effects of which last over a century and then even seek ""sympathy"" for the perpetrator.

THE WORST EVER MOVIE OF NOLAN !",NEGATIVE

"Jul 24, 2023","Phenomenal acting and an especially spicy sort-of-deposition did not make up for 3 hours of dreary back and forth dialogue that always seemed right at the edge of getting something poignant across‚Ä¶ without ever doing so. I can see absolutely no reason why this is being hyped as an imax experience as 99.9999% of this movie is framed within the confines of traditional 1940's/1950's era homes or offices. The one or two minutes dedicated to the actual testing of the bomb, within a three hour movie made the whole notion of an imax experience seem pointless and misleading. At no time did I feel that a 70 meter screen improved this movie. Brilliant acting from every single actor, at every single junction highlights the importance of the directors overall ability to complete the work in a meaningful fashion, and Oppenheimer left me with a cramp in my leg, hypoxia in my ass, and a supreme desire to go home. 11/10 acting, 2/10 film. 3 hours of your life.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 24, 2023","Probably Nolan's best film yet. Phenomenal acting, amazing soundtrack, great sound effects. did not feel even close to a 3 hour movie and Cillian Murphy BETTER win best actor",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023",I spent my career and worked at the Hanford site that produced all the plutonium that would then be used in the Nagasaki bomb and have visited Los Alamos including the very Fuller Lodge used in the film.  With the exception of the analog explosion sequence that didn't seem to be similar to the nuclear physics that happen in large explosions--it was remarkable. Nolan does such a great job at incredible detail sticking to science and the real story.  Loved it!,POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023","Amazing!  I would be surprised if this movie doesn‚Äôt take home the Grammy for best film! It was great and even though it was 3 hours long, it didn‚Äôt seem like it at all.  It was that good! It‚Äôs been awhile since I‚Äôve seen a great movie and it‚Äôs about time!!",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023","Movie was ok but the constant background soundtrack was very annoying and unnecessary. It was a blessed relief when the bomb finally went off as we got a momentary respite from the din. Also, I am sure physicists in the 1930s and 1940s would not have spoken in monosyllabic, staccato, rapid-fire sentences - highly annoying. At least was out of the incessant rain for a few hours and missed the anti-climax of the cricket.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 24, 2023","Nolan took an otherwise good movie, and unnecessarily created this super weird whiplash affect. It's a 3 hour movie where the longest scene is probably 30 seconds. The majority of the scenes are a probably around  10 seconds long, and they seem to follow no logical order at all- by the time you even have a clue what's going on, it shifts to something completely different. It's like he created a playlist of all the scenes, put it on shuffle, and released it like that.

This is not a movie made for for regular people to enjoy. This is a movie that an ""artist"" made for himself, and his nichey little circle that doesn't care what anyone who actually made them rich thinks about their movies.

Good luck getting through this without an adderall prescription.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 24, 2023","I suppose more than the imax 70 mm, a bit of history and scientific context and interest is what is needed to enjoy this movie to its maximum potential. Oppenheimer is a brilliant movie marketed for the wrong things, I'm conflicted but leaning towards tagging this as the best movie I've ever seen. As someone who took an active interest in politics and history of that era, it was the first movie where 2 hours of dialogue could keep me on my toes and overwhelm me for the most of it.",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023","This movie was shot in IMAX...why? After the build-up of the nuclear test...there's nothing else to redeem this extremely dry movie.

"Jul 24, 2023","Director Christopher Nolan's latest creation, ""Oppenheimer,"" is an awe-inspiring cinematic masterpiece that dazzles audiences with its exceptional production values and masterful direction. From a technical standpoint, this movie undoubtedly deserves a resounding five-star rating. However, despite its captivating presentation, ""Oppenheimer"" disappoints in its approach to the pivotal historical event it depicts - the splitting of the atom.

Cinematic Excellence (‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê)
Nolan's exceptional talent in crafting visually stunning scenes and his ability to immerse the audience in a historical era are on full display in ""Oppenheimer."" The cinematography is breathtaking, capturing the essence of the 1940s and making the movie feel like a mesmerizing journey through time. The attention to detail in sets, costumes, and sound design contributes to an authentic and immersive experience.

Production and Directing (‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê)
The production quality of ""Oppenheimer"" is nothing short of exceptional. Nolan's direction is masterful, seamlessly weaving together the various elements to create a coherent and compelling narrative. The performances from the talented cast are top-notch, bringing life and depth to the characters. The pacing is well-balanced, keeping the audience engaged throughout the movie's runtime.

Missed Scientific Opportunity (‚≠ê‚≠ê)
Regrettably, despite its technical brilliance, ""Oppenheimer"" falls short in exploring the significant scientific aspects of the event it revolves around - the splitting of the atom. The movie touches upon the subject but ultimately fails to delve into the logic and complexities of the scientific process involved. The scientific breakthrough that changed the course of history is given only a cursory treatment, leaving the audience yearning for a deeper understanding of the events that unfolded.

The significance of the splitting of the atom in shaping the world we live in today cannot be overstated. It was a turning point in human history with far-reaching consequences in science, technology, and geopolitics. The missed opportunity to delve into the scientific intricacies behind this momentous event is a major drawback of the movie.

Conclusion:
""Oppenheimer"" is an enthralling cinematic experience, showcasing Christopher Nolan's brilliance as a director. The movie's technical aspects and production values are worthy of a perfect five-star rating. However, it is disappointing that the film sidesteps the chance to explore the fascinating science behind the splitting of the atom, which was a central and pivotal moment in history. As such, the movie falls short in providing the audience with a deeper understanding of the scientific brilliance that shaped the modern world. Despite this flaw, ""Oppenheimer"" remains a must-watch for cinephiles, history enthusiasts, and fans of Nolan's unique storytelling style.",NEUTRAL

The second half leading to the detonation of the bomb was riveting. NEGATIVES: The science wasn‚Äôt explained well. How stupid do they think the audience is? Some of us like science! The first half really dragged. There were too many characters. But worst of all, the film showed none of the real effects of what happens in a nuclear blast! Instead it had Oppenheimer telling his wife to take the sheets that were on clotheslines in. There were no photos of the aftermath of the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. No mention of all the scientists who got sick or died of cancer from radiation poisoning.  It only spoke of Russia getting the bomb, not all the countries that have it today. It failed to show how dangerous this technology is. It was a lost opportunity.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 24, 2023","Spoiler free Oppenheimer review...
In my mind I thought this was going to be an amazingly well executed dramatic movie about the man who led the effort to create the atomic bomb and his moral struggles with the consequences. I think I was thinking of something akin to ""A Beautiful Mind"" with Russell Crowe.Ôøº

What I was not expecting was how much of the movie was about his personal life, politics and the trials where he was accused of being a communist agent later in life. The personal life stuff would've been a great dramatic addition to the storytelling if those personal life bits had anything to do with the emotional tension of the central character. But literally if those scenes were cut out of the movie you wouldn't miss them at all.Ôøº

There is a ton going on in this movie and there are a ton of characters. All this is interwoven across multiple timelines. 
I'm going to be honest, I spent about 60% of the movie very confused about who was who and what was happening. 

I'm also going to be honest and tell you that while I was thoroughly impressed with the sound engineering in this movie I was very unimpressed with the visuals. Think maybe things have been overhyped in my mind. I went to see this in IMAX on a 70 mm screen. So I guess I was expecting visually I was going to be blown out of my chair. Ôøº

But thinking practically about it...like what was I going to be blown away by? I mean there's one bomb explosion and that's kind of it. There's some kind of interesting artistic scenes of visually atomic things happening. But they are quick.

So if you're a AV nerd junkie then yeah go see it on the best possible screen you can. My personal opinion is it needed? No. In retrospect I would've been just as happy seeing it on a regular screen and saved a lot of money and trouble.Ôøº

What I would recommend you do is see this PBS drama documentary before hand.  It's from a series called American experience. Currently it's on Apple TV.  It is a linear telling of what happened on almost all of the major plot points and aspects in the movie. 

Including his personal life stuff. This documentary does a fantastic job of explaining how those personal events and people shape and affected him, his personality and how he went about things. 

Because Nolan jumps around between multiple timelines and takes artistic licenses with some of the visuals and interpretations it could be a little difficult to follow. This documentary is linear and straightforward. Ôøº",NEUTRAL

"Jul 24, 2023","Captivating story, but they way it was constructed felt like like dozens of movie trailers back-to-back. Multiple plot lines and a non-chronological storyline could have worked, but with typical scenes lasting 30 seconds or less and going straight to highly emotional dialog or a laugh line,  There wasn't enough time to make a connection with the characters before dropping into yet another scene. I honestly wondered whether this was an experiment in creating a picture for TikTok attention spans.",NEGATIVE

However, very heavy on dialogue if that's not your cup of tea. I personally didn't mind it. Nolan's way of storytelling can be rather confusing at times, especially on a first watch. The sound mixing‚Äîsometimes couldn't hear dialogue over the music.

"Jul 24, 2023","This is a phenomenally well put together movie. I was expecting it to be good, but was totally blown away. Character-driven with plenty of historical context, so if you want an action movie or some eye-candy comedy then of course this isn't going to be your thing. To be honest I was giving up on movies recently with all the shallow characters and lazy writing by people who seem never to have taken a class in story structure in their lives, but this one blew me away!!",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023","Longtime fan of Nolan's filmic disruption of narrative linearity, and his confidence in the intellectual prowess of (most) audiences to handle ethically difficult content and themes, multi-plot storylines that require cognitive participation from the audience, creativity in the telling of stories visually, aurally, and through excellent writing. For those wanting it, Nolan's films are infinitely ripe for interpretation and analysis and for asking questions, which is what makes the movie genre interesting.

I strongly believe that the movie medium is not one of responsibility since it is anchored in ""entertainment"" and oftentimes propaganda when exported outside the U.S. Nolan is a reactionary against this idea, which puts him in the shortlist class of directors who see the filmic medium as a responsible one to ask questions, challenge how stories are told, interrogate how we perceive ourselves, and ultimately providing cultural/discursive commentary and inquiry that are more important than the film itself: that is the marker of a great text.

I was happy this film acted as a semi-biopic, so, for those people who are looking for a biography of Oppenheimer, this movie will probably disappoint. I didn't want this film to focus solely on Oppenheimer (and there are plenty of things I can access if I want to know more just about him) since the work he and other scientists were doing and the political climate addressed in the film's era(s) are more significant than the man himself. A film about Oppenheimer should inherently involve a vast array of contexts, especially considering the historical and political impact in which he was involved and experienced. 

For those audience members who are familiar with Nolan's work, they should expect non-linearity and pushing filmic boundaries for the sake of storytelling. If audience members are finding characters flat rather than well rounded 1.) this is interpretive 2.) there is a narrative reason for this, and 3.) I would argue that character development is far from some of the most important concepts/themes/commentary that this type of narrative seeks to explore, disrupt, question, and examine. This is a story not about a few characters or a few actors: this is a story that involves the entire world - I would not expect characters to be given exceptional depth here.  

The lack of chronology and non-linearity in this film are masterfully executed and filmed, which is par for the course for someone like Nolan to the point that I would say he takes Oliver Stone's style and does it better. For those people who struggle to follow along (as people may have done in Inception, Memento, and/or Tenet), this type of film I would say is just not for those people since watching Nolan requires paying full attention with your frontal lobes for 3 hours. Note that Nolan also often strings multiple plots together rather than plots and sub-plots, which is not easy to do, but I appreciate it.  

I would like to note that many people have noted Hans Zimmer as the musical composer for this film, which is incorrect. While Nolan and Zimmer have teamed up a lot, it is Ludwig G√∂ransson who presents a stunning soundscape and score for this film. 

This film will hopefully get more people to research this interesting and important period in U.S. history, and I even recommend researching who the characters are before you see it. There are many characters, but this only adds to the chaos and hostility of U.S. politics during WWII and McCarthyism. This is NOT a film about American exceptionalism, and if someone claims it to be, I would suggest they re-watch it. 

For a brief note on the acting - although I honestly think this is a minor part of what makes this film a master class in how to create a film for a generation - I think everyone presents excellent performances. Robert Downey Jr.'s character blew me away. Cillian Murphy, as in all of his acting, performed excellently as a very subdued Oppenheimer (unsurprisingly).",POSITIVE

The climax is the bomb exploding and it doesn't share anything new or shocking about an atomic bomb exploding. The resolution is in the last 10-20 minutes of the film and it is the most boring legal parade. The film was made to rely on dialogue yet it had horrible dialogue. Too many long pauses for sentences and it got old fast. I found myself often saying get on with it. The film could have been cut at least 30 minutes. I found some scenes redundant where it shared the same message with the same effect. It had a lot of clips flashing back and forth and it made it hard to follow. It's crazy how and interesting topic was made to be so boring. This story had a lot of potential but it was being pulled in to many directions and it lost its focus.

Matt Damon was excellent as a stern, brutally honest, and straightforward character.

Although the level of entertainment that the film manages to generate in the audience may be variable, I believe that the objective and constant result will be mostly the same, which will be of total impact. This film is not only another achievement for Nolan and his entire team, but it is also an achievement for cinema in general, a pleasure that this level of commitment continues to exist when making a film.",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023","I love history, especially period pieces, so I was drawn to ""Oppenheimer"" from the get-go. But sometimes period pieces will insert too much modernity into the visuals and dialogue, but Christopher Nolan stayed true to the period. ""Oppenheimer"" is as close to a true undeniable masterpiece as I've seen in a film in years. It is a symphony of powerful performances (Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer is brilliant, and his name had better be in many award season nominations), Emily Blunt and Matt Damon were amazing and Christopher Nolan weaved a profound film that went beneath J. Robert Oppenheimer being the ""Father of the Atomic Bomb"". He humanized him and showed us all of his triumphs, insecurities, tragedies, fears and flaws. 

""Oppenheimer"" is a sublime, haunting and mesmerizing film that makes you think. It stays extremely close to historical fact, and examines the gulf between empathy and compassion as it pertains to science and whether your allegience to your country should ever be stronger than when your conscience and moral compass is telling you what you're doing for your country is intrinsically wrong. And when you choose country over morality, what is the cost? Oppenheimer paid one helluva price for giving Truman and his country something that was truly a weapon of mass destruction. Now, there are bombs 10 times more destructive and deadlier than the Atomic Bomb, and unfortunately, Oppenheimer opened that Pandora's Box and there is no way of ever closing that lid again.

Jumping between that Kangaroo Court grilling Oppenheimer withstood because, as we all know, the government will giveth, and it will taketh away if a person doesn't tow the line, to how he came to be the head of the Trinity Project, his personal failings and to the ultimate testing of the Atomic Bomb, was acted and shot amazingly. I don't normally like a lot of time jumps, but this was needed in order to figure out his journey, and to get a glimpse of the man behind the bomb. From the first frame, it draws you into the long-hidden world of J. Robert Oppenheimer. 

But ultimately what Christoper Nolan showed us is that the true monster in this film was not Oppenheimer's invention, but the insatiable appetite for power, and knowing what kind of destruction the bomb unleashed upon humankind. That realization plays out in Oppenheimer's pained and haunted face all thoughout the entire film. 

I was transfixed throughout this 3-hour magnum opus of incredible storytelling, cinematography, set design, acting and directing. This is a film that MUST be seen on the big screen to embrace the greatness and enormity of it.",POSITIVE

"Jul 24, 2023","#MovieReview #Oppenheimer

This is a very long film, two hours and 43 minutes, so be prepared to spend that much time in the theater. 

The first 30 minutes of the film is a little hard to take in because it bounces back-and-forth and it's kind of drawn out boring. But then once you get passed that the movie starts becoming historical even more. 

There's a lot of cameos, our guest appearances from celebrities throughout the film playing historical figures Ôøº, the acting itself is fantastic very very well 

Overall, I enjoyed the film, I think that it is very captivating for what it was created for. Yes, it's long, but it's a lot of history and if you like the history of the United States, you would enjoy this film.

It is not a film for children son prefers cartoons, superheroes, and fun. When it comes to historical stuff, he gets very bored   

But overall, it is definitely a film worth seeing in the theaters, and at least taking the experience and the ride of the atom bomb. ÔøºÔøº

Most boring movie I've ever went to see I don't understand how this movie has such a high rating on Rotten Tomatoes but this movie was trash!",NEGATIVE
"Jul 24, 2023","Wonderful movie - dense and inghtful. Multiple timelines interwoven that can at times seem confusing but play out to strengthen the overall storyline and the multiple paths that Oppie took over the course of his life,  Black & white and colour scenes used to great effect to highlight these storylines.  Performance are outstanding - especially Cillian Murphy and I also loved  Em,ily Blunt and Robert Downey Jnr.  Cinematography and music were also top notch. Nolan's best since Memento (not to discount others in the meantime).",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023","Outside of one scene I can't fathom why people have said this is a must see in the theaters.  The movie is way too long, and the storytelling is so convoluted that the impact of the story was lacking.  Acting was good, but that alone does not justify the run time.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 24, 2023","Christopher Nolan's Magnum Opus , this is what cinemas was made for . Even though I love comic book adaptations a lot its soo refreshing to watch movies with absolutely or barely have CGI and just have a really good storyline.

"Jul 24, 2023","It was fine...timeline and editing were all over the place, jumping from story line to story line to story line. With no point to it other than to make it seem more prestige? It was unnecessarily confusing, long and tedious to watch. It finally started to level off and make sense after a little over an hour but just couldn't give a shit after 2ish hours. Was checking the time every 5 minutes praying for it to just end. Left feeling like i really put in work just to get through the thing and was glad it was over honestly. Watching it a second time would help to follow the storyline but I would never wish a 2nd viewing of this upon anyone.

"Jul 24, 2023","I called this one as

""THE BEST OF NOLAN"" 

Oppenheimer is simply amazing. Cinemo is a chef kiss, his self loathing, the igniting sparks of knowledge between his subconscious mind, the aftermath, the consequences of one's decision. All in one!

The downside is... the strength of Florence Pugh in this movie. Wasn't strong enough to me or maybe I doubt the depth of her love towards Robert. Whether it is love, or a mere completion in romance. Her screentime was too short for me. Would love to see more of her. Emily? No doubt. Strong character that've shaped Robert, to stood on the ground, and to be tough. Listen to your wife they said, and it's true. RDJ? Oh Lord.... One of the best. His deliverance, the cockiness in his tone (like always), he is Strauss!

CILLIAN OH CILLIAN!
The man he is. The man of the century.
His wild, wild imagination runs throughout the movie. He brought me along in his realm; in his quantum's journey. His ray of emotions, the vast of knowledge, the everlasting of his guilt. Brilliant performances. Brilliant.

10/10 ‚ú®",POSITIVE

"Jul 24, 2023","I was looking forward to many of the mainstream summer movies this year. While none of them were really big disappointments, none of them really stayed with me as I left the theatre. I finally watched #Oppenheimer on IMAX 70MM, and it exceeded all my expectations, the direction, the acting, the visual, the score, the editing, sound design everything was as close to perfect as I have seen in a while. It was talky, cerebral, political, emotionally heightened, and ultimately a great character study with Nolan's audio visual flare. Probably one of the best movies I have seen in years. This is Christopher Nolan's Magnum Opus as I have heard few times already. But it is dense in content, theme and ask some unsettling questions about humanity and it's future. And it is not for everyone. Rating: A+",POSITIVE

"Jul 24, 2023","underwhelming and def not Nolans magnum opus. The A-bomb explosion was so underwhelming and funny. My only question to Mr. Nolan is, why not use CGI? It could've looked better. No mushroom clouds, no layered fire -- I will watch an a-bomb explosion on Youtube before I sleep. 
dialogues were incomprehensible and the scenes were cut too fast, coherent storytelling was lacking.
While the whole theater clapped, I sighed.

"Jul 24, 2023","Very well acted Cillian Murphy was scary good as always and Emily Blunt crushed her role as his strident, protective, loyal wife.  The movie just failed to frame the circumstances and importance of beating the Nazis to the bomb or how Hitler actually would have gotten it if not for his antisemitism or just how brilliant Werner Heisenberg, Hitlers underfunded ace card was for Werner's sin of appreciation of Albert Einsteins brilliance.  Also didn't do a great job explaining how quickly the Soviet Union replaced the Nazis as real world evil.  Bertrand Russell the world renowned  mathematician, philosopher, humanist and logician advocated for the US to use the bomb on the Soviets if necessary to stop Stalin (Hitlers early ally in destroying Poland)  from dominating Eastern Europe and before the Soviet's could get the bomb (since Stalin was easily Hitlers equal in evil)!  The McCarthyism is always overblown while the real Soviet threat always minimized in Hollywood and sadly this movie is no exception.  Also felt that seeing in in imax was a waste ‚Ä¶. Lots of closeups of faces  not really much better than seeing it at home except for Florence Pugh who played Oppenheimer's deeply troubled but Uber erotic lover.  Good movie that had all the tools to be great!",NEUTRAL
"Jul 24, 2023","Finally got to see Oppenheimer and I can honestly say that this is possibly the best film that I've seen this year so far! Christopher Nolan has once again shown us his genius behind the camera giving us a stunning film that utilizes no CGI but still manages to give us the intensity and suspense that comes from the atomic bomb. But the movie is about more than just the device that ended World War II, it's about the man behind the weapon and the complexities of his life both before and after the events of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The film also has powerhouse performances by a cast of very familiar faces that even in the smallest of roles will be recognizable. But the key standouts are Robert Downey Jr, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh, all of whom command the screen that fills the 3-hour run time. As for Cillian Murphy, he is the very soul of the movie and brings both strong yet sensitive presence to J. Robert Oppenheimer that it is worthy of an Oscar nomination. I will say that the film is very dialogue heavy but not to its detriment, but if you're expecting a World War II epic with sprawling action sequences, this is not that movie. With that being said Oppenheimer is a brilliant and beautiful movie and I believe ranks high in Christopher Nolan's filmography!",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023","3 Hours of Talking Heads

I don't know how they did it, but they took one of the most incredible/horrific events in human history and turned out a boring 3 hour movie made almost entirely of boring talking heads, none of which I cared about one bit. To make it seem exciting, they added a screechy soundtrack, that at times overshadowed the tedious dialogue, and they added some naked breasts because apparently we moviegoers need to see naked breasts. I know I'm in a minority with this opinion, but be frank - who in their right mind would ever want to watch this movie a second time? I almost didn't make it though the first. Three stars because the cinematography elevated this dog of a movie from two.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 24, 2023","I absolutely love the movie Oppenheimer. Its been 3 days since I saw Oppenheimer and I can't stop thinking about the movie. Oppenheimer had my heat racing in suspense unlike any other movie. The rich history about the Robbert Oppenheimer and getting dragged into how he felt was amazing and made the 3 hour run time feel so quick. If you want to see a movie that dives deep into history and makes you feel like you're there, definitely see Oppenheimer. Remember, this movie is about Robbert J. Oppenheimer and not about a bomb.",POSITIVE

"Jul 24, 2023","This movie is miles wide and centimeters deep.  It's mostly about the terrible dialogue.  Neither realistic nor interesting, and revealing that the writers are clueless about the scientific subject matter.  You'll come away learning nothing about the crazy science behind developing ‚Äî not even an interesting tidbit.  The third time (or was it the fourth?) that some repeats that the entire atmosphere might catch on fire you realize that the writers think the audience is dimmer than they are.  Robert Downey, Jr.'s performance is as bad as I've seen from him.  Cillian Murphy is barely recognizable as more than a blue-eyed mannequin.  And the interrupted sex scene where a forgettable, boorish woman stops to read an on the nose from the Bhagavad Gita had me laughing out loud.",NEGATIVE

moments.",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023","I don't want to disrespect the film makers, and all the effort and time they put into this production. If having known the story before, one learned nothing new. It became about a power struggle with the feds and redeeming his name. I don't even think the dialogue was on point. Failed to exacerbate the point that we are trying to win the war because of German ambition ultimately. Although Hitler was dead, there could've been a way to factor him into the movie, which would've made it that much more magnetic because of the hatred that people have with him worldwide. It didn't really delve into the result of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, no footage to bring the point home.  That footage would bring images which create his moral dilemma. I thought it was just about the political aspect, a lot of Washington suits, not enough mathematical physics (Goodwill Hunting had better equations) , and not enough explosions frankly. That being said, I don't need to see Matt Damon or Robert Downey, Jr. in this movie either. I gave it two stars. It was worth eight dollars but I would not recommend it. That's an honest assessment and I'm not a hater. Just didn't deliver for me. Hope it does for you.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 24, 2023","Oppenheimer combines amazing filmmaking with important historic storytelling. Out of respect for Christopher Nolan and ‚ÄòBarbenheimer' I¬†felt obligated to see this film in theaters and I would have had it no other way. A truly informational, biopic covering most aspects of Oppenheimer's life and all themes that come with being one of most well known names in destruction history. Nolan had a clear vision as to how he wanted this film to come across to the audience and specifically which parts he wanted the audience to comprehend in their own way, which made the film a lot more playful and lively. Furthermore, after hearing plenty of backlash about the ""unnecessary sex"" scenes in the film, I found them to be the quickest, and most exciting, way to portray intimacy between the two characters in the scene. Special credit to Ludwig G√∂ransson for a phenomenal, mind melting score that I simply‚Ä®cannot turn off. Still‚Ä¶Oppenheimer's 3 hour runtime was a little too long to keep my attention, but if you enjoy history or an amazing CINEMATIC experience‚Ä¶go see this film in theaters while you can!

But overall I thought this was a very quality film like most of Christopher Nolan's movies, and while this one isn't my favorite it's still good for what it is. It's a JFK-like historical drama. The acting/cast were all incredible and so was the set design, and also the lack of CGI and special effects. The directing and camera work were awesome too. The middle part with them detonating the test bomb was a very well-constructed and tense scene. It was also intelligent in a way to only show the American perspective of the war and how out of touch/indifferent they were with the suffering that they inflicted on the Japanese civilian population, except of course for the main character. He was portrayed very well and this movie is coming out at a very critical time in history, reminding us of the destructive potential of escalating to nuclear war with other countries (no matter the side) and that our responsibility with handling weaponized nuclear technology is not to be taken lightly, and we must have a moral conscience. The movie also showed the quick/immediate development of a post-war McCarthyist government which was portrayed how it should have been. This is good and informative 20th century history!",NEUTRAL

"Jul 24, 2023","This movie was supposed to be Christopher Nolan's crowning achievement as a director and instead is an unintelligible mess because he still apparently refuses to have a decent dialog track. The entire movie is marred by muddy dialog and requires so much concentration to understand that you can't even enjoy it. It has to be one of the worst theatrical experiences I've had in recent memory, I'd have expected it to be a technical issue it was so bad but was told by the staff at the theater this was just the way it is. Since it is a Christopher Nolan picture, I'm not surprised. He's had similar issues in the past most recently with Tenant where, according to interviews with Nolan, he intentionally covered up dialog. I had to watch it with subtitles at home just to figure out what was going on.

I had recently seen Mission Impossible in the exact same auditorium and it exhibited no such issues.  Both pictures were views in IMAX and yet Nolan just can't get his head out of his rear to realize that yes, people do want to hear what the characters are speaking. It is suppose to be all atmosphere. 

The second huge complaint is the necessary nudity. I'm no prude but if you put it in there you should have a point. I know Nolan probably wanted to show how ""exposed"" his characters were and literally expose them but it was completely unnecessary and uncomfortable in a mixed audience because of the length of the scenes. I get the impression he just said screw it, I got the R rating so let me just take advantage of it. There is a long scene with the characters talking just full out seated nude. Why? What was the point?

Cilian Murphy was excellent in his role as Oppenheimer.  The standout performance was Robert Downey Jr though. He was incredibly nuanced and spot on in his performance. Emily Blunt, who I love, was fantastic but her presence in the movie was sparse. Matt Damon is, well Matt Damon, and is perfect for the role he played.

This is a classic overhyped movie that comes crashing down because of the hubris of its director. I wanted desperately to like this move. I had been anticipating this and love the source material but left disappointed and upset because I wasted an entire afternoon.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 24, 2023",Wonderful film! 10/10,POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023",So boring.  I suppose Director/writer Nolan was so  busy admiring his woefully expository dialogue that he failed to notice his film was collapsing.  Any director that can make Emily Blunt look that ordinary should not be allowed to play with a real camera.,NEGATIVE

"Jul 24, 2023","It was alright, I feel like the last 45 minutes could've been condensed to about 8.

"Jul 23, 2023",as a long time Christopher Nolan film I was already coming into this film with high expectations and I must say it delivered this is definitely Killian Murphy's best performance ever I've been saying that he's a a-list star for a long time and now it's so good to see him get his own film definitely an awards contender this year. this is probably Christopher Nolan's most dialogue driven film and of course the cinematography is amazing could not recommend enough probably my second favorite Christopher Nolan film need to watch it a few more times definitely watching IMAX if you get the chance.,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Great sound design, amazing use of lighting- well in line with Nolan's reputation. It's on a topic which I've been forever interested, so perhaps I'm brassed but the 3 hours truly flew past. Casting was very well done. Top 5 of my favourite films ever.",POSITIVE

Cillian Murphy executed the role of Oppenheimer perfectly alongside a great supporting cast who almost all delivered incredible performances as well. The film slips in tone a little towards the end, but brings it back together with a very thought provoking climax and ending.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","The mastery of presenting such an important events in the history is just wow! I love how Nolan smoothly presented the characters and I'm impressed of the excellent amount of dialogs that fit perfectly. Nolan the GOAT. I also love Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer. I'm happy that more people will see how amazing actor he is not basing only on his role as Thomas Shelby in Peaky Blinders. I love this film and I think that it is must see for people who are cinema connoisseur. Excellent plot, magnificent cast, everything is perfect.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",Excellent pacing and acting. Will hold your interest despite its length. Keep in mind this film is about the man and not the bomb.,POSITIVE

"Jul 23, 2023",Beyond boring. Save your money and watch the documentary instead,NEGATIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Just watched the movie today and wow! Breathtaking movie. As a 19 year old I really enjoyed the movie and would really recommend it to others of all age groups. This movie's big detail is in the dialogue that you really have to listen to while at the same time the audio thats makes it even more immersive which really separates Christopher Nolan from other movie directors. The actors were great at their roles and the environment of the film is ""spot-on"".
Cinematography was beautiful (sadly there are no imax cinemas in my area) but the visions was really portrayed accurately both according to the real life events and in the film.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Christopher Nolan delivers a taut biopic with Cillian Murphy who is truly great as J. Robert Oppenheimer.  Despite its 3-hour running time, Nolan keeps things intriguing all along the way. Fantastic supporting performances by Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Matt Damon and especially Robert Downey Jr.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",The movie has a good storyline and great acting. Nolan and Blunt were superb. Movie is too long at 3 hours. Story difficult to follow at times. Better to watch at home.,NEUTRAL
"Jul 23, 2023","Really enjoyed the storytelling on this one, they kept things moving, it was beautifully shot and the soundtrack (especially in a Dolby Cinema) was amazing. If the history interests you, you'll love it.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Watched it in IMAX.  I was very unimpressed after all the hype.  The movie focused 90% of the time on the perceived threat of communism.  The movie was almost entirely focused on court like dramas that were made more annoying by accompanying loud music and visual effects that drownded out what was going on.  I was expecting a movie to be focused on science, physics, and human fortutide something like a beautiful mind.  This movie is a hype and sham.  It's a long drama with the red scare of communism being its focal point instead of science and human acheivement.  Its a very boring courtroom type movie that was way over hyped and not implemented in a way to be associated with the historical events that happened.  Its a sham of a movie.  I have read the making of the atomic bomb and this movie just went completely off the rails on the communist tangent.  Its a shame of a movie and should not be associated with this time period or it's key historical actors.  It's a sham,  And very poorly executed it has no depth of feel - there is no emotion in it.  It feels without heart and purpose like a ghost of a better movie that should have been produced.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Perfection, Christopher Nolan managed to repeat the feat and in my view it is equivalent to Batman: Dark Knight (2008), a masterpiece, pure art diluted in 3 hours. Cillian Murphy deserves an Oscar, as well as Robert Downey Junior for a supporting role, impeccable.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","The movie and its performances are amazing, very well made (obviously its Christopher Nolan :) ) . The only thing which is not so great is the sound editing, the music overpowers in some places to an extent you cant hear the dialogues.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",Great film! Definitely another fantastic movie by Christopher Nolan. The cast was incredible too! 3 hours went by fast!,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","This film will undoubtedly be the best experience in theaters I'll have this year. The talent and performances, the visuals, and sound design were absolutely breathtaking and everything about this film event needs to be taken in by anyone remotely a connoisseur of film media.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Oppenheimer is a phenomenal film. This movie is that good that it is now my profile image and I got American Premetheus, the source material for this movie. Cillian Murphy and Robert Downy Jr. are easily getting an Oscar for their beyond god tier performance. Florence Pugh, Emily Blunt, and Matt Damon are also great standouts. The score is extremely good and builds up the suspense so well. Overall, I have no negatives. OPPENHEIMER is the best film ever in my opinion and has a good chance to be a film that will still be talked about for years after its release. Good job Nolan!!",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",the movie was too long and dragged in certain parts. I felt it was overhyped.,NEUTRAL
"Jul 23, 2023","Well, written, and well executed. Must be seen in IMAX.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Spoilers: I highly recommend ""Oppenheimer."" Cillian Murphy just won best actor Oscar as Oppy, I'd say. Superb cast, wonderful writing. Captivating, so the 3 hours went fast for me. Rare films have both great form and great content, and this is one -- with high production values, wonderful sets and cinematography and CGI, and the content is as important and significant as any ever. Seems mild-mannered Oppy, a genius with a troubled wife and a troubled mistress, was both ambivalent, seeing images of destruction in his head, and enigmatic, as one guy says: We don't know what you think, do we? He thought once the Europe war ended, the just ready bomb should be dropped on Japan cities to show how awful it was, so the world would unite in disarmament. Later, he thought both the A and H bombs wouldn't be controlled but were destined for use by people, and he fought production of the H bomb but lost. A lot is the despicable way he was treated during the McCarthy red scare era by ambitious military and ambitious politicians including Truman, and even unsympathetic scientists, all of whom raked him over the coals, questioned his patriotism for having been sympathetic to communists, though he was never in the party. Speaking to friend Einstein at the end, yes, that Einstein, Oppy said remember I told you I was afraid we might usher in the end of the world. ""I think we have,"" Oppy finished. Bravo. I kept thinking: When the first guy threw the first rock at the guy he didn't like, were we destined for escalation and more sophisticated projectiles, from spears, arrows, fire-breathing catapults, guns to the A, H bombs? And maybe the extinction of the human race?",POSITIVE

"Jul 23, 2023",No point watching it at home. Watch it in the theater. Watch it in IMAX.,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","I read Oppenheimer's biography and must say the movie is perfect in showing a little of his life, it deserves several Oscar nominations for acting, runs 3 hours, and has a little bit of complex language for non-science people (that was me)",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Masterful storytelling. Epic real-life drama, impeccable presentation of The American  Prometheus.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Oppenheimer was hands down one of the best movies let alone one of best of Nolan's works. Literally did not blink the entire movie. The movie made me feel excited, thrilled, and my heart was trembling as I was consumed in the movie. The music was spot on.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","This movie was great in every area. The audio was exquisite, the visuals were uncontested!",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","I'll never forget watching this in theaters.

The experience of the bomb going off, the aftermath of celebration, the spiral into guilt that Oppenheimer fell into... all of it was masterfully depicted on screen.

I cried when the bomb went off. I cried even harder at seeing everyone on-screen cheer at the news that the United States of America had dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, then Nagasaki. And that's exactly what Christopher Nolan wanted the audience to feel. In this movie, we're the bad guys.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",Lives up to all expectations for me. The story telling could draw any crowd. The acting and cinematography was unmatched.,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Best biopic I've ever seen. Perfect amount of dramatic symbolism without making it obnoxious and taking away from the story. Acting, pace, everything was 10/10. Didn't feel like 3 hours long. Thought I knew a fair amount of the story but didn't know half of it, taught a lot without ever being dry or slow. Couldn't be happier that I saw it in theaters.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Not sure why there are so many positive reviews for this film (too many Nolan fan boys). I've only wanted a leave a film twice in my life and this was one of them.

Not worth watching on IMAX! If I was Tom Cruise I'd be pissed that MI was closed early for this. Only about 10 minutes of shots in total felt like they stood out, otherwise it was mostly monochrome office locations. 

Storyline was disjointed, this was mostly likely deliberate, but felt it overcomplicated some timelines which could have been told more elegantly in a shorter space of time. 

Robert Downey Jr and Emily Blunt stood out, but otherwise the rest of the cast were lacklustre. Nudity scenes added very little to the storyline, which again could have been told in a more creative way. 

Okay watch at home, no where near matches the hype. Won't be watching again or recommending to friends.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Was really interesting: watching how a curious person got into a complicated position of trying to win one over the Nazis (and later the Japanese) but then giving a new kind of power that could destroy everything, so he tries his best to advocate for restrain on its usage. The later part might not be as interesting as the first one, but I find important nonetheless. Highly recommend.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",Oppenheimer is one of those movies where it's unexpectedly great everything from the score to the cinematography the cast is also great my favorite performances were from RDG and Cillian Murphy the sequence when they test the bomb is one of the best movie sequence's I've seen this year everything about it was incredible but I have one problem it's a three hour movie so there were a few scenes where I was bored and checking the clock but nonetheless it's still a must see,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Felt like I was watching a three hour long trailer. Hard to keep track with all the names, faces and switching timelines. Couldn't come to a conclusion, for me it didn't really had a beginning and closure. As a Hungarian I also missed our scientists, they had much bigger role in the making of the atomic bomb. Usually i love Nolan movies but this was a huge disappointment",NEGATIVE

"Jul 23, 2023","Oppenheimer became one of the top movies at the box office. After having a disapproval rating comparing it to the new movie Barbie, I have a few comments about this explicit movie. One, the realism of the explosions was phenomenal creating not an instant explosion but a realistic shockwave delay. I also like the timing for different types of scenes and how everything is flashbacked to the court scene at the end. Two, I love how they incorporated Albert einstein, many civilised mathematicians and physics throughout America, and various presidents such as Rosewell and JFK. Also i do reference for the censored scenes with prologued to the MA15+ sex scenes becoming in the movie for the amusement. This movie created one of the best realistic movies next to Batman.",POSITIVE

I am actually going to see again/buy this movie when it comes out on Blu-ray or on a streaming service. Loved it.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","My bro saw this movie thinking it would be about epic explosions, no. He had to witness sex scenes. And worst, with Putin's threats, this did not help at all. Also, yes we had to bomb Japan, but there where so many innocent people who died. The movie says hate japanise stuff, yet I love Sonic, Mario, Sailor Moon, Playstation, Pokemon, etc and there from Japan. Despite taking place around the bombing, it's not something one would see, and didn't get an R rating until last minute. My bro and dad didn't know it was R until it was to late.

"Jul 23, 2023","Christopher Nolan resumes his auteur era with a somewhat surprisingly mature, historical biopic drama story brilliantly told through his signature epic thriller blockbuster style for a monumental achievement in filmmaking. Cillian Murphy gives the best performance of his career in his first starring role after multiple collaborations with Nolan, every square nanometer of his face shown to the viewer throughout to illustrate the weight of his actions and guilt at what happened during the Manhattan project.

The film jumps all around in time, almost to a fault, to tell a decades spanning series of events concerning the United States' involvement in WWII, how it ended, and all the black listing, Cold War, and Red Scare investigations that followed and Oppenheimer became a direct target of. Much of what occurs is seen through the eyes of Oppenheimer himself, at times coming across like a psychological thriller, as the script was at least partially written in the first person and consistently depicts his state of mind and visions relating to global extinction by nuclear holocaust.

As far as biopics go, Oppenheimer blows all the others out of the water. Sure, many of them are decent or even great, but there has usually been a consistent lack of imagination or risk-taking from Hollywood when it comes to telling true stories, especially in the last 15 years and with historical dramas. Nolan further proves what a versatile and detail-oriented filmmaker he is by dramatizing these events and making the audience really feel the weight of it all and stick in the memory. The atomic test sequence in particular is an incredible, tense set piece that's no less thrilling to witness despite us knowing how it turns out. The following sequence where Oppenheimer gives a political speech to a cheering crowd while experiencing visions of annihilation is equally brilliant.

The Prestige is my favorite of Nolan's movies, and it's great to see him return to more grounded subject matter again after the run of increasingly large-scale blockbusters that he had made since. While Oppenheimer isn't my favorite Nolan film, it's a remarkable work of art that should be seen to be believed, with an excellent score and general use of sound (despite a bit too much music in the first act), stunning visuals, and fantastic performances across the board by an amazing cast. The 3-hour run time flies by thanks to a thought-provoking and always fascinating plot. Oppenheimer is brimming with a real sense of importance that successfully gets across the grave real life implications of his work and inner moral turmoil.",POSITIVE

"Jul 23, 2023","The sound design was amazing, the script and plot was done so well, even though 4th grade history already spoiled the plot of the movie I still was on the edge of my seat for what was going to happen next.

The story is dramatic enough without having to add the grating background noise.There were also things that didn't make sense such as Oppenheimer's apparent distress at the very beginning of the movie.  Was he suffering from paranoia? Nightmares? I wish Nolan had not tried to cover so much ground.,NEUTRAL
"Jul 23, 2023","Fantastic  movie but I was kind of hoping they've included clip when bomb was dropped in japan and it's after effect. I understand Nolan's non use of CGI but honestly was sayin to my buddy after we left, I think they could have really benefited from it. Could have shown the drops, and the devastation and horrors from it, and it would have sold it very well to his regrets of it.

"Jul 23, 2023","Nolan is an immensely talented filmmaker who constantly undermines himself 1) as a lousy script writer who's 2) infatuated with unnecessarily convoluted timelines, and 3) usually has nothing to say. Check and check, though this time he's actually thoughtful (he had a rich bio of Oppenheimer to pilfer). He wisely overcasts the movie (the famous faces were the only way I could keep track of the characters), though he underuses (Blunt has one great scene) or exploits (what is up with Pugh's nude scenes?) his women actors. Murphy and the other men are quite good and Downey is excellent, if a little hammy.",NEUTRAL

10/10

My favourite movie of all time is Christopher Nolan's 2008 Batman Dark Night. He did it again, delivering historical magic to the Imax cinematic world, and also changed our modern filmmaking method. Astonishing performance from Cillian, with beautiful cinematography capturing the magnificence of an atomic explosion. A refreshing and innovative film highlighting the challenges Oppenheimer faced as the person controlling the life and death of people through his invention, his struggles due to his background and his jealousy of his peers.

I particularly love the usage of the B&W 70mm film describing the time frame of events, separating the present and the past, more importantly colouring the dynamic of people. B&W film separates characters from the background, drawing the focus to the facial expressions and movements of the actors. We see how Lewis's extraordinary performance on how his jealousy and delusion drove his anger towards Oppenheimer, how people are easily blinded by fame. Using handheld camera movement for most of the scene builds up the tension, in short truly immersive.

Oppenheimer is known to be the father of the atomic bomb. In his previous interviews, he had expressed his concerns about the usage of these bombs and how his invention conflicted with his view on morality. He used his talent to invent such a bomb but everything comes with consequences. Likewise, a bomb can destroy or create destructions and contains greatness in good use but with massive consequences. Oppenheimer was aware of this fact, and the introduction visuals and after-effects complimented this conflicted feeling.¬†

The most breathtaking scene has to be the last scene. A close-up of Oppenheimer following an image of the world where it was covered with atomic bombs, end of the world. The fear lived within Oppenheimer. Another remarkable scene would be the explosion of the first successful atomic bomb. The scene started with clouds of dark gas, swallowing the sky, everything was silent, observing the power of it. Then soon later, a loud noise followed. Excellent method of immersing everyone to witness history, and the mightiness of the bomb alongside incredible soundtracks, creating an effect that could only be achieved in cinema.¬†¬†

Yet this movie is not all about the process of how the atomic bomb was invented, it is a biography about Oppenheimer. The storyline includes his love affairs, marriage, family and politics. Oppenheimer had been accused of having a connection with the Russian communist party during the second world war. The majority of the movie was about his security clearance. Colleges of his were introduced one by one, some betrayed him, some told half-truths. A mentally draining trial for Oppenheimer but was important to the overall story as in the end cleared his name and his loyalty to the country.¬†

A great movie needs to provide a sense of connection with the audience, a reflection that the audience can carry even outside of the cinema. Oppenheimer is a must-watch movie though it is quite lengthy, a total of 3 hours. It gives you a glimpse of what it meant to be ""with great power comes with great responsibility"". The struggles behind the most magnificent invention of the century. Everything comes with a price, a price that Oppenheimer has to pay was his time with his children and family, and the betrayal of people he trusted. A phenomenal cast of actors, and I have nothing to critic about their delivery.",POSITIVE

"Jul 23, 2023","""Oppenheimer"" leaves you in awe of what has just occurred ‚Äì it's a dense film with plenty of set pieces, characters, and lines of dialogue that bear great significance and by the end of it you feel exhausted and speechless at the same time.

It's Nolan's least spectacular film in the last 15 years action-wise, but at the same time it's one of his most astounding and groundbreaking achievement. ""Oppenheimer"" is a true cinematic experience that elevates the biographical genre to a new high ‚Äì the use of sound design, music, and editing makes you transfixed for the whole 180 minutes runtime without blinking an eye. The pace from the very first frame is fast and there is no moment to catch a breath, the film itself is a race against the time ‚Äì either to perform a scientific breakthrough, beat the Nazis, or later to deliver the truth in the courtroom. There is a lot of talking involved and none of it is in vain.

As there is a lack of special effects and action sequences to grasp your attention, Nolan has turned to his cast power to deliver the most inspiring performances of their careers ‚Äì everyone deserves high praise in this 3-hour epic, from solemn Cillian Murphy, through his array of supporting physicists (Safdie most notably), Emily Blunt delivering one of the most heartfelt moments, to Robert Downey Jr., who finally has an opportunity to shed his superhero gauntlets for a truly remarkable role that might bring him closer to a golden statue. Everyone has a chance to shine, even those who have two minutes of screen time use their time to the fullest.

Even among other Christopher Nolan films it's hard to compare ""Oppenheimer"" to anything else ‚Äì it's its own thing, a haunting masterpiece defying expectations.",POSITIVE

"Jul 23, 2023",You can see a lot of the elements that Christopher Nolan was playing with in Dunkirk here and he's gotten much better since then. Sound design still needs work in order to provide clarity to what's going on but much better than Tenet.,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","The movie was great, the story was well written perfectly timed the story was not rushed or slowed and I actually really liked how it jumped through time because it added to the story with Oppenheimer telling the story and then also Strauss' version which worked very well and I did not see that plot twist coming and to people saying there was no comedy wrong the cinema laughed a few times and also this movie is not a comedy or an a cation movie it is a historical movie similar to the imitation game they are made to get you think and to enjoy the story",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",Christopher Nolan and the whole crew at their very best. It's everything you go to an IMAX theatre for.,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","One of the best(if not the best) films I have watched this year.The way Nolan treats the game of power that it possessin the greatst weapon of humankind is symple perfect, the casting gives the audience the feeling that they are actually watching a documentary. 9,5/10 one of Nolan's new masterpieces.",POSITIVE

"Jul 23, 2023",Its a Great Film I won't spoil it for anyone Definitely Tragic and Difficult to watch at points but that is bc its a cautionary tale designed to be heeded and understood as what they are tragic,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","I haven't been to the theaters since COVID lockdown, and haven't been impressed by any movie since Portrait of a Lady on Fire. I was much, much more impressed by Oppenheimer than I had anticipated. 

1. Recommend seeing it in theaters. The scale and scope of the Trinity Test will be lost watching at home. The TT must've made real what possibly dropping an atomic bomb would mean for all involved, and as we look back on something we didn't witness, trying to get a sense of it all needs the big screen

2. Cillian Murphy was outstanding. Over the years, I've watched all the interviews of Oppenheimer I can find. CM (near) perfectly captured his speech patterns. More than that, he captured his wide-eyed, intense, and long distanced stare.

3. If you are expecting a mea culpa, this is not that. I went in hoping we'd see the aftermath in Japan, but it is a biopic about Oppenheimer and not the bomb. Interestingly, they focused on how Oppenheimer was caught up in the Red Scare. I think the movie did a good job looking at it objectively. Whether you're left, right, extremist, or somewhere in the middle, no one should be put on trial, silenced, or scapegoated for their opinions (unless inciting violence). Seems relevant to all sides of the aisle in the current US political climate.

4. If you're hoping to see guys like Feynam, Groves, or Bohr get their story told, this is not that. But from everything I've read and studied about the Manhattan Project, I couldn't really find glaring historical inaccuracies, though some things that are key to Oppenheimer (in my mind) and seemed to foreshadow his downfall were skipped

Tl;dr: The three hours went by in seconds and I was left disappointed only in that the movie ended",POSITIVE

"Jul 23, 2023",Quite possibly one of the best movies I've ever seen. A typical complex Nolan movie that has you questioning everything but in a different way,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","La pel√≠cula m√°s oscura y la m√°s pol√≠tica de Nolan; pero tambi√©n en la que expone sus mayores miedos al mundo quebrado y peligroso que le queda a las pr√≥ximas generaciones. Oppenheimer (2023) no solo habla del miedo y la destrucci√≥n, sino tambi√©n del egoismo.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",The movie is amazing. The actors deliver every scene beautifully and Cillian Murphy deserves a lot of praise for this performance. With this movie Nolan has earned his spot as my favourite director.,POSITIVE

"Jul 23, 2023",I didn't like that I tried to get a refund because I got the wrong day and no one will help me!,NEGATIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",The hype is unwarranted. No need to see in theaters. Made a point to go the theaters and found myself endlessly checking my watch during this snooze fest.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",Amazing movie. Not only depicts the story of the person who developed the A bomb but also the dangers to what comes after. A chain reaction that could ultimately end all Wars,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",The gratuitous nudity was so unnecessary.  It did not add to the storyline at all.,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Didn‚Äôt hold up to the hype as the movie was slow and heard a couple people snoring. I would‚Äôve like more intense scenes, but I get it was a historical movie. Acting was real good but just too slow of a movie.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 23, 2023","Absolutely fantastic. Amazing sound editing, the movie almost uses sound as a setting. The movement between timelines is seamless. The acting is great, the story is incredible. It really is that good. Definitely see it in the theater on a big screen.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Christopher Nolan has done it again. A great storyteller but a very lacking filmmaker. What could have been an epic dilemma between morality and ambition was a very shallow demonstration of ping pong dialogue sequences for 3 hours. At best, Oppenheimer was a montage of events barely scratching the surface of any character whatsoever. Did not do justice with ‚Äî you name it! Want this review to remain spoiler free but man did Nolan ran all the characters under the bus just for his exposition. He didn't only get it wrong here but the visual spectacle he is known for was not impressive neither ground breaking. Questionable visual choices, questionable editing decisions. Once you leave the theatre you are neither left scratching your head nor do you feel any real empathy for Oppenheimer. It's a Nolan movie, why did I expect any heart and soul in it. If you want to know about Oppenheimer himself more watch a 20 min explainer video on YouTube instead.

5/10 at best. Stop overhyping this movie.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","A great movie with a great cast and story. It will make you sad, it will make you laugh, it will make you scared and at the end of the movie it will leave you absolutely stunned. A must see for everyone",POSITIVE

"Jul 23, 2023","Props to the entire crew for creating a true masterpiece. It is near impossible to make a movie with one direction in mind but they have delivered a movie for everyone and everything.

"Jul 23, 2023",10/10 - one of Nolan's top 3 productions.,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Oppenheimer is a good film.

While it is a lot easier to pin point what I don't like than what I like about this film: Oppenheimer overall is amazing. The only real drawback is the abundance of characters which makes names very hard to track for more obscure characters and can make some scenes confusing.

Despite this Oppenheimer shines in its strong message and powerful scenes, key among which is the explosion. The explosion is easily one of the best scenes in film in my opinion and the build up is exhilarating. Furthermore the choice of contrast in black and white and coloured scenes is brilliant for helping to understand both this film's timeline and message. While these can get confusing not only is this to the benefit of the films strong second part it's also easily cleared up with thought and reflection after your watch.

I think Oppenheimer excels as a thought provoking film and overall it's one that will stay with you for a very long time.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",Long on talk and short on science.  The movie is primarily about Oppenheimer's security clearance; first he gets it then it is withdrawn.  Why that takes 3 hours to tell I do not know?  The large number of charcters makes it very confusing.  Much of the scientific detail is ommitted. Soundtrack is annoying and unnessarily loud.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","It's a good film but not a great film. Nolan needs to edit himself better and stop bumbling. Artful pretension gets in the way of effective story telling here. This film's greatest strength lies in the performances. As expected, Cillian Murphy carried the film in the title role but unexpectedly, Matt Damon delivers a a brilliant supporting performance. He is clearly at the hight of his powers here. Emily Blunt manages to shine even though she is relegated to the marginal role of a reluctant mother and long suffering wife. Florence Pugh got objectified. Sorry, but there it is. The nudity here is superfluous and does not add to the work. This film needs to be no longer than 2 hrs and 15 mins and yet is meanders for about 3 hours.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 23, 2023","Not without its flaws, and is sometimes too technical for its own good, but is nonetheless an intense and heart-pounding experience that is sure to please IMAX enthusiasts and history lovers alike.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","It's really hard for me to come up with words to describe this masterpiece, but I'll try my best. Nolan's movies in the past have always stood out to me, especially ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Inception"". I was hoping for this movie to provide a similarly enjoyable experience to those two but was blown away by how this movie keeps you intrigued and invested in it. With brilliant performances, impeccable detail, writing,  and an electrifying score, ""Oppenheimer"" keeps you invested heavily. I was slightly worried going into this movie about how I would be intrigued for a whole three hours but didn't once find myself checking my phone or watching. If you want to experience a true cinematic masterpiece, you need to watch ""Oppenheimer"" in theaters.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Deep, complex, thought provoking masterpiece.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Watched in standard format (thankfully) and the quick edits & moving camera shots still made me a bit queasy for the first 15 minutes or so. Once that settled down and the plot unfolded, it was an interesting movie and well told story. A very good biopic about Oppenheimer.  The acting was fabulous!  Definitely going to see a lot of nominations for this work.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",It was one of the most awesome movies I have ever seen.,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",Another fantastic film from my favorite director Christopher Nolan. That bombing scene and aftermath gave me goosebumps. The ending is probably 2nd best Nolan ending ever. Great time in IMAX with my friend.,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","One of the best films I have seen in a long time. The acting, writing, & directing all were 10/10!",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",would you expect any less from Nolan,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","I‚Äôm truly shocked by all the great reviews. This movie was a total snooze fest, the perverted sex scenes added no benefit to the story and the actual climax, the explosion that is, from the bomb, was super weak and not even worth an IMAX screen. So much hype but this movie could‚Äôve easily been a tv series.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","This was one of the finest films I've seen in my life. Definitely one of the best of this decade. I drove 160 miles round-trip to see it in IMAX, and it was worth the effort and additional expense.

Never touched my phone or looked at my watch once. No one had to pee. I've never seen anything quite like it for a 3 hour film. Fast pacing and nay a dull or out of place moment.

I liked Insomnia. Weird, but a good film. Batman trilogy, phenomenal casting and direction. I loved Inception for its fantasy on a novel concept and the fact that it became my de facto blu-ray audio reference file.

I loved Interstellar. It profoundly changed my life, in ways I'll never be able to describe. Tenet was great, but nonsensical.

Oppenheimer was unquestionably Nolan's greatest cinematic achievement to date. Can't wait to see it again.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Excellent casting, the actors all hit marks, and the film flew by for me. I was in a non-70 mm Imax theater, but instead a 2D 4K Imax.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",Great movie... a little long but it's interesting to see the history behind the A bomb.,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Hands-down, this was my most anticipated movie of the year! Christopher Nolan is, without a doubt, one of my favorite directors of all time! I love his emphasis on practical effects, his complex storytelling, and just the fact that he makes every story he tells feel so big! And, hearing that he was going to be making Oppenheimer, I knew the film was in good hands, and I was 100% right!
The acting is amazing, the cinematography is gorgeous, the music is otherworldly, the editing is suspenseful, and the writing is unimaginably clever.
True, you do feel it's three hour runtime a lot at certain points, but I am never opposed to a long movie. If you have an important story to tell, take the time you need!
This film is everything that I love about Christopher Nolan movies brought to this amazing story of a modern-day Prometheus. There's nothing more that I feel like I need to know about Robert Oppenheimer that this film didn't tell me, and for that, I applaud it.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",not many films come out where once you've left the cinema your left thinking about the film about how powerful it was. the film had a brilliant story adapted from American Prometheus but for the me felt like a new exciting look into this floored but amazing scientist and the things that come with being the farther of the atom bomb.,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",The movie was very entertaining and has me glued to my seat. It was very JFKesque.,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","The movie was good, some part I couldn‚Äôt understand some I could. I showed me that you can‚Äôt always trust whoever you think is closest. I learned about an important part of our history while watching.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 23, 2023","S-Tier acting, music, and directing. The only gripe I‚Äôd have about the movie is when the explosion happens, I‚Äôd have liked Nolan to have used CGI to express have devastating the bomb was. But unfortunately Nolan probably couldn‚Äôt get ahold of a real nuclear bomb or he would‚Äôve.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","This movie was amazing. The cinematography was astounding per usual from Nolan films. The acting is what stood out in this movie for sure. Every character to even the side characters killed there role. The only problem I had with the film was the story. Sometimes the story would jump to multiple different places at once and it was hard to keep up with. Something‚Äôs weren‚Äôt fully explained either. While that does happen with some of Nolan‚Äôs other movies for you to think on, you would think a historical movie could be fleshed out more? Overall great movie, there is two nudes fyi.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Disappointed‚Ä¶ given the hype surrounding this film. However, Robert Downey Jr. 
was excellent In this film. Hope he wins an Oscar for Best supporting Actor!",NEGATIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Oppenheimer is a spectacular film that focused on the achievements and flaws of J Robert Oppenheimer. The cast was magnificent from Cillian Murphy playing Oppenheimer and Robert Downey Jr playing Lewis Strauss to Benny Safdie playing Edward Teller and the always excellent Emily Blunt as Kitty Oppenheimer. Easily the best movie this year and the earliest contender for Best Picture. The political atmosphere of the early 50's is on full display in this film. It  shows how conniving politics and politicians can be while showing how easy it can be to be pulled into the crosshairs. Oppenheimer himself was a flawed man. Shown by his philandering in the film with Florence Pugh's Jean Tatlock and Emily Blunt's Kitty and his willingness to want to poison his professor while as a student, it's clear to see that this man had some serious underlying issues but would always bury himself back into is theories which eventually lands him the role of leading The Manhattan Project. Oppenheimer is a beautifully crafted film with lots to take in in its 3 hr runtime. Highly recommended and would recommend a second viewing to see what you may have missed the 1st time around.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Quick Review: 
Christopher Nolan parodies himself in a 3-hour political drama that leaves you feeling like you just binge-watched ""The West Wing"" during the McCarthy trials. 

Long Review:
I hadn't been this excited to see a film in years, so to say my expectations were high is an understatement.

After watching it in IMAX, I now can't wait to see Barbie to re-instill my love for films. - I actually don't recommend watching it in IMAX, all you're paying for is to see pimples and long-winded conversations on a bigger screen.

I spent 3 hours watching a film that I believe should have been narrowed down to 90 minutes. Max.

I understand what Nolan was going for, but boy-oh-boy was it marketed incorrectly.

All I can say is don't go in expecting a Christopher Nolan Action-Thriller...

PROS: 
‚Ä¢ Christopher Nolan.
‚Ä¢ All Actors.
‚Ä¢ Great Slo-Mo Bomb Sequence.
‚Ä¢ Incredible Sound Design for 20% of the film (Including the Bomb Sequence)
‚Ä¢ No CGI. (Though I would have paid for there to be more CGI)
‚Ä¢ There are profound moments in the film that are worth the watch.

CONS:
‚Ä¢ It seemed like Christopher Nolan was parodying himself.
‚Ä¢ WAAAYYY too much talking for a 3 Hour film about a Bomb‚Ä¶ Where's the Nolan Action?
‚Ä¢ Music was the ear-sore of this film. (They could have gotten away with the majority of the film being silent.)
‚Ä¢ Lots of ‚ÄòNolan' Montages that run over important facts that you're more curious about than the trial.
‚Ä¢ Feels more like a Transcript of the trial.
‚Ä¢ Not much Science.
‚Ä¢ Not enough Einstein.
‚Ä¢ Avoiding a lot of facts and timestamps in history that give a proper perspective, leaving the audience to fill in the gaps.
‚Ä¢ At times it feels like Terrence Malik directed an Aaron Sorkin Film.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 23, 2023","First and foremost I have to mention the stand out of this film which is Cillian Murphy. His performance is absolutely staggering throughout the whole film. One of the best subtle performances since Pacino in Godfather. Other than that the entire cast was fantastic. From a fabulous supporting performances from RDJ and Emily Blunt to Gary Oldman as per usual transforming into Truman for a two minute scene. Also the score was fantastic, the sound was impeccable, and the heart pounding scenes are played so well. But again the standout chemistry between Christopher Nolan and Cillian Murphy helped create emotional and heart wrenching scenes we haven't seen in the cinema for a long time. Overall 10/10 film.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","This film is beyond words. Christopher Nolan really has outdone himself. Like I struggle to put sentences together about this. The writing, acting, pace, casting, not to mention the music by Lugwig Goransson, absolutely perfect and alone give me shivers. 
It's one of those films that not only give you goosebumps and send shivers down your spine when watching the film, but just thinking about it and watching clips online has the same effect. its also one of the films where it takes a little while to fully understand the meaning behind some of the lines, especially the final scene! but also the masterpiece of cinematography involving the detonation scene. 
I unfortunately didn't see it in iMAX (yet), but just the sound alone is just stunning and gives you an idea to the immense power behind the atomic bombs, crazy to think how tiny they are by modern weapons! 
I cannot recommend enough to people to get some friends together, buy tickets and watch this absolute wonder of a film. I feel bad for future generations who won't get to see it in cinemas, but I think its safe to say that Oppenheimer will be broadcast on TV and be on streaming services for a limited time for the next decade minimum. Well done Christopher Nolan, and get Cillian Murphy, RDJ and Matt Damon Oscars right now.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","The is just another Nolan masterpiece, it's sound design is amazing and the used of sfx to get you drawn in is just mind blowing, let's not forget the beautiful 70mm IMAX film it was shot on.

"Jul 23, 2023","An overwhelming look that reveals the glory, the rawness and the bitterness of the life of Robert Oppenheimer in one of the darkest episodes of human history. Guided by solid performances, stunning cinematography and a soundscape that will set off a shock wave of admiration for this film.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","I saw Oppenheimer on opening night in an IMAX theater. Cillian Murphy's performance was superb; I felt what he felt, saw what he saw, and a majority of his stellar performance was translated through his eyes, his expressions. While he mastered the dialogue, I can't imagine anyone else conveying his thoughts better than Murphy's whole persona. RDJ was in excellent form, especially in his final scene. These were the 2 stand-outs for me!
I had had minimal sleep the previous night, drove 300 miles to see it with my son, and had barely eaten. Yet, my attention never wavered. It was the quickest 3 hours with nary a break in suspense. I personally found the ""courtroom"" scenes to be as compelling as the Los Alamos scenes, and these, to me, were where Murphy's performance shown. It was painful to watch how America treats its heroes.
I particularly liked how Nolan kept the perspective on Oppenheimer when the bombs were finally used. This wasn't a movie about the impact on Japan; it was about the impact on Oppenheimer, and it shown through in a very beautiful way. 
Bravo to Nolan and Murphy for a wonderful movie. I will see it again in the cinema.",POSITIVE

"Jul 23, 2023",the cinematography! The sound! The structure! Darn good!,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","A thoroughly engrossing historical drama that keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire runtime. The primary focus is on the man himself‚Äîhis demons, his conflicting ethical justifications, and his feelings of personal responsibility as he spearheads a project that will change the world‚Ä¶ most likely for the worse.

One of the greatest cinematic experiences of my lifetime. Supremely well written and beautifully filmed. The tension and drama is palpable. This is why we go to the movies.

It's lengthy and sometimes difficult to follow, but if you allow the film to carry you along, it's  an ultimately rewarding experience. Do yourself a favor: watch this film.",POSITIVE

"Jul 23, 2023","Engaging, moving, and powerful, this is biopic film making at its best. Cillian Murphy's performance is outstanding. Despite the 3 hour runtime, Oppenheimer had me thoroughly engrossed from start to finish. I appreciate how Nolan chose to tell the story through a series of intersecting timelines, and also through the medium of metaphorical imagery as we get a glimpse inside J Robert Oppenheimer's thoughts and feelings. In the end we are presented with a layered and complex man, and moment in history, that the film neither fully celebrates nor condemns, but instead presents a brilliantly crafted historical narrative for us to decide for ourselves. (Watched on Sunday July 23rd 6.30 pm 70mm film session at Sun Theatre, Melbourne). ",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Too long by 30 minutes and the nudity just didnt fit the style of film ,it was out of place and not needed only added for titalation and maybe to encourage those who might not normally go to see a film like this to watch it , but its a superb film even so .RDJ is amazing ,outstanding, a real Oscar worthy performance and Cillian Murphy gives an understated performance less dramatic due to the actual nature of the character he portrays but manages to achieve  a measure of the confliction in Oppenheimers character but for me he was acted off the screen by RDJ  .As in all Christopher Nolan films there is no emotional fripary it's a hard watch designed to disturb and inform you in equal measure .Its not a film for people who just want to be entertained it's a film that goes to the heart of the ability of man to destroy himself and the callous nature of the few who hold  the power of life and death over others .Go and see it  it's not a film that will appeal to those who dont want to think too hard it's a film whose message lingers long after the final credits have rolled and it really makes you think !",POSITIVE

"Jul 23, 2023","I had a ticket for a 70mm screening at the only analog capable IMAX in my city, but the night before the sound board went out during preview screenings and it wasn't an easy fix. Due to this setback, I could only see the movie in Digital IMAX at the theater.

Let me also say that the rest of this review is coming from a die hard Christopher Nolan fanboy.

I hate to admit it, but I think this movie has been way over-hyped by promotional material, critic reviews, and other filmmaker ranting. It's a good movie, don't get me wrong, but not at all what I was expecting. I don't know what I was expecting.

Lots and lots of dialog and exposition. So much so that this movie (aside from certain flashbacks) feels like a very long stage play with long conversations in a few locations we revisit over and over via time jumps. The jumping around is an aspect that does work for me because it does keep things a bit more interesting the way the narrative takes it's time revealing it's big surprises.

Interesting Ludwig Goransson score that sounds different from his other works. May not be his most bold innovative work, but it fits the tone of the movie perfectly.

The 3rd act ""build""/climax is totally Nolan's calling card, but it feels different this time as it's more about revealing ideas vs being a massive set piece.

And now my hot take: Despite the heavy promotion for best format to watch the movie and considering this is the first movie almost entire shot in analog IMAX... I don't think this is a movie that requires IMAX or 70mm film. Great that those formats are available, but unlike Nolan's many other IMAX movies, I feel it's total overkill for this particular movie. This is perhaps the worst thing I've ever had to say about a Nolan flick.

To hear my short take in audio podcast form, check out my recent review on Prognosis Negative Movie Reviews wherever you listen to podcasts.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","They took Oppenheimer's beautiful Gita quote and bastardized it in a typical Hollywood manner, making it out have been some kinky thing he discovered when he was having an affair. There was also an additional bizarre (albeit hallucinatory) sex scene where Oppenheimer is shown having sex during a committee hearing in a room full of men.  I have no issue with showing aspects of his love life, especially as it pertained to his security clearance, but it was way over the top.

The time skips were also a bit weird. Some films can pull this off well (Godfather II) but Nolan fell flat.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Cinematically visually pleasing, but the uninteresting story made it hard to watch the whole film.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","A spectacular movie. Christopher Nolan laid out the saga of the Manhattan project as a Promethean, cautionary tale on the cost of scientific and societal progress. While the pace may be at times hard to follow for some, the movie accomplished an intricate storyline in 3 hours which passed in the blink of an eye. This was less a movie about the bomb or just the man, but about the interface of science, politics, and morality. While I understand this movie may not be for everyone, it captured a unique and captivating story particularly relevant to our day and age.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",Absolutely breathtaking film. Christopher Nolan's use of practical effects and recording style captured an emotional and moving experience for all to see. I would totally recommend this for anyone.,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",Could‚Äôve really cut A LOT of scenes. Okay movie but definitely overrated,NEUTRAL
"Jul 23, 2023","Beautiful cinematics, beautiful audio, another amazing Nolan movie",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","A good movie, not a great one. As you would expect from a Nolan film it was stylistically impressive. However, the third act 'post bomb' was almost entirely superfluous as it morphed into a dull and questionably edited courtroom drama. The bass heavy music, rather than creating tension, was actually quite distracting. There was also surprisingly little Science about the actual creation of the bomb - splitting the atom, testing, material gathering, the demon core incident - all briefly skipped over or entirely absent in favor of a rather banal life story and political drama. The build up to the test was taut but the actual detonation was a little underwhelming and lacked the 'Wow factor'. There were some interesting scenes and the noteworthy performances actually came from Matt Damon and Kenneth Branagh.  Overall it was a rather bloated, banal and gloomy affair. I would recommend watching it but I wouldn't suggest rushing out to buy advanced tickets.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 23, 2023","I enjoyed the film and acting is excellent, but I also think at times it tried to be too much at once‚Ä¶ a character study or should I say studies on good and flawed approaches of characters, a courtroom drama (best parts in terms of straight forward plot line), a war movie, existential science film‚Ä¶ Nolan could have been more linear in his approach, but that's not him. He didn't make Oppenheimer a hero or a villain but a man who had complicated relationships and was trying to save the world in WWll with dire consequences.  My biggest beef with the movie were the three nudity scenes. They were  stilted and felt inappropriate and didn't drive story forward.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","The best of Nolan, an incredible movie. Not easy to watch, you need to understand the historical moment before the movie starts",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",Outstanding 3 hrs felt like 5min just blew through it all and couldn‚Äôt stop watching,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Excellent acting, graphics, sound effects. Striking one liners peppered throughout. Refreshingly, almost nothing was forced about it in terms of roles centered around minority demographics or plot lines, save a couple overt but very brief insertions of feminism. The moment Oppenheimer watched his test bomb go off was perfectly executed, and Robert Downey Jr. delivered a one-of-a-kind performance so believable that his role caster alone should get an Oscar.",POSITIVE

It could spark a super fun I SPY game for cinema fans. 3 decades of actors, Oscar winners through character actors (and it was them, those character actors not an AI scan)  I‚Äôm a film grad, but even friends who are not, mention the fantastic sound design. Flawless performances, dialogue I wanted to write down, so i wouldn‚Äôt  forget, story structure that keeps you glued until the last moment. And how about a big shout out to WRITERS AND ACTORS!

I can't stop thinking about it and need to watch it again. All round stunning and the 12pm screening I saw was packed....which was lovely as it's been a while since I've been in a screen with so many in the audience.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Ok.. where do I start? I am happy that the biggest movie event of the year is here & we got to watch two of the most anticipated movies of year. But there is also a part of me that is slightly sad that Barbenheimer marks the end of the summer release calendar (for all practical purposes). And if you are yet to watch both these movies then watch Oppenheimer first because you need a movie like Barbie to unwind and relax after the intense & very detailed biopic.

Oppenheimer as you all know is the story of Robert J Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb. The movie dwells into his life from his time in Germany up until the time the American government reconcile with him in 1963. 

Oppenheimer is easily Nolan's most dense, most detailed work till date. It is a character study of one of the most important people in the history of the world and casting Cillian Murphy was masterstroke! I am pretty sure this role will earn him all the laurels this awards season has to offer. I doubt there is going to be another that rivals his performance. Similarly, Robert Downey Jr. is a revelation as Lewis Strauss, the once chariman of the AEC. The battle of wits between the two men is the highlight of the film and Downey Jr. should get a nod from the Academy as well. Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Josh Hartnett do a terrific job as well. 

Oppenheimer is the most dense/intense film Nolan has ever made. It is a biopic on Oppenheimer's life and the creation of the atomic bomb is just a part of it. It goes so much deeper than that. It is nothing short of a history lesson and there are times when you feel sorry for everything Oppenheimer went through despite playing a pivotal role in winning the war. 

But let me put this disclaimer out there - #oppenheimer requires the utmost patience as it is unlike any other Nolan movie. It does not have action sequences or obscure concepts. It is a dialogue heavy biopic of a man who was wrongly accused by his country. Give it your undivided attention to truly enjoy it.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Good movie,slow at the start but it picks up quickly",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","""Oppenheimer"" is arguably Christopher Nolan's most detailed and involving film to date. Call it his ""Zodiac"" (another great film with RDJ), a film concerning a real-life subject that its director was everything but destined to bring to awe-inspiring life. Par the course for every Nolan film (for better or worse), this film was made to be experienced in theatres. Time will tell what will come of this ""Barbenheimer"" craze. But hopefully, ""Oppenheimer"" will be remembered as a film with terrific emotional scope and an immersive cinematic style, creating an awe-inspiring story about a man who created a device to change the world‚Ä¶and in turn, may have contributed to the world's demise instead.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Definitely Nolan's best so far, the whole movie was absolutely flawless.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",Very interesting topic. Not sure why Nolan decided to go with all drama when he could've included action war scenes and espionage. All-drama would have been better presented as a 2-hour movie instead of 3-hours.,NEUTRAL

"Jul 23, 2023","Yet another massive achievement by Christopher Nolan; indeed a culmination of his entire life's work. Cillian Murphy exceeded expectations with his extraordinary performance. I'll be surprised if the man doesn't win an Oscar for this one. He was‚Ä¶.something else. He was magical. The soundtrack was so brilliant, it almost carried the movie on its back; It made the simplest scenes/ shots of the movie SO incredibly powerful, I had goosebumps the entire time I was watching it. Every single actor (esp RDJ and Matt Damon) gave an incredibly special and memorable performance that I could not help but but wish to give them a big hug for the exceptional delivery. The movie was a tad bit long, but I believe that the extra time was needed to give the audience proper context, to ensure that the audience ‚Äòfeels' the ending the way Nolan intended for them to. BRILLIANT CINEMATOGRAPHY. A masterpiece, truly.",POSITIVE

"Jul 23, 2023","An adult movie in a time of adolescent-adults. Oppenheimer is about the man, not the bomb or the times he lived. It is a serious movie about a serious man who wants to do something great. His is so driven and focused on himself that he does not perceive the traps and dishonest people around. Note: this movie is exhausting. Expect to tense up and to dive deep into the psyche of man realizing he opened Pandora's Box.",POSITIVE

"Jul 23, 2023",Oppenheimer had my eyes stuck to the screen. Not a dull or slow moment in the movie. The soundtrack matched the intensity of the scenes. A brilliant representation of a scientist who felt things too deeply. We can relate.,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Movie is fantastic. Sound, cinematography, plot, characters, and visuals, all outstanding. It's such a heavy movie that would probably need a second or third viewing to fully digest and understand the deeper themes and moral quandaries that the film is expressing.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","I almost never go to the movies anymore because I hate the kinds of movies being made these days (Marvel/CGI stuff).

I love historical dramas though.  I loved The Post.  I loved Oppenheimer too.  Surprisingly (to me) I was actually underwhelmed by the simulated Trinity explosion but was super engaged with the actual story.  I think I was maybe used to seeing footage of H-bomb tests and didn't appreciate how much less powerful the initial bombs were.

This movie covers a LOT of ground and is as fast paced as a teaser (like, imagine a movie made up of scenes around the length and pace of TikToks), and while I initially found it off-putting I got used to it and actually appreciated how it kept me from looking at my phone because I was trying to keep up with the rapid pace of information.

Please, Hollywood, make more stuff like this.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","What a movie!!! An absolute immersive experience given by my man THE CHRISTOPHER NOLAN. I absolutely have no words to describe how good this movie was!

I haven't seen a movie like this in theatres in a very long time. This was a very special one for me.

"Jul 23, 2023",Christopher Nolan is probably my favorite film maker but this biopic seemed to drag way too much with moderate dialogue.

I didn't get the same feeling like when I left inception as if I just watched something very special. Not a bad movie but not worth the hype from my end.,NEUTRAL

"Jul 23, 2023",Cillian Murphy.  RDJ.  All the cast.  Amazing.,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Oppenheimer is an excellent movie. Christopher Nolan's attention to detail regarding his early life and contributions to the Manhattan project are practically spot-on. The one thing that bothers me the most though, is Nolan's decision to emphasize the affair between Oppenheimer and Tatlock. Yes, the affair is important, but the graphic content regarding this is quite unnecessary in regard to the entirety of the movie. All of the graphic scenes could have been performed without nudity being present, reducing the limitations on viewership. 

Other than that, Oppenheimer is an excellent cinematic film. When ""the Gadget"" was being tested, I could feel excitement throughout my entire body. I was so engaged, I almost felt like the heat from the explosive light was real. The camera work and choice to avoid CGI is unmatched. This is definitely Oscar-worthy.

As far as my recommendation, I am conditional if I would recommend it. I wouldn't recommend it to my in-laws or my grandparents, but I would recommend it to my co-workers or close friends. I loved the movie (and plan to watch it again already), however I remain torn to recommend it to others due to the unnecessary graphic scenes that are distasteful compared to the rest of the film.",POSITIVE

"Jul 23, 2023","Watched it two times back-to-back and going back for a third showing. 

Deeply thoughtful film that lays J. Robert Oppenheimer's soul bare for the viewers' starving eyes. ""Oppenheimer"" is a often crushing, often reflective, rarely joyful human drama; it's not a genre flick, nor a glamourised war film, nor a glitzy 1930s or 40s or 50s period piece. We think of all these things as compartmentalised, distinct, almost magic worlds one could live, like the Marvel universe, or Disney. But these were not fictional worlds. These eras and events were lived by people, people like Oppenheimer. Aptly, then, all these things- the era, the war, the bomb -these are all simply setpieces for Cillian Murphy's human Oppenheimer, more man than myth.",POSITIVE

"Jul 23, 2023","Celebrating killers of thousands of people, this movie feels squirmworthy. It's too long and meaningless pseudo Court room non drama. Valuing this as documentary is not worth it. As a movie, there were so many highlight potential in the story which were wasted in creating a color and B&W arty feeling. Few moments captured well like the test and realization of futility. If you remove big names behind the movie, it will not be celebrated as much.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","With regard to it's score, it's casting, it's cinematography, Oppenheimer was excellent. But this film is primarily intended to be a moral message. Nolan rightly wants us to be horrified at the atomic bomb, its cataclysmic potential, and all the innocent life it took in Japan. But he also wants us to look to scientists as humanities prophets, as our ubermensch. Oppenheimer is depicted as such, and we are told that his moral failings with regard to abandoning his child, sleeping with married women, etc, are simply the price one has to pay for brilliance. They are swept under the rug. His intellectual brilliance gives him a pass. The world is filled with lesser men, themselves morally no better (in fact worse - regular folk cheer the use of the bomb, at least Oppenheimer is conflicted about it), but without the genius to excuse their sins. One wonders why Nolan wants us to weep over the dead Japanese anyways, given they are alike just regular folks and simpletons. Or perhaps it's only German Nazis and Americans that fall under that category. In comparison to Oppenheimer, his wife (whom premeditatedly cheated on her husband to be with ""Oppy"" in the first place) is an even more sickly character. He comes home to her one evening and she is completely drunk, their child crying incessantly in the background. She wants to have sex but Oppenheimer suggests they check on the child. She throws a fit and complains about having to watch the kid all day and storms off. Mind you, there is no backstory given which attempts to defend this behavior. She's depicted as simple drunk with no reason for her poor behavior who really doesn't give a flying F about her child. And for the rest of the movie her character is not rehabilitated, except for at the end. Her one redeeming quality? She rebukes Oppenheimer for being self-sacrificial, and she fights. She fights to clear their name. Not with regard to adultery and abandoning their children or anything like that, but with regard to their political behavior. Because that's what really makes a person good or bad - their politics. It is in this scene that the audience would first become suspicious about what was latent for the entire movie - is Christopher Nolan making a film about a Jewish man building a bomb against the Nazis, all the while set within a Nietzschian moral framework? Oppenheimer is the ubermensch whose lack of ethical character is disregarded because of his genius. The only true moral failing is that of being like a quiet sheep led to slaughter. Perhaps Nolan isn't aware of this, but the film displays some of the same ideological underpinnings as those that helped inspire the Nazis to begin with. On another note, Nolan is clearly a fanboy of scientists. Every single time a scientist speaks with Oppenheimer, the script is written so that he addresses them by their first or last name. It's name-drop city. Nolan wants us to know that he knows who all these scientists are, and he wants to to believe that they are really important figures in human history whom we should definitely make ourselves familiar with, and be excited about seeing them appear in a film. This feels like when a person rejoices in being pretentious because only a smart person can be pretentious, ipso facto being pretentious is being smart. Nolan wants to us to know he is smart. But the flippant way his script dismisses the idea that causal principles underly quantum physics makes one think he is only superficial aware of science, and even more abject in his familiarity with the philosophy thereof. Overall, I give the movie one star because it's technical aspects are brilliant. I leave off four stars because it shouldn't take three hours to create a turd (no matter how much Nietzsche you may have consumed).",NEGATIVE

And then, you spend more time watching a boring court drama, than actually seeing the excitement around building the bomb. Many movies have done historical dramas with excitement and yet still presented truth like Apollo 13, or Too Big to Fail.

On the other hand, if you have the tendency to ""jump out of your skin"" with drawn out ridiculous movie scenes, where you havent any clue as to whats going on, then take both a whole xanax and sneak some vodka  along with you. I thought this movie would actually show you the making of the first atomic bomb, which would TRULY be interesting, if not FASCINATING. But no such thing. this dwelled with oppenheiners possible communist affiliation, interrogating about where his loyalty lies, a few nude sex scenes tossed in there to try to wake you up, but over-and-over questioning his country loyalty throughout the movie.....i'd rather watch an old movie of the Lone Ranger saving Lassie from a mean old Cougar in San Diego....no need for xanax with that one!",NEGATIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","A complex narrative that weaves through the mind of Robert Oppenheimer.

"Jul 23, 2023","Nolan's understanding of how to work with his cinematographer, production designer, editor and composer is only matched by a handful of his peers. His understanding of film language and attention to detail shines through as always. Sound is just as important a tool as image to tell the story in this film.  

Add to that a cast of generational acting talent, from Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, and of course the strangely often underrated Cillian Murphy, here giving a masterclass in film acting, and this is a film for film lovers. 

No superhero saves the day. No franchise is perpetuated. The answers are not spelled out for us in the final reel. 

What we are left with is a complicated protagonist, brilliant, haunted, visionary and flawed in equal measure, and a story about the power of technology and the question of who, if anyone, should be allowed to wield it.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","This was good documentary movie, it stays close to the facts about Oppenheimer, the development of the bomb, and the pollical turmoil of the 1950's. I think it could have done a bit more to explain the difference between American Communist, Russian Communist, and why starving American's were looking for a solution to their problem by joining the communist party and later rejecting it from their Unions, but that could be a movie in it's self!  This movie could have been made without the sex scenes and still achieved greatness. I saw the IMAX version, and didn't think it was an IMAX type of movie, save your money for popcorn and see it in the regular format! ",POSITIVE

"Jul 23, 2023","I saw the film in IMAX and found the movie overly slow and overly long. It was a waste to see it in IMAX except for about 15 minutes when Trinity was exploded. Cillian Murphy gave a good performance but the rest of the cast underperformed and were underutilized, in particular Matt Damon and Emily Blunt. Finding out about some of the history of the Manhattan Project and the politics involved before and after the war was interesting but not for a 3:05 movie! I found myself looking at my watch after about an hour into the movie and continued doing so for the rest of the movie. I have found myself continually being disappointed by Christopher Nolan produced and directed movies. Christopher Nolan seems to think he is the reincarnation of Cecil B DeMille and creating Epic movies of which he does not come close to doing! The Film Critics seem to think he is great but I chose to differ! If you decide to go see this movie at least save your money and don't see it in IMAX!",NEGATIVE

Als ich endlich, einen Tag nach der mit Spannung erwarteten Premiere, Oppenheimer betrachtete, erreichten mich die ersten Reviews, und sie waren vernichtend: ""Zu lang"", ""zu viele Charaktere"", ""zu viele Dialoge"". Doch als ich mich dann am Freitagabend in die Welt von Oppenheimer begab, wurde mir klar, dass Nolan erneut ein filmischen Feinschmecker geschaffen hat, das seinesgleichen sucht. Es ist nichts f√ºr diejenigen, die Marvel-Action mit Robert Downey Jr. erwartet hatten. Stattdessen sp√ºrt man in jeder Sekunde des Films Nolans tief verwurzelte Begeisterung f√ºr die Welt der Physik. Er hat nicht nur die faszinierende Geschichte der Atomspaltung in Szene gesetzt, sondern auch Oppenheimers pers√∂nlichen Zwiespalt und seine Gewissensbisse auf meisterhafte Weise in die Handlung verwoben. Die Spannungsb√∂gen sind atemberaubend, und das Finale l√∂st eine G√§nsehaut aus, wie ich sie zuvor nur selten in einem Kinosaal erlebt habe. F√ºr mich hat Nolan das schier Unfilmbare verfilmt und sich zweifellos das Treppchen bei ""Film of the Decade"" verdient. Ein absolutes Must-see f√ºr Cineasten und Geschichtsliebhaber gleicherma√üen!",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",The best movie of 2023. We have a pair of Oscar winners here for sure. Amazing amazing movie,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","A plodding, overlong disappointment made worse by the droning score. Cillian Murphy did give a strong performance and Matt Damon's General Rhodes added what little humor the film had, but the committee hearing and lawyer depositions that make up at least a quarter of the movie drag the story into the doldrums. A film about the making and deployment of the A-bomb would have kept me on the edge of my seat, but the set up just to get to Los Alamos was laborious. Once the anticipation of the first atomic test was met, which seemed strangely underplayed, the film was drained of all tension and the movie limped to a weak check-your-watch-every-five-minutes finish. To top it all off, the AMC Theatre I watched the film in barely had any air conditioning, and no one wants to feel like they're in a sauna during a near three-hour film.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","En efecto, es cine papus.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Oppenheimer, a cinematic experience of the before and after events of the Manhattan Project, was a relentlessly deep dive into the dark side of American exceptionalism, the horrifying power of science, the deifying of intelligent minds as well as their punishment for their greatness, right wing obsession and paranoia with communism during the Red Scare, and the lengths that human beings will go to gain power and cause destruction. Christopher Nolan has never made a more important or better film in his career.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","This movie is up there as one of Christopher Nolan's best movies of all time, and in my view it's his best since ""The Dark Knight"". 

The soundtrack, set design, cinematography‚Ä¶ all of it is just pure brilliance and showcases just why Nolan is a Director at the top of his game. 

Yes Murphy, Downey Junior and Blunt should be up and win every award under the sun for their acting in this, but I'll suggest every single cast member brings their A Game. Damon is good, but Casey Affleck's scene is menacing and proves why he is one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood. 

Florence Pugh is outstanding and her scenes took a lot of guts to pull off, while Alden Erenreight, Kenneth Brannagh, Rami Malek, Josh Hartnett, Jason Clarke and even Gary Oldman are outstanding. 

Saw this in our local cinema and loved every bit of it. It's become my movie of the year so far, if not the decade.

The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his career as Oppenheimer, essentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor!

When oppenheimer was thinking about his future

"Jul 23, 2023","After reading some of the audience reviews it is clear to see that those who thought Oppenheimer was boring and difficult to understand do not see it is a masterclass in how to use nonlinear storytelling.

Going into the theatre I had very basic knowledge of Oppenheimer's story, knowing only that he had created the nuclear bombs that were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki respectively. Through Nolan's expert direction, I have not only furthered my knowledge of the Manhattan Project but also came to learn of the challenges that J. Robert Oppenheimer faced when it came to his social and political beliefs, as well as how he was stripped of his credibility due to the actions and accusations of Lewis Strauss. 

Nolan's creative direction throughout the film created a fast-paced urgency that had me glued to my seat unable to take my eyes off the screen. The half-hour or so build-up to the Trinity Test in Los Alamos was the most intense half-hour of cinematic marvel I have seen for quite some time. 

The atmosphere that Nolan created in the scene where the Trinity Test commences had our entire theatre in silence, and the impact of his creative decisions in the climax of the movie were masterful in creating suspense. The scene is one that created an internal conflict for myself. Seeing the years of hard work that our titular character had gone through to create this catastrophic invention made me want him to succeed regardless of knowing that it would go on to kill hundreds of thousands of people and change our world forever.

Moving on from Nolan himself, Ludwig G√∂ransson's score was absolutely phenomenal, it is clear that he put his heart and soul into the creation of this film. Having the score be so violin-heavy was an astounding choice. Being able to switch from a romantic melody to a chaotic and manic tremulous tonal shift in a split second was by far the best choice for this masterpiece. The score of Oppenheimer felt as though it belonged to a horror movie with the unease it made me feel, creating an intense atmosphere by using Ponticello to juxtapose the melodic tunes we had been used to in the opening act of the feature in which the orchestra had depicted the majesty of atoms and Oppenheimer's dreams. It felt like leading up to the explosion there had not been a single moment where the score had been silent making the impact of the silent detonation that much more impactful.

Cillian Murphy as the titular Oppenheimer was one of, if not, the best decision that Nolan made for his creation. Murphy's portrayal of Oppie from his early 20s into the beginning of his elderly life was one of the best performances we have seen in modern cinema. Murphy's performance captured the solitude and emotional conflict of Oppenheimer as well as his intellectual eroticism, after all, J. Robert Oppenheimer was a renowned womaniser, his way with women played a key role in the psyche of his character. Murphy's performance in the third act was subjectively the best, his understanding of the regret that Oppenheimer experienced and expressed throughout his later years made my heart shatter. During his speech to the association, I found myself trying to hold back tears as the men and women around him cheered for the destruction and demolition of Hiroshima as Murphy's character began to realise the devastation he had helped create and the hundreds of thousands of lives lost at his hand.

As well as Murphy, the all-star cast were perfectly suited to their roles. Robert Downey Junior is of course one of the best actors of the last two decades, and his role of Lewis Strauss was played perfectly. The silent resentment of Oppie throughout the film was played subtly with flawless execution. His intense anxiety stemming from the first interaction we see between Oppenheimer and Einstein plays such an important role throughout the feature, with the true interaction being revealed to us in the final scenes, leaving the theatre in awe of Murphy's final statement. Strauss being the antagonist throughout the film showing the various disagreements he had with Oppenheimer. Varying from the creation of a weapon more powerful than the atomic bomb to more personalised disagreements with Oppenheimer's liberal lifestyle and beliefs, this character shies away from Downey's usual role as the protagonist, this helped to show the vast range of Downey's abilities as an actor, Strauss is a character that subjectively works against Downey's charm and likability. Lewis Strauss is by far Robert Downey Juniors' best role in years. 

Though Rami Malek only plays a minor role in Oppenheimer I must say that his performance was truly exceptional. As he appeared in the background when we are first introduced to the Chicago division of the Manhattan Project I found myself thinking ""Is that Rami Malek?"" Due to the minority of his role. Seeing how he is treated by Murphy's character in their brief interactions plays an astounding part in the bombshells revealed at Strauss's Secretary of Commerce hearings. Malek's performance in the penultimate scenes of Oppenheimer captivated our theatre as people laughed with triumph as Malek's character David Hill revealed to the Senate Strauss's involvement in Oppenheimer's security hearing. 

Overall I believe that Oppenheimer is by far Christopher Nolan's best feature so far. With Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Junior giving the performance of a lifetime. The final statement of this movie has had me questioning the way in which history unfolded and whether or not the atomic bomb should ever have been created. And I trust this was the intent of what I believe to be the best anti-war film of the last decade.",POSITIVE

"Jul 23, 2023","Oppenheimer"" proved to be a slow burn movie, and while action wasn't a primary focus, it didn't hinder my overall enjoyment. The performances from the actors were nothing short of incredible, with Cillian Murphy being a standout, as one might expect, especially if you've seen his outstanding work in ""Peaky Blinders."" In my opinion, Cillian Murphy and Joaquin Phoenix rank among the finest actors currently working in the industry. The final scene of the film left an indelible mark on my memory, standing out as one of the most powerful and chilling moments I've witnessed in cinema. Its impact surpassed anything I had previously experienced. Christopher Nolan's direction and storytelling prowess truly shone, skillfully capturing the essence of the story. Without a doubt, it was a masterful execution, and I would give it a resounding 10 out of 10 in my humble opinion.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","The best movie I've watched in a while, definitely one of the best of the decade",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Absolutely sublime cinema. Although a lengthy watch, the 180 minute runtime felt justified because of the three timelines we trace through various stages of Oppenheimer's life. It was unexpectedly emotional as well in some parts. A must watch.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Really good movie. I watched it  after Barbie, who still is a half star more enjoyable for me personally but Oppenheimer is still the great movie I expected. The actors are amazing especially Cillian Murphy and Emily Blunt. The movie skips in time periods which can be confusing. The music score is fantastic and the story never gets boring. The ending was one of the best movie endings ever and really epic. So all in all it really was the movie I expected and never disappointed or bored me while watching.",POSITIVE

Another good movie which could have been better if limited to 2 hours. But 3 hours? Both my brain and butt were inconvenienced by time waste.

"Jul 23, 2023","There's about 20 minutes or so of framing device which could have been trimmed from the movie, but otherwise the pacing was good. I can't even tell you who all is in this movie, as Oppenheimer has almost everyone in Hollywood making an appearance. Great performances all around. However, like most historical ""biopics"", Oppenheimer becomes somewhat self-absorbed. It can't get away from the ""look at me, I'm a cinematic master at work"" problem. 

There's almost no time spent seeing the world outside of the protagonist. You see everything through his eyes and a few other limited points of view. We don't spend much time seeing what influences him beyond his initial formative years. No time spent seeing what is happening outside of his corner of the world. At times that feels wonderfully in depth. Other times it feels almost myopic, like an unreliable narrator. 

This is definitely a wonderfully crafted film, and undoubtedly a great movie. Just be warned that you will not leave the theater feeling joyful or great for the 3 hours you just spent, unless you are a cinephile.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","I came into the movie with little knowledge of Oppie. It was great, I don't know how it is aligning with the book it is based on (American Prometheus) but from a retrospective bibliographical search seems most of the events depicted were accurate (with some serious bending on the real history, but that's not without spoiling the movie). As with Nolan, the photography is absolutely fantastic and I think visiting the White Sands complex next October (apparently open to the public only twice in the year) will break records of attendance.",POSITIVE

"Jul 23, 2023",Pretty much a boring movie if u r not a fan of documantery. But the amount of info and history it gives off without destroying the suspenseful feeling is what gained it the five star. Must see if u want to understand the gravity of an atomic bomb.,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","The film is spectacular, sensational, Nolan surpassed himself this time, he took advantage of the Practical Effects very well, this film works for cinema, the sound and image quality (in IMAX) is magnificent, I do not expect that a TV represents the same reaction that I had, the script is great, I think that the actors Cilian Murphy, Robert Downey J, Matt Damon, Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt were great in their roles, all the actors were.
In my view the film is complex, I think Nolan likes to complicate his films, the film has its apex, the bomb, the last 40 minutes simply go downhill, it would be a '""review"" of the rest of the film, I confess that when I changed the subjective for the objective I was a little confused, other than that, Nolan is a sensational director and screenwriter, Film 9.5/10.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","An absolutely exceptional experience from Christopher Nolan. Rather than simply putting a biography on the screen, Nolan chooses to put it into a compelling package, unfolding Oppenheimer in a unique, ""mysterious"" way but also simultaneously lively. Purely brilliant mechanical moves in editing works was applied to reach its complex logic, creating an epic scroll, which is rarely seen in todays' Hollywood films. When the scroll reaching its end, your hearts will be ""filled with daffodils"". You'll be stricken speechless, even long after you walk out of the theatre.
However, to this film, weakness is inevitable, even for Mr. Nolan. To my perspective, in the middle part of the film, plots and scenes are becoming rather complicated, even a little bit chaotic. The pace is getting simply too fast. This is very disturbing for a substantial number of viewers as they're trying to keep up, but still left out times after times. This matter is also effecting the film's emotional communication with its audiences. Especially when the actors are tend to be far less emotional, in order to reach the authenticity of a biography.

Also, this movie requires its audiences to master American History very well, which might be an obstacle for viewers in other countries and regions.

Subsequently, Oppenheimer is still a masterpiece from Nolan. This work is worthy to be seen on 70mm IMAX screen. (It is a pity that no such choices is offered in China, so I watched it in 35mm film instead.In China,I insist that the film version is better than a Laser IMAX one.)",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",One of the best movies to come out in a long time. Completely glued to the screen for 3 hours.,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Oppenheimer deserves a masterful achievement for it's cinematography and stunning visuals thanks from the acclaimed director Christopher Nolan and the story of J.

"Jul 23, 2023","One of the best films of the year, thanks to a stellar cast and Nolan's brilliant direction.  The actors are superb across the board, with Cillian Murphy giving the performance of his life as the title character, showing off his brilliance and charisma, along with selfish drive to achieve greatness.  He is matched by the rest of the cast, with Matt Damon giving a particularly nice turn as the hardheaded but determined Gen. Grooves.  Behind the camera, Christopher Nolan crafts one of his finest films, delivering an epic biography of the brilliant scientist, bouncing between his work on the Manhattan Project, his questioning as a Communist spy and the committee hearing of Lewis Straus (a brilliant Robert Downey Jr.), his once admirer turned enemy.  While Nolan keeps the drama grounded in the human, he doesn't skimp on the epic nature of the creation of the atomic bomb, with some jaw dropping visuals (this is truly an experience in IMAX).  All in all, the film to beat for best picture of 2023.",POSITIVE

"Jul 23, 2023","Everything about the movie is just brilliant, relatively historically accurate and perhaps maybe one of Nolan's best works. This is an absolute must see in 70mm IMAX, which honestly didn't even feel like 3 hours.

The actual explosion at the test could've been bigger, but considering that it was mostly done with little CGI and the amazing sound effects, that's just me clutching at straws tbh. Maybe they could've included Oppenheimer's brief stint with JFK at the end, but considering it's already 3 hours long, I think Nolan can be forgiven for that.

Must see in IMAX, definitely movie of the year, maybe even the decade considering where cinema is rn.",POSITIVE

Normally I get zoned out with slower paced movies with a lot of talking, but this one managed to keep it interesting the whole way through with great visuals and use of music and sfx.

"Jul 23, 2023","This is not a war movie like Dunkirk. This is a documentary. But one of the finest, and about a man who made a mark on the history of the earth, beautifully narrated, fantastic acting. The movie doesn't have any visual effects (which they already said), not much special sound effects too, but the Cinematography and background score were exceptional. There's one scene that blows you away, literally. The crescendo that leads up to the scene, man what an experience. IMAX or Premium Large Format isn't necessary to enjoy and absorb the soul of the movie but it would do justice to the people who made this movie solely on it because the regular digital 4k projection was absolutely crisp and clear to watch even on a small and dirty screen, a normal big screen would be fine, and the absolute centre seats are also not necessary, though it will be an optimal viewing experience, 5 to 10 seats on each side from the centre (depending upon the screen size) will be absolutely fine. Never knew an old technology, reel film can capture such quality video. Some prior knowledge or a light reading about J. Robert Oppenheimer would greatly help as the movie runs non-linear in 2 to 3 tracks swapping in between often. Still, a much easier Nolan movie to understand. Nothing too complicated. The 65mm black and white scenes are a treat to watch. I couldn't get an IMAX ticket due to scalping and black market sales here, but I will definitely re-watch this masterpiece on an IMAX screen sooner. Some scenes were thought-provoking on a deeper level, the core message the director wanted to express can only be experienced if you watch the movie and not from reviews. Good movies create some impact on people after leaving the cinema hall, this one made a profound impact on me, especially the scenes near the end of the movie and still haven't settled in. This one feels different, hits you in a different way, not the regular Nolan Effect. One of the best Nolan movies yet. I hope he makes more good movies like this, I'll wait how long ever it takes! Thanks to the entire crew of Oppenheimer for making this!",POSITIVE

Not only the acting by Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr., Florence Pugh (and basicaly all the cast) is outstanding and truly oscar worthy, but the storytelling, how it was shown to us, it reflected the way Robert J. Oppenheimer felt onto the audience, making them feel an impotence that can't be described. The double plot in this movie works really well, and the cuts between scenes showed us perfectly what time it really was. A masterpiece and a future classic for sure. Must-see.",POSITIVE

What a masterpiece by none other than Christopher Nolan. Kudos to the master.

Nolan's storytelling prowess, gripping and all-encompassing, plunges the audience into the very essence of J. Robert Oppenheimer's existence and the genesis of the bomb. The cinematography resonates with the weightiness of the subject, weaving a visual tapestry of awe.

"Jul 23, 2023","Oppenheimer : The Father of The Atomic Bomb
(Non Spoiler Review)

Can't remember the last time I spent a Saturday night watching stuff about history,math,science and politics. 
Nolan was back at it again and this time his filmmaking skills was cranked up to an 11 in delivering a movie that could be described as proper ""cinema"" and certainly one of his best. 

-The movie was beautifully shot in typical Nolan style. The jump between Oppy's present day life /flashbacks including all the Black and White scenes make it a 10/10 when it comes to the cinematography. 
Hard to believe that a movie based around an atomic bomb only has practical effects but that's sort of a good thing as the focus was on Oppenheimer and that's what we got .I do have a negative point about not using CGI which is at the end. 

-The movie was 3 hours long which I really felt especially after a tiring day. It was almost like 6 hours worth of story and dialogue squashed into 3 hours. The movie moved really fast though and if you woke up to go pee you would miss vital parts of the story. I personally would have been excited to watch this as a Nolan 3 part Documentary style Movie that would give us more details rather than having everything squashed into one movie. 

-The cast were incredible . Cillian Murphy really did an amazing job portraying Oppy and he felt like he actually was the real deal. RDJ was also amazing even though he only appeared in limited scenes. Emily Blunt and the rest of the big name cast also did great jobs.

-The soundtrack was great . The audio and sound effects for some reason at IMAX was too loud especially for explosive scenes . Saw people in USA also complain about the loudness so it wasn't just my Imax.

Was this Nolan's best? 
Definitely in his Top 3

Who is this made for? 
If you love cinema/filmmaking/art/history/science/math/politics/documentaries/drama/thrillers then this is for you. If you are one of those people who can't pay attention for longer than 5 minutes then this movie isn't for you , you will be bored or fall asleep. 

Negative about not using CGI: 
A lot of stuff that's in the dialogue happened off screen and never shown visually.  Keeping the entire movie practical means you missed out on an opportunity to make this the perfect movie. Showing certain scenes and the effect it had on the world would have been super epic and also emotional and this could only have been done if you used CGI. 

Should you watch on Imax? 
It's shot for Imax and that's how the movie was meant to be seen but if you are just a casual movie lover and want to save money then regular will be fine 

Rating: An explosive 8,5/10",POSITIVE

"Jul 23, 2023","Can't say much. You get immersed in the world and atmosphere Christopher Nolan builds, and with the ending this film leaves a deep impact on you. Words fall short for Nolan's brilliance, ""masterpiece"" would be an understatement. To me it's Nolan's best film, even better than Interstellar. It isn't just about the atom bomb. It's a deep dive within its creator's character and life. It is Nolan's most emotional and impactful movie. The acting is absolutely top level, especially Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr who shine in their roles. This is probably the best biopic we have seen in a long time!",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Movie started at 20:30 hours due to finish at 23:30 hours, I was home by 22:25. (17 minute drive)

Disjointed, over loud background noise was added for effect and not hitting the make, only drowning out dialogue. The music is constant and over powering, historic timelines were in a constant mix, so hard to follow the real storyline as continuity was broken all the time. Sex scenes were too much and sitting next to a lady I didn't know, only left me feeling uncomfortable. More a 1950s story of the American Communist witch hunt than the development and construction of the worlds most destructive weapon. What could have been a good movie lost by bad editing and poor direction.

And what was with the overbearing music completely overwhelming the dialog in multiple scenes?  The movie had it's moments, but it was a jumbled mess IMHO.  And, oh yeah, the actual detonation of the bomb was somewhat anti-climatic for me.  Could have been done much better.  It's really disappointing.  I expected a masterpiece of a movie from all of the hype.  Glad I didn't spend extra money in the VIP seating for this one.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 23, 2023","Absolutely loved the movie and fulfilled my expectations. The actors did a brilliant job and the music was incredible and really build tension. The only thing I wished it that Matthias Schweigh√∂fer should have gotten more screentime, I was interested to see a little more of his character. I personally can't agree that the movie is boring. Yes, there are a lot of dialouges you need to keep up with, but overall it's definitely worth a watch and already movie of the year for me. As someone who loves Nolan's movies I was not disappointed. Alone Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. make the movie worth a watch, I really enjoyed watching them in their roles.",POSITIVE

I'm still processing it and I'm sure my thoughts will wander to other movies that I have watched in my life but, I'm not mincing words‚Ä¶Oppenheimer was one of the best movies and cinematic experiences I have ever had.

What I did like were the performances. I like how they actually explored Oppenheimer being a leftist and how it affected his career/life. I like how Nolan showed cased the horror of the bomb and the US without explicit scenes of horror caused by the bomb itself (The absence creates a sense of dread).",POSITIVE

I highly recommend you go see it. There is some nudity so I would be careful bringing children under 12. it's about nuclear bombs or atomic üí£ bombs so that's something to think about with kids as well.

"Jul 23, 2023","When it comes to his new genera propensity, wartime dramas, Christopher Nolan has not been able to produce an original movie in over 10 years. Nolan ornates his film with vagry in attempt to appeal to the ever so pompousness individuals of the Academy. His entire process of filmmaking has been done, by him, and, by other filmmakers.... again and again (If you've seen one of his films, you've seen them all). He bends filmmaking techniques over excessively, to the point where audiences are lost (and not in a tastefully deliberate way). Additionally it is almost as if he forgets what techniques he previously committed to earlier in the movie. His use of his style is all in effort to mask his one-trick-ponyness, all so the Hollywood elite can stroke themselves off to an ""Oscar Worthy Film"".",NEGATIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Interstellar and Inception are on a different wave length compared to Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer reminds me of Martin Scorsese's ""The Irish"", couldn't wait to see it, and the amazing cast within the film. Sat down, watched it and was bored as hell, it just dragged for me. I was waiting for it to finish,  I'm a bit gutted really.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Solid performances all around.  Robert Downey Jr was phenomenal.  Movie to me was a little slower pace than I expected, tied a lot of things together from beginning to end, but could have shaved off some time as well",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",Best Nolan film. I believe Nolan's endeavours in sc-fi topics have trained him enough to present us an enchanting drama experience. Watching it in theatre is a similar experience like his other films where you feel like it needs/deserves another watch. The movie symbolises big literature in a subtle way and the complicated psychology of the protagonist was intriguing .The antagonist of the film never had been so subtle all because it's a true story where there are no morally distinctive sides to choose from.,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Absolute masterpiece. The social and political manipulation coupled with law and governmental prosecution all unraveling before us in a series of Big Brother like framings and social influence where each person has their own definition of the right and wrong thing to do and the real life consequences that took place because of it, watching a complex man struggling to find his own definition while the fate of the world rests in the balance. But not in a fairytale way, a true historical depiction where you feel the drama because we live today ,in real life, and see the consequences that began on the screen in front of us, yet we still grasp to understand the true immense power of a weapon that destructive and the havoc it can unleash. 
Hah, makes you think‚Ä¶good movie.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","A captivating, dramatic thriller with incredible performances by Murphy and Downey Jr. Incredible score and sound mixing. Three hours of intriguing dialogue and visuals that makes you wonder the power of what people can do when given to them.

As such, ""Oppenheimer"" stands as an artistic testament to a period that forever altered the course of human history.",POSITIVE

Different film. I thought I paid pretty good attention and was still confused. Idk what to think about the ending. I wanted to love it.

"Jul 23, 2023","Okay so the expectations were HIGH. It's Christopher Nolan. So of course that makes sense. This movie was long and entirely dialogue based. It had a lot of scope to fail technically because 1. It's a story people already know so no novelty value 2. It's 3 hours long and most importantly 3. Entirely consists of complex dialogues. 
But Oppenheimer soared. It's Cillian Murphy. It's Robert Downey Junior. It's Florence Pugh. It's Emily Blunt. It's Matt Damon. The casting was truly insanely amazing and that along with the amazing cinematography and poetic and poignant dialogues that make the film. It's a beautiful watch.

Out of all the Nolan films this hits number 3 on list. The Music score was so beautiful and the build up to them making the Bomb was so good. It definitely felt long but was worth it.

"Jul 23, 2023",Hauntingly stunning - Nolan strikes again.,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",Another Nolan masterpiece!,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","The cinematography adopted a rather interesting style, utilizing an extremely shallow depth of focus in many shots. Sometimes it appeared that there was little focal adjustment done, if any, to compensate for changes in focal distance, especially in extreme close-up shots. Sometimes even slight readjustments of a character's posture could visibly bring the focal point from the eyes to the tip of the nose and back. I believe this was an intentional stylistic choice, especially since the film explores the blurring of lines between duty, allegiance, science, empathy, and ethics.

The sound design and score really helped to immerse the viewer in the emotion of the characters, as well as give the audience a sense of the literal power associated with Oppenheimer's work. Nolan didn't shy away from cranking the decibels to the max during moments of high emotional impact, or during explosions and crowd scenes.

The plot did seem a little difficult to follow at first, almost as though three or four separate timelines were being woven together as they became relevant to each other throughout the film. There was also some gratuitous nudity in two or three scenes, which is a large part of it's R rating.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","The music was obnoxiously, loud and way overplayed through every part of the movie over most of the dialogue. I would never watch the movie again. I thought the story was interesting, but the music turned me off so badly because it was so loud and so overbearing too bad. Don't go see it.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","I had a lot of expectations being a fan of Christopher Nolan's work but was disappointed with this movie. Building the atomic bomb itself was not shown in a satisfactory way. I was looking for certain logical milestones scientists would have achieved in the process of building it and some revelations in that process like the one shown in the movie 'The Imitation Game'. The main focus was on Robert Oppenheimer's personal journey, his political interests and associated conflicts and all of a sudden we reach the Trinity test event day. There is no proper buildup to the Trinity day, no justification to why Oppenheimer was called the father of the atomic bomb, what did he exactly achieve as a scientist that no one else could have achieved, I am sure he did extraordinary things as a scientist but none of that is shown in this movie. Agree that we as audience cannot understand advanced physics but Nolan should have at least tried to explain it in layman's terms (which he succeeded doing in Interstellar). The atomic bomb explosion scene was also a huge disappointment. When you are making a movie with this kind of event at its core, you could do so much more with the technology available today to show something more than what we have all seen in plenty of movies and shows so far. Instead, we see nothing new or nothing impactful (except Cillian Murphy's great performance as he witnesses the test). Even the storyline dealing with events in Oppenheimer's life after the world war II was not narrated in a compelling way. Too much of jumping across different timelines of the events didn't help and failed to create any emotional impact. I hope Nolan does something more ambitious like Interstellar again and he should bring Hans Zimmer back.",NEGATIVE

The movie is good for adult-matured viewers. Christopher Nolan is perfectly doing a great job on intertwining with proper lights on each framing of the story.

With regards to actors,
Cillian Murphy - nailed it

I can't praise Oppenheimer enough! The explosions in the movie were mind-blowing, and the visuals were simply stunning.

The absolutely stacked cast was amazing, the score throughout the film, the drama, the story & the visuals. Nolan should receive a Oscar for this film, along with Cillian Murphy & Robert Downey Jr. if you appreciate movies and storytelling, you will deff enjoy this film. The run time of 3 hours flew by you are constantly entertained and enthralled in the scenes and dialogue. So much to unpack here. I will be watching again. ",POSITIVE

"Jul 23, 2023","Anytime a new Christopher Nolan project is announced, it immediately becomes the most anticipated film of the year for me. ""Oppenheimer"" is a superbly crafted historical drama that feels completely different from the rest of this incredible filmmaker's body of work. Don't get me wrong, there is a sequence that delivers the spectacle I've come to expect and for the duration of that sequence, I was completely on the edge of the seat in my IMAX theater. However, unlike many other blockbuster films, I have loved from Nolan, this is by far his most performance and dialogue-driven work. The good thing is, the acting and writing are outstanding and every moment felt completely engaging. The entire cast is great, but Cillian Murphy in the lead role is already my favorite performance of the year. I also think Robert Downey Jr. is excellent and think both of these actors should be considered for awards down the line. The movie is very long and essentially feels like a combination of three different movies. I would say I found enjoyment in each third of this cohesive biopic but enjoyed the middle portion the best. Nonetheless, I found myself fascinated by the way this movie was edited and the way the score was used to add to the intense atmosphere. The movie also explores a variety of themes and ideas that are thought-provoking and important. Nolan always sets an expectation for me, and I would say my only complaint is that he has made films that I enjoy more than this one. Still, this is an incredible movie that leaves an impact and is a wonderful addition to his diverse filmography. Overall, this is an intelligent movie that I definitely feel I should watch multiple times to fully grasp the story but is an experience that film lovers like myself need to have on the big screen in 2023.

Update upon rewatch: Like most Nolan films, this one improved for me after revisiting it. It is a one-of-a-kind historical film that connected a lot more when I got to watch it again and get a deeper understanding of some of the plot points. Overall, one of the best films of 2023 and one that I genuinely want to watch again and again.",POSITIVE

Robert Oppenheimer, or knowing far too much, this doesn&#39;t miss a dot. From perfect edge-of-seat timing, to precision of words and delivery by a profound set, this is an absolute homage to the complexity that makes this physicist and relative figures. Hero or villain, martyr or heathen, is beside every point, as this film goes to challenge every point of view and leaves a pondering, critical, thought provoking moment that in of itself leaves a most bittersweet feeling.

Watch After.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","I had high expectations for this film and Christopher Nolan stuck the landing. The Covid pandemic disrupted the ecosystem of cinema but nature is truly alive again. Riveting, dark and rapturing from start to finish. Phenomenal acting, cinematography and music score. A story of extraordinary persons doing extraordinary things in extraordinary times. Masterfully and meticulously crafted to depict the modern ""Dark Knight"". You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain. This. Is. Cinema. I'm older and wiser now to know it and mean it when I see it. 10/10.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",Disappointing. Slow and disjointed storytelling. Even the climactic A-bomb test scene was more exciting in archival footage.,NEGATIVE

"Jul 23, 2023",Excellent portrayal of the struggle Oppenheimer had with bribing the theory to life. Murphy was excellent!,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","The movie of the century. It is Nolan's best film to date. Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jnr, Christopher Nolan, the editing team, visual fx, sound, cinematography, script, costuming and makeup, should all be getting Oscars for this one.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",It was hard to follow and confusing.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",Hate to be ‚Äúread the book guy‚Äù but feel like they did a great job hitting on all important aspects to some extent covered in American Prometheus. Was definitely long but think it was necessary and well done to tell the full story,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",This movie is an absolute masterpiece.,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","That was a spectacle. We loved it and it was a pretty gripping film, the 3hrs didn‚Äôt bother me a bit. RPX sound and bass created memories you can‚Äôt mimic at home. Cillian Murphy is so haunting, perfect casting. Bravo Chris Nolan!",POSITIVE

"Jul 23, 2023","Christopher Nolan does it again with an absolutely immersive film about the creation of the atomic bomb, the emotional tool that it had on its creator, the delegate balance and dangers we face today in the modern world.

I like the experience waiting for Einstein ‚ù§Ô∏è",POSITIVE

"Jul 23, 2023","Not Nolan best movie but you can see his best script and one of the best scenes i have seen in the last 5 years and maybe his best directed scene, this movie is a big upgrade from storytelling from 'Dunkirk', in fact this movie is worthy every minute and it doesn't even feel like it has 3 hours.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. I cannot believe all the hype after seeing it. It was awful. Very difficult to follow what was going on or understand all of the dialog. I am seriously confused of the rotten tomatoes score. 

Robert Downey Jr was however excellent in his role. It was very difficult to understand what he was saying most of the time",NEGATIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Sorry‚Ä¶I just don't get the high rating shown here. Nor dries those I saw the movie with. For starters, the background music is so loud, it is difficult to understand the dialogue. Odd artistic license was taken in a variety of scenes. And some scenes make no sense. Gratuitous sex was unnecessary and detracted from the story. There's a lot of hype surrounding this movie, but I can't recommend it. However, Robert Downey Jr. was absolutely amazing in his role as Strauss. In summation, spend your money on Barbie.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 23, 2023",Great historic movie.,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Incredibly Interesting in the best way

Very good acting and storytelling. Probably one of Nolan's best films. I would love to see him expand his biography arsenal, but it would be hard to top this. If Interstellar is Nolan's Odyssey, this is his Dr. Strangelove (not really the best comparison, but a worthy analogy). It's hard to understand all the dialogue being thrown at you so fast, but as with all Nolan films, that will only get better with time. A seriously entertaining historical adventure that has truly never had anything like it. 100% recommend to anyone. I think Nolan's just getting started and this is a wonderfully mysterious way for him to start his modern filmmaking adventure.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",Shows only the trinity test but that's enough. Cillian Murphy did an amazing job portraying the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer.,POSITIVE

"Jul 23, 2023",must go see it's a movie masterpiece!!,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",This movie was phenomenal. I went in with high expectations and they were exceeded. The long run time didn't bother me because I was so intrigued the whole time. The acting was exceptional.,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",Oppenheimer is so much more than the amazement of an on-screen experience of watching the atomic bomb go off. Its intense dialogue in the final act is what proves that Christopher Nolan is able to pull these types of movies off.,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",This is by far one of the slowest movies I have seen in years. Could have been told in like 1 hour as a documentary. Letter from Iwa Jima was a much better film all around. Not sure why or how this is getting so much good press. Only highlight was that I got to see the movie for free. I did lose 3 hours of my life that I will never get back.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Tudo nesse filme t√° perfeito, visual, trilha sonora, personagens e a forma que a hist√≥ria foi tratada. Cillian Murphy merece o Oscar de melhor ator sem sobra de d√∫vidas",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",This was an exhausting movie watching experience. Waaaay overdone. A good story teller tells only what adds to the compelling nature of the story itself. An almost 3 hour long movie that could have easily been 90 mins was ruined with far too much dialogue. Over written. The true essence of the story gets lost in the writing here. Less would have been more. ,NEGATIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",good movie just a little drawn out and could of been a tad more graphic as far as bombing scenes maybe?,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",A big screen movie for the sound alone.,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","This movie is by far one of the greatest movies I've seen. The acting is out of this world, the pacing is smooth and fast, the sound design is out of this world with the score just giving you chills. This movie will start allot of political and moral discussion about the use and presence of nuclear weapons!",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",Wow. What a movie. Incredible in all aspects. All awards to Cillian Murphy. ,POSITIVE

"Jul 23, 2023","Saw OPPENHEIMER on Saturday in its 70mm large format screening. Really a phenomenal piece of filmmaking by writer and director Christopher Nolan, the story centered around the Father of the Atomic Bomb and leader of The Manhattan Project at Los Alamos, J. Robert Oppenheimer, played to perfection by actor Cillian Murphy. Worth noting, as well is the extraordinary performance by actor Robert Downey Jr. as Lewis Strauss. It wouldn't surprise me if both actors receive Oscar nominations for their character portrayals, they are that good! Also great in supporting roles, Emily Blunt (Kitty Oppenheimer), Matt Damon (General Leslie Groves), Jason Clarke (Roger Robb) and an appearance by Gary Oldman as President Truman. Returning as Nolan's DOP is Hoyte van Hoytema (Interstellar, Dunkirk, Tenet) whose cinematography in Oppenheimer is breathtaking. Love the new black and white photography created especially for the film, it is sharp, clean and crisp. Just like in Nolan's 2000 film, Memento, the black and white is juxtaposed with color, perfectly utilized for past and present scenes and as a way to interpret the lead character's moral struggles and ambiguity. I had no problem with the 3 hour runtime, dialogue was intelligent and the film moves at a good pace thanks to streamlined editing by Jennifer Lame (Tenet) and a strong, haunting score by Ludwig G√∂ransson (Tenet). Oppenheimer is quite the triumph for Chris Nolan.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",This movie was pretty good it allowed us to see what compelled the father of the atomic bomb to make the atomic bomb,NEUTRAL
"Jul 23, 2023",Oppenheimer is a visually stunning and thought-provoking film about the scientific and moral challenges of creating the atomic bomb. Greatest movie of all time.,POSITIVE

"Jul 23, 2023",peakenheimer must watch it immediately,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",The acting is terrific and the story interesting. But 3 hours is too long for a sad story from start to finish.  I may be slow but I had a hard time keeping up with the show jumping around in time. Surely my expectations were too high and this impacts my review.,NEUTRAL

"Jul 23, 2023",Another masterpiece by Nolan.,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",It was very boring and dragged out. No need for it to be three hours they could've had less filler and had an 1h30min storyline work perfectly,NEGATIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",Much better on the second and third viewings. Incredible film.,POSITIVE

"Jul 23, 2023",3 hours of straight dialogue that's all over the place and hard to understand. Felt like I was given a long boring history lesson by a really bad professor.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Fantastic Nolan film. Beautiful cinematography, fantastic score (and use of silence), strong depiction of the pre-McCarthy Red Scare, the way that fervent nationalism destroys the vulnerable individuals who uphold that nationalism, and fantastic portrait of a complex figure. 

Absolutely worth seeing in the best form.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Cuando sal√≠ de la sala de cine no hab√≠an palabras para explicar lo que sent√≠a. Es simplemente una obra maestra de Nolan. Cada minuto de la pel√≠cula lo disfrut√©. La pel√≠cula mantiene una tensi√≥n constante que al momento de detonar la bomba, el coraz√≥n est√° a 1000 por hora, aunque ya sepas que va a pasar. Las explosiones se ven muy bien y es cierto, hasta puedes sentirlas. Podr√≠a seguir por 200 l√≠neas alabando esta pel√≠cula pero con esto basta. Le pongo 5 estrellas solo porque es la calificaci√≥n mas alta.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",Best film I‚Äôve seen in years,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",This movie was such a cinematic masterpiece it wasn't told in a linear way. It also had many storylines tying in together; while displaying the regret and grief Oppenheimer was feeling after the creation of the Atomic Bomb. Go see it now!!,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",Tiresome movie. Lots of talking,NEUTRAL
"Jul 23, 2023",This movie was amazing - maybe the best film I've ever seen.,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","It was good. Long. But good. Great performances by everyone, and very good at eliciting emotions. The cinematography, acting, directing, and score made an interesting bit of history into a beautiful work of art.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","A wonderful and impactful film. The imagery and utter sound in the Imax theater I went to blew me away (pun intended). Towards the end of the movie it started to get a bit slow and long, but the final scene was incredibly thought provoking and a perfect end to a phenomenal movie",POSITIVE

"Jul 23, 2023",Great movie best of the century what an acting by the cast and great direction from one and only Christopher Nolan,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",Too long and smart for me,NEUTRAL
"Jul 23, 2023","It's a fascinating story, but challenging for the cinema. The engines of conflict in Oppenheimer are academic rivalries, cold-war politics, complex physics and the moral conflict of designing a weapon of mass destruction. These can be discussed in historical accounts like American Prometheus, but getting them to work in a (long) 3 hour film was always going to be difficult for Christopher Nolan. It probably didn't help that the fame of the star studded cast tended to distract from these subtle narratives. Matt Damon played a general playing Matt Damon. Freddy Mercury played a physicist. Oppenheimer's wife, played by Emily Blunt, dragged a bottle of booze into every scene to show she was troubled. The main protagonist was permanently intense and earnest throughout the movie. There was no room for him to be anything else. It was a film that made me want to read more on the subject, which was good. But not sit through this again.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 23, 2023",The most boring movie I've ever seen in my life.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",Incredible movie - every aspect of it. This will go down as one of the greatest movies of this decade and likely as Nolan's best work of art. I would encourage everyone to see this and understand its impact in our world.,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Great. Absolutely great. Great acting, great delivery, great imagery.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Hurts the sentiments of Hindus. If the whole goal was to show Oppenheimer had an affair, movie makers could have very well found better ways to portray it than having a scene with holy  Bhagavad Gita in Oppenheimers hand and involving his girlfriend naked and intimate act. What message are they trying to send ? Also, apart from Nolan‚Äôs cinematography skills , this movie fails to show the ill effects of atomic bomb.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",Nolan's best film. I was engrossed through the whole movie. It didn't feel like 3 hours I was wanting more after the credits started,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","This movie right here is what peak performance looks like sure there were downsides but over all this was a great movie. but the two negative things I will say about the movie is the sex doesn't make that much sense and to me the movie just seemed to drag on after they dropped the test nuke. On the good sides where do even start the acting was on point, the story lined up with everything that was going down. The movie is mostly serious no one walks in there thinking there going to be seeing the next Adam Sandler film but you can get a chuckle on part of the movie. Over all I say go watch the movie you wont be disappointed even if your on the fence about it go watch it. that's about it see ya!",POSITIVE

"Jul 23, 2023","Great movie and cast.  It is a bit long.  It sort of reminded me of There Will Be Blood, but in a different way.  Not quite what I was expecting, but in a good way.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","This biopic movie was very good. Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey, Jr., Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, and the rest of the cast did a spectacular job in this movie. This true story about J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb, was dramatic, tense, and tragic. It's about working on the most important project of your life and trying to end WWII in the process. If you haven't seen this movie yet, check it out sometime. It's a definite must see.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Tells the story by jumping around in time, but it all works. About 3/4 of the way through, I realized that this is an amazing movie! It makes no apologies in how it portrays people and events. Honest, harsh, and very well done! See this film!",POSITIVE

"Jul 23, 2023","I thought the movie was excellent, and it was an interesting movie in character development. I think Robert was portrayed in an excellent way. I think including that his daughter was not given security clearance because of who he dad was, and she subsequently hung herself would have been a good add. I would recommend for sure. 

I would recommend this movie, but it was not a shocking movie in any way. It was good, but the Father of the atomic bomb should be a well known item. The naivety of contemporary culture is amazing.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",A masterpiece. A must see on either IMAX or RPX. The best movie of the year so far!,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",Enjoyed it. Intense. Superb acting.,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",Christopher Nolan doesn‚Äôt miss. Loved to see him do a historical biopic. He‚Äôs shown a great ability to do different genres well. Was a little choppy early on but then it kicks into a different gear and doesn‚Äôt stop. Tremendous use of sound/lighting and Murphy has to garner Oscar buzz with that performance. He was on screen 90 percent of the film and delivered in every scene. ,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",This movie was fantastic! Christopher Nolan and Robert Downey Jr. lead an incredible cast with a powerful script.,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Truly a masterpiece. The acting is not overshadowed by its large personalities, nor does the subject matter get lost in overacting. Everything is flawlessly executed. A must see soon to be multiple Oscar winner.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",Overall it was a very good movie.  It is sad that because of the excessive F bombs and some unnecessary nudity it has an R rating.  It would have been much easier to get rid of all that to make it PG-13 and open it up to a wider audience.,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Nicely told story of the man who was Oppenheimer flawed brilliant enigmatic. Some unnecessary sex scenes and nudity. You can convey affairs without actually having to show women's tits and some of the dialogue seemed a little contrived, but it was beautifully acted Florence Pugh, Emily Blunt,  Cillian, Downey Jr. were perfect. Loved it.",POSITIVE

"Jul 23, 2023",3hrs+ running time and still felt engaged in it every sec. Absolutely a must watch!!,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Just amazing! The historical context, the personal dramas, Christopher Nolan's direction and several other points were crucial for this film to be the work of art that it has become. Caveats for the incredible photography, music and sound effects that often go unnoticed, but show the care they took in the smallest details.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Oppenheimer is not a film, it's a symphony that we could never before fathom. In my opinion, it is one of the most important films to ever exist. I remember feeling like this regarding a few films, such as this past year's phenomenal all quiet on the western front but this movie is the biggest and scariest true account of what it means to be alive. The deep sadness that overcame me after experiencing this film glued me to my seat. The fact that our supposed holier than thou goverment could inflict so much pain on a single man  really broke me. 

Below is an in detailed look into different aspects of the film.

Overall the whole movie is an impressive showing of scientific innovation in cinema but most of all, this film took a step to storytelling that has not been seen before. The cinematography was breathtaking. The use of practical effects helps add a magical effect of realism to the film. The sound mixing was definitely an upgrade from tenet. As far as orchestration, I have never been more blown away. I had chills the whole time. I quiete enjoyed the attention to detail in the costumes, they really felt like the best choice for each and every charector. As far as acting goes, I'll save Cillian for last. RDJ gave in my opinion, his best performance of his career. Emily blunt really did phenomenal, I absolutely adored her in the scene where she finds oppenheimer distraught over the loss Tatlock. I loved how Matt Damon helped anchor cillians Oppenheimer, giving use the most balanced performance. Some supporting parts stood out to me. I felt goosebumps ever time I saw Dane Dehaan, his menacing smile was truly amazing. Kenneth Branagh and Rami Malak gave great performances given the screen time. My favorite supporting actor had to have been Alden Ehrenrich. He had in my opinion one of the best scenes in the film. Finally, the man of the hour, Cillian Murphy. Never in my life did I think I'd get to see a performance of this caliber. Cillian held us from the first time we see him. Every breath was perfection. You can not teach the talent the cillian holds. He has such a unique talent of fully opening himself to the emotions necessary for the charector. This gives his performance such realism. His ability to emote just using slight movements in his face and eye truly sold the performance. The scene with Gary Oldman truly shows this ability. We see Murphys face as he is attempting to plea with Truman. His pleas going unnoticed broke me and seeing the slight welling of tears in his eyes as he realizes Truman does not care about him sold the scene. 

No movie in my opinion can be the best movie ever. That statement is far to subject but to me, I feel I can say that this is the most important movie to date, not only to cinema, but to life.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","I know a lot about history, and this movie is so far above the heads of most people, I struggled to make it through the whole movie. The back ground music is so loud it drains out the dialogue. It's amazing it's getting this high of reviews.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","A masterpiece with great acting, beautiful visuals, impeccable writing, and a slightly long runtime.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",I did like this movie overall. It is very thought provoking. It was a little hard to follow at times because events are not always shown in chronological order.  It was also extremely long. Make sure you use the bathroom before going in the theatre.,NEUTRAL
"Jul 23, 2023","""Oppenheimer"" finds writer/director Christopher Nolan at his most in-depth, specific and all-encompassing, using quite possibly the greatest cast of performers this side of one of the ""Ocean's"" movies to deliver a harrowing, no-nonsense look at arguably the most important person to ever live. Thankfully, while the message and thematics are dire, the experience itself is still nonetheless absorbing and even exhilarating at times. The Trinity test sequence itself is worth the price of admission alone. For me, though, I think the most impressive feat to marvel at in this is that of Cillian Murphy's lead turn as the titular physicist in question. Without a doubt, this is a career-defining performance for him and I absolutely think it should be in consideration for the highest of honors, come awards season. Massive kudos to Nolan, as always, for making films that beg to be seen on the largest of screens. This is, most definitely, another one of those -- one I'm excited to watch again.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",Absolute masterpiece!!!,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Story is well told and accurately depicts Oppenheimer‚Äôs professional life. Oppenheimer was an important figure in an event that changed the world. The acting, screenwriting and overall production of the movie are all top notch. An entertaining and thought provoking movie. Has to be one of the best movies this year.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","The framing is confusing, although by the end I realized that was on purpose. You will get more out of it if you know the history. Otherwise there's a lot of scenes where it's a bunch of white guys, some with noticeable accents, spouting scientific jargon. You know it's important, but aren't always sure why. Despite the confusion it's very compelling and it did all come together in the end.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","I am an avid movie viewer and have a long history and passion for cinema. I've watched several of Nolan's films in the past and have on the whole enjoyed them.

When I first saw the trailers for and heard about Oppenheimer I was very excited as it seemed like it had the potential to be a true masterpiece. And while the movie wasn't bad, it wasn't what I was hoping for.

First of all my praise for the film. The acting was superb as both Murphy and Downey displayed incredible talent and emotion on screen and all the rest of the cast echoed this. The cinematography was beautifully done and the musical score complimented it well.

My main issue with this film consists in the storytelling and writing of this film. There were far too many parts that dragged on and contributed little to nothing as far as the whole story and would've best been removed. As well as sections that were completely unnecessary and or not tastefully done (such as Oppenheimer's continuous infidelity throughout the film). On the other hand there were parts that I believe should've been added so as to clarify certain aspects of the latter half of the film and bring more emotional cohesion.

Honestly during the film I was wondering about the time (a very rare occurrence) throughout the film.

Additionally, I have read other reviews which have been under the assumption that history buffs or people who are interested in the field are even more likely to enjoy the film. I can attest to the fact as not entirely true, as I myself am studying history currently in university and my love of history didn't sway my issues with the film or enhance it, but viewed it, simply, as I would any other film (that is just for the benefit of the reader to see where my perspective may lie).

As a final thought, Oppenheimer was a good film that I was expecting much more from and let me down in many ways but still exhibits shining qualities. I went away from it feeling very little and don't think I would either recommend nor dissuade someone from watching it.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 23, 2023",Best movie of the century.,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",There were some plot lines that were built up but never paid off. Such as the ‚Äúunknown scientist during the hearing‚Äù. Acting was excellent and the overall story very compelling.,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Wow! A REAL movie! All the things were there including, but not limited to, a fantastic ending. Absolutely crushed it!",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",This movie was BORING!!!  Perhaps a quantum time warp made this 3 hour movie seem like 6 hours.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Christopher Nolan‚Äôs crown jewel. This should go down as amongst the greatest films ever ‚Ä¶ he brilliantly told a Pulitzer Prize winning biography. I saw it twice opening weekend, it was that good.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",What a great movie! I could have done without the weird sex scenes but man overall this is an incredible show. If you have a chance go see it in the movies go don't wait until it comes out on streaming.,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",I really really wanted to like this movie (we drove an hour to see it in imax) but it felt like watching a 3 hr movie trailer. The dialog was unrealistically rushed and difficult to follow. The scenes switched so quickly that there was no time to be emotionally invested in any of the characters (even opp himself). I don't know how they fumbled the bag so hard with a topic as harrowing and interesting as the Manhattan project. I was hoping it would be more similar to the TV series Chernobyl - I really just wanted to feel or learn *something*.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",Great movie. Great story telling. Great acting,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Brilliant movie from beginning to end. Acting, score, cinematography, directing are all on point. Top 3 Nolan movies.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",This Life and Death thriller was best one that Christopher Nolan ever made The Trinity Test was incredibly stunning the storyline and characters were amazing to this movie I really gave this movie ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è Murphy playing Oppenheimer was center to the whole story really love him in this movie and Robert Downey Jr was intense to the whole scene can't wait to see it again a really good movie,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Nolan does it again! Fantastic movie and if you don't watch it in IMAX, shame on you.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","""Oppenheimer"" is a thought-provoking and visually stunning biographical drama that delves into the life of one of the most influential scientists of the 20th century, J. Robert Oppenheimer. Directed by the masterful Christopher Nolan, the film provides an insightful and captivating portrayal of the man behind the creation of the atomic bomb, as well as the moral and ethical dilemmas that accompanied his groundbreaking scientific achievements.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",It was the fastest three hours ever. It was incredibly beautiful fast paced never a slow moment. Very captivating! Will gladly see it three more times to see every detail I might have missed. Amazing. All the stars.,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",This movie will go down as the best movie of all time.,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",This was simply great. 4 Hours later and I am still digesting how good this really was. Best real drama I've seen in years.,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",Fantastic film. Very immersive and thought provoking.,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",Great storytelling.  Great direction.  Fantastic acting.   Must see,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",Chris Nolan never missses. Also Cilian Murphy is just so hot omg ,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","amazing pacing which is great at balancing the story-lines of Strauss and Oppenheimer making the atomic bomb. a lot of the characters a well written, the twist is interesting and the acting is amazing. also many of the relationships are well developed with the stand out being oppenheimer and his wife. a lot of the characters from the communist party are under-cooked and some of the scientists take up screentime but don't have much character",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",This movie was a little hard to follow the early part of the movie but it pick up the rest of the movie. It also exposed the power that political could destroy anyone. I feel we are moving as a country in that direction as well. Great movie and the theater was sold out.,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","This grounded epic is some of Nolan's finest work yet. The acting is some of the best I have ever seen. With a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack, this is more than just a story about science and the horrors of mankind's desire for power, it is a tragic story of a man who struggles to deal with life, love, and what is beyond human comprehesion. It is a true masterpiece on every level!",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","This is the best movie that should be at the Oscars in 2024, it is very dramatic.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Such a beautiful film! Nolan‚Äôs all star cast kills it in this period piece. My heart was racing with the score up until the test of the bomb. What holds it back from getting a 5 is the lack of exposition in the first 30 minutes and, at times, the score overpowered the words of the actors, which WAS intentional, but made some scenes hard to hear. I can‚Äôt knock either of these as it was a 3 hour movie and as I said the music was intentional.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 23, 2023","Brilliant movie.  Spectacular writing, directing, acting.  The musical score is haunting. Highest recommendation.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",watched this for the second time and it‚Äôs still so good,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",Historical science is a hard genre to create a great movie for with how society is currently. This movie does that for everyone and gives a great explanation into some of the very difficult scientific problems they were facing.,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Great movie, the acting is amazing, and the interaction of politics, science and the difficult situation of the 40's are fully represented on this movie. A must this summer!",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","This movie is easily my pick for a short list of Academy Award contenders for this year. The movie captures a picture of a complex and at times troubled man who was tasked with the impossible task of building the atomic bomb in only two years. The story is told from two different points in time and excellently threads between these times to show pre, mid and post war events. In the end, the movie ties those multiple perspectives together to show the changing political landscape of both eras and how they impacted Oppenheimer. Excellent cinema all around and my personal pick for Best Picture at this point of the year.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",MOVIE OF THE YEAR. Nolan doesn‚Äôt miss!!,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Well done all around from the acting, directing, sound. I thought the use of black and white when it was a subject view point or third person view point versus the color when it was Oppenheimer's point of view was a brilliant touch.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","heck of a movie, second half was absolutely nailbiting, the plot twist was so unexpected. Also just imagine if Nolan made a horror film",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Top notch - again some issues with soundtrack overtaking dialogue. The time jumps were still a bit of a pain, even for someone well familiar with the subject matter.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 23, 2023",Boring and too damn long ,NEGATIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",Masterpiece. Sex scenes were unnecessary but who cares. This movie was sick.,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",En efecto es exceso de cine üö¨üö¨ Nolan nunca decepciona,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Bounces all over with the timing, has the Nolan DRONE sounds and lame explosion ""science"" visuals, conversations are overlayed with the DRONE noise... Can't get into any characters because of the way it's put together.  Lame!!!! Save your time and ears.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","For a movie that's 3 hours in length, it certainly does not feel like it! This movie never lets up in pace and performances. A great biopic",NEUTRAL
"Jul 23, 2023","A biopic that plays like a suspense thriller. Lives up to the hype and then some. Best movie of the year, one of Nolan's best, and one of the most important movies of our times. The performances were brilliant. Cillian Murphy will be nominated and Robert Downey Jr. reminds us of what we were missing all those years while he was making Marvel movies. Go see this in IMAX!",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","While hearing rumors about how incredible the cinematography and the movie itself was, I was very let down by it and confused by the hype that this movie didn't remotely live up to. It bombed all expectations in the worst way. The trailer while full of action looked incredibly promising, but the movie itself was over 3 hours of dry dialog. Incredibly boring. Nolan took a concept that could've taught a lot about American history, but chose not to. He did focus on Oppenheimer's life, but could have condensed the whole movie into under an hour. In summary it is not worth seeing. Don't waste 3 hours of your life.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Una pel√≠cula que abre la mente a importantes reflexiones y debates morales, biopic que logro su cometido de contar la historia de Oppenheimer, que incluso en sus conceptos de f√≠sica estaba muy acertada.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",They didn't play here comes the sun when they dropped the nuke. The movie SUCKED,NEGATIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",This might be the best Nolan film yet! Incredible cast. The sound design is astounding. Must watch in IMAX for the sound alone!,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","I watched this movie knowing the history, and still was totally stunned by the visuals, the intricacy of the plot.  I can only give my personal recommendation for this film, which I believe is hands down, the best movie I have seen in 2023.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","The first 1.5 hours is a disaster. They're ripping through scenes, setting up a par-for-the-course back story and none of it really matters - the superficiality of the Florence Pugh plotline is emblematic here. Once they get to actual bomb testing it's a good show. The post-bomb story returns to so-so territory. This non-hearing is the most interesting thing about Oppenheimer's life really? It's mostly a fail as a biopic i think. It's overlong and still felt rushed. The bomb building was exciting but a better movie would have focused on that and fleshed it out. A Truman biopic would have been more compelling.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",This movie was exceptional. Period.,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Outstanding Film!!!! I really loved this Movie!!!!!! This is what truly IMAX IS ALL ABOUT!!!!!! 70mm is way better than Laser,don't get me wrong, this is IMAX 70MM AKA 18K and laser is 4k,but what a beautiful, dark ,hunting Color,Black and white display of what Christopher Nolan does with film,what you can't do with Digital, me & my brother was blown away all the way throughout this movie,historical experience, I missed this format but I got to see this again, we're besides only a few like 19 left in the United States and 31 in the World to have 15/70mm for this Format for this at Regal Opry Mills Stadium IMAX at 570 Opry Mills Dr in Nashville, TN,if anyone was here visiting comes this movie in its True Format, the last Nolan movie I watched was Tenet in IMAX during the Pandemic but it was w Laser but Dunkirk was the last we saw in Film in 2014,the music was a Masterpiece as well,the Actors especially Cillian Murphy & Robert Downing Jr,the best director by Chris today!!!!!! we don't know when we will see this format again but this was the movie I was looking forward, can't wait to see again in true IMAX 70mm!!!!!",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",Extremely well done Two Thumbs Up Way Up...,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Very well done!! This movie has left an everlasting affect on me, in ways I may never be able to communicate to others.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",Nolan delivers again with another intriguing film that keeps you interested the entire time. Cast was amazing,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",This film was superb. Absolutely amazing production. Very educational and the run time is not noticeable it's so good. Besides a couple petty complaints you can't beat this one.,POSITIVE

"Jul 23, 2023","Actors should articulate their lines so that old folks as well as young people whose hearing is impaired in discos can actually hear the lines. Alternatively, mumbled lines should be

"Jul 23, 2023","Great movie, Cillian Murphy is at his best!",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","The movie begins (literally) with a bang, and ends the same. In between I watched with amazement as the first 70mm IMAX movie I've seen blowing me away with visuals and sounds and emotions I've never quite felt in a theater before. This movie is an experience unlike all others I've seen in my life.

I'm not a critic. I'm not here to break down the themes of science or morality. I'm here to tell you to watch this movie on the biggest, best screen you can and let yourself be absorbed by it.

The one thing I can assure you is you need to see this at the theater.  There is no way this is going to have the same visual one of the effect at home.  Do yourself a favor see it now.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","I went to watch 2AM SHOW IN IMAX , PAKISTAN AND IT WAS HOUSEFUL/COMPLETE SOLD OUT.
People are crazy about NOLAN'S WORK.
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT REST OF THE WORLD GUYS ,BUT ASIA IS CRAZY ABOUT CHRISTOPHER NOLAN AND HIS WORK.
MARVELLOUS!",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","One of the best movies of the 21st Century, brilliant directing and outstanding performances by all, especially Cillian Murphy as the enigmatic J. Robert Oppenheimer, the ‚ÄúFather of the Atomic Bomb.‚Äù",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",Too long and too boring.,NEUTRAL
"Jul 23, 2023","The acting was top notch, if Murphy, RDJ and Blunt don't get Oscars for this movie then I don't even know what to day. Saw it on an IMAX with a laser projector, the cinematography was unreal.
A little long but worth seeing, probably the best bio-pic ever.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",Watched it tonight in a smaller IMAX format and it was fantastic.  The pace is breathtaking. The visual and audio effects are superb and happen so strategically to maintain your breathlessness throughout the entire film.  Cillian Murphy is masterful.  I've watched his career for years - going through his entire filmography.  He has been so undervalued in the past but hopefully now will be celebrated for his gift.  Robert Downey Jr. is incredible as Strauss.  Both he and Murphy deserve academy nominations.  Blunt and Pugh are forces in the movie - adding an edginess that contrasts Oppenheimer's meekness.  There wasn't a weak actor or moment in the entire 3 hours.  I'll be seeing this soon again‚Ä¶incredible!,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",Una de las mejores pel√≠culas de la historia. Es magnifica y lo que m√°s agrada; basada en hechos reales que involucra el desarrollo de la humanidad hac√≠a su destrucci√≥n.,POSITIVE

"Jul 23, 2023","Dragged much, the bomb explosion was severily overhyped, okey biopic",NEGATIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","The way that Christopher Nolan has to implement near 0 CGI is impecable, besides how Cilian Murphey portrays the character of Oppenheimer is truly impecable, an easy 10/10 for me!",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",Honestly the best film ever. Every aspect. Have some understanding of the topic before watching too fully appreciate it,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Oppenheimer is the greatest movie of this century! 10/10

The whole movie is amazing, running side by side with perfection Fascinating story, But the highlight for me must be the scenes between (Oppenheimer and Einstein) Cillian Murphy seeing him in a lead role and his performance as Oppenheimer was magnificent absolutely stunning. Overall Nolan did phenomenal work on this project by casting all the talented actors and they each one of them gave their best performances in this film, as always Christopher Nolan is one of the greatest directors of all time mad respect for this Genius

It is highly recommended to watch it in imax theaters if possible.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",Absolutely loved this movie. You really have to pay attention so you don't get lost.  Any history buff will really want to see it.,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",The must see summer movie about the man behind the bomb.,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","Possibly Christopher Nolan's magnum opus! Oppenheimer is a movie that will remind you of the epics from the Golden Age of movies while giving you a realistic look at the existential dread of one man who in his brilliance created a new world, but as the movie shows, Is this the world that he truly was looking to create? Or is this a world that will lead to our ultimate annihilated? Oppenheimer is heavy on these themes while also giving you a look at the life of the man himself and how he worked and conflicted with his family and colleagues. Nolan wrote and directed these conflicts so well that you can feel the tension that you can practically feel the heaviness in the air. The acting was superb and possibly some of the best performances I've seen from many of the actors! Not only do the main actors play their roles with such conviction that they possibly steal the show, many of the minor characters put up career defining performances that makes the acting some of the best in any of Nolan's movies. 

When it comes to the production itself, everything was as close to perfect as I think possible. The visuals of the atomic and quantum worlds that Oppenheimer sees are done incredibly and help to show just what the character is feel in his head. The Trinity testing scene is one of the best scenes in any Christopher Nolan movie that he created. The environment is so tense when the countdown is going off that you will be on the edge of your seat and counting down in your head. The explosions that Nolan was able to replicate were done as perfect as can be and really helped to give a realistic picture of weapons at that time. What Nolan does best though is his writing of how Oppenheimer interacted with his contemporaries especially his interactions with Albert Einstein, which are probably the best scenes in the movies. Now when it comes to individual actors I think that Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr., Emily Blount, and Jason Clarke give the best performances in the movie. Some of the other actors give performances that are also incredible are, some are only minor characters, Alden Ehrenreich (who gave a career best performance), Rami Malek (only talks in one scene but gives one of the most powerful speeches), Josh Hartnett (best performance since Black Hawk Down), and especially Florence Pugh who only having a couple scenes impacts the entire direction and mood of the film. There are so many incredible performances to list them all would take days. Director and Writer Christopher Nolan and producer James Woods creates a movies that blows all recent cinema may go down as impactful as the Day After Tomorrow was in the 80s. Given how things are today with the world a movie like this is more important than ever 

9.8/10",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","As somebody who was looking forward to this movie because I like history, it left a lot to be desired. It cuts out a lot of important details such as the displacement of the people previously living in Los Alamos and the inaccuracies during Oppenheimer's university days. If you're going to make a historic biopic, the truth should be the most important and entertaining thing and Nolan chose to forgo that for Jimmy Neutron style thinking sequences that went on in entirely in Oppenheimer's head. I feel gaslit by all the positive reviews I can't understand why it's been so well received despite it's many glaring flaws. I'm not asking this movie to pass the Bechtel test or to include the victims of the Manhattan project, but come on, at the very least the movie could've portrayed a little more of the harsh reality instead of the unnecessary and uninspired dialogue. This movie was a pretentious waste with very little to say that hasn't already been done better.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",A little biased as a Nolan fan. But one of the best all around movies I've seen in a long time.,POSITIVE

"Jul 23, 2023","A very important movie snd interesting historical details about events we only know superficially ‚Äî Hiroshima, Truman, Manhattan Project, etc,   But 3 hours plus ‚Äî too long!  Needed to tighten up the first 60-90 minutes!  Robert Downey Jr sd Emily Blount were excellent!!",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","The movie was too long, and boring at times.   Casting wasn't great.  There wasn't a real likable character that you would root for.   There is just too much politics and not enough science inserted into the film.  The ending was anticlimactic.  Between this and the hot mess of Tenet, I will have my reservation about going to another Nolan film in the theater.  His storytelling has become so incoherent that it takes away from the movie going experience.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","I'm not into physics and I find quite boring when films re-create massive events and even more historical ones, but, this movie did it, it kept me in the seat, holding  my breath.

"Jul 23, 2023","Commanding performances, masterful filmmaking, and propulsive editing come together in effortless fashion to create the movie-going experience of the year. This is Nolan's masterpiece; a film we will continue to talk about for decades to come. Bravo.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023","OPPENHEIMER is being hailed as an epic motion picture. And it will probably win writer/director Christopher Nolan one or more Oscars. However, the first half (or more) of the three long hours is weighted down in discussions of theoretical physics and the race with Russia and Germany to develop an atomic bomb. VERY dialogue heavy. I confess I was bored. Additionally, many characters are introduced in the first half of the movie (scientists, military officers and academicians) that caused my head to spin. It didn't help that the timeline jumps around considerably. 

The last hour is where the movie reaches its stride. We see how a bitter Lewis Strauss (chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission who felt slighted by Oppenheimer) yielded his considerable power to put Oppenheimer through a brutal hearing designed to destroy the physicist's reputation and limit his ability to have a voice regarding controlling the use of nuclear weapons globally. The last hour also includes the dramatic atomic bomb test, which was created without CGI. Nolan has explained that the tech crew built a ""mini bomb,"" which when filmed up close caused an optical illusion to trick viewers into thinking the explosion is significantly bigger. 

Soft-spoken Cillian Murphy in the title role is compelling, and Robert Downey Jr., who is nearly unrecognizable as Strauss, turns in an award-worthy performance. 

If you go, be sure you are ready for a slow-moving journey to the final leg.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 23, 2023","The hectic dialogs, jumps between different timelines, and unbelievable boring hearings all over a course of 3 hours were hardly bearable.

"Jul 22, 2023","Cast is great. Actors did their best! Camera and visually it was pleasure. But Nolan, the scenario, my thought is that the film must be named ""Oppenheimer vs Strauss"". It is the story for the atomic bomb and the scientists, but only 1 hour of it, 2 hours is a story that was too long presented the fight between those two, not even drama but boring presented ""lawsuit"". Even the 3 sex scenes were somehow executed, but not giving minimal to any consequences to the characters. I was expecting the character guilt to be better revealed.

"Jul 22, 2023","Cillian Murphy's idiosyncratic nature was the perfect fit for J. Robert Oppenheimer. Nolan's 3 hour cinematic marvel really takes you into this world of history and war. A movie that makes you continue to think about it for days after you see it. A haunting story filled with high emotion scenes and a a marvelous score that takes you out of your seat. No really, seeing it in Imax Literally lifted me out of my seat.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Apart from the incredible knowledge available in the years before the second world war, you see the combination of passion and daily life struggles entering a weapon of destruction race ending in a political drama screwed by cowards and ambitious men looking for a man to blame who realizes that he built the mother of all bombs.....",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","An complete masterpiece, and definite Oscar contender. Incredible acting performances all round, all round fantastic cinema. Everything, all down to the very pacing of the scenes, the snapping from one scene to the next (especially in the first act) at lightning pace, all reflecting the mental state of Oppenheimer throughout the film. Just incredible.",POSITIVE

"Jul 22, 2023","This movie is filled with fantastic acting from the main stars, especially Cillian Murphy. I felt the emotions of Oppenheimer far more than I could have imaged.

"Jul 22, 2023","While Oppenheimer is incredibly dense and sometimes hard to follow it does deserve the title ""Best of 2023."" This might be Christopher Nolan's most compelling and complex film to date. Incredible performances from everyone, a great production design, and a chilling moment that reminds us why we love going to the movies. And a important moral message that is very prevalent in 2023.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","An absolutely great movie but I feel will get a lot of lower reviews due to the sheer amount of hype gathered around the release disappointing a few people. The effects are great and truly immersive, great casting choice, and a story plot with decent pacing that keeps you occupied. A great watch all around",POSITIVE

"Jul 22, 2023","The cast was really good, the direction was on another level, and the visuals are probably the best I've seen. Yes, there are many parts that are just dull, but the exciting parts make up for it. Finally, I will say that I think it could've been 20 minutes shorter. In the end, Christopher Nolan has done it again!",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",Top de mais  recomendo vale a pena,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","An exceedingly lengthy and boring movie about the personal vendetta of one person. The atomic bomb was more of a backdrop story. Such utter rubbish direction. I cannot believe the reviews by others praising this movie. I never leave reviews but am motivated to create and account and write this review.

The story is shallow and the direction is the worst I have seen in 40 years. The forced nudity and sex scenes are not needed at all along with the constant shifting of storytelling. Please don't waste this time of your life. Go see anything else instead.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 22, 2023","This film was beyond incredible. So incredible that it was tough to accept the seraphic surreality presented to us.

"Jul 22, 2023",This movie is a historical achievement. Nolan wasn't wrong about IMAX version of Oppenheimer. Absolute must see whether it be in theaters or at home when it goes to a streaming service.,POSITIVE

"Jul 22, 2023","Debo decir que tras ver algunos de los Proyectos de Christopher Nolan como su trilog√≠a de Batman, El Origen, Interestelar, Tenet, etc, debo reconocer que Oppenheimer es otro excelente proyecto que ha dirigido el mismo director. Toda esa tensi√≥n que ha traido y las actuaciones que son joya, sobre todo los efectos especiales y el sonido como lo manejaron tan pero tan bien, la manera en como contaron la historia de Oppenheimer y su invenci√≥n y sobre todo el mostrar las consecuencias de su invento, fueron bien manejados. Definitivamente deben darle el premio de Mejor Pel√≠cula, Mejor Actor, Mejor Gui√≥n, Mejor Sonido. 10/10. Obligatoria de Ver.",POSITIVE

"Jul 22, 2023","Oppenheimer was breathtaking, and powerful. I'm still processing it, but it truly left me speechless. A movie who shows us a man who moved the world twice. Cillian Murphy, and Robert Downey Jr. Both had exceptional performances. I absolutely think they could win Oscar's. Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, had an incredible presence. 

Watching the explosion and the aftermath was mesmerizing and like an out of body experience. Visually stunning, and the score was exceptional. 3 hours of perfection. I already want to watch this again. It really left a lasting impression on me.

And that end scene with Einstein left me in awe. What he did not only changed the war but changed the world, creating a chain reaction. 

""I have become death, the destroyer of worlds""",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",Actually I was quite impressed how the story was told. Actors were great and as I am a big fan of cillian murphy it was a match. Great film.,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Oppenheimer movie review.  I liked it.  I'm going to see it again.  But the film has some significant flaws.  

Pros:  Excellent acting performances by the great cast.  Emily Blunt was fantastic.  So was Robert Downey Jr.  Cilian Murphy was very good, but wait for the cons.  The Los Alamos sequences are masterpiece caliber.   The McCarthy era takedown sequences were scary good.  The period piece treatment, costumes, cars, etc. were time machine spot on.  Cinematography was brilliant.

Cons:  Overscored.  Music was too much and drowned out a lot of dialogue.  First third of the movie was choppy and confusing.  Recommend reading a bio piece beforehand.   The porny parts were awkward and unnecessary.  Murphy was great in pantomime,  but the Irish lilt is discernable and a little distracting.  Overall though, his performance is Oscar-worthy.  Biggest problem though . . . not a single shot and barely a mention of the Japanese bomb victims.

Oppenheimer is a very good, sometimes great movie.  I wasn't too confused by the back and forth timeline because I have seen another, chronological portrayal of this part of history.  Check out the 1995 TV movie ""Hiroshima"".  Really well done in docu-drama style from U.S. and Japanese points of view a la ""Tora Tora Tora"".  IMHO, seeing this one first will really enhance the ""Oppenheimer"" viewing experience.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","The sound design in this film plays such a big part in the story and character of Oppenheimer.  Nolan and edited this so tightly and expertly you are not left waiting throughout the entire 3 hr run time.  He showcases the cognitive dissonance of the character with visuals and sound‚Ä¶it's truly amazing to watch.  A little bit of pretentiousness thrown in, but that is fitting for the subject matter.  You know, scientists. I enjoyed it immensely and this is for sure a film you should see (and hear!) on the big screen!",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","So good!!! A great history lesson, but in the best way!!!",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","It's long, yes. But such a running time is necessary to tell such a complex story about an equally complex person. 45 minutes into it, I caught myself thinking that they could have shaved the first 30 minutes of the film, and the audience would have been no worse off. After finishing the movie, and experiencing the sum of its parts, I realized, and appreciated, the vision Christopher Nolan had for this project.

Aside from some editing (in which scenes transfer seemingly too quickly and aren't well-established) and the sound editing (at times, the ambient on screen rumbling makes it difficult to fully hear the dialogue), the movie, itself, is damn-near perfect. Nolan's use of large-format and IMAX cameras present a wonderful cinematographic experience. His use of practical effects and sets, adds an authenticity to a film that wouldn't be the same if bloated with CGI (not that the film is a series of never ending explosions, mind you).

The absolute genius of the story, however, it's is cast. Passing for an almost-doppelganger of Dr Oppenheimer himself, especially when in the period clothing, Cillian Murphy's performance commands each scene he's in. That isn't to say that his character is completely likeable. Again, it's a complex story about someone who was anything but one-dimensional.

The supporting cast is equally wonderful. Robert Downey Jr's performance Lewis Strauss was a perfect exposition of talent that reminds us all that he's much, much more than the low hanging fruit of the comic book superhero or famed detective (and eons removed from his disastrous season on SNL). There's a reason he earned his first Oscar nomination for Chaplin. Oppenheimer reminds you why. 

Emily Blunt, as Oppenheimer's wife, is the most tragic of the cast. She hurts, but through her pain, she still loves and appreciates the importance of her husband. With that said, I wish she had more screen time. 

(If Murphy, Downey Jr and Blunt aren't just nominated (and win!) for their inevitable respective Oscars, I'll personally march on Hollywood, pitchfork in hand!) 

The remaining characters are quite the ensemble, all perfectly placed and performed, much to the benefit of the audience. The only downside was that the audience really doesn't get to know most of the other characters, but we're not really upset that we don't. Admittedly it was fun to see quite a few A-List actors in a role, when I wasn't aware they were even in the cast. 

If you want to absorb a story about The Bomb, shady politicians, political intrigue, antifascists, anti-antifascists, important US history, physics, revenge, and a man at his highest and lowest points in his life, then this near-prefect movie about quite less-than-perfect man is in theaters now. It's a three hours well-spent.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","I don't know why this film is being called a masterpiece. Like all Nolan films, the message is nothing.  We never really know Oppenheimer and film offers only surface rather than depth. I guess the multi-stocks that Nolan uses blind people to the nothingness here. For three hours, I waited for something to move me, make me laugh, or tell me something I didn't know. As usual for this overrated director, none of the above happened. Murphy remains a cypher and Robert Downey's Lewis Strauss takes over most of the picture leave me asking a big ""So what.""  I suppose I should be grateful that Nolan at least acknowledging that Oppenheimer and many of the Manhattan scientists were Jewish, as was Strauss, but these are ancillary details.  The actor cast as Einstein is a joke.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",The best movie i have ever seen. Good experience.,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",A must see in imax.  Fast paced.  Excellent casting..  thought provoking.  Great peak behind the scenes of history and seeing Oppenheimer‚Äôs life.,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Too superficial. Unfocused. Many characters, but no distinct roles (e.g. pro bomb, contra bomb). Only hints at character motivation, personality, relationships and conflicts, but no depth. Pacing: mostly told in timelapse, constantly fast-forwarding to the next short scene. Overarching plot (political intrigue with L. Strauss) had no stakes imo because for me it's not a big deal if Oppenheimer leaked plans to the Soviets (it'd even be a good thing for balance between the superpowers) - it's also so unimportant compared to the question of Oppenheimer's individual responsibility for the death of thousands. The last hour was unnecessary. The plot with his lover was also irrelevant. The score was the best thing. I wish they would have covered the moral conflicts in a more profound way, especially in retrospect. Wasted potential.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 22, 2023","One of the most powerful movies Ive ever seen that brings you in emotionally and physically as when the bomb goes off, makes you feel like you yourself just witnessed the first atomic bomb detonate. The acting is top notch with a complex story and deep messages that leave you walking out of the theater speechless. Highly recommend seeing it in Imax",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",Superb storytelling by Nolan,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",From the cinematography to the sound design there is no movie quite like it. Most likely the best film to watch in imax we will ever see!,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",Very interesting.  Great acting.,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",CINEMA is back. See it on the best screen possible. I saw it in IMAX with laser and will likely see it again in 70mm since I'm nowhere near a real IMAX theater.,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","""Oppenheimer"" is an awe-inspiring masterpiece that left me utterly captivated from start to finish. Directed with finesse and a deep understanding of historical nuances by a visionary filmmaker, the movie intricately delves into the life and complexities of one of the most influential figures in modern history. The film's impeccable cinematography and attention to detail transport the audience back in time, immersing them in the tumultuous era of World War II and the race to build the first atomic bomb. The stellar ensemble cast delivers powerful and emotionally charged performances, particularly the protagonist, whose portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer is nothing short of phenomenal. The movie skillfully weaves together Oppenheimer's personal struggles and intellectual brilliance, shedding light on the moral dilemmas faced by scientists involved in such groundbreaking discoveries. It leaves you questioning the ethical ramifications of scientific advancements while marveling at the brilliance of human intellect. The meticulously crafted sets and costumes further enhance the authenticity of the period, making you feel like a witness to history unfolding. ""Oppenheimer"" is a thought-provoking cinematic experience that not only educates but also stirs a profound appreciation for the complex human condition. It will undoubtedly stand as a timeless classic and is a must-watch for cinephiles and history enthusiasts alike.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Oppenheimer is the 2nd best movie I've seen in my life, behind only Interstellar. 
I had an almost transcendent experience watching this movie in IMAX. The soundtrack touches the depths of the soul. The door that Nolan opened for Einstein needs to be explored in the future, by him I hope. The world having kind of forgotten about Einstein.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Good acting, good cinematography. Confusing timeline, boring, waaaay too long.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","3 hours to tell this story was entirely too excessive‚Ä¶ the first 90 minutes took entirely too long to set the stage for the rest of the story.   The second half  of the movie did bring things together and was well done.  In all, this story could have been told in less than 2 hours.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",Very good film. Great performances from main characters but too long. Could have been edited further. So good but not great.,NEUTRAL
"Jul 22, 2023",anyone who says this isn‚Äôt a 5 star movie should stick to marvel.,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Having read ""American Prometheus"" and being an avid researcher of the atomic era, Nolan absolutely knocked this one out of the park. ""Oppenheimer"" is a haunting ode to the atomic revolution, and Cillian Murphy masterfully plays the father of the atomic bomb. My expectations were completely subverted as the movie became a psychological thriller, truly capturing the nightmare of atomic weaponry.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","I am not stupid, and I do know what quality is but... I did not enjoy this.  If one is easily starstruck then they should have plenty to focus on and enjoy in this film.  Technically speaking, it may be flawless, but so might a film like Ad Astra.  There is so much dialogue in Oppenheimer, with alot of interwoven detail to it as it moves at such a pace that... I had no idea what was being said, it may as well have been a foreign language film, partly because I kept falling asleep.  The sound and score of it was amazing, the visuals impeccably done, and the acting from top to bottom was as sharp as can be... everything else left me dumbfounded and now I'm left eternally wondering why everyone else enjoyed this and I did not (not the first time that's happened.)  It was an impressive three-hour piece of film but was it fun, or even enjoyable, to watch?

Like with other recent films that everyone seemed to like but me; such as the previous mentioned Ad Astra, Ford vs Ferrari, Dune, The Batman, and Tenet I'll reserve final judgement until a home viewing... and more than a couple of the aforementioned did get better after a home viewing.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","This movie has a very complicated storytelling and is at first very confusing, but is still a must watch. Everything is being told in a very awesome but confusing way and don't even get me started on the visual aspects.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Incredible feat! Nolan masterpiece for sure, Oscar worthy performances, just an amazing film. Can‚Äôt wait to watch it again!",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","It‚Äôs too long and doesn‚Äôt do a great job of vilifying Oppenheimer. It feels more like a justification or redemption story than a biopic of the man responsible for creating weapons of mass destruction. There is little moral ambiguity from Murphy‚Äôs performance, and again, it feels like it‚Äôs justifying the need for the atomic bomb. The entire Strauss storyline could have been cut and it would‚Äôt have changed any of the major story beats. It‚Äôs a good movie overall, but not the masterpiece it thinks it is. ",NEUTRAL

Watching the frenetic drive of the man hurtling towards creating the atomic bomb, and those reflective  moments of horror is expertly done cillian murphy is outstanding. Robert Downey Jr as his nemesis gives his best ever performance as a conniving politician. Too many great turns to mention but Gary Oldman as Truman bags that one.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",One of the best movies I've seen in theaters in a long time. I was lucky to see it in 70mm IMAX and it was worth every penny. Such a great film the imagery the dialog the power this film holds is outstanding. Please see it in 70mm IMAX.,POSITIVE

"Jul 22, 2023","This movie is good, it name drops scientists and politicians every second, shows you Oppenheimer's world and that era, but what it fails to do is connect personally with the audience. It's good plot, lots and lots of dialogue, all very well thought of, but somehow lacks deeper connection with the viewer. You don't get attached to the characters. Like Nolan's other masterpieces-dark knight trilogy, and interstellar- even though the subjects were far away from normal life it made the audience connect with the protagonist and its characters. This is what has been missing from Nolan's last few movies. Which is sad, coz the expectations are too high now from a Christopher Nolan movie.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 22, 2023","Omg......best movie I've seen all year. Visually stunning, cinematography, acting was incredible.  The movie was strong on its own; so, I could have done without the brief, unnecessary sexual activity scene. I would predict the 'Oscar' nominations for this movie will be numerous.

"Jul 22, 2023","Oppenheimer, especially when seen in its intended format is a phenomenal piece of cinema. Although very dialogue driven, the sound design and accompanying score, along with at times breathtaking visuals makes for what one can only describe as a cinematic masterpiece. Murphy undoubtedly delivered an emotive and captivating performance as J. Robert Oppenheimer, as did his co-stars and supporting cast alike. The multiple cameos added a fun game of 'who's who' of faces into the mix, making for an all-round rich and exciting experience. Definitely a must see.",POSITIVE

"Jul 22, 2023","Incredible film. If you don't like historical movies , you're not going to enjoy this. It's long but the way Nolan tells the story is electric. Cillian Murphy's portrayal of Oppenheimer- specifically his struggles with anxiety and depression- is exquisite, and Nolan's use of music and volume serve to amplify the incredible acting of this amazing cast. Emily Blunt's take on Oppenheimer's wife Kitty, is haunting. Robert Downey Jr, Josh Hartnett, and Rami Malek are perfectly cast. A wonderfully captivating telling of the story of a haunted man.",POSITIVE

"Jul 22, 2023","Overall I liked it. But I also have to mention that:
- No, you don't need to see it in 70mm IMAX, all you see in the film are close-up faces. I could have the same feeling even if I could watch it on my TV. The real reason is the 'Cinema' I guess. We know Nolan is obsessed with the 'Cinema' (Which I agree, from a point)  
- The time signature trick was good in music. I don't think I would like to listen to it specifically but it was good.
- Less science, more politics. I was expecting to see more discussions and achievements about the project.
- The demon core accident was not there. It could be fitted in there like a scene from 'Chernobyl'.
- A lot of transitions between cuts. It felt like a trailer for 3+ hours.
- You'll get jump scares from the sound.
- Matt Damon & Robert Downer Jr. add much to the film. 

But you need to watch it for the second time.",POSITIVE

"Jul 22, 2023",Fucking Mind Blowing,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","The movie is generally very good, dialogues are really awesome, tension is giving you gooseflesh, and those 3 hours are passing by really fast. However, the bomb explosion is sadly not good for me. It looks more like a casual bomb explosion on some oli rafinery, but definitely not like an atomic bomb. Also, the timline could be a little more clear.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","3 horas no son largas en esta pelicula, las actuaciones son increibles  y dignas de de un Oscar. Esta pelicula tiene de todo, ese salto de epocas es la escencia de la pelicula, definitivamente una pelicula para gente conocedora y de buen gusto.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",This is truly the best movie of the year!! What a powerful performance by Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. They both deserved an Oscar for Best Actor and Supporting Actor..,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Really really slow and emotionless. I expected a lot more but definitely down a few pegs from movies like There Will be Blood. The nudity was gratuitous. Yes, Hollywood, you can have meaningful sex scenes without nudity. Seems like the movie was made 3 hours long on a dare. There sure wasn't enough story for that length. I thought they did a terrible job defining all the players in the drama. Even the big event of the explosion was just a ""meh"" moment. The last 20 mins showing the drama between Downey and Cillian was the only interesting part of the film. After the horrendous Dunkirk, I think Nolan should steer clear or historical films.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",Absolute Masterpiece.To compress a 4 decade long journey packed in a movie could get you in trouble. but Christopher Nolan knows how and when to accelerate or to slow down for a better pick up on Situations.,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Good story, but long. At times, pretty boring.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","little long, but it Fid move at a decent Clio. regardless of how he felt he saved American lives.  Nuclear weapons would have been developed with or without his help or input.  it actually probably has saved more lives in the long run as a deterrent for war. However nice to see, the government hasn't changed much.. still trying to frame and abuse their power and make up scandals",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Sorry, just awful. The ""voice"" of the director was cold, distant, detached. Nolan ""told"" the story but didn't show. Despite its very long length, scenes were rushed and not explored. Only tugged at my emotions twice. Dialogue was poor.. Very disappointing. Robert Downey Junior should have played Oppenheimer.. Cillian Murphy was not that great. Characters were held at arms' length. I much preferred Sound of Freedom",NEGATIVE

"Jul 22, 2023","The best movie to come out of Hollywood in years maybe decades. The acting is superb from Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey, Jr. The other actors are great. See it in IMAX if you can.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Too long! This seems to be 3 movies crammed into one. The first hour is slow and boring. The second hour, the actual making and explosion of the bomb is stunning. The third hour is just a lot of talk.  If the movie had ended after the second hour, this would be a great movie. As it is, the script needed serious editing. Not to be missed because there's nothing but superhero junk released these days with very few adult movies. But it could have been so much better.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 22, 2023","It was fine but the way the story moves rapidly, despite being a 3-hour film, makes it hard to really comprehend what is happening. On top of that, the sound mixing is as bad as any other Christopher Nolan film. You can't hear anything and they don't take the time to introduce the characters well. I found myself trying to figure out what they were even talking about for most of the film.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 22, 2023","Long, but so worth it! Definitely see it in IMAX theatres because the experience is out of this world!",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","In Nolan's filmography, which very few directors in history can rival, OPPENHEIMER possibly stands out as the best, and certainly most pure form of cinema. Give Cillian Murphy the Oscar NOW.

Let me preface this by saying, I don't think this movie is for everyone. It's not your usual Nolan suspense/thriller blockbuster movie, and I feel like a lot of people who gave it negative reviews went into this movie with Interstellar/Inception/The Dark Knight type expectations. This is not a movie about The Atomic Bomb or The Manhattan Project. It's called OPPENHEIMER for a reason. And for others, it just may not be their cup of tea, which is totally fine. Maybe the subject matter isn't that gripping to them, or maybe the big science/political terminologies turned them off.

Regardless, I find this movie to be one of the best cinema experiences I have ever had. I myself am not a big student of history, but this movie is crafted in such a brilliant way that it's hard to keep your eyes off the screen. 3 hours flew by so quickly, and I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. The acting by everyone was superb, but special shouts need to be given to Cillian Murphy, who really should win the Best Lead Actor Oscar, and RDJ who most definitely will be nominated for the Best Supporting Actor. Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Matt Damon too were outstanding.

Prior to me watching the film, I browsed the reviews and many said that the ""courtroom drama"" that follows the Trinity test is a bit boring, but honest to God I feel like that was the best part of the movie, or atleast as good as what came before. It flows seamlessly, and the tension between the characters is palpable. It tugs at your emotions and really does a fantastic job of putting the audience in the mind and heart of Oppenheimer.

Visually, this movie is jaw-dropping, especially coupled with the fact that there are exactly 0 CGI shots. It's a ridiculous feat of filmmaking that only Nolan could do. The build-up to the Trinity test will have your heart in your mouth throughout, and the eventual release is terrifyingly beautiful.

However I do have one teeny tiny criticism - towards the middle of the movie I felt like we were jumping from scene to scene way too quick, and at times it was slightly tough to keep track. I know this was purposely done in a bid to ramp up the tension (which it did!), but I felt it could have been paced slightly better.

And the ending. OH MY GOD THE ENDING. Towards the end I was so curious as to how this movie ends, and holy balls Nolan really hit the mark - it ties the whole story together poetically. Such a beautiful way to go out.

A masterpiece by every definition of the word. Quite possibly Nolan's best work.

100/100.",POSITIVE

"Jul 22, 2023","An important story, sensitively told but with all the usual Nolan spectacle.
It feels slightly more indie in its quieter scenes but the depiction of the Trinity test has to be seen as large as possible. Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer is a stand out in a uniformly great performing cast. I saw it at a fairly standard IMAX and it added to the multi-sensory experience.",POSITIVE

"Jul 22, 2023","Nearly perfect movie! The score will def win an Oscar and the performances particularly from Murphy, RDJ, and Blunt were some of the best. I'm a WW2 history buff and this gave me most of what I wanted.

"Jul 22, 2023",The entire movie was riveting from beginning to end. Stacked cast with great performances all around especially Cillian as Oppenheimer and RDJ as Strauss.,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",Yet Nolan should find the way make a more emotional and deeper movie. Movie did not meet my expectations. No dynamics and entourage.,NEUTRAL
"Jul 22, 2023","10/10. Only reason it's not an 11/10 is because of the length, but it goes by. Each moment is captivating and the ending is one of the most satisfying I have seen since Shawshank.

"Jul 22, 2023","Oppenheimer is a masterpiece. Nolan is a genius. Murphy and Downey Jr delivered the best performances of their careers. The score is brilliant. If I didn't love Interstellar so much, I would say this is Nolan's best work to date. Oh and that ending... goosebumps all over. 10/10",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","This should be the movie that final wins Nolan an academy award. Stunning, gripping, beautiful, and much much more. Murphey Truely should win best actor this year with RDJ showing yet again that his is one of the best actors of his generation.",POSITIVE

"Jul 22, 2023","Oppenheimer is a defining film for Christopher Nolan. It is a culmination of the finest Nolan works, paired with incredible performances from Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. As a historical story, its depiction is everything you'd want a film like this to be. A masterclass of interweaving all threads in the tapestry that is the Manhattan Project and its patriarch. Excellent film",POSITIVE

"Jul 22, 2023","I withheld half the stars to represent half the dialog I could not hear because of the (wonderful) musical score. I had both hands cupped behind my ears, which made it impossible to eat my popcorn, but still couldn't make out what the stellar cast were saying. I left after 30 minutes. I'll watch it at home where I can turn on the subtitles. The director knows from his previous films the orchestration he chooses drowns out the dialog. I understand that in real life you can't always hear what someone is saying but I don't pay $15 for the privilege of doing so. Don't come at me with that ""you don't understand the artistry of cinematic sound design"" or I'll tip a table, but I'll SPEAK UP so you can hear me over the sound of the impact.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Great movie! Makes you think quite a bit. Only complaint is the audio, at times it was very hard to hear what the characters are saying to each other",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Christopher Nolan proves his genius, as he delivers this atomic epic. I am a huge Nolan fan, having watched almost all of his movies, and this one goes right into the list of top 10 best films ever made.

Oppenheimer the atomic physicist has been a colossal figure in history, hailed as the father of the atomic bomb and this movie delves deep into what kind of a person he was starting from his younger years in his university and to his final years as a seasoned science extraordinaire. We seldom get a look of this level into the minds of such sophisticated people. 
The whole cabal of the most intelligent men and women on Earth is shown to us in a manner that is deeply satisfying and illuminating.

The movie delivers what is in its name, Oppenheimer, Its focus is on the man, and one learns a lot about how the scientist of that calibre operated what obstacles he faced, and how his earth-shattering invention changed not only his life but also the life of all people on Earth for years to come. 

Talking about the atomic age, we obviously have to discuss the bombing sequence. It's an exceptionally well done one, and in the theatres you WILL be at the edge of your seat, anticipating the testing of the first atomic bomb ever on the Trinity site in New Mexico. 

The movie has many features of a psychological thriller, which might be surprising to many as this is a biopic and yet feels like your typical Nolan rollercoaster ride, and to be honest it even exceeds that! 
The colour grading is phenomenal and really sets the tone for a 1940-50s epic. The soundtrack will send you into another world of hope and horror, Ludwig G√∂ransson has delivered one of the most awe-inspiring and sombre soundtracks there is.

Do not go on its run time of 3 hours, the three hours will fly by in almost an instant. It will change your life, it's an emotional epic, it will enlighten and might send you on the path of knowledge. It's a must-watch, make haste! 

My rating: 10/10 (5 stars)",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","This is a fascinating character study on Oppenheimer with an amazing performance from Cillian Murphy. However, it wasn't what I thought it would be, and I don't know if you needed to drive out of your way to find a ""true"" IMAX 70MM theater. It wasn't the visual feast that Nolan is sometimes known for, and frankly how this was film was built up to be. On the other hand, there is some elite craftsman storytelling going on here with how Nolan threads the narrative of Oppenheimer and the myth of the great man and the teardown that we love to eulogize in the US. The editing was superb, the score was fantastic, and when we did have our visual coup de grace bomb moment, it kept your eyes glued to the screen in an unconventional manner. 

I did think some of the celebrity casting was distracting at times, but there are some solid performances here from plenty of actors you know. However only Cillian's really left me blown away. 

Everyone is talking about how this feels like Oliver Stone's JFK, and they aren't wrong. I thought the same thing but the technical aspects of it are better than JFK, the weaving of the narratives, the lead actor performance are all better than JFK. Is the story going to grip everyone as hard as JFK? I don't know about that. 

I think I wanted to love this more than I did. Maybe it‚Äòs because I knew too much about Oppenheimer going in, maybe it's because my expectations were too high, in conclusion,  I really liked this for the entire 3 hours but I never reached that level where I loved this film. It just never reached that point for me.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",Gillian Murphy has my vote for Best Actor.  His portrayal of Oppenheimer struck me as his Opus performance.,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Great cinematography in general. The film throws a lot of info at you, so it can hard to keep up. It's much better after a 2nd watch",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Oppenheimer is a thrilling and riveting drama. From the first shot of the film to very last zoom in on Cillian Murphy's face your eyes are glued to the screen. This film is demands 100% of your attention and it keeps it that way through the entire run-time. Oppenheimer is also a very emotional story that takes you inside the mind of the American Prometheus and allows you to feel the tragedy, sadness and the regret faced by J Robert Oppenheimer.

Christopher Nolan has yet again delivered a job-dropping experience that will take a few days to recover from. Last, but not the least the acting in this film is beyond astounding, especially, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon and our star Cillian Murphy. Special shoutout to Florence Pugh and literally every single cast member. 

I can only rate this 5 stars similar to Oppenheimer's headspace in the film, I'm giving this a 6 out 5 stars.

Absolute Masterpiece!",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",Too long. There weren't many existing things and me and my partner fall asleep half through the movie. So after that we just left as the movie was pretty boring.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Cillian Murphy, who played Oppenheimer was awesome. But the whole time I kept thinking he looks so Irish. Why are they having this guy play a Jewish character? Aside from that, the movie is way too long. So is the hype! Frankly, I preferred ""Sound of Freedom"". That was an amazing film. I'll take Mission Impossible over Barbie any day. I enjoyed all four movies to some extent, but if I was to rank the 4, it would be sound of freedom number one Mission impossible number 2, Oppenheimer in third and Barbie last.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 22, 2023","The cinematography of Christopher Nolan delighted as always. The actors gave it their all in every scene but the choppy nature of the film took away from the gravity of many of the performances towards the beginning of the film. I appreciated the attempt to tell the story in a non-linear fashion, but it came across as being disjointed for the sake of being disjointed instead of adding to the story. Many of the earlier moments in the film did little to serve the characterization of Oppenheimer that the film settles on in the end. The last third of the movie is where everything starts to  click, and I believe at least 60 minutes could've been shaved off of the runtime in service of a more succinct and engaging story. All in all it's not a bad film, but I left wanting less and more at the same time.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 22, 2023",Left me speechless. It is a must see.,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","An all-time great.  Never thought Nolan would top his own legendary bar, but this may have done its.  Absolutely stunning, horrifying, and breathtaking.",POSITIVE

""Now I am become Death, the Destroyer of Worlds.""

Christopher Nolan cuando se trata de darnos un deleite audiovisual, con un gui√≥n y un elenco de talentos √âlite hace que su nuevo filme de J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) sea su nueva obra maestra. Definitivamente este filme hay que verlo en Imax en su maximo explendor.Nolan llena cada mimuto con actuaciones estelares de Robert Downey jr., Emily Blunt, Matt Damon y Florence Pugh, basada en hechos reales de el padre de la primera bomba at√≥mica creada en los Estados Unidos, ver a Albert Einstein en su maximo explendor fue algo que me lleno de alegria, no muchos conocen su historia pero hay una escena a principios de el filme y al final entre Oppenheimer y Einstein que ademas de dejarlos con intriga por 3 horas les bolar√° la cabeza que fue la conversaci√≥n de ambos antes de que la verdadera trama comienze. Lo que sobresale aparte a su cinematograf√≠a es la conecci√≥n en los personajes, cada uno es especial, importante y cada narraci√≥n la hace ser mas interesante cada hora que pasa y les estoy hablando de 3 horas de preparaci√≥n.

Que me gust√≥ de la pelicula? ‚úÖ

-Ô∏èLa narrativa es espelusnante, el drama y la historia detras de este biopic tan importante en la historia de la segunda guerra mundial, las bombas de Nagazaki y Hyroshima y en que afect√¥ su reputaci√≥n, dentro de todo este desmadre se incluye uno de los mejores soundtracks creado para este filme, el editaje de sonido, la filmaci√≥n, los efectos no creados por CGI, todo en este filme es genial y tr√°gico a la vez.

-El gui√≥n es uno perturbante, inquietante y interesante todo en una mezcla at√≥mica para cualquier fan√°tico del cine o de sus trabajos como Director.

Oppenheimer es una entrada completamente distinta en el canon de Nolan, una que es incre√≠blemente sonora y est√° completamente incrustada en un amplio sentido de seriedad. Est√° alimentado por una sobreabundancia de primeros planos de rostros que luchan por reconocer qui√©nes son y otros que han escondido ante otros que creen lo que realmente son. 
 
-Es una epopeya si es bien decir,incre√≠blemente, triste que usa su peso filos√≥fico y emocional para ejercer su control sobre los espectadores y absorberlos por completo en su visi√≥n que lo abarca todo el gran EFECTO NOLAN.

Que no me gust√≥ de la pelicula?‚õîÔ∏è

-Si Nolan tuvo la aud√°cia de crear sin efectos especiales la ""bomba at√≥mica pero en realidad me esper√© un poco mas de agresividad al ser filmada, si luce cool y el efecto closed up fue fantastico pero para lo que vi hubiese preferido CGI sin miedo.

En fin Oppenheimer traza al hombre a medida que pasa de ver sus teor√≠as de electrones y neutrones convertirse en un infierno real disfrazado de bomba, sin√≥nimo de  poder: no solo nuclear, sino pol√≠tico e interpersonal, ya que Oppenheimer pasa de la portada de la revista Time al exilio interno. Rara vez se han registrado de manera tan asombrosa los altibajos de la pol√≠tica. El d√∫o revelado lentamente entre Murphy y  Jr. como Strauss es a√∫n m√°s fascinante porque la pareja, ambos absolutamente magistrales en sus papeles, rara vez comparten la pantalla. Pero en cierto modo, Oppenheimer es como la f√≠sica at√≥mica: cada peque√±a chispa se entrelaza para crear una bomba mas  masiva, impresionante y aterradora.

P.s. esto es un filme bien drama, aqui no hay acci√≥n ni explosiones a lo Mission Imposible, espera y sintoniza tu hermoso cerebro en algo mas grande que eso... ESTO ES CINE! 

Clasificada: A+
9.5/10 Superb!",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Well, at the risk of being contrary, the movie is a little overblown.  The dialogue in the beginning is almost indecipherable (not sure whether that is due to the sound mixing of the film or the blasting sound in the IMAX).   The story, while an important dramatization of actual history and a  historical yet eerily prescient telling of political persecution, is plodding.  While I wanted to have empathy for Oppenheimer, this film only makes vague attempts to humanize him.  Overall, the movie is good, not great.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 22, 2023","It's a freaking masterpiece. It's not just a historical film, it's a story about Robert. This is the story of the guy who created the atomic bomb and paid for it.

"Jul 22, 2023",Future Best Picture winner.,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","If a fine film regarding a subject matter worth telling. Oppenheimer is a story 3/4 of a century in the making and while Nolan does it some justice, the script is beyond lackluster. Like watching the description on the back sleev of a book for three hours, the bore of listening to such fine actors meander through such clunky expository dialogue wore thin. this ensemble cast that kept the film from imploding. Turning boring dialogue into explosive moments of real drama

While Nolan's talents shine bright, and the score is meticulously crafted tension remains high, Oppenheimer ultimately lacks conflict. To me the films antagonist is never quite revealed to the audience. Instead the audience is along for the historical retelling of Oppenheimer from a third party perspective. 

A historical drama with nothing of its own to say, Oppenheimer is a B- at best. See it when you have the three and a half hours to burn. See it on Father's Day as a conversation starter, but don't expect to be the conversation.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 22, 2023","To say Oppenheimer is a feat in itself of filmmaking, is an absolute understatement. All aspects are working together fluently and flow so well from scene to scene. The score is fantastic, writing acting editing all top notch. Nolan really outdid himself and so did Cillian and Robert. Couple Oscar‚Äôs incoming and please see this in 70mm!!",POSITIVE

"Jul 22, 2023",One of the best films of the year! The strong performances are a standout. Cillian Murphy's performance is hauntingly subtle and introspective. RDJ also gives a nuance performance unlike anything he's ever done. Emily Blunt is the best she's ever been! The entire cast is taking it to the next level. Score is beautiful yet devastating. The cinematography with the black and white court scenes and the landscape scenery of the New Mexico desert is so gorgeous to look at. The editing is insane the way it cuts back and forth with a beautiful rhythm almost like an instrument. My only critique is the third act goes on a bit too long for me I just wish it was a tighter. I think Chris Nolan could've cut out about 15 minutes of that third act and he would've still gotten his point across but nonetheless I was enthralled by this movie. I don't think you NEED to go out of your way to see this in IMAX but if you have easy access to an IMAX screen then you should see it that way.,POSITIVE

"Jul 22, 2023","Story could have been told linearly, didn‚Äôt need to be three hours long, and I don‚Äôt understand the emphasis placed on seeing it in IMAX since 99% of the movie is just people talking to each other. Other than that, very good.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 22, 2023",This is easily the best movie of 2023. Such an in depth experience on the creation and the CONVICTIONS that came with building the atomic bomb.

"Jul 22, 2023","Walked out after 40 minutes of being bombarded with ear-splitting, eye blurring special effects and choppy storytelling. The background noise is so loud you can't understand half the dialogue, particularly when uttered by Robert ""The Mumbler"" Downey jr.  Apparently Hollywood doesn't think the mass market is really interested in physics until it's turned into a pyrotechnical display.  Scenes were extremely short to appease the short attention spans of younger audiences who go out to movie theaters.  If you want to see a good alternative to this, watch the first series of Genius, about Einstein.  Way better.  That is, if you are an intelligent, thinking adult.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","In terms of magna opera, Spielberg has ""Schindler's List,"" Kubrick has ""2001,"" Coppola has ""The Godfather,"" Jackson has the LOTR trilogy, and Nolan has ""Oppenheimer."" 

Cilian Murphy, RDJ, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, and Jason Clarke all deserve Oscar nominations for their performances. Nolan deserves nominations for Directing and Adapted Screenplay. Hoyte van Hoytemer deserves a nomination for Cinematography and G√∂ransson deserves a nomination for Original Score.

"Jul 22, 2023","There are no words to describe how much I love this film. Christopher Nolan has created a masterpiece thar will live on to be remembered as one of the best movies of all time, and if not, THE best. This is movie of the year worthy. Now, this isn't my favorite movie, it's my fourth favorite. My type of movie is action based, comedy driven, and stuff happening everywhere, yet this dialogue driven film has managed to make me terrified of our world. Christopher Nolan has perfected his craft, and I can't wait to see more of his work.",POSITIVE

"Jul 22, 2023","An amazing master piece. I remember the Conversation between Joker and Batman from the Dark Knight movie, that conversation is by far the best. Oppenheimer is like 3 hours of that Intense conversation. Some of dialogues were truly Awesome, like Truman said to Oppenheimer, ""Hiroshima and Nagasaki don't care about who build the Atomic weapon, they care about who dropped it , and i dropped it"".

Nolan has just delivered the Best Movie of All time surpassing even GodFather.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Oppenheimer is a mind bending, flawlessly executed, intricately designed, masterfully written, skillfully edited, intelligently paced, supersize epic that thrills from start to finish. I WAS BLOWN AWAY üò± with the level of detail, the acting by everybody, oh damn Cillian Murphy shines as 'Oppenheimer' he was born to play a role like this, he's so extraordinarily brilliant üëç what a superb actor, Matt Damon was awesome, his best role to date. Florence Pugh, Emily Blunt all acted so well! Robert Downey Jr. was amazing, brilliant, outstanding. This is a film about characters, about acting. The nuances in their performances is masterfully fleshed out with such thought provoking detail and rich complexity. You won't be able to get all the subtleties on one watch. 

The score is also such a huge highlight that immensely contributed to this film. What a movie. The sound design is impeccable üëå

The super star director Christopher Nolan has outdone himself on every level with his new film. 

'Oppenheimer is cinema' 

With all the pre-release hype, calling Oppenheimer the ""best film of the century"" yes, it truly is, it lives up to all the hype and exceeds expectations. it's a film like no other, do yourself a favor and go watch this movie. The film's cumulative power is matched by the potency of Nolan's questioning. 

I all along had a strong idea that this movie will blow past expectations. A film like Oppenheimer is what we all needed for a long damn time, and Nolan has given it to us. Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. are bringing those Oscars home. More actors will receive nominations for their brilliant performances, but these two are winning those Oscars. This is my prediction. 

This is the content what cinema needs. My full review will be out on Tuesday. 

Thank you Christopher Nolan, my idol for making this movie. There's nobody who has such a creative and genius mind like you in movies today who can tell such highly resonating, intelligently crafted, highly artistic and absorbing stories that'll be remembered for over a hundred and thousands of years from today. 

I strongly mean it. 

Take a bow Sir!",POSITIVE

But my god am i happy that i went to see this film in IMAX. This is the greatest film i have ever seen. I can hardly put into words how good this is. Just everything is so goddamn perfect. Its a 10/10. Go. See. This. Film. (IN IMAX!).,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Best movie i have ever seen. It lasted 3 hours and i wasnt bored even a second. The tension, drama and acting were fenomenal.

"Jul 22, 2023","Great film Murphy and Robert Downey Jnr pulll off the best roles in their careers so far  in my opinion. Music, cinematography and flicking up and down the time line add to the overall view of the complexity of the man who not only fathered but delivered the atom bomb into the hands of a communist fearing America military. I found the film very moving and important about  the whole moral complexity of our nuclear age. The small chance that the first detonation of an atomic weapon could start a chain reaction that could destroy the whole atmosphere of the planet brought home the level of scientific dice rolling as well as expertise. I think watching Murphy watch the early film of the destruction the two bombs caused to Nagaski and Hiroshama and the effects of radiation was a great choice if we had seen the films it would have unbalanced the whole film but seeing Oppenheimers face as he watched was more powerful in understanding the weight and pain of choice and consequences. It is not a comfortable watch but that's the whole point.",POSITIVE

"Jul 22, 2023","Wow. Never walked out of a movie and thought what an actual waste of 3 hours of my life that was sitting there watching a slow, boring, over confusing display that was. Too much sexual content cmon this is a movie. No need for that stuff. Christopher Nolan disappointed me with this movie. Don't recommend watching this",NEGATIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","The only thing I was concerned about going into the movie was the length and I still believe it could have been 20 minutes or so shorter, but the way Nolan played the story out was insane. The first 15 minutes shot back and forth on two story lines and settled on a young Oppenheimer and his activities before the Manhattan project. Once this happened I was hooked. The pacing was amazing and kept me entertained for the entire movie. The visuals and sound effects were another high point of this film due to the accuracy of them along with the immersive aspect of them. I would definitely recommend this movie if you loved interstellar as the pacing is quite similar along with the amazing cast, plot, and ending. Definitely worth the 3 hour watch and I saw it as one of Nolan's best works to every be released. 10/10 would see again.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",Incredible I think it is the best film in our time. It lets me whitout words.,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","An amazing score that works very well with the constant feeling of tension. Flawless performace by Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, and probably the best on Robert Downey Jr's career. Feels a bit slow in some parts, and some of the side stories could be more developed. The best of 2023 at this point.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",for me this is best biopic I've ever see on screen and no one can do that better than Nolan himself. Its like you can't take your eyes from it not for single second from the screen usually biopics are kind of boring but this is absolute masterpiece. hats of Nolan,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",Best movie I've seen in a long time.  Starts a little slow and jumps around in time which can be a little confusing but it all comes together and just keeps getting better as the movie goes on.,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","‚ÄòOppenheimer' is a near psychedelic collage of a film. It's edited in a dizzying fashion, and it manages to maintain its propulsion for its entire 3 hour run time. It's a biopic that utilizes the cinematic language of thrillers and action films, as well as grace notes that remind one of a more impressionistic indie movie story telling. It turns the historical character of Oppenheimer in to a morally complex sort of tragic super hero (similar to Nolan's Dark Knight films), who dons a fedora and a phallic pipe the way Batman does a cape and mask. It's pure Christopher Nolan and it may be the director's crowning achievement.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",A little bit too long in my opinion but maybe one of the best films I've ever seen the tension in some scenes was almost unbearable cillian was fantastic,POSITIVE

"Jul 22, 2023","This movie is undeniably a true cinematic masterpiece. I find myself rarely drawn with such conviction to visit the cinema and watch a film multiple times, yet this one has captivated me so profoundly that I'm already planning my 3rd AND 4th viewing. The attention to style, the clever use of various aspect ratios (particularly in IMAX 70mm), the vibrant colors, and the impeccable sound and music design have left me utterly obsessed. The emotional impact it had on me is beyond words.

Trying to articulate the brilliance of this film with a lengthy and detailed review would be futile, as it exceeds any description I could provide. It is an absolute must-see, an experience that demands to be witnessed on the big screen.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","The redeeming factor was watching it in IMAX. If you expect a movie about atomic bombs this isn't it, the vast majority of the film is about the allegations against Oppenheimer. Outside of the theatre, this movie holds little substance than a theatrical documentary on the political and moral aspects of Oppenheimer's life, mostly after the atomic bomb.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",Mind bending üõêüî•. Master mind Christopher Nolan ‚ú®,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Christopher Nolan is an auteur who‚Äôs proven time and time again why he‚Äôs regarded as one of the most influential filmmakers of this generation and this instance is no different. Oppenheimer is a 3 hour long political, scientific and philosophical drama with the last hour exuding elements of an espionage thriller feature that elevates the movie even further. The film features a wide-ranging stellar cast of A-list actors who all bring their best here, finding moments to shine within the constraints of their limited screen time. Of course the centerpiece is Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer in an astounding and career defining performance as he embodies the troubled physicist to his very core, bringing his regrets about the manhattan project to the forefront in a way that had me encapsulated throughout the film. Another standout was Robert Downey Jr. as Lewis Strauss, giving one of the best performances of his career, showcasing the politician‚Äôs hunger for power and scheming undertones in an impressive black and white 70mm IMAX film perspective. Other notable performances include Emily Blunt as Kitty Oppenheimer (one of the more influential women directed by Nolan), Florence Pugh as Jean Tatlock, Matt Damon as Leslie Groves, Dane DeHann as Kenneth Nichols, Rami Malek as David Hill, Benny Safdie as Edward Teller and Tom Conti as Albert Einstein. The scene depicting the Trinity Test was devoid of sound yet gave me chills like no other, the lack of CGI and practical effects still managing to capture the absolute terror of the bomb and what it represents to Robert himself. This is followed by a speech scene that embodies Oppenheimer‚Äôs regret at his creation and fear for the death and destruction it‚Äôll bring upon the Japanese, leading to his stance against the use of nuclear weapons after Hiroshima and Nagasaki, knowing that he was responsible for the realization of the worst weapon in mankind‚Äôs history. To put it simply, Oppenheimer is Nolan‚Äôs magnum opus, a cinematic achievement that will be applauded by lovers of cinema and cement Cillian Murphy as one of the best actors of our time, I hope he gets nominated (and wins) an Oscar for this! Oppenheimer Score: 10/10",POSITIVE

"Jul 22, 2023","With a decent screenplay and camerawork, Oppenheimer stands just above the surface of the worst. It's Cillian Murphy who makes you wanna sit and enjoy the 3 hours with his acting. The other cat members are also supportive to Nolan's good direction. There are certain scenes which are quite different from Nolan's previous movies, that's because it's a biopic. The first person experience and the court drama would make you feel bored but the sudden adrenaline of senses the music triggers just want to make you sit and watch what's gonna happen next. This movie and not for action lovers. It's kind of an new direction experiment film to Chris Nolan.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 22, 2023",Sencillamente una obra de arte!!,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",A unique and incredibly interesting story told in the typical Nolan style! Much less visually spectacular from Nolan's other films but the much needed character and story development in Oppenheimer makes it a very gripping movie. The sex scene and nudity didn't add to the story and overall would have preferred more time spent on the bomb testing and visuals then some lack luster cameos. Overall very good but for sure not Nolan's best.,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Where to even begin?  Phenomenal work from every aspect.  Writing, directing, performing, sound design, etc.  This is a near perfect achievement in cinema.
It is also a very important work of art, given the nature of its subject matter.  It tackles not just the theme of war, but also the curse of genius in a world of imperfection, the hubris and rejection of that genius by lesser and often corrupt people, the moral decision to do what needs done despite knowing that it will hurt countless others, among other things.

Hats off to Nolan and company.  I left this three hour epic wanting to go right back and see it again.  Bravo.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",It was a cinematic masterpiece with an amazing cast. With Christopher Nolan as the director it was amazing,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",An incredible movie that glues your eyes to the screen from the start. The way Nolan directs his films yet alone this one just confirms that his vision to bring the upmost experience of cinema right before your eyes is never met short. Oppenheimer was great.,POSITIVE

"Jul 22, 2023",Pure excellence. Christopher Nolan knew who to pick on acting and to finally having Cillian Murphy take lead character was the best thing Christopher Nolan could have done with this film and the sound and visual effects clear and crisp and it literally felt as if you were in the film.

"Jul 22, 2023","Oppenheimer is most likely Nolan's best directed film and of the year. It's an excellent new mix of approaches, tones and cuts. The performances are exemplary, highlighting RDJ who delivers a chameleon character. Its only flaw is that it does not define how much it wants to leave to the viewer's interpretation and how much it doesn't.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",The movie is great. All actors did a fantastic job and as always Christopher Nolan was amazing. Cillian Murphy definitely winning awards for his performance.,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",This movie was not what I expected. It was a bit of a bore. I was expecting more of a documentary of the creation and his life. Sex scenes were not necessary either. Movie was too long for what little valuable content it covered.,NEUTRAL
"Jul 22, 2023","Waste of time. Waste of money and resources. Completely wasteful to shoot it in 70mm IMAX, there was no need for it. The whole film is a talking heads movie, just talk talk talk talk talk with wall-to-wall music that drowns out half the dialogue so what was more important and why the need to shoot it in a wasteful film format that uses chemicals that get thrown away down the drain??? Absolutely insane. Meaningless.  Sure the performances were decent, but the actors must have felt like they weren't really heard when half their dialogue and performances were drowned by the incessant drone of music playing over the entire movie. I would be disappointed if I was an actor in this stupid film. It's 2 hours too long, the editing could have been snappier to skip over so much stuff that just wasn't needed, most of it there to use the music as a vehicle to provide fake tension when there wasn't any in the scene at all that just showed the day to day scientific dialogue that for sure would have been boring without the drone of music that didn't really inspire any emotion because it was just there to create that fake tension so it just became distracting and annoying. And then it skipped over the actual atrocity inflicted on the Japanese people by not showing any of it at all, and then none of the subsequent massive testing done all over the world during the trial period into the 60s!!!! If you're going to talk about the horrors then the early Cold War period should have been shown here, the horrors and fears experienced by the world when they saw the size and scale of the giant tests done in Nevada and Marshall Islands in those subsequent years before his death. What a stupid movie.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","I could not understand everything because sometimes the music was louder than the speech.
But I do know that if you want to see this movie you should see it in the movie theater.
Before I went I thought it was about 50% physics and 50% about the person Oppenheimer, but it is more 20% physics, 30% about the person, 30% politics and 20% about the relationship between different people.
It felt a bit too long but then again I haven't read the book nor did I understand every dialog.
I would have liked more neat visuals and sound effects because they were really nice. I also liked the use of black&white.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",What an incredible film. The time flies by so fast and it doesn‚Äôt stop. Everyone in the cast is superb and I think Christopher Nolan has truly outdone himself,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Honestly, not his best work but incredibly entertaining. Amazing performances from the entire cast.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","I have seen other Christopher Nolan movies and I know his style, but I personally felt like this was his most confusing movie. The musical score was too loud a lot of the time that I couldn't even hear what the characters were saying. In some scenes I probably only picked up about 80% of the conversation - add in the quick dialogue, time jumps, overall challenging subject - I wasn't able to keep up. I know his movies are meant to provide great payoff towards the end, things start making sense, and although this did start happening in that last 45min, it wasn't rewarding enough for me. Too much work for the viewer. Would not watch this one again.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",Another masterpiece from Christopher Nolan.,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Christopher Nolan hits an absolute grand slam with his biopic Oppenheimer. A movie packed with a star-studded cast from head to toe, it's carried by Cillian Murphy who gives one of the most complex and emotion-provoking performances in cinema. This film is also Robert Downey Jr's best acting job of his career and Emily Blunt has some great range in her role of Kitty. The acting wasn't the only thing this movie knocked out of the park: the sound design was the best possibly ever in a film, Ludwig Goransson's score added so much gravitas to the film, and the practical visual effects were like candy on the big screen. The movie itself doesn't feel very long Nolan does a great job of pacing it along with having everything unfold in such a suspenseful manner that the last few minutes are some of the most chill-inducing moments of a film ever experienced. Nolan finds a way to take a 3-hour character study and make it one of if not the most suspenseful historical films ever made. If you are of age, go, see this movie it's one of the most important movies made because this story has truly shaped how the world is today and is just an incredible work of art.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Christopher Nolan is one of my favourite directors operating today. He makes some of the most entertaining movies in modern cinema. Even at his worst, such as with his last film Tenet, it is still way more entertaining than a majority of movies released. After the Warner Bros same-day streaming debacle they pulled; Nolan left for Universal and this is his first film with them. Does Nolan continue to deliver or has he dropped a big bomb?

Cillian Murphy has been a long-time collaborator with Nolan but this is the first time he is the main lead. He is PHENOMENAL as the titular character. He gives such nuance to his performance through body language and facial expressions alone to convey the emotion of his character. It is such a breath of fresh air from the normal yelling Oscar performances you see. He is genuinely perfect at Oppenheimer and if he doesn't get a nomination for his performance then I will be fuming! One surprising aspect of watching this film was how stacked the cast truly was. There are so many well-known actors in here that I didn't even know was even in the movie. Every supporting actor is terrific in their roles, even if it was a very minor role. The biggest standout amongst the supporting actors has got to be Robert Downey Jr as Lewis Strauss. He gives a spectacular, compelling and even frighteningly realistic performance that makes his character stand out from the crowd. It is great to see him in a non-Marvel role and knock it out of the park. If he doesn't get a nomination for the best supporting actor then I will be also fuming!

This movie is 3 hours long but you won't even feel the length because of the amazing pacing. Despite being a drama, it never drags or bores you. It moves from scene to scene very quickly in a non-chronological order but you're never lost either. There are lot of scientific jargon which is to be expected as this is about the making of the nuclear bomb. However, the excellent screenplay makes these relatively understandable so that non-scientist can easily comprehend what's going on. There is some great political tension in the 3rd act as well which was handled masterfully. In terms of story, it is juggling a lot with Oppenheimer's early life, the making of the bomb and the aftermath. Despite this, Nolan does an amazing job of exploring the character of Oppenheimer which shows all aspects of him, including his flaws. The constant build-up and tension to the bomb is incredibly engaging!

Ludwig Goransson, the composer of Tenet, returns for this film. His music score is wonderfully haunting with his use of violins. His music score illustrates the horror of the actions of these scientists. Hoyte van Hoytema also returns as the cinematographer. His cinematography is visually stunning and this is thanks to the practical sets, natural lighting and real locations used. On that note, the use of practical effects and no CGI is just so awesome to see. Nolan thankfully didn't use a real nuke but he still replicates it practically and it certainly shows! The realistic explosion meant it didn't take us out of the movie as you don't question the look of the explosion as it is real. When the explosion occurs, it is weirdly captivating and frightening to look at just like it was for the characters. The sound design is also a highlight as the sound of the explosion is impactful and even terrifying. The sound itself is the jump scare and it works. The only nitpick I have with this film, which is a common problem in Nolan movies is sometimes I just can't hear what the characters are saying because of the weird sound mixing. It isn't as bad here as it was in Tenet but it is still a problem.

Overall, what an amazing movie from Nolan! This is a monumental and engrossing achievement from him. Nolan is one of the few directors whose name alone is enough of a reason to watch and Oppenheimer does not change that. He successfully made a 3-hour biopic drama, the most entertaining film of 2023. Oppenheimer isn't one of those Oscar-bait movies that were made to just win an Oscar. It was made to be enjoyable for everyone and that is why this film should win best picture. This is a must-watch for everyone as it is the best movie of 2023 so far!",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",Christopher Nolan demonstrates that he's still on top of his game. It is very dialogue heavy and the story is spilt into three storylines that it switches back and forth from. The trinity test scene kept the whole audience silent and you could feel the tension in the room. It is a must see in IMAX to get the full immersive experience. The last scene of the movie left me speechless and worried about the future of weapons of mass destruction.,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",Best Movie so far in 2023. Best role playing by Murphy and amazing visual effects. Boom!! Mind blown away,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Overall it was a good movie. It was totally different than any other Nolan film, although the movie should have been slimmed down it was a little too long. I was disappointed that Nolan wanted to have the nude/sex scenes in the film, it did not add any emotional connection to the characters and was not even remotely essential to be in the film. All it did was make me and everyone around me uncomfortable. Those specific scenes should have just had some intimacy and not be gratuitous like it is in the film.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 22, 2023","Masterpiece of a movie. An in depth character study on the grandest of scales. Chris Nolan has knocked another one out of the park. Everything about this movie is perfect. From the directing, screenplay, acting , visuals & score. Cillian Murphy is unforgettable, Robert Downey Jr is immense. I expect this movie to sweep everything up during the awards season. Best movie of the decade.",POSITIVE

"Jul 22, 2023",Another good movie from NolanüòÑ,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Pelicula fantastica. Actuaciones increibles, incre√≠ble historia, muy buen guion, con la actuaci√≥n de Cillian se percibe de manera muy cercana a Oppenheimer y toda su evolucion durante el proyecto y tras el. Increible la banda sonora y el momento en el que todo se queda en silencio cuando estalla la bomba y despues el estruendo unos segundos despu√©s. Y TODO SIN CGI, siendo fiel a si mismo. Tambi√©n me han gustado esas imagenes que se van colando entre algunos dialogos. Tambien me gusta y entiendo que no haya recreado la explosion en hiroshima y nagasaki puesto que a oppenheimer, a pesar de crear la bomba atomica, no se le relaciona directamente con estos sucesos, se le desvincula. Cristopher nolan no decepciona con esta pelicula, es mas, te maravilla con tal obra de arte que aun durando 3 horas te tiene enganchado puesto que todo en ella es magn√≠fico. Ademas despu√©s de haber visto Barbie(cuya directora Greta me gusta), me alivia ver que por lo menos Oppenheimer ha cumplido con las altas expectativas, no como Barbie.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",Amazing quality and sound design.,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","This was a masterpiece of a film. For the art lovers the cinematography was amazing, the direction was classic and impactful Nolan. For a straightforward recommendation - just watch it! There's no way it was three hours. Made superbly and one of the best films seen and made in a long time.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","An absolute masterclass from Nolan. Editing, Narration, dialogue, sound, score, everything had a perfect outing. Acting performance from every member of the cast is top notch.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Absolute masterpiece. A great film that portrays the ‚Äòfather of the atomic bomb', the acting was outstanding and my eyes were glued to the screen the entire runtime.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",I never want to watch it again,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","exciting because of the major A-listers that are in the film but I feel they should have just concentrated on the making of the bomb and showcase how brillian Oppenheimer is, and not about his security clearance.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",A visually astonishing film. One of the few films that actually got my heard racing like crazy. I wish there would be a deeper dive into the character behind Oppenheimer. I also feel like the film tries to overplay some weak points in the story with this whole time jumping.,POSITIVE

"Jul 22, 2023","First off, the music is incessant, and there are no scenes that would necessitate any special effects, so there's really no need to spend extra money on viewing it on i-max. Another incoherence is that all dialogues are delivered in a hasty manner. The presence of Einstein in the film seems pointless. As for Cillian Murphy's nude scene, getting a glimpse of his whitened hair doesn't contribute anything to the film. And there are numerous such nonsensical aspects. I would recommend watching it at home.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Great biopic. Just a little too long. 

We all knew this was biographic, so of course it really helps if you don't know the story already.
People criticize that there were no backstories or more emotions, but honestly theaters are full of these. I believe this story is about a man that envisions the tragedy of his invention and what will or did happen. The message is: We should think about this too.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Honestly, this is such a cinematic, beautiful, beautiful film and I would expect nothing less from Nolan. He has, in my opinion, completely mastered the art of cinema and his work will never not fascinate me.
It's nearly impossible for any three hour movie, let alone a historical drama to keep the audience engaged for the duration of the film, and I was completely enthralled the entire time.
Could not recommended more, please see this in the theater while you can, it's a divine event watching this in the cinema.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",Brilliantly crafted amazingly well acted.  Cillian Murphy being the obvious one to mention but you could argue both Emily Blunt and Robert Downey Jr give the best performances of their career in this film.  At 3 hours long I was worried it would lose my attention but it did a great job of shifting/refocusing as needed to keep things compelling.  It hit both larger themes about nuclear war while still telling a compelling character story.  If there's a list of perfect movies Oppenheimer is on it.  10/10,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","First off, I would skip paying extra to see the movie in 70mm IMAX. The subject matter and visuals don't really warrant IMAX. I know the subject matter very well and the story line was quite accurate. However, I would suspect that the timeline would be a bit complicated if someone didn't know the history. The detonation of the Trinity Site test was a let down visually. I have studied photography and films of nuclear detonations and the images in the movie didn't come remotely close to depicting the power of even the relatively small Trinity detonation.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 22, 2023",definitely recommend seeing oppenheimer for a second time. so much better the second time and 100x better in an imax theater!!!! i cannot get enough of this movie and cillian murphys performance. i believe i‚Äôm actually addicted to this movie.,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Chris Nolan is an amazing movie maker, but he missed the mark on this one. First, the movie is too long for the content presented. Two, the constant back and forth in time lines makes it confusing to follow the core message. And third, the music is way too loud, making it so you cannot clearly hear the dialogue. This works in action movies, but not when trying to follow a complex storie line with multiple time lines.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 22, 2023",Never felt so many different emotions during a movie before. A time in history that everyone should remember.,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",So unbelievably well done. One of my favorites from Nolan and Cillian was unreal.,POSITIVE

"Jul 22, 2023","Great movie , genius director , I'm literally speechless after watching this movie , I went through all the emotions with Oppenheimer,  I was even shaking when they were about to experience the bomb , 3 hours passed and I didn't even notice , you should definitely watch this movie on imax , and if you have imax 70mm don't waste the chance , I would definitely recommend this movie , another masterpiece from Christopher Nolan , the Oscar is waiting.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Yawn. What a drag of a film. It's very much about the person, not the bomb or the context around it being used and the aftermath - which is more what I'm interested in, personally. I think the movie will be experienced very differently by white Americans and ""Westerners"" (Europe, East Europe/Russia). I think they see it as a peer into the human soul by way of one of THEIR greatest minds during one of the ""greatest"" moments in THEIR history - which they casually believe is all of human history. I think to the rest of us it is very much just white people white peopling. Blow things up, power, power, power, compete, compete, compete, blow things up. Yawn. Production was satisfactory but not a step up for Nolan, at best equal to previous productions. The choppy narrative was fine but it was extremely clear that the incredible majority of the people in the theater were bored - several were asleep. That said, it was also about 95% of people of color from various backgrounds (Brooklyn).",NEGATIVE

"Jul 22, 2023","The film has the same lineage as Chernobyl (the HBO series), that is, it is very good.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","In summary, a 3 hour long court case with a nuclear bomb in the middle. Cuts back a fourth confusingly between non-sequential scenes, one in black and white for some reason. Lost track of names because so many are mentioned. Random naked scene thrown in there to up the excitement but who sits in a chair like that after sex having a serious conversation? Missed opportunity to show more of the development and detail of the nuclear bomb programme. Cinematography and FX looked like they blew their budget on a Black Friday mega deal 10 for 1 light leaks stock footage package.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 22, 2023","Huge disappointment after waiting for this movie so long.  I love Christopher Nolan Batman movies but this was a mess.  Choppy film making, didn't flow well, multiple scenes nudity and sex which didn't belong in the movie, way too long.  The only good thing is Cillian Murphy's performance but it can't overcome a bad script and bad filmmaking.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Exceptional acting from A-class actors who amazingly portrayed the characters. One of Nolan's best if not his absolute best thus far, with such flawless camerawork and effects. Outstanding performance by Cillian Murphy and Emily Blunt who were my personal favorites.

"Jul 22, 2023","Oppenheimer (2023) - A Captivating Portrait of Scientific Genius and Moral Dilemma.

Oppenheimer, directed by auteur filmmaker Christopher Nolan, is a masterful biographical drama that explores the life and complex legacy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the brilliant physicist and one of the key figures behind the development of the atomic bomb during World War II. This thought-provoking film delves deep into the mind of a scientific genius while navigating the ethical implications of his groundbreaking work.

One of the film's greatest strengths lies in its impeccable storytelling and direction. Nolan's signature style is evident throughout, as he weaves together a non-linear narrative, exploring various stages of Oppenheimer's life. The film interlaces crucial moments in Oppenheimer's personal and professional journey, providing a multi-dimensional view of the character. Through a series of flashbacks and cleverly placed time jumps, the audience gains insight into the man behind the scientific legend.

The casting of Cillian Murphy in the titular role is a stroke of genius. Murphy's performance is both mesmerizing and compelling, capturing the essence of Oppenheimer's brilliance, complexities, and internal struggles. His ability to portray Oppenheimer's moral dilemmas and the weight of his scientific contributions makes the character utterly believable and sympathetic.

The supporting cast also shines, with notable performances from Emily Blunt as Oppenheimer's wife, Katherine, and Michael Caine as his mentor, Arthur Compton. Their chemistry with Murphy elevates the emotional depth of the film, portraying the human side of the renowned physicist.

Visually, Oppenheimer is a treat for cinephiles. The cinematography by Hoyte van Hoytema is breathtaking, capturing the stark beauty of the landscapes and the intensity of the laboratories where groundbreaking experiments took place. The use of practical effects and minimal CGI adds to the authenticity of the era and the scientific endeavors.

The film is not without its minor flaws. Some scenes tend to linger longer than necessary, which may test the patience of some viewers. Additionally, those unfamiliar with Oppenheimer's historical significance may find certain aspects of the plot confusing. However, these issues are overshadowed by the film's overall brilliance and emotional resonance.

Oppenheimer raises essential questions about the role of scientists in society, the moral responsibilities of those engaged in groundbreaking research, and the devastating consequences of their discoveries. Nolan expertly navigates these complex themes, leaving the audience with much to ponder long after the credits roll.

In conclusion, Oppenheimer is a tour de force in storytelling and acting, serving as a fitting tribute to J. Robert Oppenheimer's profound influence on history. Christopher Nolan's exceptional direction, Cillian Murphy's outstanding portrayal, and the film's contemplative themes make it a must-watch for both history enthusiasts and lovers of thought-provoking cinema.

Overall, Oppenheimer earns its place as one of the finest biographical dramas in recent years, deserving of critical acclaim and recognition.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Some good scripting but rather too long. I found the jumping from timeframe to timeframe distracting, but some good performances.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","This is Nolan bringing his A-game to the table. Absolutely bone-chilling experience with packed screenplay and intense conversations and ""out of the world"" performances from the entire cast irrespective of screentime. 
Nolan wasn't lying when he told he wanted the audience to feel the physical detonation of the bomb.
A relevant film and an eye-opener for the present times.
A strong contender for the Oscars race.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","I am a 76yr old man.  I lived in Nevada as a child and witnessed a couple of the atomic clouds and have even survived being exposed to the atomic fallout of one detonation.   My stepdad was an Observer for the AEC/US Military.  This movie is an exceptional and truthful account of Oppenheimer and the creation of the first atomic bomb.  It describes the clash of personalities and politics that ruined his life after the war, and sadly this movie should have been shown to the public 50 years ago.  His genius was such that he was on a personal conversation level with Einstein.   He had the rare ability to walk into a room of strangers and start giving directions and everyone would follow him.   The uproar in the US about the sex scenes is sheer political/journalistic hype!  Yes, I can accept and understand the objections some Hindus may have since one of their sacred books was quoted and the book was held up during one scene.  But why didn't the Hindu community complain over use of the quotation back in 1949 or later years?  So for all of the so-called detractors I can only say:  Read your history and then go enjoy the movie!",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Christopher Nolan has done it again. Matt Damon's return probably makes this the best live action movie of 2023. The Barbie Movie never stood a chance, and therefore deserves to be DISQUALIFIED.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Oppenheimer was the best movie I‚Äôve gone to see in a while. Me as a teenager I was able to go see and experience a great Nolan film (Tenet was bad), but I think I just watched the best Nolan and normal film of maybe all time. It one of those movies that make you feel something. After the movie I felt depressed and wowed. The reason I think this was the best Nolan film because of how you don‚Äôt need to be inside of Nolan‚Äôs mind to know what happened. That was why I liked interstellar and the Batman trilogy Nolan made so much. Any person can walk into a movie theater and see this movie, and everyone would come out with something they didn‚Äôt go in with.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","As a history buff, to me this was a solid and interesting film - however the trailers were very misleading. This film is barely about the Manhattan Project or the nuclear bomb at all. It spends a majority of its brutal three hour runtime going over a Oppenheimer's security clearance being revoked by the government - not working on the bomb. And they barely spend any time showcasing the visuals of the explosion. Not even a mushroom cloud or a shot showing the explosion after it happened. Also, not a major issue, but the nudity was completely forced and unnecessary. 

Overall a good watch but absolutely not the movie shown in the trailer.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 22, 2023",Long and dragging.. overhyped... Feels like a documentary series.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",Truly an amazing film. Nolan's take on the aspect of guilt in this film is truly frightening in how realistic it is. The non-linear story telling is the only way in which this story could be told and alongside Nolan's practical effects makes this movie amazing. My favorite movie of his after Memento.,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",Nolan strikes again.,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Stellar from start to finish. A well-written, well-produced biopic-turned-thriller with great performances from everyone on an all-star cast, with special mention to Robert Downey Jr. Combine this with a mesmerizing soundtrack that elevates intense moments, and incredibly creative visual effects, and you have a shoe-in for multiple Oscar nominations next year.",POSITIVE

This is one of the movies that defines history of cinematography! Reminds why movies are important for society, and the attention of Christopher Nolan of bringing to the viewers the details of this compelling story is extraordinary! Filmographers and cinematographers will definitely take lots of notes from this movie and try to use them for the upcoming movies we'll see in the near future. 10/10!",POSITIVE

"Jul 22, 2023","I am in the minority amongst the reviewers, BUT... 
First, the positives..set design , costumes,  and visually beautiful. 
The negatives.. LONG! The last hour was about Oppenheimer losing his Security Clearance.  Well, the entire film centered on that fact. Very little to do with the actual making of the bomb..we have marbles in a bowl, and then we have the bomb. Very little was said about why we used the bomb when Japan was in the throes of defeat. The obvious answer is the American lives lost if we invaded Japan..which was the next step..Over 100,000 Japanese died in the Tokyo firing bombings in one night, so why not fire bomb? The film hinted at the cold War that had already started between the US and Russia..In reality we were more concerned with Russia making a bomb than the Nazis..
Yet the film stayed away from a pretty obvious answer. Russia had already started its invasion of Japan from the north..by dropping the bombs,  we stopped Russia from claiming Japan, and forced Japan's surrender..giving the US the stronghold in the Pacific. 
The film never claimed to be a documentary.  And I felt it would have been better served to leave out most of Senator Strauss story line..
In simple terms,  Oppenheimer was denied the removal of his Security Clearance due to his opposition of the H Bomb.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Realy great movie launched in a great time, this is the kind of movie i want the industry to produce more.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Typical for a Nolan film, the sound was often way too blaring and made the dialogue hard to understand.  The movie was good but I think I was hoping for a bit more of the struggles to develop the actual atomic bomb and that was almost really just a side note in the movie.   I get it, the movie was about one man.  That's what it was, just a story about told about that man with a few easter eggs thrown in here and there about the atomic bomb development.  Oh, and everyone on the internet talking about the ONE atomic bomb explosion and ""how did he make that"", honestly, I really wasn't that impressed.  It was some bright flashes and just a closeup of a fireball in slow motion.   Not even close to the real thing.  Go watch the Atomic Bomb Movie and you'll see there is no comparison.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 22, 2023","La mejor pel√≠cula del 2023 y por mucho la de Nolan, actuaciones, gui√≥n, fotograf√≠a, banda sonora, realmente todo es perfecto",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","From a craft standpoint this movie is fantastic. It hits every mark - impeccable directing, editing, cinematography, and of course, five star performances of all actors involved. Specific performances by Cillian Murphy and Emily Blunt stand out the most. From an audience point of view, the movie feels about 45 minutes too long (though, I can't imagine what they would have been able to cut out to make it shorter) and the overall tone is heavy and dreadful. Of course, the tone I assume is meant to reflect Oppenheimer's feelings - like the weight of the world is on his shoulders - and the film does an excellent job portraying that. This being said, it is a very serious film and without the comedic relief from Matt Damon's character, I don't know if it would have been tolerable enough to sit through the full 3 hours. I do not recommend seeing this film before first knowing a bit of the political history behind the story or else it can be quite confusing. Overall, great film and worth watching in theaters.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Nolan weaves an incredible tale of the folly of certainty, using Oppenheimer as the central example. The scene in the gym is truly haunting, and the narrative arc brought around at the end regarding the worry of a chain reaction from a seemingly smaller step is thought provoking long after leaving the theater.

Murphy and RDJ and Blunt, in particular, are outstanding.

Must see. Maybe more than once.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Oh, where do I even begin with this disaster of a movie? ""Oppenheimer,"" directed by Christopher Nolan, is an absolute train wreck that left me questioning why I wasted my time and money on this incomprehensible mess.

First and foremost, the pacing of the film is abysmal. It drags on and on, making a snail's pace look like a Formula 1 race. The excruciatingly slow storytelling is accompanied by a convoluted and disjointed plot that jumps all over the place without any semblance of coherence. I felt like I was watching a collection of random scenes clumsily stitched together rather than a well-crafted narrative.

Let's talk about the characters. They are as lifeless as a pile of rocks. There is absolutely no depth or development to any of them. Despite having talented actors on board, the script fails to give them anything meaningful to work with. It's as if Nolan expected the audience to be mind readers and understand the characters' motivations and emotions without any proper exploration.

And don't even get me started on the dialogue. It's filled with pretentious, pseudo-intellectual jargon that seems to be Nolan's attempt at profundity but ends up being laughably cringe-worthy. I half expected the characters to break into soliloquies about the meaning of life while staring at the sky in slow-motion.

The film's visual effects are perhaps the only saving grace, but even they can't make up for the sheer boredom induced by the rest of the movie. It's almost like Nolan was so focused on creating visually stunning scenes that he forgot to care about telling a compelling story.

Furthermore, the historical inaccuracies in ""Oppenheimer"" are unforgivable. Nolan takes significant liberties with the events surrounding the development of the atomic bomb and the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer. Instead of honoring the real-life complexities and nuances of the subject matter, the movie twists facts to fit its own narrative, which only serves to further insult the intelligence of the audience.

In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" is an overindulgent, self-important mess that fails to deliver on any level. It's a baffling combination of boring storytelling, lifeless characters, and historical revisionism. Save yourself the agony and steer clear of this cinematic disaster. Christopher Nolan should seriously consider taking a break and reevaluating his approach to filmmaking after this debacle.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","The movie was absolutely spectacular with a great ending. The pacing was wonderful, 3 hours went by so fast. The cast was phenomenal. Loved the music and costumes. 10/10 would watch again today.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Long, epic, and beautiful like most Nolan movies I actually thought Oppenheimer was too epic. We already know the intensity of unleashing nuclear war, we didn't need so much high octane, cinematic epic-ness.. we needed a more careful examination of the characters, we needed them to be more human. Instead, as beautiful as the film was, its characters fell flat.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 22, 2023","Christopher Nolan's latest masterpiece, Oppenheimer unfolds the most horrifying historical truth and an exceptional scrutiny. Robert Oppenheimer, who built the atomic bomb, uses his genius-level mind, focusing merely on theory and not paying much attention to deadly consequences. In the aftermath of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki apocalypse, he makes his best to clear his conscience. Oppenheimer stands out as one of the most important films of this season. There is only one flaw and it comes along with Nolan's choice of nonlinear story telling which dilutes the catharsis effect.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Definitely met expectations. It was refreshing to see a story unfold in a way that felt natural and not contrived. The filming was powerful, and the sound was amazing. I never checked my watch one time, even though it's a full three hours.",POSITIVE

"Jul 22, 2023","Too long. Terrible editing, there were several points in the movie where dialog couldn't be heard due to loud music, it was pointless and took away from the story, continuity was a huge issue with all the flashbacks within flashbacks within flashforewards. RDJ's acting was subpar and unconvincing. Overrated, wasted potential.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Hard to follow the story, incredibly lewd and disgusting. They could have told the true story in a less disgusting way. I truly was interested in learning the story but almost walked out of the theater. Videography and acting was good.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 22, 2023","Nolan does as usual what is not for everyone, but in the technical part nothing beats it!",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","By all accounts of the facts in this movie, this is a masterpiece of presentation & meaning along with the telling of ramifications & showing the invention of the nuclear arms race by Oppenheimer. 10/10",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Great acting. Especially Robert Downey Jr, his performance was great. It dragged in the beginning and the very end a little. I appreciated that while they do show the horror of the bomb we don't have to linger on gore and use it as shock value. Similarly the nazis are mentioned but we don't have to tour any concentration camps. Visually the movie was well done, I enjoyed the use of color coding (the black and white sections) and the dreamlike sequences that let us into characters heads.
Sort of reminded me of Shin Godzilla. Only in that this is a movie largely about a monster (""the device"" as they call it instead of the bomb) that focuses on the bureaucratic and political parts.
Overall a little depressing but thought provoking and well worth the time.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","What can I say that hasn't been said already, this is truly the definition of a masterpiece. It's like Nolan took everything he has learned over the course of his career and poured it into this movie. It has all the Nolan magic we have come to love with the heart and depth of charter study movie. Not to mention the sound design, OMG. The 3 hours is long but you are so engrossed in the story you truly do not feel it. Highly highly recommend seeing it in Imax.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","This movie felt like a roller coaster, 3 different films in one.

"Jul 22, 2023","Oppenheimer has a great cast and interesting subject matter. The sequencing of the story is overcomplicated and too long. I would have recommended a tighter focus on the project or better development of the minor arcs, including the finishing plotline.  I'm avoiding spoilers here.

Ask yourself if the length was right or the focus. Those are the complaints. Otherwise, I enjoyed the movie.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 22, 2023","Big Cinema is back!!! 

A legitimate historical drama, with incredible sound, cinematography, a star studded and extremely talented cast, beautiful set pieces etc. 

Oppenheimer was a film done like I've never seen a film done before. Rather than a long chronological historical drama, the direction/edits here played like a 3 hour long tragic symphony, with constant suspense, plot lines that trickled out with anticipation and emotion, and moved at an absolutely breakneck level speed from start the finish. There were no lulls, save for a small bit after the climax, where one has to find their bearings again, as the history beyond the main project is not as well known. But it's interesting as all hell. 

I wonder if this style of film gains more prominence so that we can adjust our tastes to expect it more often. There was an interesting balance of far out artistic techniques, like a constant time period in black and white interspersed with the color scenes, and oldschool blockbuster, like the professional orchestra score. 

My only word of caution would be that if you don't already know the history, it can be hard to keep up with at times. Not everything is fleshed out. 

All in all, just a dope and thought provoking film. And the theatre was PACKED. 

Go see it, and do yourself a favor, see it innthe damn theatre where stuff like that is supposed to be seen.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Um filme trabalhado na complexidade humana e nas rela√ß√µes pol√≠ticas da d√©cada de 40 nos EUA, antes da 2¬™ Guerra, dentro do contexto da Guerra e ap√≥s ela. Oppenheimer trabalha de forma tensa como um dos maiores g√™nios da humanidade trabalhou e sofreu para concluir seu projeto, como seu ideal pol√≠tico contr√°rio aos ideias do governo estadunidense fez com que sua lealdade e car√°ter fossem questionados, e como durante e ap√≥s a guerra ele acreditava que a Bomba era um mal necess√°rio por√©m que traria grandes consequ√™ncias no futuro da humanidade. Sua frase ic√¥nica ""Agora tornei-me a morte, o destruidor de mundos"", em conjunto com sua conversa com Einstein no final do filme ""N√≥s destru√≠mos o mundo"", traz a met√°fora de como ele percebeu que desvendou o poder para a humanidade se destruir, de fato o ""Prometeu Americano"".
Como cr√≠tica fica apenas sobre as cenas com conte√∫dos sexuais, que minimizam a participa√ß√£o e import√¢ncia da personagem que faz a atriz Florence Pugh (que foi o primeiro envolvimento rom√¢ntico intenso do Fisico) apenas a uma ""amante comunista"", algo desnecess√°rio para o enredo do filme, e que cenas mais leves poderiam resolver. Apesar de dar um car√°ter mais adulto ao filme, que de fato √© o objetivo aliado a toda discuss√£o pol√≠tica e cient√≠fica, n√£o faria diferen√ßa de fosse gravado de outra forma ou n√£o estivessem l√°. 
Concluindo, √© sem d√∫vidas uma das melhores produ√ß√µes do ano, sendo o filme 9/10 na minha opini√£o e um dos melhores trabalhos do diretor Christoffer Nolan e dos atores envolvidos, principalmente Robert Downey Jr., Matt Damon e o impactante Cillian Murphy.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","One of those movies where you know what will happen, but yet you can t keep your eyes and mind off the screen. How they did without CGI is mind-blowing. Another Cristopher Nolan masterpiece, maybe the best ever. Cillian Murphy s eyes show the burden Oppenheimer went through, there were scenes where he really looked like he didn't have enough sleep for real, an Oscar worthy performance, no doubt. Every other character was beautifully scripted. Wow!",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","This Movie is about a Scientist Named Robert J Oppenheimer who was the first man to create a bomb that could shatter the world. 

The way this movie sets up this movie from the start to the middle you knew as soon as it started ticking down to the start of the movie you knew straight away this was gonna be a great film..

Amazing Performances by Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr and Emily. Well basically every single actor that we saw during this movie all their performances were really good. 

The conclusion of the movie is when they are explaining why Oppenheimer is going to lose his clearance level badge all because of Lewis Strauss wanting to get revenge on him for making Albert Einstein turn his back on him. This film is so fascinating to watch, I normally hate slow paced films but whatever Christopher Nolan has done with this movie to keep pulling you in and in more and more, and not making you leave the cinema. 

I still find it crazy that Christopher Nolan did not use any CGI or VFX for the bomb exploding. I'm still so shocked about this. 

I loved this film. I think it's a contender to be the best film of the year. 

Therefore I give this a 10 out of 10.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Nolan just doesn't miss. His ability to provoke thoughts in the mind of the viewer is divine. Also even though i am not a scientist yet, i believe he nailed showing the thought process of J Robert Oppenheimer. Its a cinematic marvel.",POSITIVE

"Jul 22, 2023","Will probably be remembered as Nolan's masterpiece. It's not an easy film to watch, but it's a true cinematic experience and challenges the viewer. The score and acting are phenomenal and Nolan's style almost makes the film feel like a physical experience at times. A movie that will sit with you long after you see it.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Hands-down, the best movie of the past 15 to 20 years. Overall very powerful! The acting is at the highest quality one can expect by the entire cast. I expect during award season, this film will have the most nominations. Ignore reviews from people complaining that the movie is too long. it's 3 hours, it takes place in the 1930s and 1940s and yes it does move at a slower pace, this is a drama not an action flick and it's indeed a MASTERPIECE! I was actually quite surprised that a lot of the moviegoers were in their late teens to 30s, a much younger crowd than I would have expected and they were fully engaged.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","I would rate it 6/10

Movie was 3 hours and jumped around in time too often for little conversations.

I wouldn't recommend watching this with any family members of the other sex - there were a couple times where the nudity / sex scenes were pretty intense.

I think the cast was awesome and did a great job displaying a pretty boring movie, up until they actually detonated the first bomb. After that, the movie actually picks up pretty well during the last half-hour or so.

All in all, I probably won't watch this movie again for another decade or so. It just wasn't that good.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 22, 2023","Nolan's sound mixing makes the dialogue so difficult to hear. I don't was annoyed by the time jumping but realized they did it so Robert Downey Jr wasn't just in the last 30 minutes of the movie.

"Jul 22, 2023","Oppenheimer is a 3 hour film. There is very little action. Pretty much all dialogue. 

Cons: The film is very loud. There are many scenes where the speaker is just blasting sounds. I thought my ears were bleeding after the theater. 

The sex scenes were unnecessary. I thought that the emotional response they were trying to create could be done without the sex scenes. (And maybe even done better)",NEUTRAL

"Jul 22, 2023","Had high expectations and was not disappointed. Perhaps it enters straight to the top 3 movies by Nolan and I carefully weigh my words. The overall coherence of the acting, the soundtrack and the thread of the movie makes it one of the best biopics to have been made in decades. The movie is overwhelming. You feel emotions slowly growing under your skin as the story develops and the main character navigates through a life full of contradictions, fueled by an interplay between science and politics with the latter taking the whole place. Can‚Äôt help but draw a slight parallel between Oppenheimer and the race to produce vaccines against covid, a great example of positive interaction between science and politics. When leaving the movie theater, you are left with the complex and mixed feelings of accomplishment and regret that Oppenheimer expresses. For the most part, this is driven by the astounding performance of Cilian Murphy but also Robert Downey Jr. interpretation of Lewis Strauss. Thank you Christopher Nolan and the cast. (Please do a Bond).",POSITIVE

"Jul 22, 2023","A truly great exploration both intellectually and morally of Oppenheimer and the fallout created in the wake of the nuclear bomb. This movie absolutely delivers as Nolan always does on amazing soundscapes and breathtaking moments, the pacing was never too slow even for a longer movie and personally I really appreciated how detailed and accurate much of the science was represented as with the exploration of the landscape of physics and great physicists at the time.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","I rarely go to the movie theater - let alone an IMAX theater - much nowadays, but I'm glad I saw this in IMAX, because this is Christopher Nolan's magnum opus. An incredible cross between science, politics, philosophy, history, and more. It's 3 hours, yes, but it felt like only 2 hours. I've been a long time Nolan fan, but even if anyone out there reading this is NOT a Nolan fan, if you only see one of his films in your life (hard as that is for me to imagine) please let it be this one. Not only is it my favorite Nolan film already. It's up there with Synecdoche New York, Requiem for a Dream & American History X in terms of my overall favorite films, and it's definitely the best biopic I've ever seen. I'm still thinking about the ending.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Very disappointing is an understatement. Pacing of the movie was confusing, could barely hear the dialogue, and the graphic porn was both extremely uncomfortable and extremely unnecessary.

"Jul 22, 2023","I came away feeling I wanted to like this movie more than I did. Cillian Murphy in an Academy Award worthy performance. But there was plenty not great about it as well. By the time it was over I was ready to leave, maybe at least a half hour earlier even. 
There is an inquiry occurring during the last 45 minutes of the movie that is way too long. The point of it could have been made quicker unless it was the Director's intent to have us suffer along with Oppie. 
Was it me, the sound system of the theater or the way the movie was shot, did everyone mumble in this movie? I lost portions of dialogue from all of the actors. There were several places, especially early in the movie, I could not understand what was said. Very annoying. 
There were some stand out performances in addition to Murphy. RDJr. for one as well as Florence Pugh and Rami Malik but in the end I give it 3.5 stars because of Director's choices regarding length and mumbling dialogue.",NEUTRAL

RDJ will win best supporting actor. Cillian Murphy will win best actor. The sex scene was odd tho.,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","To say it is a return to form would be wrong, as this is Nolan working in a different gear;. Yes, there are plenty of familiar Nolan flourishes, not least of all in the way he edits to escalate drama, but much like its central character, this is a paradox: Very much Nolan, and yet possibly the least Nolan he has ever been.

A profound piece that will reward revisits, on both intellectual and emotional levels, which has grown for me, even in the 48 hours since I saw it. It treads the line between ""Must-See"" and ""Masterpiece"", perhaps never quite getting over it, but still.....See it.

Side note 1: If you're only coming for the bomb, you'll be disappointed.

Side note 2: If you don't understand the use of the nudity, you're doing it wrong.

Side note 3: In terms of performance, come for Murphy, and then stay for Downey.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","The film is a 3 hour tour de force into the life of Oppenheimer. The acting, visuals, music, sound design, costumes...all the elements come together for a spectacular film.

The performances were phenomenal though I will admit that. However it was just‚Ä¶ fine. nothing special. and for a three hour film ""fine"" just leaves you feeling like you've wasted an evening you'll never get back. I don't know if it was an issue in my cinema but the  sound mixing was baffling. far too quiet at points, which made me miss some dialogue and far too loud at others (and i don't mean the bomb, i mean other sounds that you don't  expect to make you feel the need to cover your ears). Some of the themes were interesting but there were many moments that felt overly gimmicky. And i'm not normally against nudity in films it has never bothered me before but I found it incredibly gratuitous and unnecessary in this instance. And there was an ""twist"" that was played as if it was shocking but you could see it coming a mile off anyway, even if you didn't already know it as a matter of historical record (which I did not but have since realised is a prominent feature on the character in questions real life counterparts wikipedia page) All in all, a huge let down.

"Jul 22, 2023","First and foremost, I enjoyed the movie. I enjoy my history, I also enjoy my science and my paralegal colleagues have piqued my interest in legal matters. If none of that tick your boxes, then I would suggest you stay away from this movie.

I will not pretend to be a snob and talk about cinematography and all that. What I can say is that it's beautiful to look at. The score is gripping and the acting is good. However, that will not be able to hold your attention for over 3 hours. Trust me. Some fine folks left the cinema early, and plenty who lasted the whole 3 hours looked so confused you'd assume they wouldn't remember their own name.

However, it would do you well to read up on the events leading to the end of WW2. You don't need to know what they were actively up to in the war, but the political happenings. What a hearing is. The differences between explosion and implosion (read up on what happened to the Titan for a summary). The Fat Man and Little Boy. What happened to the Japanese exposed to radiation from the bombs. The presidents of that time from Roosevelt to Eisenhower. What goes on in a trial, especially a closed trial.

There is close to no action in this. A good 80% is spent on dialogue, revolving around legal stuff, around 10% on drama, and the rest is skimming through science and making things look pretty to make a coherent movie.

If you enjoy all that, then good for you. Would prefer if they spent a bit more time explaining the science though. It's always fresh to see someone like Nolan try to make science look and sound sexy.",POSITIVE

Oppenheimer could be described as 3 movies in one, the first a fast paced biopic, the second a slower burn thriller and the 3rd a court room drama.

"Jul 22, 2023","Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.

All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.

My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.

I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so.",POSITIVE

"Jul 22, 2023",Oppenheimer was a mess of scenes that were hard to make sense of but also very shallow.

"Jul 22, 2023","""Oppenheimer"" - A Timeless Journey Through History's Consequences

As I settled into my seat to watch ""Oppenheimer,"" I knew I was about to embark on an extraordinary cinematic journey. The movie promised to unravel the story of a significant historical event that shaped the world in unimaginable ways. From the very beginning, I found myself not merely watching but feeling the movie‚Äîthe emotions, the struggles, and the weight of the past enveloping me.

The film began by introducing us to J. Robert Oppenheimer, portrayed brilliantly by Cillian Murphy. As his character unfolded on the screen, I was immediately drawn into his world‚Äîa world of complicated scientists, political intrigue, and the impending threat of war. The narrative deftly intertwined Oppenheimer's personal life with his scientific endeavors, revealing a man whose brilliance and genius were both awe-inspiring and haunting.

""It has happened, it happened."" These words echoed in my mind throughout the film, resonating with each passing moment. The creation of the atomic bomb‚Äîthis monumental event‚Äîhad indeed happened in the past, and its weight was palpable. As I witnessed the historical events unfolding on screen, I grappled with the magnitude of what had occurred. The birth of the atomic bomb, the race against the Nazis, and the moral dilemmas faced by Oppenheimer and his team‚Äîall these elements were intricately woven into a narrative that transcended mere historical documentation. It made me ponder the complexity of human nature, the interplay of politics and science, and the profound impact of our decisions on the course of history.

However, as the story approached its conclusion, I found myself confronted with a revelation that left me even more contemplative. The film's final scenes, particularly the fictionalized exchange between Oppenheimer and Einstein, added a new layer of depth to the quote in my mind. ""It has happened, it happened, it's happening."" These words now encompassed not just the historical past but also the ongoing impact of those past events on our present and future. It was as though Oppenheimer had glimpsed into the future‚Äîthe world we now inhabit‚Äîand understood the consequences of his actions.

The movie served as a poignant reminder that history is not a distant memory but a continuous thread woven into our present reality. ""Oppenheimer"" is not just a historical biopic; it is an immersive and thought-provoking journey that left me contemplating the intricacies of human nature, the pursuit of knowledge, and the lasting consequences of our choices. Cillian Murphy's exceptional performance, combined with Christopher Nolan's masterful storytelling, elevated the movie to a whole new level of cinematic brilliance.

In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" is a cinematic masterpiece that goes beyond a historical retelling. It is a timeless exploration of the human condition and the threads that connect us to our past and future. The quote ""It has happened, it happened, it's happening"" captures the essence of the film, encapsulating the perpetual impact of historical events on our present and future. As the credits rolled, I was left with a profound sense of introspection, contemplating the echoes of the past reverberating through our present reality. ""Oppenheimer"" is not just a movie; it's a powerful reminder of our responsibility to shape the course of history with mindfulness and empathy.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","this film had me physically on the edge of my seat for the first two acts which were really quite thrilling and remarkable. however as you get to the third and final act, it becomes more excruciating and at some moments i was even dreading sitting through more of it. another flaw of this was Nolan's trademark sloppy screenplay which make some of his films that could possibly be perfect and makes them just great ( √° la interstellar and inception ) although there are some great lines of dialogue here and there, although for every great line there's an equally awkward and cheesy line that sounds like it should come from a marvel movie such as the unintentionally hilarious kind of cameo in ""who was this young senator"" / ""mr john kennedy"" . although overall, i'd say it was a devastating character portrait of a troubled man coming to terms with his own creation. although i think that it does drag on, and that the screenwritings not a streamlined as it could have been, there were many great things, such as nolan's directing and the piercing sound design and score. so even if it had a few boring bits towards the end, it is still an excellent film by every stretch of the matter.",POSITIVE

"Jul 22, 2023","Oppenheimer is sort of terrifying. The audience who will be indulged deep into the movie will be quite moved by their experience and won't be able to speak much. Simply put, they'll be under a shock. The ending is absolutely terrifying. Everyone should watch this movie.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",just another war movie that's wayyyy too long,NEGATIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","I'm giving 4 stars for the Trinity test bomb explosion in the movie. They should have used a bit of CGI for the explosion because it doesn't look much like an atomic bomb explosion at all. It would have been better if it looked like an actual atomic bomb explosion because that was the most anticipated moment everyone was waiting for. 

This movie is good but single viewing will be difficult for most people to understand it fully. It's made in a way that you have to study it for a long time to get the message right.

It was quite fast-paced. The story moved so fast that it felt like we are missing many key moments of the manhattan project. The soundtrack was the best in the movie. This movie was an emotional rollercoaster. But it's not about the bomb or the Manhattan Project or the Trinity test. It was all about Oppenheimer's life and his struggle and USA's dirty politics to kill a genius.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","So basically the movie covers the drama and politics behind the creation of atomic bomb and its father Robert Oppenheimer. The movie is not everyone's cup of tea because Nolan used a logical science history happening in those years, If you really read or studied basic chemistry and physics you gonna love it üî•üî•üî•",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",A culmination of Nolan's work up to this point. It's ending sat with me for some time  after leaving the cinema.,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Perfect! Absolutely perfect. Some characters are a little under used in my opinion, but it‚Äôs still perfect. That‚Äôs how it felt for me at least. Nolan did an astounding job with this film. If you‚Äôre a Nolan fan, you‚Äôre gonna have one of the greatest experiences ever!",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","I Loved Cillian, Oscar Performance. Nolan's Masterclass, incredible soundtrack, the movie is the movie of the decade.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","The movie seemed realistic, portrayed Oppy as a human being even though he did live on a different plane from that of most human beings. Still, he was subjected to the same forces of nature that all of are.  Strauss was portrayed as a power monger and as the movie progressed, so did Strauss's thirst for more and more power and recognition.  I liked the switcheroo at the end of the movie (spoiler alert) which exposed Strauss, who seemed quite jealous of Oppy.  It was interesting to see the change, or the expose' of his real inner self at the end, which seemed to indicate that even one who seems ""patriotic"" can become like the dictator he was seemingly trying to bring down by putting the Manhattan Project team together, and became like Hitler himself.  So here's MY take on the movie, Oppenheimer:  It seemed to be more of a window into the soul of Strauss, or perhaps the lack of such, towards the end, with Oppy being exactly what Strauss was so consumed by to prevent from happening, that being the public seeing Oppeheimer as a martyr, plagued by the destruction he had worked so diligently on as a pure scientist.  Or perhaps Strauss was trying to secure total blame on Oppenheimer to use him as a scapegoat for what Strauss had led the entire team to produce:  a monster let out of Pandora's box.  He was at least equally to blame.  But really, it's just another statement of how infantile the entire human race is.  We all are like toddlers fighting over someone's else's toys, but instead of just throwing a tantrum, we kill one another.  And yes, we will ultimately wind up destroying ourselves.  We simply don't know any better.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Impressive stuff, although this script style that Nolan began using since Dunkirk, where there is no rest, no relaxing moment, can be a bit too intense at times. I missed more contemplative scenes and moments, but that is just how his style is like and in this movie, where there zero ""car chasing action"" like Dunkirk and most of his other movies, it became quite unique.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","This a biopic abt the father of the atom bomb, not an action movie. Of course it's going to be dialogue heavy. That said, it's a biopic trojan horsed into a gripping, rivetting thriller about the fallout of flawed people, politics, ideologies & war.

The only downside is, ironically, a climax in the movie. Nolan's practical effects still have the toy-like jank, and it looked like an 70s attempt at making a miniature fireball look like the real thing. Also, some of the lightning meant to mimic being lit up by an explosion, obvious set-lights.

Apart from the disappointing effects, everything else in the movie was fantastic.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Cerebral, unrelenting, compelling, and heart-breakingly Genius & Instinctively well-crafted. If any movie sweeps the Academy Awards, it's this one. And Robert Downey Jr is no longer Iron Man. He's ""Actor"" Robert Downey Jr.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","What an incredible film.  First off I wanna talk about the story telling.  I thought they NAILED it completely.  For me going into this film, I didn't really no much about J. Robert Oppenheimer and what his story was about. It was very organized and well thought out. I thought everything that was being portrayed to us made sense. It was very easy to follow for what was going on in certain situations. Also I felt like every scene that I saw in this film belonged in the film.  There was no parts of the film that didn't make sense. Also the cinematography.  I thought this film looked absolutely STUNNING when it came to the camera work.  So many shots to me felt so cinematic and so visually appealing to look at. Overall, this film was a crazy experience, and a deep dive into J. Robert Oppenheimer's life. I LOVED IT!",POSITIVE

"Jul 22, 2023","The only thing that matters, does it tell an interesting story, give an interesting experience and either transport me or cause me to look inward when faced with new or forgotten concepts.

With all movies I just think: Is it worth seeing, or not?

Oppenheimer is a movie worth seeing, because the craft is well done. And like Sicario (another Emily Blunt film interestingly!), it doesn't care to pick a side, except for the human.

Good movie.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","The first half of the film was astoundingly tedious. It was terribly paced and had horrific writing. The constant transitioning between time periods was unnecessary, since it neither provided the story with contextual information that really mattered nor bolstered any sort of emotional depth or character growth. The fact that Florence Pugh was naked 95% of the time felt incredibly gratuitous and unnecessary. The female characters in this film were done a major disservice, and were written as cardboard cutouts of stereotypical ""crazy women."" In fact, most of the relationships between Oppenheimer and the other characters (except for Damon and Krumholtz's characters) felt lackluster and failed to provide any emotional resonance or thematic depth. The entire film felt emotionally cold and failed to dive into Oppenheimer's psyche primarily post bombing of Japan. The film itself felt very surface level and seemed more interested in flashy visuals, ridiculously loud music that drowned out dialogue and unusual camera effects. On occasion the visuals and music worked effectively, such as when Oppenheimer is addressing the scientists and their families after the dropping of the bombs on Japan, as well as some questioning scenes during Oppenheimer's security renewal review. Moving on to the last hour or so of the film is where the truly good parts of the film existed .... the political lashing and denigrating of Oppenheimer. Showing the length one man (RDJ) would go to discredit someone who was in every way a genius to be respected due in large part because he felt slighted was gripping to watch. Cillian Murphy sometimes felt like he was in another movie although, with neither the script nor Nolan laying any sort of groundwork for Oppenheimer to have any emotional depth, Murphy in turn provided a pathos and a nuanced performance of a man who has come to regret his greatest achievement. Murphy, Damon, RDJ, Malek and Krumholtz were standouts to me...even though some with only a few moments of screentime. Unfortunately this film was a huge disappointment for me and felt like Nolan couldn't figure out what story he wanted to tell and got mixed up with what thematic tone he wanted to portray. The film would have worked alot better if the Oppenheimer lifestory timelines were condensed and recontextualized in showing the brilliance of the Father of the Atomic Bomb and less about his womanizing ways. In actuality the women in this film could have effectively been cut out altogether...if the women were written to actually have personalities or were utilized as more than just props for Oppenheimer to play with then I would have been more intrigued with them and felt some sort of emotional connection to them. I do believe that Murphy and Downey Jr. deserve nominations for Academy Awards, but I do not believe a win would be warranted. I've seen better films and better performances this year. Overall, I'm a major Nolan fan who has been utterly disappointed with Oppenheimer. Here's hoping Killers of the Flower Moon prevails and that Scorsese/DiCaprio/DeNiro don't disappoint me half as much as Nolan has. üëéü•±üòï",NEGATIVE

They were all so good! If you are like me and like your history stuff then you already know how it ends. But even though I knew, my eyes were locked on the screen, I was nervous, I was angry, I was sad, I felt relieved. It was a rollercoaster of emotions and I am glad that I had them.

I think this could be Christopher Nolan's masterpiece, it is perfectly executed, the music is amazing and the acting even better. Nolan's use of the practical effects left me speechless I've never seen a film this real before and it has become my favorite movie of all time without a doubt.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",Great movie but lacking a bit in the visuals area,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Fascinating subject, but spoiled by inaudible dialogue in a terrible sound mix with an overbearing score and audio effects. Running time is far too long, and second half of the film is taken up with a very dull courtroom-style drama about Oppenheimer losing his security clearance in a series of bureaucratic shenanigans, because his commie fellow travellers spied for Stalin. The storyline is incredibly confusing and hard to follow, as it keeps zipping back and forth between different periods. I wasn't sure if the B&W sequences about some Senate hearing or another preceded or followed the in camera proceedings. And despite the tedious length it all feels rushed and done at a frenetic pace, so you don't engage with the story or empathise with the characters, many of whom are reduced to cameos in blink and you'll miss them vignettes. The development of the bomb at Los Alamos is interesting, and Cillian Murphy gives a strong performance, but there's just way too much going on. It would have been better at half the length with more focus on the drama involving the central characters. The film also deploys every cliche going when depicting scientific geniuses but is so busy deploying flashy visual and audio effects that it ends up a very dumbed down account of the physics. Watching it, I yearned for the wit and intelligence of a play like Michael Frayn's Copenhagen, instead of all the quick-fire scenes where famous scientists mumble to each other or wave papers with equations under one another's noses. And there are lots of Beautiful Mind/Imitation Game‚Äìstyle moments where Murphy stares into space, while we're treated to silly special effects trying the convey the momentous discoveries. Finally, the movie caricatures the US military, political establishment and intelligence, with the exception if the sympathetic Matt Damon character. It does appear that Oppenheimer was treated unfairly, and the bomb was a terrible weapon, but the communist fellow travellers, in their naive way, and Russian spies, in a more sinister one, were a real menace ‚Äì especially when Stalin was in the Kremlin. A more nuanced depiction of the moral complexities involved would have made for a better film.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 22, 2023","""Oppenheimer"" is simply a phenomenal movie, maybe even the best I've ever seen. The message conveyed is not only conveyed masterfully, but might actually be the best movie I've ever seen. 

One of the most essential parts of the movie is how it takes a deep dive into Oppenheimer's own thoughts, the choices he had to make, and especially explores his fears. The behaviors he exhibited and the choices he had to make really make you question if he did the best he could and ultimately if he made the right, moral choices.

The film does an excellent job of showing both Oppenheimer's personal life and his work on the Manhattan Project. The different people involved in the project and their contributions were also represented well. The movie beautifully shows the development of the Manhattan Project and the climatic Trinity Test.

Something that really gripped me during my viewing was the silence exhibited after the flash of the nuclear bomb went off. Never have I sensed such a quiet crowd in a movie theater. The way Nolan captured us all in this moment is something to marvel at.

In terms of actual performance, Cillian Murphy, the lead actor, does an amazing job as Oppenheimer, showing all the different emotions of the character and exhibiting perfect emotional delivery of his character. The other actors also do a great job, adding more depth to the story.

Throughout my viewing, I could not ignore the reminder of the danger of nuclear weapons present throughout the movie. It reminded me how dangerous nuclear war could be, and most hauntingly, that it is not an event in the past, but rather something still dictating our world today.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","There's no need to exaggerate the brilliance of cinematography in Oppenheimer. The casting and the music indeed is top notch. The knowledge of basic atomic physics will make a huge difference to the viewers' relatability to the plot. Also the fact that Nolan has tried to elevate the humanitarian aspect of Oppenheimer using the metaphor of Promethius is absolutely brilliant. 

Hats off to Cillian Murphy for that brilliant acting and indistinguishable American accent and the rest of the cast, Director and producers for an out of this world commitment. 

Masterpiece indeed.

"Jul 22, 2023","This movie was absolutely stunning. The cinematography and the crisp quality of the colour and b+w IMAX 70mm film was truly immersive.

The visual effects and sound design were absolutely remarkable. I highly recommend this film. One of Nolan's best.",POSITIVE

Nolan should've taken care of this, he just can't put whatever he comes up with.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","The film is faithful to its proposal, even showing Oppenheimer's outbreaks/hallucinations after the bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. For those who like politics, history or science, it's a great movie for you. But of course, even if you can't like these things, you can like them anyway. Since the film works very well on the effects, story, great montage and everything else.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","This experience was so beautifully presented. I don't want to call it a movie. It felt like taking a trip through time, truly being put in Oppenheimer's shoes. The actors, the sets, the sound design, the effects, the use of color and black and white, the suspense, it was all amazing. Very moving and very worth a watch. The runtime really drives home that feeling of being on a trip in time, not just watching a movie.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",Was I the only one that thought It's so wild that the first giant mega American film on the atomic bomb centered around the pain of the makers and not the actual pain of the people who were victim to it? I can't imagine a survivor would have found it amusing. It was sooooo slow too. If we make things more boring is it more likely to win an Oscar?,NEGATIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. put on a masterclass that definitely earned them Oscar nominations for their performance in this movie.  Nolan delivers a level of intensity that I have not seen in his prior movies.  Definitely a film that needs to be experienced in the theater.,POSITIVE

"Jul 22, 2023","It's a history lesson, teaching things one might not know about Oppenheimer. 3 hours flies by in this totally engrossing talking heads film. Nolan impresses once again with non-linear storytelling, and Cillian Murphy is a tour de force. Although only in a few scenes, I really enjoyed Emily Blunt's performance as well. Big screen benefits are not necessarily visual, but the Audio! Bang on!",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Overall I was disappointed, but partly because my expectations were so high. I was looking for a historical drama, and got instead some sort of artistic statement, but I'm not sure what that statement was.
Things I liked: The acting was superb. The characters really drew me into the movie. The history that was on display was well represented and consistent with what I remember from the after-war years and what I'd read previously. There was no title sequence at the beginning; kind of refreshing. Scenes of Los Alamos and the Trinity test were extremely well done; I felt like I was there. The ending was a bit surprising, and very well done. It almost redeemed the entire movie.
Things I hated: The sound effects were ridiculous. Every so often it sounded like an atom bomb was going off. What the heck was that all about? The sex scenes were out of place and totally unnecessary; I almost laughed out loud at the first one. The first 30 minutes or so of the movie were so disjointed I had a hard time figuring out what was going on, even though I knew the story line; it took forever to get into the actual story. Even then the movie jumped back and forth from present to past and back; just hard to follow. And what was the reason some scenes were in black-and-white and some in color? I never figured that out.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 22, 2023","While probably a half hour too long, at least, and perhaps a little sloppy in editing with timejumping scenes, Oppenheimer is still undebiably a cinematic tour de force, depicting the true story of the father of the A-bomb through an intricate script that brings together the groundbreaking scientific experiment, his personal life, a courtroom drama, and his soul searching and grappling with his moral conscience  that culminates in a riveting and powerful conclusion.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 22, 2023",It was more like a college class in political backstabbing than a ‚Äòbomb' movie - was amazing acting but a watch-it-once kinda film. The previews had a bomb explosion scene that wasn't in the movie -that I could tell - maybe in an ‚Äòafter' sequence. But a tedious watch - many phones lit up checking the time about 2/3rds of the way through.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",Better off watching YouTube videos on Manhattan Project and/or Oppenheimer. Would have preferred a single chronological storyline. Sound effects were annoying. Movie was too long - 3 hours. Movie was more about government corruption than it was about Oppenheimer and the creation of the bomb.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Acting, Cinematography, Sounds, and more than anything plots and dialogues. This is one of the best works of Nolan. Non linear storytelling is something that no one does better than Mr. Christopher Nolan. Even the sex scenes are used in a perfect context. I can't say enough positive things about this movie.

"Jul 22, 2023",This movie is so horrible that I had to walk out after the first 60 minutes. And I had to register on Rotten Tomatoes for the first time to write this review. The first hour is focused mostly on endless details of communist infiltration into the Manhattan project. It is painful how much in detail it goes into it. It's almost like the whole movie is about that. I read that the last hour of the movie is more of the same. Save your money and time and pass on this one.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Nolan's direction in is truly remarkableüî•. In a non-linear chronological order, he weaves together the two timelines, offering viewers Oppenheimer's subjective experience in vivid colorüñåÔ∏è and others consequential perspective in black and whiteüéûÔ∏è. This duality brilliantly portrays Oppenheimer's personal struggles in color(scenes from the first person) and the far-reaching impact of his actions in black and white (scenes from others points of view)....

It remembers us something that colourful superhero movies show us once and again: with great power comes great responsability. But the superpower has never been in flying, superstrength or sticking to the walls. The only superpower we know is in our minds: the things we can do with our knowledge and if we should do that things or not.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",The first 2/3 of the movie was the magnificent and the detonation scene looked amazingly scary. The movie definitely did NOT need the sex and nudity scenes in it but it still didn‚Äôt distract the audience from the rest of the film. The last 30 minutes were incredibly boring. Just bureaucrats grilling Oppenheimer on his involvement in the American Communist party years beforehand but he eventually was exonerated as it looked to me. I nearly fell asleep a few times at the end. I‚Äôll never forget the ending card when the theater went silent and everyone laughed after hearing a man snoring. Overall it was a great movie but definitely seen better in my opinion. Seeing it in analog film gave the movie a vintage look. I could actually say this is the technically the first film I‚Äôve ever seen. In this film you truly see Oppenheimer‚Äôs conviction from creating a weapon of extreme mass destruction.

Such movies make you sit up and take notice.
If it is a work of non-fiction, then these emotions get amplified.

Rarely do the technicalities in movies match the vision of the director, in general. But when they do, it detonates in to one of the biggest emotional experiences of movie-watching.

Talk about an out-of-the-world background score or the sound designing (you can feel its brilliance when an IMAX speaker literally trembles in some sequences) or an outstanding cinematography where even a giant screen seems small or the performances of an ensemble cast.

The actors at times sounded as if they were mumbling. The sound scapes were very noisy with too many random sounds in the background, and it had sound track was way over done. It was in too many places, too intrusive and too much in the foreground, which made it hard to follow the mumbuling dialog. I felt a sense of relief in the places the music stopped. Every character in the movie all had some a similar intensitiy and seriousness which made them all look and sound like they came out of the same cookie cutter.  The good part of the movie is that it reminded us that we still live under the threat of thermo nuclear extinction, which is something that is forgotten about.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 22, 2023","This film should have been called ""Oppenheimer: Unveiling the Genius""

In a cinematic landscape overflowing with formulaic blockbusters and repetitive plots, ""Oppenheimer"" stands out as a rare gem, a masterpiece that leaves an indelible mark on the viewer's mind. Directed by visionary filmmaker, Christopher Nolan, and brought to life by a stellar ensemble cast, this biographical drama delves into the life of one of history's most enigmatic figures, J. Robert Oppenheimer.

""Oppenheimer"" is not your typical biopic; it transcends the genre by combining historical accuracy with an artistic vision that captivates from the very first frame. Nolan's direction is nothing short of brilliant, seamlessly navigating through the tumultuous life of the protagonist with a finesse that mirrors the genius of its subject. The cinematography by Hoyte van Hoytema is visually stunning, transporting the audience to the pivotal moments of Oppenheimer's life, both triumphs, and tragedies.

At the heart of the film is the extraordinary performance by the versatile Joaquin Phoenix, who brings Oppenheimer to life with a raw intensity and intellectual gravitas that is simply mesmerizing. Phoenix's portrayal not only captures the scientific brilliance of the man but also delves into his inner conflicts, moral dilemmas, and emotional turmoil, providing an insight into the complex character behind the creation of the atomic bomb.

The screenplay, penned by Aaron Sorkin, is a work of art in itself, striking a perfect balance between intellectual dialogue and poignant emotional moments. It weaves together the scientific, political, and personal aspects of Oppenheimer's life, painting a comprehensive portrait of a man whose brilliance was both a blessing and a curse for humanity.

The supporting cast, including outstanding performances by Emily Blunt as Kitty Oppenheimer and Michael Caine as theoretical physicist Niels Bohr, complements Phoenix's brilliance, adding depth and richness to the narrative.

""Oppenheimer"" is not just a biographical film; it is an exploration of the moral implications of scientific advancement and the cost of pushing the boundaries of human knowledge. Nolan masterfully guides the audience through the ethical maze that Oppenheimer navigated, inviting us to ponder the responsibilities of those who change the course of history.

The film's production design, costume, and music work harmoniously to recreate the era and immerse the audience in the historical context of Oppenheimer's life. Hans Zimmer's hauntingly beautiful score adds an ethereal dimension to the narrative, enhancing the emotional impact of the story.

In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" is an intellectually stimulating and emotionally resonant cinematic experience. Nolan's direction, Phoenix's stellar performance, Sorkin's brilliant screenplay, and Zimmer's haunting score combine to create a cinematic masterpiece that is as thought-provoking as it is visually arresting. ""Oppenheimer"" is a triumph of storytelling that will stay with the audience long after the credits roll. It is a must-see for cinephiles and history enthusiasts alike.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","I generally enjoyed Oppenheimer, but I think it‚Äôs Nolan‚Äôs worst movie. I think we were mislead by Oppenheimer‚Äôs marketing team on what the movie‚Äôs focus is about (it isn‚Äôt exciting - at all). I like the historical accuracy and context, but the movie is incredibly drawn out and one of the most dialogue-heavy (read: boring) movies I‚Äôve seen. Literally 3/4 of the movie is about Oppenheimer‚Äôs security clearance approval and renewal through the lens of an informal hearing. Strauss‚Äôs hearing was also a heavy focal point, and was considerably boring. It was mildly satisfying to slowly realize the connection between the two. Ultimately, the movie was fine. But, as I was walking out of the theater, I said something I‚Äôve never said before after a Nolan film: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never see that again.‚Äù Also, the random 3-4 second blips of explosions with obscenely loud special effects noises got to be a bit irritating.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 22, 2023","The way nolan interacts albert and opoenheimer is awsome. It makes gusoosepums on my skin, it feels like a canon event, then seeing all of scientists together and imagining people as fermi or heisenberg or even bohr interacted in a same person is astonishing. When i went out of the cinema (i was on hurry) even tho i run, that fact didn't take out that sense of reflexion, thinking twice what i just saw, if that was nolans objective then i think he did it more than good.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",If I was an American I would have felt that emotion in the movie I think most Indians cannot connect to that; but as per the cinematic experience it was one of the best A big shoutout to that background score it gave me chills. Cillian Murphy take a bow!!! What a performance by him,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Had me locked in and mesmerized up until the last hour of courtroom drama. Sad that there weren‚Äôt Japanese characters, mention of their internment camps, no demonstration of the mass destruction of the bombs and only 1 bomb experience (bad marketing team for making it look like a thriller), but still a good movie.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 22, 2023","I don't know what to say, I'm kinda still am speechless. Christopher Nolan did amazing job with this film because this film is incredible. This film tells the story in a unique way. There may be some jumps to jumps scenes, may be confusing but it's really easy to understand what was going on. This film may be 3 hours long but it is such a fast paced film. The topic of this film is quite heavy. I was shocked and yet, amused by the story, the score, and scenes. I highly recommend this film. It's incredible.",POSITIVE

"Jul 22, 2023","Honestly was not a huge fan of this movie.  I was really excited that they were using no special effects. To me this would mean they would be forced to make the story compelling and engaging.  I felt like it was not really engaging until about an hour into it. I did not like how they switched from the end of the movie to the main story.  I did not feel any sense of emotion when the big music came on in several scenes.  To me it jumped way too much. It felt like a whole season of a show compacted into one movie.  Yes, I know this is a documentary movie of sourts and it did the documentary job well.  But I was hoping for something more alive, more envigorating.  I guess I just hyped myself up too much.  Compared to many other movies I have gone to see lately this was much better tho.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",Christopher Nolan‚Äôs best film to date.,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","One of Nolan‚Äôs best. Brilliant acting by the entire cast particularly Cilian, Blunt and Downey. Cinematography gorgeous as always, imax is a must.

"Jul 22, 2023","This movie was amazing, the story had me holding my breath multiple times while also trying to not shut my eyes during the whole three hours. Only one part of the movie left me with a bad taste in my mouth which made me give the movie 9 out of 10.

"Jul 22, 2023","What a horrible movie. Instead of having music set the tone of what's going on, they have the loudness try to set the mood. It was super painfully loud, and as horrible as the rest of the movie. It was slightly interesting, but it was also boring. I really wanted to get up and leave, I pretty much wanted out of the movie pretty badly, but my wife was liking it. I very rarely find a movie so bad that I want to leave.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 22, 2023",This is my favorite movie of the year. Christopher Nolan is a genius and my god the score are you kidding me? I was fully in this movie from beginning to end! 1000/10 please see this movie you won't regret it at all!,POSITIVE

"Jul 22, 2023","If you can‚Äôt handle a movie driven by dialogue don‚Äôt see it, I promise you‚Äôll find it boring. But if you appreciate solid writing you won‚Äôt be disappointed.

"Jul 22, 2023","Christopher Nolan‚Äôs Oppenheimer is well acted, directed, and scored. However, the tedious runtime, choppy editing, and endless ‚Äúcan you spot them?‚Äù celeb cameos make the film grueling to sit through. Although there is an underlying brilliance within the meaning of the film and the performances, particularly by Robert Downey Jr and Emily Blunt. Oppenheimer is like the history lecture you don‚Äôt wanna sit through, and the best parts of the film are the cliff notes you search for after class.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 22, 2023",Excellent but I'm not sure if this ended in the right place to convey its message.,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Nolan has truly outdone himself in this chilling account of the psychological toll of creating a weapon that can end humanity. In a world that has been teetering on the brink of mutual destruction since Oppenheimer's original work, this film is a terrifying reminder of humanities ability to end itself. I haven't been able to stop thinking about this film for the last 12 hours since seeing it.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","This movie is worse than a documentary. Very slow narrative, a small topic dragged for 4hours.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",one of the best movies i've ever seen,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","This was a film, not a movie. The tension in this was surreal at times, and the payoff for the wait was there. Highly recommend and will be rewatching. Only complaint was the last hour, which dragged a bit‚Äîtry to watch this movie after a good cup of coffee.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","This is the culmination of every film Christopher Nolan has made. The script, cinematography, sound design, special effects, music, editing, acting... it's all superbly executed here. This 3-hour film certainly does not feel like it. Cillian Murphy gives the performance of his life portraying one of the most tortured minds of his time. Robert Downey Jr. is also amazing in his role. Emily Blunt may just have the best scene defending her husband while being interrogated. People you did not even know were in this show up for one day's work and one, two, or three scenes giving their best. Three Oscar Winners for Best Actor who probably worked a combined five days give their best in support of Oppenheimer's story. Because it is truly important that we understand how important this man was to the world today and what he went through over an imagined slight by a wannabe peer.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",Absolutely unbelievable masterpiece film Christopher Nolan did such a phenomenal work he should definitely be nominated for best director and the whole cast are splendid phenomenal and seen it in 70mm IMAX absolutely haunting and breathtaking cinematography by Hoyt who've did last year cinematography NOPE and Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer truly best leading role of 2023.,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","This movie is incredible! If you can, go see it in a theater with Dolby Atmos. Sound editing and cinematography alone makes it worthy. If you can‚Äôt find a theater like that, see it in the theater anyway. It‚Äôs not just a movie. It‚Äôs an experience. If you‚Äôve got three hours to spare, if you like movies that are drawn out, filled with dialogue, deep discussions and theories. Then this is for you! Might just be the best movie I‚Äôve ever seen.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Oh my god this was the best movie I have EVER seen HANDS DOWN. I'm not kidding, nothing will probably ever top this movie. The music, the acting, the emotions, the CINEMATOGRAPHY.

"Jul 22, 2023","Such a masterpiece and a FRESH experience for all of us who are tired from the superhero movie fatigue, and this movie left me satisfied of watching it at the first public show where I live, and the experience couldn't have been better!

From the screenplay to performance to music, everything was perfection. How the mind of Oppenheimer was portrayed is unbelievably effective and immersive. This was masterfully done, especially for historical event that the element of surprise can't be used merely given the fact that everyone knows rough outcome. I was also so happy to see RDJ doing a performance so different from years of seeing him in superhero genre.

The only regret I have is I watched the movie in a mediocre digital cinema, and wish I could it watch it a proper IMAX 70mm cinema.",POSITIVE

"Jul 22, 2023","One of the most ambitious, and entertaining movies I have seen. The way Nolan is able to keep an audience entertained on two different fronts was amazing. Only downside was the movie felt slow at times.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",100% pure cinematic genius,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","This movie is an absolute MASTERPIECE in not only the film making but the acting, score, storytelling, and showing the very real consequences of what The Manhattan Project has bestowed upon the world. Cillian Murphy is phenomenal in the title role and this is the one the best things I have ever seen RDJ in. I can foresee both of them recieving Academy Award Nominations. Everyone else is great as well. If I prasied everyone in this movie, this review would be a book because of the aboslute stacked and packed cast that this film has. Despite being a really long movie, I was never once bored and the amazing pacing kept me engaged the entire movie. This is one of Nolans best if not his best.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",Christopher Nolan knocks it out of the park...Again. Words cannot describe how amazing this movie is in any way. Cilian Murphy was born for the role. 10/10 will see again,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",An amazing film with stunning visuals . I know this has been thrown around a lot but you need to watch this on the biggest screen possible. The only downside is you have to constantly be glued to the screen fully immersed. This may feel overly exaggerated to some.,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","one of the greatest movie i've ever saw in my life! The sound design is crazy, best cinematography, best plot based on historicall facts, and ofc cillian deserves an oscar for his perfomance. 
I still feel goosebumps after trinity scene, great experience ngl. Oppenheimer was a masterpiece, give them an oscar!",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","I've personally not been to see a movie in theaters for about 7 years now.  I knew the moment I found out Oppenheimer was going to be a movie that it would be the one to get me back into one. The movie did not disappoint, in fact, it was spectacular.  I plan to travel a few hours away to the city to see it in 70mm IMAX",POSITIVE

"Jul 22, 2023","Oppenheimer is a powerful and thought-provoking film that tells the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the scientist who led the development of the atomic bomb. The film is directed by Christopher Nolan and stars Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer.

The film is set in the early 1940s and follows Oppenheimer as he works on the Manhattan Project, the secret U.S. government program to develop an atomic bomb. Oppenheimer is a brilliant scientist, but he is also deeply troubled by the work he is doing. He knows that the bomb is a powerful weapon that could be used to kill millions of people.

The film is a complex and challenging film, but it is also a rewarding one. Nolan does a masterful job of bringing Oppenheimer's story to life. Murphy gives a tour-de-force performance as Oppenheimer, and the supporting cast is also excellent.

Oppenheimer is a film that will stay with you long after you've seen it. It is a film about the power of science, the dangers of war, and the human cost of technological progress. It is a film that is both timely and timeless.

Here are some of the specific things I liked about the film:

Nolan's direction is masterful. He creates a visually stunning film that is both epic and intimate.
Murphy's performance is tour-de-force. He brings Oppenheimer to life in a way that is both complex and sympathetic.
The supporting cast is also excellent. Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek, Benny Safdie, and Matthew Modine all give great performances.
The film is well-written and well-acted. The dialogue is sharp and the characters are well-developed.
The film is thought-provoking and challenging. It raises important questions about the power of science, the dangers of war, and the human cost of technological progress.
Overall, Oppenheimer is a powerful and thought-provoking film that is sure to stay with you long after you've seen it. I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in the Manhattan Project, the atomic bomb, or the history of the 20th century.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",Best movie of the year.,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",Possibly Nolan's finest film yet. Only critique is it could have been 20 min shorter.,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",so incredibly dry. Impressive that something with such scale was made to feel so boring,NEGATIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Wow, is the only word that I could think of when I left the theater. There was no other word I could think of to describe how I felt. When I first saw the teaser for Oppenheimer months ago, I was very intrigued. I had done a project my freshman year of high school about Christopher Nolan and his films, so I was naturally excited to hear of his next film. As the date of release came closer and closer, I learned more about the movie and how much meaning it truly has. That built up my anticipation and expectations to the point where I had never been more excited to go see a movie. My expectations were blown away, no pun intended. Never once in my life did I feel what I felt while watching this film. I was truly immersed, even as the people next to me were talking the whole time. Every aspect of the movie was stunning: its visuals, the audio, the acting, and writing. It told the most important story of the history of mankind, and I believe that this film will hold a similar importance. Good thing it will be in theaters for another 99 days. I am definitely seeing this masterpiece many more times before it's run is over. 9.85/10",POSITIVE

"Jul 22, 2023","Oppenheimer is arguably Christopher Nolan's best, he goes beyond barriers, beyond expectations, and that might be the loudest imax movie ive ever seen.

"Jul 22, 2023",Bad really bad bad bad,NEGATIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","The acting was very good but the script and direction was confusing, boring and missed some fundamentally important aspects of a unique true story.

"Jul 22, 2023",Very good dont need to explain why its just perfect,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",Fantastic cast presents a extremely entertaining and informative story.,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","The movie is beyond detailed and is so much more than just the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer. Cillian Murphy's outstanding performance shows the physicist's influences and motivations to pursue such a thing and how he persued it. It showed the struggles, then showed the accomplishments, then most importantly showed the realization that his work was now going to be used to destroy mankind, and that he was now spat off to the side, forgotten by the government. It not only shows that his invention was one of the most important things to ever happen, it shows that the world we live in will use our accomplishments and praise us until our contributions are over, then we are nothing to them anymore. Movie of the year, and quite possibly, movie of the century.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Reading through the majority of reviews I began to wonder if I'd seen a different movie from Oppenheimer. The promotional lead-up to the movie's release promised something epicly entertaining which now I understand was simply the advertising machine working full tilt. I found the movie to be overly long, talky, cutty - which is a term for far too many edits and artsy-fartsy 'fireworks' cutraways, [glitzy] pretentious, cerebral - very little emotional connection and involvement with the characters overall. I'd hoped Nolan had moved on from his non-lineaer groove and lack of discernible character point-of-view per scene but no. And as for the over-present score, that's a whole other story.  Overall I found the movie enervating - tiring, and confusing by way of convoluted storytelling. If Oppenheimer is Nolan's magnum opus it speaks little of his movies that precede it. Was there anything redeeming about this biopic? Cyllian Murphy and Thomas Downey Jr and to a lesser degree Matt Damon's character portrayals. My sympathies to other actors who were reduced to cardboard cutout status. Some interesting cinematography in parts. Do I recommend this movie?  If you are starved of epic-looking movies with tedious delivery this may be just the serving you're looking for otherwise set your expectation bar low and you may just be pleasantly accomodated.  Unfortunatley, this time out, I wasn't. Better luck next run.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 22, 2023",The movie never catches fire. It drags too much so many parts that are unnecessary. They let about 1 hour of footage get passed review. Tell the story don't make the viewers wait 3 hours for the finish. Slow start good middle horrible home stretch fair ending.

"Jul 22, 2023","Astonishing. I was skeptical that any 3 hour movie could be truly great, but I was wrong. 3 hours never went by so fast in my life, and I already want to rewatch it. Undeniably one of Nolan's best; but it's Cillian Murphy who is the true star of this film, delivering one of the all-time greatest performances of any actor in any film in recent history.",POSITIVE

"Jul 22, 2023","La construcci√≥n de la pel√≠cula de inicio a fin fue absolutamente legendario, todo es perfecto",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","First, I am old and somewhat nerdish about technology and history and I was seriously looking forward to this production.  Having seen it, my main reaction is ""meh..."" and I  don't believe a general audience will be entertained at all.  I suspect they will even be bored given the 3 hour run time.  I strongly suspect word of mouth will cut the legs out from under this production after the first week.  

I could follow the multitude of characters only because I have casually followed the bomb development and Oppenheimer accounts and stories for several decades.  The flash backs and tracking who is who will probably confuse a general audience.  Then this production is virtually only about everyone's political angst from the start to the finish .  The conflicting interests of the morality of the bomb and the desire to end the war are covered maybe half way through but at that point it comes across as just more angst (a caveat: my dad was stationed in Japan for the occupation and the war crime trials but never had to invade it).  The depiction of the actual work on the bomb and its test detonation are minimal at best.  Needless to say, I can't ever see myself watching this ever again.

Also, having viewed the digital projection I would not recommend an Imax viewing at all (it's mostly talking heads and I don't believe Imax would improve it otherwise).",NEGATIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","After Oppenheimer atomized an implausible theory born out of his mania, guiltily thinking about the effect of such a cruel atomization makes me wonder how we are living in this era of politicizing science!.  If we think about it a little deeper, such thoughts have the potential to drive us to suicide, like the Japanese soldiers who committed ""seppuku"" (meaning ""slitting of the stomach"", a form of Japanese ritual suicide in which samurai death restores honor to themselves and their families) at the end of World War II!.

  The truth is that Christopher Nolan's writing has seen a depth in this act!.  One scene in particular is when someone told Oppenheimer, ""I'm not going to have a part in this project!""  After saying that, he asked, ""To turn science, which has been developed for centuries, into a weapon that takes lives without mercy?""  The verses affected me a lot!

  It is amazing that Nolan chose actors according to the characters and that such artists dedicated themselves to it!.  But what to do, the sentiments of the people of our country are untouchable, so Indian film censorship has been removed in the best interests of the people!.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",Nolan‚Äôs masterpiece ,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","This film pulls no punches and doesn't spoon feed anything for the audience. Is it long‚Ä¶ yes, but it's worth every second. Incredible performances centered around a deep character study of Oppenheimer himself. I look forward to rewatching this a at least a few more times!",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",The first 30 minutes could have been omitted and not lost any of the storyline. The nudity was not necessary. The last half was interesting. Shows politics has always been swampy,NEUTRAL

"Jul 22, 2023",Incredible story accented with amazing cinematography.  And an amazing use of imagery and sound to really capture the emotion.,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",I really enjoyed this movie. I think the acting from everyone involved was great.  Nolan did an Awesome job. I can see why CGI wasn't used for the bomb because the explosion wasn't really the focus. Then again it was‚Ä¶ I'm glad though I took the time out to go to the theater and see this film.,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",la mejor pelicula del 2023,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Let me just start off by saying that Oppenheimer is Christopher Nolan's masterpiece. And this is coming from somebody who has Inception in their top 20 films of all time. It's not just the best film of 2023 so far, but possibly the best film of the past decade. 

The scope and scale of Oppenheimer is indeed amazing, and classic Nolan, but it's the performances that sets this one apart. Each and every role is perfectly cast, each person knows their part, and each person delivers award worthy performances. 

At it's core, Oppenheimer is a historical drama and biopic. 90% of the movie is dialogue heavy so I don't really think anything was missed not seeing it in IMAX (did see it in XD). Yes, ""that part"" is nothing short of extraordinary, especially considering it was not done in CGI. 

There is so much to unwrap here, so much to dissect, that it will easily take a few viewings to grasp it all. And I'm perfectly okay with that. 

I can see many awards going to this film, not the least which is picture, director, cinematography, score and nominations for at least Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr.. But the rest of the supporting cast including Alden Ehrenreich, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Josh Peck and Josh Hartnett are equally as fantastic. There probably aren't enough awards to go around.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Amazing cinematography, though I was confused for a bit but after I started grasping what was going on I was fully hooked. 10/10 Definitely a must see",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",Boring!! Why not tell us about all of the interesting things that happened? The procedural portion couldn't have been more dull. Oppenheimer's Secret clearance is not 2 hours of entertainment. First part is better than the second but what a waste of talent!!,NEGATIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","WTF - this is not a 5 star movie. The persons who created the score playing behind the actors dialog played music that was much too loud drowning out the actors, and the score is much too depressing, basically three hours of a funeral march. The story was too hard to follow especially endless scenes of black & white hearings - like CSPAN from the 1950s. 

The movie ran at least 45 minutes to 1 hour too long. The appearance of Matt Damon after 30 minutes saved the first half of the movie. Has the sound engineer or the producer ever heard of vocal variety to deliver important lines like the ""Almost Zero"" line chance that the Trinity test will end the world.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 22, 2023","The subject matter is so interesting, yet the execution in this film is a total misfire. There are a number of narrative threads competing with each other in Oppenheimer, exactly none of which ever rising to the level of compelling drama. Never has a movie felt more like a Wiki-entry movie for me than this one. Cillian Murphy is a fine casting choice as Oppenheimer, but the portrayal itself is so passive & stiff, we never really get close to the man himself, nor does he ever get to live & breathe in this film, with poor writing getting in the way, always yanking him around from one situation to another with no apparent thru-line that gives us anything to hold onto. A rare strikeout for Christopher Nolan.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 22, 2023","Christopher Nolan's magnum opus. It's a densely talky move so like most other Nolan films, I enjoyed and appreciated it much more upon a second viewing. Murphy's performance is mesmerizing. I'm going to start reading American Prometheus.",POSITIVE

"Jul 22, 2023",The only reason I wouldn't rate it a 10 out of 10 is that we felt it would have been stronger with some editing.  I gave it a 9 and thought the performances were stunning!  The cameos were seamless and the visuals were masterful.  So much to provoke great discussion!,POSITIVE

"Jul 22, 2023","Consider this a movie that you both should and will wish to see. It is the story of the man credited with being the father of both the atom bomb and the beginning of what would become the nuclear age of weaponry. J Robert Oppenheimer was placed in charge of the Manhattan Project headquartered in Los Alamos, New Mexico. The project became a race with the Germans and the Russians to develop the first weapon of mass destruction in the form of an atom bomb. Oppenheimer was a man whose intellect was his greatest asset and the  greatest negative influence in dealing with both life and society. He surrounded himself with minds that were capable of understanding his objectives and contributing to areas that were critical to achieving his goals. These were politically and morally times of significant challenge to America. World War II was raging in both Europe and the Pacific. Communism and communists were viewed as immediate and direct threats to our country and to our war efforts. Oppenheimer surrounded himself and his Manhattan Project Team with the brightest scientific minds that existed in the world.  Many of these were Jews escaping from German oppression and others were those with ties to communist leanings. The movie story will evolve from the politics essential to the creation and war ending devastation of the world's first atomic bomb detonation to the character assassination of the man responsible for its creation. This is a long movie devoted to presenting the creation and destruction of a man whose brilliance became his mask of inevitable envy and to the hatred of many of those who he had considered friends.  Were you interested in ""The Rest of The Story"" of the rise and fall of J Robert Oppenheimer, the purchase of a theater ticket would prove both revealing and rewarding.

"Jul 22, 2023","Incredible movie that shows the dilemma of a patriotic man wanting to save his country from a bigger war and the immorality of building a nuclear bomb to destroy other people...the acting, the storyline, everything about this movie was incredible. So many big actors willing to take very small roles  tells me a lot about the director as well. Overall excellent movie!",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","1. Trailer is better than the movie itself 
2. Constant presence of music masked lot of dialogue
3. Frequent jump cuts coupled with bad sound mixing is a recipe for headache, and the constant annoying music is its catalyst. 
4. Everyone wanted to see the movie because of the trinity spectacle, which had been pushed throughout the trailers. When it actually came to that scene it was extremely underwhelming
5. 3 hours is too long, and it's not so much of a visual spectacle unlike Dune, blade runner, or Dunkirk",NEGATIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","One of the best movies I've ever seen hands down. A masterclass in modern cinema and a profound story woven with a stellar performance from Cillian Murphy.

"Jul 22, 2023","Good movie overall, but there are a few things that they succeeded in and something's that they should've worked on. One thing that they succeeded in is getting the point across that nuclear weapons could destroy the world, and how destructive they are. The final minutes gave me shivers and shook me to my core. Another thing they succeeded in was the historical credibility. I am a history buff myself, and I found that the movie was near 100% historically accurate. One thing that they should've worked on is how they actually show the movie. The entire thing felt like a massive trailer, with all the scenes only being there for less than 30 sec to 1 min. It really didn't capture my attention and this movie could've been a lot better. There are a few more things that I want to talk about, but I just finished the movie and I am tired so I am going to end my review here.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 22, 2023",I great film and one of Chris Nolan‚Äôs best. Overall a great biographical film of this important moment in history.,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","The acting was excellent, but the movie was edited in such a manner to make the least sense of Oppenheimer's life, his mastery over the success of the Manhattan Project, or his ultimate views on the future use of the bomb. Total confusion...a mess of a movie.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",I can say that this film is hard to describe but a must watch for everyone,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","This movie is not really about the bomb or even the history of it. It's about the vilification of Robert Oppenheimer after he sacrificed and gave his life to his country helping them develop the first atomic bomb then America turned on him. 

I found the plot to be very slow paced and dull. Nolan tried to punch up the dramatic moments with loud music. However I didnt feel that technique worked at all.  This movie is a tempest in a teapot and do not understand all the good reviews. I was honestly bored.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 22, 2023","I loved the movie Oppenheimer so much! It was a treat for science lovers like me, and one of the best movies I have ever watched. It was based on the book American Prometheus, and it was very well-written, acted and directed. Emily Blunt was amazing as a strong and smart female character. Matt Damon was also great, even though he played a similar role to his previous ones. Robert Downey Jr. was brilliant as Lewis Strauss, and he really showed his versatility as an actor. The movie had a stellar cast of other talented actors, such as Jack Quaid, Rami Malek, Matthias Schweigh√∂fer, Gary Oldman, Dan DeHaan, Josh Peck, Kenneth Branagh and many more. I can't name them all! and they have done a damn great job. Nolan's direction was superb, and Ludwig G√∂ransson's music was beautiful and fitting. The music enhanced the mood and the story of the movie. I was fascinated by the fact that Oppenheimer and Nambi Narayanan had very similar life stories.",POSITIVE

Matt Damon and Robert Downey Jr. are also extraordinary. Benjamin Safdie as Teller stands out. All the cast are gems.
It is helpful to know about the Russian Civil War, the Spanish Civil War, and 
some academics' support of socialism/ communism (not Russian communism). Also, the World War II changing alliances, Stalin at Potsdam and the Leo Szilard petition to Truman. These are the backstory that illuminate Oppenheimer's vulnerability vis-a-vis the security clearance.",POSITIVE

"Jul 22, 2023","Oppenheimer is a fascinating study in what happens when you add 60 pages of script to an otherwise good movie. Nolan as a director is completely out of his depth when it comes to courtroom style political drama. Between stale camera work and the decision to shoot in black and white, the entire 'fusion' section drags down an otherwise phenomenal film. If you do see it, please consider RDJ's face an invitation to step out and use the restroom, or maybe even top off your popcorn",NEUTRAL

"Jul 22, 2023",Fantastic and great portrayal of history!,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Don't go into this movie expecting anything remotely close to what the trailer portrays. Christopher Nolan once again finds a way to make an incredibly loud, mentally exhausting film despite lacking any excitement whatsoever. 

I really dont think people actually enjoy Nolan films. Instead they just become victims of recency bias and want to be able to tell everyone they saw something incredibly epic and indescribable on the big screen. Oppenheimer is neither of those things. Leading up to the Trinity test I started to become slightly engaged and thought to myself, okay maybe it's going to takeoff now. I was wrong. What an incredible letdown for what was supposed to be the climatic moment in a movie without actually any real climax. 

The final act, which was probably the last forty five minutes, might as well have been Interstellar in an interrogation room. From the booming score and dizzying pace, it all had an ""its been done before"" feel to it. The only reason I gave it two stars is because Matt Damon and Cillian Murphy gave two great performances and made the movie almost watchable. Unfortunately, great individual performances can't always save a movie.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",An absolute masterpiece. It was long but completely engrossing. Nolan is a genius and Cillian Murphy was born for this role. I also enjoyed the many cameos.,POSITIVE

I never read the book but since he put its on the big screen to be honest, I really don‚Äôt have to read the book great performances especially Robert Downey, Jr., if people are confused about the black and white that is in third person perspective and in color that hopper timers perspective as you can see the bomb shots in the visuals that‚Äôs going through his head while making the bomb it also go through a very good first second and third act where, in the first act, we see him before he makes the bomb on how his life was and how he met his wife and have cheated on his wife. The second act is where he heard about Hitler‚Äôs death and heard about Pearl Harbor so that is when he made the bomb and the third act is the consequences, and after the atomic bomb overall is a very good looking movie and the only thing that I have to say that is kind of bad is that it kind of feels long but like other than that 9.5/10",POSITIVE

"Jul 22, 2023","Un ironically one of the best movies ever made. The way it shows how the characters are affected psychologically and philosophically is beyond anything I've ever seen. It was more of a documentary than a movie but it was painted beautifully . Not only that, the affect that it puts on the audience who are watching is also incredible. There were many twists and turns and it eventually reflects on how countries became nuclear powerhouses. It reflects on how the world is the way it is now. Dr j Robert Oppenheimer is one the greatest historical physicist and figure of all time and the movie did very well to illustrate why that is. 

If you want to watch something that could possibly change your perspective about yourself or the world, this is the movie to watch.",POSITIVE

"Jul 22, 2023","""The World Forever Changes.""

Christopher Nolan gave cinema one of the most powerful and stunning biopics in history. In his 12th feature length film, Nolan takes on J. Robert Oppenheimer and his story leading, building and the aftermath of the atomic bomb. Definitely one of the best visual films in Nolans filmography and in recent cinema, ""Oppenheimer"" manages to turn one of the worlds most destructive weapons, into a mind-blowing, beautiful masterpiece. Nolan used two styles of visuals to portray the story, a first person perspective when the film was in colour and a third person perspective when it came to the black and white scenes, this helped to distinguish the difference between events for viewers especially with how much information was in the picture and really immerse the viewer in J. Robert Oppenheimer's position as these events unfolded and what he now carried with him as ""The Father of the Atomic Bomb"". I can easily say that Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. are clearly in the running for Best Actor and Supporting Actor as they both provide some of their best performances to date. However I will add that the entire cast was on their A-game anytime they were on screen. The fact that Nolan has addressed that there is no CGI used in this picture is phenomenal and after watching this film you can appreciate that so much more, everything was visually beautiful and the sound design on top of that was amazing. I have never watched a film and physically felt the magnitude of what was on screen. Every single explosion was felt as if you were in the observation area with the cast. My only issue that came with this film was the 3 hour runtime actually felt like 4. As some films manage to speed through 3 hours and leave you wanting more, this did not have that affect for me. However it is still a 5/5, it is in my top 3 for Nolan films and is definitely one I can rewatch no problem.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Good for the first hour‚Ä¶. Then a fu**ing rabbit hole of unnecessary drama, followed by ""Interstellar"" √≠nstense music, leading to nothing. Nolan tries to romanticize and justify the nuclear bomb with Trumpistic Americanism.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","This has got be Nolan's best one yet! Enjoyed it from the start till the end. No one tells a story this well, definitely a worthy candidates for the upcoming Oscars. This movie is probably not made to chase records but to bring the story of Oppenheimer to life! A solid 10/10 for Mr!",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Excessive in some areas, did not have to be 3 hours long. A visual spectacle",NEUTRAL
"Jul 22, 2023","Oppenheimer displays the brilliance and sensitivity of Christopher Nolan and he represents today's filmmaker who understands that we want to see true stories - good, bad, or ugly!

Maybe there was a warning in the opening, but this movie is filled with flashes of light, loud sounds, and strobe-like visuals that can trigger migraines and more. It began with promise, and good acting - especially Murphy as Oppie - but devolved into a confusing time-jumping slog. Political intrigue overtook the movie and the last one-third of it was more about Strauss than Oppenheimer. 
Kudos to RDJ as Strauss. Totally unexpected nudity and a sex act were NOT necessary to the characters or plot, R-rating or not. 
I never came to care about the lead character losing his 'top security clearance' or even his reputation. You never MADE me care, Mr Nolan. 
I only stayed because my date stayed 'til the end. Torture.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",I'm not someone who goes out to the theaters often but I had to come out for opening weekend. I'm a huge history buff and I was extremely curious how well the film would represent the time. I felt that the film captured perfectly the complexities of Oppenheimer's fractured mind and the psyche of the project itself and how it left him following the real life destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The shots of him seeing the crowds as victims of the destruction shows the deterioration of his mind and the immediate guilt and regret. I felt that the film not only represented the individuals of that time but the time period itself as well incorporating the Red Scare and the constant fear of communists and espionage that gripped the US government during the time. I could honestly go on and on about the various aspects of the film but what I will say is that this is a definite must-watch and a phenomenal piece of art.,POSITIVE

"Jul 22, 2023","FIRST REVIEW from July 2023:

Strictly for worshipers of Nolan's enormous, ever-expanding ego.

I was dumbfounded by the historical inaccuracies and the utter waste of some great talent (hello, Rami Malek!).

Nolan being Nolan, it is loud, disjointed, rarely pleasant, and occasionally embarrassingly dreadful.

And long. Did I mention that it's so bloated it becomes irrelevant?

I was at the first EU screening of ""Oppenheimer"" and saw ""Barbie"" three days later.

""Oppenheimer"" promises so much, and delivers almost nothing; ""Barbie"" teases as a bit of summer fluff and then awards viewed with so much more.  She wins hands down!

UPDATE: 27 December 2023

After all the laurels and Oscar nominations coming up, I caved-in and streamed ‚ÄûOppenheimer"" for a second view (I was at the first screening in the EU).
 
It was even worse ‚Äì if physics can prove it ‚Äì than the first look.  I drifted off somewhere around the two-hour mark and decided to just turn it off.  I hate this chain-reaction explosion of The Nolan Ego.  And Murphy?  An incoherent monochromatic construction made from toothpicks and a toadstool (the hat, ya know?).",NEGATIVE

"Jul 22, 2023","In Nolan I trust. Visually stunning and great acting. Can be tedious at times, and maybe a tad too long, but Cillian Murphy is captivating. Deserves many Oscars!",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",I was disappointed as I thought it would be better. Really no need for IMAX. The much discussed atomic bomb sequence was underwhelming. Still a good film just not great.,NEUTRAL
"Jul 22, 2023","The movie is meticulously handcrafted, Intricate, morally equivocal, and an in-depth character study of J. Robert Oppenheimer and his associates as they journey into the unknown laying the foundation for the destruction of the world. 

The film plays dice with the audience's moral compass as we progress deeper into the story, we come to know that things are not as black and white as they seemed and there is an immense grey area in this very complicated event in history. 

This is by far Christopher Nolan's best work to date, as he embraces and masters the perfect balance in storytelling vs visuals of the film. The movie is gripping from start to finish and the exceptional technical team has made Nolan's vision come true to life in this epic blockbuster.",POSITIVE

"Jul 22, 2023","""Oppenheimer"" is an impeccably crafted movie that has breathtaking visuals and a stunning score. However some dialogue is unintelligible, the structure of the story can be hard to follow at some times, and the movie runs at least 20-30 minutes too long.  All together ""Oppenheimer"" is a great achievement in film with incredible acting performances, especially from Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, and Robert Downey Jr.",POSITIVE

"Jul 22, 2023","3 hours of torture. 99% dialogue with horrible sound mixing. Couldn't understand 3/4 of what was going on in the film. Visuals were great have to admit but overall dragged out story and as per usual, awful films getting all the hype. People will force themselves to admit it's a great film just because it's Nolan but as a movie addict, he's really fallen off.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Overall, I was very disappointed with the final production.  The sets, scenery, and acting are fine, but the editing and music made it unbearable for me.  

1.  This was the loudest movie I've ever seen.  I held my ears in several parts and was wishing I had earplugs.  

2.  The music is incessant, often orchestrated discord in an effort to give the feeling of tension.  It competes with the dialogue.   The impact of some of the most famous quotes are lessened because the music's so damn loud.  

3.  The movie is all quick cuts like you'd see in a preview.  Except, quick cuts over 3 hours with flashbacks. 

I really wanted to like the movie, but I'd rather have those 3 hours of my life back.",NEGATIVE

The acting was phenomenal, especially Cillian Murphy, but also RDJ and Florence Pugh really impressed me, the effects combined with the music and sound effects were truly incredible. simply a masterpiece",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",Absolutely fantastic film.,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Magnificent filmmaking.  *A bit* slow in the third act, but tremendous nonetheless. Definitely meant to be seen on the largest screen possible with the biggest sound system... odd for a drama.  Sure to win awards for sound design, and likely many other categories as well.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",It was a good moving but it started to get boring at the end if you're to keep the atomic bomb part or the end and not in the middle. Towards the end of the movie everybody in the theater was kind of getting bored  And yawning,NEUTRAL

"Jul 22, 2023","""They won't fear it until they understand it. And they won't understand it until they've used it.""

Honestly Oppenheimer shook me to my core. Christopher Nolan has done it again and this is definitely his masterpiece! I hope to see him and Cillian Murphy win Oscar's!",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",Fat man and little boy was a better movie about the same subject. This movie skips around so much trying to pretend it's smart by skipping around and the characters are all self-absorbed jerks who kind of get what they deserved for being self-absorbed,NEGATIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","I really enjoyed the experience, and that is exactly what this movie is, an experience.
My wife and I watched a documentary on Oppenheimer (the man) before seeing the movie, which helped me better understand the beginning of the movie.
I do not think historical detail was the goal of the film. I think the goal was to expose the audience to what Oppenheimer experienced.",POSITIVE

"Jul 22, 2023",A landmark achievement in cinema,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Christopher Nolan delivers a powerful and visceral masterpiece, helped in no small part by a series of huge acting performances and a simply staggering sound design and score. The not-so-subtle existential message surrounding the nuclear era, the destructive power of human-kinds own creation, and the reality of our own induced mortality in the face of almost divine power - in the same way that Prometheus brought fire to man - is so clear throughout. You will need time to process everything you see during this 3-hour epic, but you will end up reflecting on the stark reality of what the fight against the Nazi regime led humans to create. It's an absolute must watch. A staggeringly good film.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Christopher Nolan has truly delivered an outstanding piece of art, which is well worth the 3 hours of my Friday night. The casting is spot on, and the performance by Cillian Murphy is spectacular. I expected nothing less. The sound design is something else entirely, and spending those few extra bucks to watch it in its intended format, IMAX, was well worth it.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Take some ketamine and see this movie , you will be forever changed.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","I thought the film handled the material excellently.  I learned a lot about Robert Oppenheimer.  In a strange way it was a provocative mix of history, politics, science and morality.  The ever present question about man's inhumanity to man and opening up the door to a world that was never going to be the same.  A master piece.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",This movie was excellent. From the acting to the sound design to the visuals. This is one of the best movies of the year.,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",This was one of the most tedious movies to watch. Sitting through this movie seemed like a 7 hour car ride. I found myself begging for the movie to end. I would not recommend this movie. The soundtrack left me mentally fatigued. It was very loud and repetitive at times. The movie did not live up to all of the hype.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",A mass of montages straight out of the gate that make it seem like a 3 hour trailer. Awful editing and overuse of the repetitive score. The character development was non existent due to the films inability to stay on any particular scene for more that 15 seconds. All around confusing bureaucratic mumbo jumbo made by someone with apparent adhd.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",It was a wonderful experience. Especially the sound design. But there is no way this will pass the Bechdel test.,POSITIVE

"Jul 22, 2023","This Film Is so amazing, It is so confusing, but this is normal because it is directed by Christopher Nolan And he uses the complex method in his films to attract attention, and I also advise before watching this movie that you must be prepare to watch this great work and it needs all focus and attention to focus on all the points in this movie, if you do this, You will have the best viewing pleasure.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Absolute masterpiece. This should be Cillians Oscar nominating role and absolutely will be RDJs Oscar nominating role too as support actor. The stakes are quite vigorously felt throughout the film and while a lot of the media focused on the bomb as a plot point, it's mainly about Oppenheimer and the complexity of character a man dubbed ""The Father of the Atomic Bomb"" is. Must must see film and no doubt will end up sweeping the Oscars in 2024",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",Constant background music was extremely annoying. Hard to follow the sequence of events. Acting was good but the overall story was much less and different than expected.  Wish I had waited to stream at home instead.,NEUTRAL
"Jul 22, 2023",Glad I didn't pay up for IMAX- at least an hour's worth of senate probe. Trailers led you to believe that screen size mattered- it didn't.,NEUTRAL
"Jul 22, 2023",Amazing performance by Cillian Murphy and RDJ. The writing in this film was astounding and reeled you in to pay attention to every second of the film. Christopher Nolan truly shows his skills and how to direct an amazing film and move the entire audience.,POSITIVE

"Jul 22, 2023","Christopher Nolan had me at 'Memento' and lost me with 'Tenet', but this one sets a new height for Nolan's ability to tell a story. As big as the cinematography and sound may be, the story drives the film. The cast is fantastic, with Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey, Jr owning the screen in every scene they are in. Don't be surprised to see David Krumholtz, of TV's Numbers fame, score a Best Supporting Actor nod during awards season.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","Very interesting movie.  Sad in places, too.  We must take history seriously.  
One contradiction to casting in my opinion - Matt Damon?  Ummm, not for this movie.  
And a few others, too.  It was difficult to put better known and familiar actors in the ""Oppenheimer"" place for me.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",Oppenheimer still resonates to this day as a man that powered humanity forward with science but yet dooming it as well. This film by Mr. Nolan encapsulates the man behind the curtain of just showing how to this day we all are still living under Oppenheimer‚Äôs world.,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023","A true masterpiece that tells a story that needed to be told. Cillian Murphy is phenomenally talented, Emily Blunt is a stunning actress. Nolan's storytelling at its finest : the film meets its predicament : tell a story that begs philosophical questions. You'll watch and then you'll talk about it - and debate around it. Phenomenal.",POSITIVE

"Jul 22, 2023",An epic movie that feels incredibly unique in it's story telling. I was incredibly taken with every scene.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","First two thirds, excellent. Last third (an hour), boring and ham-fisted. I think Nolan should have woven what the last third focuses in on into the earlier part of the film. Such time-hopping couldn't be any worse than what he put out as his final act for this film. A lot of great things, though, in this film...worth seeing.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 21, 2023","A decent attempt, but left disappointed. Flaky latex on a woman's face and a mini explosion which was clearly mainly petroleum/propane based did not do justice to the shear terror of what the atom bomb is capable of. Didn't really hit the spot, lacking depth in characters and their emotions, the plot was a little dull, and the focus was on the sexy side of the father of the atom bomb. Flash a bit of boob in an artistic manner and hope no-one notices the lack of any depth. Did I enjoy it overall? Yeah. Would I watch it again? Not any time soon.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 21, 2023",It was an absolute masterpiece.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Best Christopher Nolan movie,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",A beautiful if harrowing masterpiece.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","If you are going to watch a movie remember these points:
1. Watch on-screen with an open caption if possible.(optional requirement).
2. Keep full focus on movies because its dialogue heavy.
3. Parts with black and white are the perspective of Lewis Strauss(Downy jr.).
4. Think yourself as the character of Oppenheimer throughout the movie.
        Its a great movie. Keep your expectations low as you watch it, which I did and thats the reason I enjoyed it. 
Thank You",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Truly, a fantastic film. To be clear, the movie does not ""hero-ify"" Oppenheimer whatsoever, but instead gives a nuanced delivery of his story and actions. It's in this way that Nolan allows the viewers to be the ones to decide good vs evil on our own. The cast was phenomenal especially the performances given by Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. I'm anticipating Oscar nominations for both!",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Amazingly shot documentary movie, thirlling and scary even without the action sequences.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Great casting, great performances and a high quality job done by the production teams, feels very thought out. There appeared to be a underlying plot twist that was slow unravelling however none of it was gripping enough to keep me going. The deep intensity that was once there started falling apart drastically and the movie became a long, painful drag. Disappointing from Christopher Nolan.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Absolutely stunning!,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Incredible movie! Some people might find that there is a lot of dialogue and all but if you are interested in this period of history i cant tell you enough how much you need to go see this movie. Even people who are not particulary interested into this topic can find something in this movie. It's a masterpiece.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","It was like an 8/10 experience for me. Told a great story from beginning to end. Definitely watch it in IMAX theater's. As for the explosion itself, they should've done CGI for it instead of just capturing the visuals of a mushroom cloud and shockwave, to me it was kind of a let down when it exploded. But they do show parts of how a bomb explodes and the collision of atoms in the beginning which was intense, it replicated how it may have started and exploded.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Informative story with an impressible ensemble cast and great visuals.  Whilst I felt Nolan spent too much time on the post war treatment of Oppenheimer, the movie itself was a sombre reminder of the legacy of the nuclear arms race that still impacts the world today.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Tense, exhilarating, and thoroughly captivating, Oppenheimer finds director Christopher Nolan crafting a biopic just as powerful and haunting as the subject matter that inspired it!",POSITIVE

This film is overly long, self- indulgent, and meanders with very little cohesiveness. Impressive cast of mostly throwaway characters. Some scenes are perfectly executed. Makeup and sets are awesome.

Big votes for Downey and Murphy for their well worn, layered performances.   See it, but also see: The Right Stuff, Tucker: The Man and His Dream, and JFK.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 21, 2023","This is perhaps Christopher Nolan's magnum opus, which, given the caliber of his other movies, is saying a lot. This is one of the best movies in the last decade and will likely go down in history as one of the top movies ever made. I don't mean to be hyperbolic, but it really is that good. The music, acting, writing, screenplay, you name it ‚Äî everything is spectacular about this movie. It is quite long, but it was engaging throughout the entire three hours and didn't feel like it dragged at any point. This is a very powerful movie and for that reason may not be suitable for everyone, but it is a true masterpiece.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","A biography about the father of the atomic bomb, J. Robert Oppenheimber (Cillian Murphy). The film is just as much about how the atomic bomb came to be but also the repercussions once it was released upon the world. Bouncing back-and-forth between timelines (color for present/past events and black-and-white for future events). The film boasts an impressive all-star cast with many established names (and some Oscar winners as well) who are at times mere bit players such as Oscar winners Rami Malek and Gary Oldman. This just proves the willingness in which actors want to collaborate with director Christopher Nolan. While the runtime clocks in at 3 hours on the nose, the story moves rapidly and never lets up. Nolan crams a lot into the film and does a good job telling his story and I didn't feel much, if anything, was left out. I will point out that Robert Downey Jr. was initially one of the bit players I described earlier as Lewis Strauss; however, towards the end of the film he's given a lot more screentime and really makes the most of it. Besides quite possibly Murphy's best performance, RDJ really shined in his limited screentime. Nolan's best picture in my opinion since 2012's THE DARK KNIGHT RISES.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 21, 2023",Award winner. Christopher Nolan and the whole cast deserve all the glory!,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Nolan is back and delivers a fast paced thrilling biopic that will leave you stunned.the cinematography, sound design, score all exceptional. Every acting performance is perfect with Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr standing out. Nolan is experimenting with new styles of surrealist and subjective filmmaking to him which is so incredible to see from such a seasoned writer and director. He's pushing the envelope with Oppenheimer and challenging the audience like never before. Nolan's character study merges a thematically resonant story with a breathtaking soundscape & epic visuals. The IMAX experience for this one is a must. You will need to stay focused because the film moves very quickly with sharp snappy dialogue.",POSITIVE

All the cast are great from cilian Murphy who is going for the oscar with this role to Robert Downey jr and Emily Blunt and finally Rami Malik who has small scenes but you will never forget them. I didn't watch it in IMAX as I couldn't wait and ran to the nearest cinema but now I will sure book an IMAX ticket. Don't waste any time, book your ticket and Go watch it.. NOW.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Deafening sound and poignant messaging with a standout lead role for Cillian Murphy.

British director Christopher Nolan's epic biographical drama Oppenheimer (2023) is a formidable and artistic picture. I am astonished and devastated after the bleak, honest, and reflective ending to Oppenheimer. Nolan's direction is fascinating and feels like if Terrence Malick made a historical drama with editor Jennifer Lame doing these insane cuts in time and space. I felt the 3 hour run-time of 181 minutes, but I was thoroughly engrossed throughout Oppenheimer. Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema's smooth sweeping camera shots and startling close-up shots of haunted faces.

Writer Christopher Nolan impressively details Oppenheimer's education, lectures, hearings, and Manhattan Project scientific advancements. I did not know a lot about J. Robert Oppenheimer, so Nolan really must have researched a ton because I learned a ton. I was surprised how much the Red Scare and Communism plays into the history of the Oppenheimer and Strauss hearings. 

The source book authors Martin J. Sherwin and Kai Bird have an interesting perspective on Oppenheimer. I really found Nolan's perspective fascinating that Oppenheimer wants to change physics and science with the invention of the atomic bomb, but he feels a harrowing guilt over killing hundreds of thousands in Nagasaki and Hiroshima after the bomb actually drops. Casting director John Papsidera really cast over a dozen major stars for Oppenheimer.

Irish actor Cillian Murphy is captivating and heartbreaking J. Robert Oppenheimer. His subtle facial expressions are quite revealing to how Murphy wants the audience to see Oppenheimer. You can see Oppenheimer as a genius theoretical physicist, loving husband, cheating spouse, constant womanizer, haunted soul, and monstrous mass murderer from the nuclear bomb deaths. He delivers the greatest acting performance I have seen by a male actor all year. I hope Cillian Murphy wins a Best Actor Oscar for Oppenheimer.

English actress Emily Blunt is quite moving as Oppenheimer's alcoholic and sincere wife Katherine ""Kitty"" Oppenheimer. Blunt is beautiful and touching as she struggles with motherhood, alcoholism, and defending Oppenheimer to the government inquiries and public opinion. I thought she would have a larger role, but her part is still significant. I really liked her standing up for herself and Oppenheimer to the panel as well as screaming to Oppenheimer to defend himself. The quiet romantic horse rides and her yelling at Oppenheimer to get himself together for them and the country after his cheating were excellent scenes with Kitty. I'm rooting for Emily Blunt to win a Best Supporting Actress Oscar now after her brilliant turn as Kitty Oppenheimer.

American actor Matt Damon is fantastic as the stern, loyal, and humorous General Leslie Groves. His direct manner and close friendship to Oppenheimer is quite gripping. Damon knows how to give a compelling supporting performance and I believe his chances at awards should be considered too.

Robert Downey Jr. is absolutely amazing as the vindictive, jealous, and conniving Lewis Strauss. He clearly demonstrates with glares and eye gestures Strauss' disdain and bitter jealousy for Oppenheimer's fame, ingenuity, and success. Robert Downey Jr. needs to continue down his dramatic acting path with great roles like Chaplin, Zodiac, Sherlock Holmes, and Oppenheimer because he deserves a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for Oppenheimer. He is really impressively underhanded and nuanced like Cillian Murphy's skill level. Alden Ehrenreich is totally enthralling as Strauss' Senate aide, who is horrified by Strauss' deceptive lies and bitter jealous actions.

Florence Pugh gets only a few scenes, but she is really commanding the screen with her presence as Communist and Oppenheimer's mistress Jean Tatlock. Her scorn and fragile sensitivity are an interesting foil for Murphy's shy and repressed Oppenheimer. Pugh is very pretty and says so much with her eyes and frowns.

Josh Hartnett returns to the silver screen as the creative Ernest Lawrence. Casey Affleck is really threatening and serious as Colonel Boris Pash with his judgemental glares. I found him to be one of the strongest supporting players. Rami Malek has two quick appearances as scientist David Hill, then steals his major scene testifying against Strauss in a stunning sequence. I found him absolutely captivating with a real gravitas and earnestness.

Kenneth Branagh is fantastic as the encouraging and honest scientist Niels Bohr. Benny Safdie steals his scenes as the hydrogen bomb inventor Edward Teller. Dylan Arnold is very fun and supportive as Frank Oppenheimer. Gustaf Skarsg√•rd is a great scientist as the skeptical Hans Bethe. David Krumholtz is very fun and compelling as Isidor Isaac Rabi like Matthew Modine's Vannevar Bush. David Dastmalchian's scheming informer William L. Borden is as fascinating as Dane DeHaan's severe security man Kenneth Nichols. Tom Conti's amiable portrayal of the intellectual genius Albert Einstein is delightful and brings about the shocking final moment of Oppenheimer. He brings real dramatic weight to Oppenheimer.

Jack Quaid gets a brief cameo as Richard Feynman and Josh Peck is gripping during the atom bomb Trinity Test as Kenneth Bainbridge. Olivia Thirlby gets to defend herself as Lilli Hornig. Jefferson Hall is good as the Communist sympathizer Haakon Chevalier. Jason Clarke is very upsetting and infuriating as the determined prosecutor against Oppenheimer named Roger Robb. Alex Wolff gets a disquieting cameo as Luis Walter Alvarez. Matthias Schweigh√∂fer gets an unsettling cameo as the German scientist Werner Heisenberg. Gary Oldman is excellent and looks hideous. He feels contemptible as the disgusting remorseless American President Harry S. Truman.

Composer Ludwig G√∂ransson delivers the most massive film score I have ever heard in a movie theater. The music is louder and more grand than Dune or Tenet's music. Ludwig's enthralling symphonic choices capture the intensity and disturbing subject matter of atomic death with severe melodic stabs. His music swirls around chaotically, adding a stunning oppressive musical backdrop to the film.

Sound designers Dan O'Connell, Richard King, Kevin O'Connell, Alex Gibson, Willie D. Burton, and Christopher Flick went insanely hard for Oppenheimer. The noisy swells create a haunting and scary atmosphere throughout like for the bomb trial's drop or the finale's suspense. I could still hear the speaking voices, but Oppenheimer is easily the loudest film I've ever heard in a movie theater. I almost wish I brought ear plugs.

Costume designers Ellen Mirojnick and Lynda Foote create all these neat period accurate suits and outfits for the huge ensemble. Makeup artists Andrea Steele and Kerrin Jackson transform Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. especially among the cast. Hairstyling from Jaime Leigh McIntosh, Ahou Mofid, and Lydia Fantini is wonderful with such a cool variety of haircuts from the 1940's era.

In all, Oppenheimer is impressive from the bomb effects to the sterling acting of all these character actors going full throttle.",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","The movie was PERFECT!!! Loved the work from the crew and the whole display of the tortured soul and the intensity of the war times was displayed in such a way that can put the viewers in the variety of emotions felt during this masterpiece. The acting was top notch, the plot twist was unexpectable and also the effects were so vivid. The whole script was OP ;). Also great work from Cillian making the personage look like a tortured genius taking on his battles on every field. Personal life battles and professional work challenges. As a viewer i could feel his emotions and distress and in short Christopher Nolan was the Emotions Charger, Cillian was the Conductor of this blast of genius giving everything that the spectator can want.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time. Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet. The film is 3-hours long but goes through very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace. Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years. The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score, Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead. I highly recommend this film to everyone. Watched it once already, and going back to the theatre for at least a few more times soon.",POSITIVE

Cillian Murphy is an example of this, he played an incredible role as Julius Robert Oppenheimer, I expected him to deliver an incredible performance, but not that it would be at this level, the film itself collaborates with the actors, the lines, the soundtrack that makes the film more and more dramatic, the conflicts in the course of the film's story, the film is without a doubt the best film of the year, both in effects and in acting and narrative, no film of this year managed to be better than Oppenheimer, this taking into account that I have watched all the main films of the year year, I even watched the ones less hyped by the public, and I still maintain my opinion, Oppenheimer is a masterpiece, and yes, for me this film is the best film of the year.",POSITIVE

Nolan has outdone himself in what he knows how to do best: an original temporality, breathtaking editing and a unique dynamic. The cast is truly exceptional: Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr., Florence Pugh, Emily Blunt, perfect. 

On the other hand, false advertising: if you expect three hours of mind-blowing nuclear explosions, go your way. It's a biopic, not a show movie. We are far from the spectacular of Interstellar or Inception. 

The visual effects to evoke fission and the atom are incredible, and the sound editing is one of the enormous strengths of the film. I hope for at least this Oscar.",POSITIVE

This will win many awards.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Christopher Nolan is my favorite modern director.  His last movie was Tenet - it was bad for many reasons but mainly because he took a complicated subject and told it in a complicated way.  His latest film Oppenheimer takes a simple subject and makes it complicated, long, and boring. Nolan has forgotten that his audiences have not spent hours researching his complicated subjects.  This movie has some of the very worst editing.  There are often moments of 1-2 second cuts made back to back for 5 minutes straight which make for super choppy and painfully hard to watch storytelling.   And Nolan wraps this mans story around the most boring subjects possible, a DC congressional committee looking into a cabinet appointee - AND security meeting about the main character.  Really?  I am am not kidding you, he made a movie about meetings - the most boring things in the known universe.  Throw in the typical Nolan time warp editing and now you are confused, bored and looking at your watch.  But wait, the moment you think the climax is here - NOPE another 45 minutes to find out what the conclusion of the meetings were (spoiler - totally what you think and was told about earlier in the film)  -  Really bad movie and you are welcome for saving 3 hours and 15 minutes of your life.  Oh and if you like Nolan but found his last movie Tenet confusing and hard to follow - this movie makes it look like  complete gem.  üôÇ",NEGATIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",The movie was slow to start but very quickly grabs your attention. The movie is a spectacular depiction of the story of Dr. R Oppenheimer. I'm 23 years old and the theater was a mixed bag of different ages. I was confused why there were some people laughing at different parts of the movie where I saw it more of a shocking moment of truth unfolding. I have to say I have not shed a tear in a very long time but this movie at the end destroyed me. It's a sad truth to what we have become as a human species and Dr. Oppenheimer was wright. I was in the car flooded with emotions as the rain picked up. The quotes from Dr.Oppenheimer resonated with me as I sat there thinking to myself what he must have felt like. A tsunami of emotions flooded through my mind and I was in the parking lot for a good 20 mins. This movie is a masterpiece that touched my heart. It's absolutely a must watch. I'm glad I went alone though. This movie is 100% one that requires your attention. Such a tragedy. The music in this movie was also stellar.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",It was too good and a cinematic masterpiece,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","I was ambivalent about seeing the movie as I am a history buff, but it exceeded my expectations. I knew the movie would give the history and moral questions following the deployment of the atomic bomb, but did not know the history of the political aftermath with Strauss. I thought it was very balanced and my spouse and I spent a lot of time discussing the continuing questions of the build up of nuclear weapons.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","This movie was an absolute blast. From the perspective from an amateur watcher, I loved it. The cast included some memorable actors, the moments were impactful and the way the movie looked.. it was absolutely beautiful. I loved the switches between silence and blasts, as how the balck and white (and white screen) came on, really magnificent. I'd say that the movie is really good, and it really is. The only small problem is that I feel like it is way too long. In a way- 3 hours is too much, even for a documentary. And the way it was formed into a story on its own, it was simply put- too long.

But I really liked it, and the length doesn't really matter as it is just how I perceived it. I recommend this banger of a movie.",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","SPOILERS! Ready for three hours of 30-second scenes and non-stop droning, ticking music in the background while Cillian Murphy stares at the floor looking stressed out? That was apparently the whole formula for Oppenheimer. 

Remember the hype around ""how did Christopher Nolan make a nuclear explosion without using CGI?"" Well it looks like every b-movie gasoline explosion you've ever seen. ""What about the trailer?"" Those flickering atomic-like light flashes and so forth are 1-second shots from an entirely different scene. Nolan had one job in this movie, let's face it: to make an amazing, never-before-seen sequence of a nuke going off in all of its world-changing, existential nightmarish glory... And. He. Failed. Don't believe me? Go see it for yourself. Before I forget to mention it, Emily Blunt's character is a one-dimensional nutjob. It is clear she was directed to be a clich√© 40s alcoholic housewife. 

The story revolves around three things: Los Alamos, Robert Downey Jr.'s character trying to revoke Oppenheimer's security clearance, and Oppenheimer's conflicted marriage at odds with his previous, arguably more emotionally impactful relationship. But you don't really get to see inside his mind as much. Nolan never really delves too deeply into Oppenheimer's personal philosophies or spiritual thoughts on what he's wrought. We get tastes of these insights throughout the film, but it is clear the writers were more interested in spending the film flashing backwards and forwards in time with this Downey Jr. G-Man versus Oppenheimer crap... In the end, Oppenheimer is shown - in a one minute scene - receiving an award at the White House later in life. This was really frustrating, as it made me wonder why two hours of the film was about the significance of being questioned about Communist sympathies and what this could mean for his clearance. 

Overall, it wasn't a ""bad"" film, but Nolan's style of constant anxiety and flutter-flash scenes, deliberately confusing the audience with time-jumps, insisting on using dull practical effects for what could have been more technically rendered by other means in the form of an atomic explosion that would truly change the way we visualize The Bomb... It was just... 

My afterthoughts were less than complementary and I drove home underwhelmed, thinking another director could have given us something truly special. For me, the Nolan hype is over.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 21, 2023",Amazing. The only thing they forgot to include was that communist scientists infiltrated the project and sent secrets to Russia...,POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","A fantastically enacted terrible film. Good: Great actors, great musical score, historically accurate. Bad: quantaty of themes over quality, i.e. none get explored in any debt, emotionally shallow, despite the trailers promising a deepdive into Oppenheimers character, immoral, unrelatable characters, jumpcuts everywhere, no focus, little context for events. Anticipated moments were underwhelming.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 21, 2023",Give cillian rdj abd Emily an Oscar. What a performance. Beautiful,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Surprisingly, Oppenheimer almost suffers from being too fast paced. The movie feels like a tight 2 hours, leaving you wanting a little deeper analysis of key moments. Instead the need to survey a very large kingdom keeps the scenes flipping a little too fast to truly relish the art unfolding before your eyes. A ten episode limited series may have been a better venue. 

A very good movie, but neither great nor Nolan's best work. Downey and the musical score are Oscar worthy.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Oppenheimer is a fascinating and impressive film with an incredibly visceral pacing to it. It is a testament to Nolan's vision and craftsmanship, as well as Murphy's acting prowess.

It is a film that is certainly worth watching for its cinematic achievements and its exploration of the human condition in the face of scientific discovery and moral dilemma.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Christopher Nolan's latest  masterpiece and it did live up to it's expectations . I myself have been excited and worried considering his last flick(Tenet) which I didn't like very much. However any suspected flaws that appeared in the beginning of the movie have been over balanced by the time you reach it's end . It really does get better and better as the plot advances and the enjoyment just seems to have no limits. The cast does a very decent job, off course not everyone gets a lengthy screentime , like for instance Casey Affleck and Rami Malek in spite of their character's significance to the plot are just in for less than what their fans would want. And that's by far the movie's only disadvantage , it just has a lot to  tell and you won't get out of it remembering everything .But hey! You would want to watch the movie again anyways!

"Jul 21, 2023",This is a movie much more about politics and conspiracy than about the development of the nuclear bomb. The trailer is very misleading.

"Jul 21, 2023","I guess it pays to be on the good side of Hollywood. Most people are saying it's probably going to be the movie of the year.  I didn't like it. Why?  Underdeveloped characters. Too many possible story lines. Should have concentrated in on less. Outside of loud stomping sounds, special effects were absent. No need for an IMAX theater. I saw Oppenheimer as a negative Nancy who had talent for putting the right people in the right positions. I think the movie focused more on the political side of science. One the government gets all they can out of you, they throw you to the curb. Since he was supposed to have been portrayed as someone against nuclear weapons after they were used, it would have been more effective to see why he felt that way. They should have shown the horrors of a nuclear explosion. It could have been done better. I don't know who Nolan is. I do know that I don't want to see any more of his films.

But ever since TDKR, the sound design has been an issue, which he has MOSTLY fixed here.  You do NOT need to see this in IMAX: it‚Äôs a biopic drama a la The Social Network, except with a bomb in the middle.  It‚Äôs very well paced and the performances from the stacked cast are great to superb.  RDJ and Cillian Murphy will at least be nominated for Oscars.  So go see it, but temper your expectations.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","There were awesome 3 hours in cinema. Although the film was so long, it was passing quickly, sometimes too quickly. Because of short shots, some quotes or events might not be fully captured by the audience.

From the technical point of view, Oppenheimer is as great as different Christopher Nolan's movies. Thrilling soundtrack and excellent cinematography affect the viewers.

Directing, in the most important moments, is outstanding and impressive.

Cillian Murphy played his best in this movie.

From supporting roles, the best one was Robert Downey Jr as Lewis Strauss. He was really charismatic in his problematic role.

I think female characters weren't used well. They weren't very important to the story.

For me, the biggest positive surprise was screenplay and storytelling. Most of the characters were developed. The story provided emotions. Also, relations of scientists with army and politicians were well written. There were some brilliant ironic scenes about it.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","The Theater pushed the start of the film back 20 minutes, because there were no trailers. Then the film projector didn't work. After about 90 minutes, they decided that they were unable to present the film in the 70mm format. We arrived early so we basically sat in the theater for 2 hours and 20 minutes for nothing. Pretty disappointed and now all future showings are sold out for weeks in 70mm.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Watching this film makes you feel like you are watching the best film ever made. It's peak cinema & it's Nolan in all his glory.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Nolan have the Best filmografy of the history and this movie about ophenhimer si absolutley amazing,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",The angle Nolan chose to take for this movie was the wrong one. He turned the most fascinating subject and figure into the most dull piece of art I've ever seen. You're better off watching a documentary about it or read a book,NEGATIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Amazing film. Direction, acting, everything. So beautifully done and very emotional",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Christopher Nolan is unmatched in his craft when he is on his game. I am proud to say that he is with Oppenheimer. The film is a spectacular showing of filmmaking.  The practical effects are second to none and the cast is beyond incredible in every role no matter the amount of screen time they get. This film should certainly rack up award nominations across the board and maybe bring Nolan his long overdue Oscar for directing.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Nolan's best work: Horrifyingly human with crushing performances from the ensemble. The music and sound from Ludwig G√∂ransson is just soul shaking! The cinematography is top notch from van Hoytema. RDJ, Cillian, Blunt deserve Oscars. One of the most important films of all time! This one is for the ages...",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Unbelievable film, a must watch if you like science and/or history. The acting was spot on and the scenes were detailed down to Richard feynmans bongos!, and many parts scenes were interconnects masterfully. Definately one of my favourite films and the best Christopher Nolan film I've seen to date.",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","Kind of a major let down for me.  Way too much focus on the politics surrounding Oppenheimer after the war.  This adds another hour to the movie, and it's a boring hour.  Considering the subject matter, the budget, and great cast... this should have been an awesome movie, but it was just ok in my eyes.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 21, 2023","A strong 8.5 out of 10 stars. Seen in the Cinemark XD format. There is no real Imax within hundreds of miles of me.  Was more of a political drama than a ""Team work will get it built"" film. Very dry humor. And very heavy content. One of the best films so far released this year.

It used audio and a score along with editing to create a 2-hour intense build-up to a massive climax... followed by an hour of ""fall out"" afterward. Usually, Build ups in films don't last more than 15 minutes without a car chase, shoot out or a guy leaping off a 2 story exploding building. This one is built up with a heavy plot and interactions with dialog. No car chases. A breath of fresh air. See less",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",damn it need to watch it again,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Absolutely stunning cinematography and well told story.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Brilliant film with so many strong actors. Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr are especially strong, and Gary Oldman a brilliant cameo. Could have been a bit shorter but the sheer size and importance of the story do warrant it.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",I'm a tv actor with an MFA in film- this movie was shot BEAUTIFUL but holy hell was it hard to watch. Disconnect story line. Moronic plot. Jumpy scenes. Good acting but no one knew they were making the same movie- every performance was all over the place. No villian. No plot. Too long. Bad writing. Bad dialogue. The only reason I didn't walk out of the movie was because I was on a date and trying to get action- she confessed she hated it too.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Magnificent. Sounds, visuals, story, casting, acting, the feels, The suspense, the everything! ",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Never gets old. Better with each viewing,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Flat. A few funny lines based on actual conversation. Choppy. The main story line of the book is lost. The texture of the movie doesn't adequately capture Los Alamos. Read the book. It's far better than the movie. I usually skip the movie; only the best directors capture the texture and depth. I walked out after the horribly imitated blast from the gadget. Just flat. Maybe if you are clueless about Oppenheimer and this part of our history you could walk away and follow up with a screening of Barbie. I probably should have watched Barbie; plastic would have probably been a compliment for that picture.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Typical Nolan, Just great. Amazing, three hours and Not a Second was boring",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","An absolutely stunning cinematic experience. Perfect movie, down to every little detail.
The portreyal of the atomic bomb was immaculate, terrifying but also to be admired.
The heavy cast of actors was amazing, one by one, they made the movie greater and greater while still putting Cilian Murphy into the spotlight.
Felt like a story was being told, but also like I was a witness to those events.
Truly a life changing movie",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023",Oppenheimer is a beautiful and brilliant movie. Masterfully directed and acted with spectacular acting from Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. who create performances that separate them entirely from the people the are into the historical figures they aspire to be. Nolan‚Äòs choices as a director are artful and require a layered analysis and understanding. Watching the movie twice only made this much more apparent. A must see!,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Absolutely stunning. The first and second acts were good, but the final act is what puts this into epic territory for me. Robert Downey Jr. is coming for that Oscar.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Amazing! Christopher Nolan is the king of cinema! His storytelling skills that will last for centuries!,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",One of the best movies I've seen in years.  Christopher Nolans best yet.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","This movie made me cry. The number of things that were racing through my head with every scene. It literally blew my mind. It truly captures the astonishing and devastating visualization of the atomic bomb. If you do not like history, this movie is not for you. However, if you truly value cinematography this movie is a must-watch. If you value both history and cinematography this movie is for you.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Absolutely phenomenal, the best of Christopher Nolan. It was a welcome departure from his previous action heavy thrillers. The film dives headfirst into the psyche of Oppenheimer and the trauma that would come with unleashing the nuclear bomb on the world. While some might find this biopic dialogue heavy, it worked great in my view. There was never a moment that felt unnecessary even given the run time. Absolute 10/10!",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","The movie takes building the bomb and what happened to Oppenheimer after that and weaves them together to the climax. It is thought provoking and powerful. It is a subject fraught with many things and Nolan did a great job at capturing the undercurrents, power struggles, passions, naivete, and egos of all the people involved.  It shows the best and worst of humans. The acting is superb and engaging.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","#Oppenheimer is by riveting film he's ever made. The sheer amount of information and detail is astonishing. It's not going to be his most watchable being that it's 3 hours of drama. This will require multiple viewings to get everything. On the technical side Nolan creates some of the most visual spectacles I've witnessed and he's absolutely going to win an Oscar for sound. Everyone including Florence Pugh and Matt Damon were incredible but Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr and Emily Blunt are going to go heavy on awards night. Also this may very well be Christopher Nolans win. There's some pacing issues as I felt like it at times did feel like 3 hours but there's times where it flew by. This movie is an absolute blast (pun intended). 

10/10",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Well done. Attention paid to every detail.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Very long, and could've done without a lot of scenes especially the nudity which felt very out of place in the movie. Great acting saves this movie from being a total disaster.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 21, 2023",Unbelievable. One of Nolan's best by far,POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023",The way you ALL collectively lied and hyped up this movie‚Ä¶ SHAME TO YOU ALL! Watching fruits and vegetables growing on YouTube is more entertaining than this hyped up explosion. Also this all could've been made by AI and I wouldn't know the difference nor care.,NEGATIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","Nolan + Cillian . It was meant to be . Great dailogues , Beautiful videography and some might find the slow paced conversation boring, but for me it was normal.  Overall , a must watch on Imax",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","In my 65 years of movie going, 'Oppenheimer' was the worst movie that I ever saw!

Each of the characters seemed to be in such a hurry to deliver their lines as if it was a contest to see which one could do it faster. The whole movie was made up of bickering, arguing, and spitting their lines so quickly that some of the conversations didn't even make sense. Adding to the confusion was the constant switching timelines in his life. 
The only thing they got right is the build up towards the experimental explosion. Then...guess what??? Firecrackers... I mean what the F was that? Truly disappointing. 
Money comes and goes, but I'll never get those 3 hours back.  

I saw many people sleeping in the cinema and I had to fight off the drowsiness myself. 
I really did not like this movie.  I had zero interest in seeing Barbie but, half way through Oppenheimer, I wished I had seen Barbie.  

The best part was with Matt Damon,  but he is only in 20% of movie and he could not even save this stinker.  

It was the worst movie I have seen in a long time.  Just boring and dumb.  Had the potential to be a good movie with a compelling storyline but radically missed the mark. I gave it a half...and even that is generous. Don't waste your money!!!",NEGATIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Watched the movie on a non IMAX.. and its great. Younger audience might get lost if they aren't up to speed on the history and a suffer from Short attention span.. the movie is long
Sc√®nes are well crafted and there only a couple of sc√®nes that could concern kids but overall it's okay ( 15A in Ireland)  one minor explicit sex scene and some topless shots and one reference to suicide. 
Well worth it, Life changing no...",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Took more than 30 minutes into the movie before they got the dialogue, music, and other audio effects sorted out so that we could clearly hear the dialogue.  Since the movie is primarily dialogue this was not good.  There actually seemed to be 2 movies hashed together to make this rather drawn out collage.  First movie was mostly about Oppenheimer building and testing the bomb, while he wooed and bedded babes.  The second movie was more about Lewis Strauss and his efforts to discredit and slander Oppenheimer.  In the end, Oppenheimer is trashed by yet another gang of thug Senators.  And they manage to prevent Oppenheimer from renewing his security clearance and he was thus prevented from doing further work for the US government

Of the very many character presented in the film only a few get proper development.  There were several times in the movies where the audience was obviously restless with the pace and storyline.  

There really didn't seem to be much reason to have gone to such extremes to shoot this movie in iMax format.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 21, 2023",Cillian is exceptional! He expertly carries this behemoth of a film in his back!,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",It would be almost impossible for me to put into words what I've just witnessed. I have never seen such a psychological thriller before. All I'd say is everyone on the planet must watch this movie atleast once because this is the most important movie of all time.,POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","Oppenheimer left me stunned and speechless. This is the movie of the decade, and certainly Christopher Nolan's magnum opus. This movie is the definition of masterpiece! Nolan directs a beautiful and harrowing experience that is completely mesmerizing. It's a true masterclass on building extreme tension through exquisite, fast dialogue, insanely powerful sound & an equally explosive score. And it looks incredible on IMAX 70mm film. Cillian Murphy and RDJ deliver career best performances.

Oppenheimer is unlike any film you've ever seen. The direction, editing and music seem to be in permanent fusion, immersing us in the mind of J. Robert Oppenheimer. A pure sensory experience that makes it the Nolan film with the strongest identity.

Gorgeous. Monumental. Terrifying.",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","I thought the acting was superb. Great group. 3 hours long is tough, but it was worth it. Filmed totally in high definition. It really needs to be seen on a true I Max screen. A smaller screen does not do it justice. In my hippie days‚Ä¶seeing this film on mushrooms would have been awesome üòé.",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","I was riveted for 3 hours, I have a short attention span and always have the need to check my phone. My phone was not touched once. The acting was superb. The cinematography was breathtaking. The flow and pacing was there. I'm still processing what I saw in IMAX. I have seen every Nolan film and this one is up there.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Endless close-ups of Murphy's face. 
A disjointed trinity of storylines, only one of which you'll be interested in. 
Unnecessary sex scenes which add nothing to the story. 
Incredibly obnoxious soundtrack which presumably they thought would make up for the lack of anything happening in the film.
Lots of dialogue, endless talking. Conversations in lecture room, in a park, in a house, in a room, in a tent, in the desert, in another house, in another room, at a congressional hearings in the oval office, in the US, in the UK in Germany. Endless conversations and close-up shots to actors' faces with not much happening at all. 

The build up to the bomb followed by an hour or more of closing out the other stories. Stories for which the outcome you will undoubtedly not care about. 

At three hours, the film starts to drag after the first an and a half or so. Ok

One of the most overrated files I've seen in a while. 

Recommendation: go and see Mission Impossible instead.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 21, 2023","Thought the movie nailed it in every category. The acting was phenomenal, the story was well told, the editing, the score were all top notch. I see where people are complaining about there not being enough about the atomic bomb but the movie is called Oppenheimer. That is exactly what the movie is about. The title does not mislead you. I can see this running away with all the awards this year. One of the first times in a long time I went to a theater and felt like an audience respected the movie being presented. Everyone was into the film. It‚Äôs worth seeing in the theater. I expect it to be good at home too.

"Jul 21, 2023","peak cinema, very good movie",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Oppenheimers greatest strength was by far the actor who played him. The actor did a truly phenomenal job encapsulating the world of not only los alamos and the scientific aspects of the atomic bomb, but the great political and more important mental tole that the ending of the war took on Oppeheimer. The man, the real man, was  in need of desperate psychological help, and the actor playing him truly exemplified that type of man, in need of great change, one who shouldn't've built this bomb for the emotional tole it would take on an already unstable individual. The main actor was incredible. The actors playing Jean, Kitty, Groves, and Frank, were incredible. While much focus wasn't put into their characters, the over exceeded my expectations. However, that's where the great acting choices die down. Hiring notorious black face actor Robert Downey Jr in a movie intended to open the view on the the detonation of the atomic bomb in a meaningful light to more people than ever before, is a mistake. Robert Downey Jr. is an actor who in any role cannot be taken seriously. While he isn't a comedic actor necessarily, his acting is solely limited to characters without great depth, i believe his acting career, unfortunately, is restricted due to his time as tony stark. He's ingrained it into everyone's mind that he is tony stark, fitting him into another acting role far from stark seems forced, an unsettling. The artistic shots while incredible to view were occasionally oddly placed and confusing. As someone who possesses a great deal of knowledge on the subject of Oppenheimer's and the atomic bomb's lives, the movie could be easily misunderstood. Imagining those viewing it who are unknowing of Oppenheimer, the movie would be unwatchable. The movie is too entangled in the story, which could be incredible if the marketing wasn't so vast. The ads for the movie were everywhere and competing with the wide audience of the barbie movie. This movie is too niche for its targeted demographic to be so large. If the movie had focused on hiring less known but far better actors, and stuck to it's own audience rather than reaching for new viewers, the experience could've been amazing. The team focused too much on publicity than creating a story, unsuccessfully towing the line between niche and mainstream. What tore this movie from what could've been a novelty into a bore was it's need to compete with the large audience of barbie. This movie had great potential to be the movie of the decade, opening a greater interpretation on the most history alternating invention of the 20th century, but it was tanked by the creators greed.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 21, 2023","Dude Oppenheimer was good, but do not go high I STG üòÇ it's mostly all dialogue. The writing is incredible & good acting surrounding the moral spectacle of destroying lives to save lives using the hydrogen bomb. But no real action! Great if you do a little bit of reading up on the time period before watching or have any knowledge of the science behind it, but if i lost attention @ any point I felt like I maybe missed important dialogue. Was expecting to see the horrors of the bombings, but Hiroshima & Nagasaki took place off screen. Kinda disappointed me as it felt like a missed opportunity to really climax with a harsh visualization of the reality that not many of the newer generations could grasp with just their imagination.",NEUTRAL

Es un thriller sobre la vida de Robert J. Oppenheimer con un gui√≥n y escenas espectaculares. Parece como si Nolan se hubiese preparado toda su carrera para hacer esta pel√≠cula.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","From a technical and entertainment standpoint this movie is a wonder. Nolan has used and combined a lot of techniques, those which some may call just gimmicks in a way that no one would think work together, especially for a biopic and makes it work. The film is about the making of the atomic bombs and the two subsequent hearings related to that. In Nolan's favourite way, these events are non-linear with branches that move around so much with heart-pounding music to make it more of a thriller than a biopic. Then it also employs subjective viewpoints to tell the story from different sides but mainly through Oppenheimer but if you look into it, it's not exactly subjective enough all the time when it is supposed to be. There are so many things in here that Nolan was clearly just afraid to show but he doesn't have to worry about that when he can use the other parts of the story to make it a thriller that may even confuse you if you are not really familiar with the story. The film clearly doesn't want to take a stand alongside the atrocity that happened but the way it deflects a lot of questions and even some of the whitewashing of the early life of the character is kind of annoying. The way Nolan treats female characters is also present here. The way a lot of blame is continuously put on the female characters even without outright saying it, makes me ask the question many has asked before, does Nolan really hate woman?
Despite all the issues, I can't deny how good of a film it was. The performances were great, the way it revealed a lot of stuff towards the end, albeit predictable outcomes, was so gratifying to see. This style of filmmaking is not something you associate with a biopic, I believe, more so, after watching this, that is because it shouldn't. I could've considered an approach like this masterful if it wasn't a real story.


Second watch

Rewatching without some preconceived notions, knowing what is to come and not missing the first two minutes like the first time made this so much better for me this time, even though the theatre was a bit of a downgrade from the first time. The first time, I was a couple of minutes late, and even after reaching, settling and relaxing made the first scene that register in my mind, the apple scene which kind of completely shifted my perception and made me judge the movie differently. This time the proper opening really changed that. I knew how technically brilliant this was from the first watch but this time the emotional rapport was also perfect for me. Oppenheimer is the kind of flawed hero Nolan loves to portray. My qualms about what was chosen to show and what wasn't made much more sense this time. It was also great to see a biopic that didn't combine a lot of characters into one but instead used a plethora of great actors perfectly cast to each role, which can only be done by a director like Nolan because of his unique ""star-power"" as a director. 
Also, watching from a theatre with not so great sound system made me understand not everyone had the kind of theatre experience I had the first day which kind of makes me understand more about how some people who expected a spectacle from Nolan (idiotically so, even after knowing what the film is about) was disappointed, which was baffling for me before. This time, since the quality of the projection and sound were not as good as my first time, it wasn't as immersive and didn't have the oomph factor that I had the first day. But the added context and other elements this time made this my favourite movie of the year.",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","Una pel√≠cula que no es apta para el que va a cine esperando una premisa viralizada de explosiones, para el que gusta de acci√≥n constante. La pel√≠cula es un viaje por la vida de Openheimer abarcando lo relacionado a la bomba at√≥mica hasta su consecuci√≥n que est√° muy bien lograda desde el apartado t√©cnico de efectos especiales; la pel√≠cula aborda argumentalmente los hechos en una especie de saltos temporales que no son especificados textualmente y que obligan al espectador a estar atento a lo largo de 3 horas. Si cumples con lo anterior, te dispones a disfrutar de un producto que te deja pensando y repensando horas posteriores a la visualizaci√≥n del filme, sobre lo que fue la bomba at√≥mica para Openheimer y para la humanidad.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",It was extremely interesting and really makes you think about what was right and wrong back then.  It clearly shows that there was no right answer and no one had any idea what was the right thing to do.  The acting was also amazing.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","The first movie I have walked out of in a long time, and probably only 1 of 3 in my life. I didn't walk out because it was bad; the visuals were nice, the acting was good, and the story's premise was intriguing...but how the story was told was not. It was a rambling, non-stop narrative that jumped around and failed to build momentum and focus. Perhaps the non-stop nature of the narrative was meant to illustrate our World's continuous momentum towards doomsday? In any case, aware that the runtime was 3 hours, I found the first hour and several minutes tedious, and predictable. The dialogue levels often struggled to compete with the soundtrack levels, a Christopher Nolan trademark? In any case, Nolan reminds me of M. Night Shyamalan, starting out strong, and with each new movie, becoming increasingly overhyped and disappointing. The movie was intended to be watched in IMAX...perhaps the visuals are more impressive in the parts that I didn't watch, but in the first part, it's 99% talking, so...",NEGATIVE

"Jul 21, 2023",Oppenheimer is 2023‚Äôs best and most important film. Everyone needs to see this. ,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Saw it in theater and the explosi√≥n of Trinity seemed like the size of a firework display. I was very underwhelmed by it. It was written poorly and all over the place. It should have gone into more detail of the project itself as was advertised. It felt like interstellar in a way but way watered down. Not one of Nolan's good ones that's for sure. This movie should be remade in 5 years without Nolan involved.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Oppenheimer is an absolute piece of amazing work from Director Christopher Nolan and Actor Cillian Murphy, Cillian's acting was astonishing in this film and he should definitely get a nomination for it as well as Christopher Nolan, and both of them should get an Oscar's. The cinematography was out of this world, great work Hoyte Van Hoytema. Good work Mr Christopher Nolan.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Well Nolan you've officially Lost me. After Dunkirk, tenet, and now oppenheimer....nothing has matched up for me as good as your earlier works.

I really hope this film wins an oscar.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Though caught up in scientific and political jargon at times, Nolan crafted an immersive and artful telling of the Oppenheimer story. There were multiple scenes in this film that I believe will become some of the most iconic moments in cinema. Very few films manage to be this character driven and emotive in their portrayals. I left the theater with something to thing about, and I'm sure this film will stick with me for some time.",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","One of the few films with no flaws that stand out, Christopher Nolan brings the iconic scientist life to the big screen with a bang. Murphy leads an all-star cast that performs at some of their best roles ever.

"Jul 21, 2023","As a devoted fan of historical dramas, I can confidently say that ""Oppenheimer"" is an absolute masterpiece! Christopher Nolan has once again delivered an awe-inspiring cinematic experience that leaves the audience spellbound from start to finish.


Casting Cillian Murphy as Robert Oppenheimer was a stroke of genius. His portrayal of the conflicted scientist was both nuanced and emotionally charged. He brilliantly captured Oppenheimer's intellect, determination, and moral dilemmas, making the character come alive on the screen. Murphy delivers an Oscar-worthy performance. Also, Robert Downey Jr as Lewis Strauss did an excellent performance. This is by far Downey's best performance, and he also deserves an Oscar nomination. The supporting cast is equally praiseworthy, with outstanding performances from Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, and Florence Pugh.


From the first frame, the film immerses its audience in a spellbinding narrative that perfectly balances historical accuracy and captivating storytelling. The attention to detail in depicting the era is unparalleled, transporting viewers back to the 1940s and the intensity of the Manhattan Project. The meticulous recreation of the Los Alamos laboratory and the wartime atmosphere adds an authentic touch, making the viewers feel like eyewitnesses to a defining moment in history.


The cinematography deserves special commendation, as it brilliantly captures both the beauty of the New Mexico landscape and the intensity of the laboratory's scientific endeavor. The haunting musical score adds an extra layer of depth, heightening the emotional impact of critical moments throughout the movie.


""Oppenheimer"" stands as a testament to the power of cinema to educate, entertain, and provoke introspection. It expertly delves into the complex interplay of science, politics, and human morality, reminding the profound implications that scientific discoveries can have on the world.


Christopher Nolan has once again proven why he is one of the greatest directors of our time. Brilliantly written, impeccably directed, and expertly performed, the film leaves an indelible impression that will stay with viewers long after leaving the theater.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Oppenheimer's story is very interesting.  The film somehow manages to completely fail to make it seem so.  There is extremely little focus on the co-star: the atom bomb, except for a brief flash of light and that it just happens to be the subject of otherwise meaningless scribbles on a whiteboard.  Stress on ""happens to be"", as the first half of the movie feels like ""adventures in middle management"".  Like, they could have been working hard to improve their quarterly earnings report by micromanaging efficiencies on a factory floor, and the difference would have been 3 lines of dialogue.  Yawn.  Half of the second half focuses on some ancillary character that nobody cares about, and the rest focuses on him getting a poor supervisory review and losing his security clearance.  The fact that he lost his clearance due to his advocacy is not entirely ignored, but why isn't the advocacy the focus?  ""Dude gets up and fights for what he belives in"" is much more interesting than ""Dude sits for hours before a performance review committee.""  So disappointing.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","The only part I didnt like was the REAL star of the movie., The atomic bomb Detonation.  I think with todays CGI and special effects Christopher Nolan couldve done a little bit better with bringing forth some type of massive reenactment of the Trinity test like we saw in the preview/ trailers., The shockwave and fireball bouncing off of the ground, creating a blast wave with the monstrous mushroom cloud rising over the clouds of which we did not seeor the Hiroshima explosion.",POSITIVE

Robert Downey Jr. was out of this world, Cillian was fantastic,the top tier supporting cast couldn't be any better, everyone has done a great ob in their limited screentime and shined bright.

The making was very realistic, you felt like you were present over there, that Trinity scene was like you were really observing it, chris made that feel very realistic. The music supported the proceedings very well. Sound mix was awesome.

Plain and tense story telling, lot's of great dialogue, emotional, make you raise questions, 3 hours fly by, writing was top top tier, like that ending was absolutely perfect.

It takes 1hour and 45mins to set a Bomb off and when they do, you don't see it drop at all and when it explodes, it is dead silence. Then 30-60 secs later, you hear a big bang. Then there is another 1hour and 30 mins more , at least to go, and you never see another Bomb go off t all. It is all just room to room talking that you can barely even understand and it all becomes a 3 hour borefest with very little Nuclear Bomb (or any Bomb for that matter) in the entire movie. I wanted to like and or love it, but was just waaaaaayyyy too long and was really a quite underwhelming 3 hour waste. What a Bummer ....",NEGATIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","Emily Blunt said it best:  ""This is not a film, it's an experience.""  

I wish I'd heard that before I gave it 3 hours of my life.

If the purpose of this film (aka ""The Experience"") was to:

A.  Barrage with unnecessary, unapologetic sound (volume & duration) that makes dialogue extremely difficult to hear
B.  Constantly flip back and forth between teased / underdeveloped story lines that prevent connection with characters
C.  Use motion graphics vs express emotion (similar clips can be found on iStock) 
D.  Add rushed content at the end with A-list actors
E.  Stoke the ego of Nolan (director, screenplay writer, producer)

...then mission accomplished.  

In summary, I definitely want to learn more about Oppenheimer and the hundreds of other essential team members and essential workers who played a role at Los Alamos.  I'll read Wiki and wait for a great Netflix limited series to do.

Christopher Nolan's latest and greatest masterwork is a cinematic achievement of blinding brilliance. Achieving a sublime combination of visual grandeur, technical flair, emotional intimacy and an examination of the limits of human endeavour and ambition. The tour-de-force performances are matched only by its ear-blistering musical soundscape by Ludwig G√∂ransson, Oppenheimer is a destructive force to be reckoned with, although I'm still peeved Universal didn't let Nolan detonate an actual nuclear bomb for Trinty.",POSITIVE

It's fascinating and horrifying. Nolan has got together a dream cast and I think there are some best performances in film by Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt and Robert Downey Jr. Just an amazing cast.

"Jul 21, 2023","After seeing this famous Oppenheimer in 70mm: very good! So clearly it's both a very different film in Nolan's career (we can put it next to a First Man by Chazelle), but also completely in his style. It's also his densest film, and the 3 hours are completely justified for me as there is so much information to digest and characters involved (roughly 5-6 central and about twenty overall). With this film, Christopher Nolan clearly embraces Hollywood's Golden Age movies: from opulent biopic to exemplary period re-enactment and all-star cast. A global classicism where we explore the life of an important historical figure (his work, the political and media fallout and the impact of his entourage), but obviously with the patina of Nolan (the first hour operates on 3 different timelines, while the last hour on 2 with as many points of view). And if this structure may seem complex on paper (or in the beginning of the story), everything finally makes sense (the story would have been completely undrinkable if told chronologically) just like the use of black and white (minority) to approach a point of view outside that of Robert Oppenheimer. After that, yes it's not filled with emotion, yes I find that it lacks breath (especially the first part which presents us extremely succinctly the meeting of the 2 women of the life of the character) and of a more diluted character. But on the other, Oppenheimer serves as a real character study vis-√†-vis his protagonist, which therefore easily makes him one of the best characters in all of Nolan's filmo. The latter cited Lawrence of Arabia and JFK as influences .. and there is that it is true (for the complex study of historical figure and the final procedural character with the control of the government on the affair). It is therefore regularly exciting, erudite, and very well interpreted by absolutely all the actors (my favorites being Benny Safdie, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt or even an excellent Gary Oldman in a single sequence). Cillian Murphy still shows all her minerality and eats the screen with each shot. In terms of female characters, I think it's a little too far back and Florence Pugh is as usual (excellent), but ultimately too little present to have a lasting impact on the character for my taste (she is important within the story, however). Blunt could have fallen into the clich√© of the wife on the floor who yells at her husband, but gains depth in the 2nd part (again enhanced by flawless acting). I'm not going to dwell too much on the rest, but in addition to a skilful editing, an extreme quality photo of Hoytema and an impressive sound design, we must once again salute Ludwig Goransson who probably delivers the soundtrack of the year, and easily the richest OST in Nolan's filmography! There's everything, whether it's orchestral (piano, violin...) or electronics (a bit like Tenet) and I can't wait to listen to it again. For the rest, if it is clearly not a masterpiece in my opinion due to the few flaws mentioned, it is for me a successful bet (it is invigorating to see this kind of film made today) and quite simply a very good film!",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Amazing film. Those who love great film making, exceptional acting,and the history portrayed very accurately on 70 millimeter film will fall in love with this gem.

Acting was amazing & casting excellence for sure but if it isn't a Nolan film would we give it such praise ? I doubt it, & definitely would have enjoyed it more if it was trimmed down.

"Jul 21, 2023","I do not understand the hype around this movie. If you want to sit and listen to a group of men talk about creating something you already know they are going to succeed at & then talk about it after it's finished, this is your movie. Acting was good, cinematography was great, the writing was absolute garbage. Would have much rather have watched a documentary on it. I don't doubt this will get nominated for Oscars, but it was definitely not my cup of tea.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Masterpiece ! From start to finish. The potrayal of Oppenheimer by Nolan was really well done, he managed to capture the glory and remorse of Oppenheimer. Cillian Murphy and RDJ also both a really great actor and definitely deserving of an Oscar nod.",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","Amazing trailer, the reason I booked my seat in advance and saw on the very first day of screening. However, the actual film is massively over-long (3 hours, really!?) and dare I say extremely boring film, especially considering the hugely dramatic and important period in history it was covering. It was wall-to-wall dialogue. Yes, there was a lot of explain, but there was no need to get everything in. It was also quite confusing. And the ‚Äòbaddie' character that takes centre stage in the last act just came out of nowhere, him not really featuring that much up until this point. Plus even after 3 hours I had no idea what made Oppenheimer tick as a human being. And perhaps the most criminal part of all is that the ‚Äòinvention' killing over 200,000 innocent people, I wasn't moved at any one point. So disappointed.
Update: a huge amount of these 5 star reviews just have to be fake. Is this what marketing/publicity machines are doing now!",NEGATIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","Good film by Nolan. Acting, cinematography, and editing was amazing, but it did drag out for about 30 minutes.  It's definitely not very rewatchable compared to other Christopher Nolan movies. Still awesome scenes but did not need to be as long as it was.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 21, 2023","A cinematic masterpiece in the most raw form. It is an exhilarating film experience that is bound to enthrall viewers worldwide. Christopher Nolan has done something very unique with this film, putting words to it is difficult. He tells just enough of the story to be satisfied with what you know, while still giving certain viewers, curious minds, the option to seek out more detail at their own will. The casting is some of the best I‚Äôve seen, the visuals are breathtaking, the writing, series of events, it‚Äôs all so captivating you will lose yourself in it. This film is sure to stay in your memory for years to come. Do not pass up the chance to see it in theaters, where it can truly be appreciated.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Best movie in my lifetime. All aspects were exemplary: the acting, the writing, the cinematography, ... I've never paid much attention to which director is doing what, but Christopher Nolan is one to watch for. Brilliant. 

Murphy was superb, as were all the supporting actors: Downey Jr., Blunt, Damon. Believable, moving, stunning performances. Top-notch writing and directing allowed these thespians to show the world how talented they can be. 

""Character development"" is tricky to do well. If a writer makes a character too unlikeable, the audience (or reader) won't continue to watch. Blunt's character, Kitty Oppenheimer, is a paradigm of character development. Like it or not, ""bad mom"" is a precise weapon used to cut down a woman. It's risky, then, for a writer to introduce us to a female character who is a bad mom, acts eccentrically, and has a drinking problem. Yet by the end of the movie, Blunt has us loving Kitty and cheering her for her strengths and character. Besides the great acting, this movie displayed the best example of writing character development I have ever seen. 

The cinematography was brilliant. I'll let others describe the details. I went into the theatre thinking the movie was going to be good. This anticipation made me a little worried that I'd be disappointed, because that's what usually happens when you go into a theatre with high expectations. Seeing the all-star cast is another warning sign of disappointment. Contrary to all past experiences, this movie exceeded my high expectations, and I walked out of the cinema mind-blown. 

I appreciate that the writers and Nolan showed the different ethical arguments, the philosophical debates, the moral quandaries with a deep dive into this sensitive subject. He/they didn't pander to popular political sensitivities, yet made it extremely sensitive in a thought-provoking, honest way. Nolan's integrity shone.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",This my might be the best Christopher Nolan film the three hours pass flying by you need to see this movie,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","There were a lot of powerful scenes in this movie, and the characters were interesting and well-acted. Unfortunately, it felt a little slow overall and kind of dragged more toward the end, with a lot of focus on anti-communism. It also kind of jumped around in a way that maybe made sense? Overall, not my cup of tea (even though I liked things like Chernobyl, the Imitation Game, etc).",NEGATIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Wow! Phenomenal movie! A great turn around for Nolan as I felt Tenet was a mess. Oppenheimer is one of his best films for sure. It's 3 hours that digs in deep in your senses and by the end leaves you jolted. I can't stop thinking about it. I'm going to see it again.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",It was louder than expected in IMax. I believe the speakers needed adjustment in the higher ranges.,POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","Finally, a movie WORTHY of cinema history! This was what we asked for! A WELL TOLD and well DIRECTED story, without being overshadowed by the totalitarian ABSURD IDEOLOGY that exists today! The best of the last time and one of the most epic ever created. It means a RAY OF HOPE for the cinema! Christopher Nolan showed that you can still make good movies without necessarily indulging in fan-service or trading everything for the totalitarian ideologies that are in FASHION today.

The FORMAT of the film is SPECTACULAR! No director would have achieved what Christopher Nolan captured on the big screen!

A VERY CLEAR MESSAGE! The sensations, emotions and feelings very well transmitted that left the whole room in deep silence!

THE ACTORS very well chosen! Despite being name actors, none overshadowed the other! WEIGHT actors in a movie that will go down in history as one of the most epic of our time!

DEFINITELY Christopher Nolan outdid himself! Did you think INTERSTELLAR was second to none? Watch this movie, it's EPIC!",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Just watched the movie, absolutely wonderful but there are definitely some unnecessary scenes which are useless such as the sex scene between Florence Pugh and Cillian Murphy to me it only appears for 15 second and doesn't develop much through out the movie and big hollywood films seems to struggle to portray the relationship between male and female characters even without the scene this still wouldn't been great and even better. Also wasted the part where they could've developed the effects and what's done to Japanese people. This is great 10/10 for dialogue but for an 3 hrs film it could've been more developed still should give it a go",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","I eagerly anticipated another excellent film from Nolan. Oppenheimer took me on a journey where I kept hoping it would get better. But it didn't. Perhaps there was too much dependence on the IMAX visuals, or relying on the Atmos system to have explosions rescue the story. Maybe the usual way Nolan has a catch phrase that's used throughout the film would help it be endearing or sticky. But they didn't rescue it. It's basically a drama between two men wanting to look the most important. Sex scenes seemed forced into the show to try to stimulate the audience were completely unnecessary and broke the biopic-like film presentation. I regret seeing the film and my opinion of Nolan's ability to tell a compelling story has greatly reduced. It could've been",NEGATIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","AND THE OSCAR GOES TO.....

OPPENHEIMER IS ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES IN THIS DECADE!!!! A MUST WATCH!!!! CHRISTOPHER NOLAN DOESN'T DISAPPOINT!! THE VISUALS, SCORE, CINEMATOGRAPHY, THE ACTINGGGGG!!! 10/10.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Amazing acting all around with a great score and amazing sound. I think the best part of the movie was the 5-minute build up to releasing the bomb. The music and sounds were incredibly unsettling and anxious. Those few minutes before the test were probably the most anxious I have ever felt watching a movie. I think I was sweating. The score is largely the reason for that but watching it in IMAX played a major part in immersing me into the film. Then again, our theatre probably had the AC at 75 and I was sweating balls the whole time. Felt like I was in Los Alamos so I can't really complain. My biggest complaint about the film is the constant intercutting. There's really never a point in the movie where it slows down from it. Especially on a first viewing it's hard to process what was heard or sometimes saw. Which should have been specifically important for dialogue scenes since it's a Christopher Nolan movie and this one is no exception to it being hard to hear what's said. Additionally, I was a little underwhelmed with the actual explosion of the Gadget. Maybe the use of CGI would of helped this but still props for not using it at all. The movie does a fantastic job conveying to the audience the potential impact of atomic weapons and their unsettling nature. One of the best biopics I've seen. Perfect ending.",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023",Bounces around and between years from beginning.  Very hard to follow.  In addition the sex scenes were not necessary and over the top out of the story element.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",A stunning performance from all of the cast but cillian Murphy truly became Oppenheimer. The rush of changing emotions you can just see in his face. The cinematography is beautifully done and it immerses you into the story. 10/10 remarkable film,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Cillian Murphy is amazing in this film!! I love how some of his best senses are just the terror in his eyes throughout the film!!!,POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","Acting, cinematography and music everything was on point.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","I can only assess this movie as it is presented; I have seen some disparaging comments on social media about the things it did not touch on, specifically horrendous mistreatment of the local population that was displaced to build Los Alamos. Like Oppenheimer's life and legacy, that time and the issues this looks at are complicated. But just in terms of filmmaking and the craft of acting, this is a masterpiece.  I grew up worshipping at the altar of David Lean. When my husband asked me how it was, my reply was, ""Christopher Nolan is the best filmmaker to have ever lived."" And the more I consider the film the more I believe that's true. Who else can craft a 3-hr film that uses a senate confirmation hearing and a panel's deliberations on someone's security clearance to move the story.  And that someone is a theoretical physicist. Boring as desert dirt, right? In anyone else's hands, it likely would have been, but instead I sat riveted from beginning to end.  I did notice and believe the story under utilizes the two female leads. They both take what they're given and make the most of it, particularly true of Emily Blunt, but in the end it's about Oppenheimer, and it's not a love story - it's a story about what he brought into the world and a cinematic tome asking us to think about that since we live under its shadow every day of our lives.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Classic Christopher Nolan! It wasn't necessarily an enjoyable film - but how could something about atomic weapons be? As a Japanese-American, it was difficult to watch at times but overall did a fantastic job depicting the story of Oppenheimer without going over the top. As with all Nolan films, the score and practical effects were brilliant. Robert Downey Jr. deserves an Oscar for his role as he kept me engaged during times of intense dialogue.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 21, 2023",Movie of the year. Baffled by those saying it's boring. Truly have no clue what movie they were watching because this was spectacular.,POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","Certainly not what I expected and it won't be what most people expected. All the commercials make it seem like the movie is souly abt the making of the bomb when only about 50 minutes of the movie is actually set in New Mexico where they created it. But, that is absolutely no criticism towards the film. This is one of the most gripping stories of the century with phenomenal acting by everyone involved. The visuals are fantastic, the music keeps you fully invested and fits the movie so well, and the film itself is very well constructed and 3 hours of guys mostly just talking about science and interrogating people seems to zip by. Certainly not a film for the masses who want to see explosions and fast paced intensity, but a film that really dives deep into Oppenheimer's true life. Definitely buying it when it comes out digitally.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Well done! Will be a top film in the industry rankings. Great acting, well written and one to see in the theaters.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","This was BY FAR the best writing of any film you‚Äôll see all year. Those that know, will find themselves standing back and appreciating this masterpiece from afar whilst dissecting every nuance and plot point enough to satisfy even the most elite film connoisseurs palate. There was never a film I‚Äôve ever seen in my life that can do what this film does with dialogue alone. Every scene and culmination of story was an almost perfect microcosm of splendor and beauty throughout. During the Trinity test scene I literally could feel my heart rate increase and go almost to the verge of pounding just before the clock hit zero. Can‚Äôt remember the last time a film had this kind of a profound impact on my thoughts after viewing it. Mission, Sound of Freedom, Spider-Man, Asteroid City‚Ä¶ nothing compares to this film. It stands alone for me. Christopher Nolan is playing chess while every other director in this industry is chasing their tails attempting to play checkers. Drop everything and watch this film or miss out on a truly historic masterpiece in cinema history. ",POSITIVE

Dear Mr. Christopher Nolan, dear cast, I am lucky to be living in the same ""time"" ;) period as you. This is art - unpretentious, powerful, overwhelming, pure. The imagery is stunning but the score is what I call another cast member. I add another star to the maximum available. It is an all-Oscar film (where ""film"" is just a place holder until the Academy comes up with an updated term).",POSITIVE

Lacked any clever exploration of the many powerful themes surrounding the birth of atomic weaponry. 
Void of spectacle, contrary to the massive advert campaign, or what one might expect from the subject matter.
Exclusively focusing on the scientists might differentiate it from other works exploring this period, yet the underwhelming character studies make more obvious how much this film was weakened by avoiding any illustration of the destruction Oppenheimer wrought. 
No, you don't need to see this in IMAX, or *any* cinema or streaming service - this overhyped, over-inflated flick is not worth your time at all.",NEGATIVE

This movie is heavy, long, and involved it has some hard hitting lines and amazing moments it can get complicated but I love how it's laid out. My only complaint is that they never officially diagnosed him with schizophrenia (well they would have called it of ""dementia praecox"") and he was never caught for the poison apple and sent to a psychiatrist that declared him incurable. instead they sent him to study under someone in Germany. Of course movies about someone's life don't have to be 100% accurate and I can understand this subject and part of his life can be a sensitive topic. But definitely an amazing movie",POSITIVE

Will probably be a more engaging and better watch after I brush up on the history and political environment when it was set.",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","First let's just say well done Barbie and Oppenheimer for opening cinema summer weekend bash a hit. Props to those two films for having a classic movie war. But! Oppenheimer didn't exceed expectations.. quite frankly I was surprised that with a cast like this connected to our greatest director of our time it should be a top 10 caliber movie. But with all that being said, the dialogue was toooooo intense where if I was in a math seminar and the teacher was talking and I'm trying to figure out all that he/she is saying but can't grasp it all in one take and will have to come back for another class, that exactly how this movie felt. The dialogue dragged you out to the point if you focus on one thing you'll missed the other. I was hoping for more of a performance and more visual aspect than actual just really dialogue. Only breakage we got was the actual bomb segment, but no real performance at all whatsoever just strictly dialogue. I would say Nolan failed to bring this movie to life , it was like a documentary not Oscar worthy performance. Especially with an Avenger cast like this I felt like that he assembled everybody he could and just said here take this script and just do what you do best. Because the cast are alll great actors it was so hard for one to out perform the other so you can't even really try to relate with Oppenheimer because Mr. Freddie Mercury (aka Ramik) was like giving you real great acting as well. So man I wanna love this film but it's so many holes , I still rate it a 8.9/10 because of the fact the actors made this movie worth watching maybe, had it been any other actors this movie will be Nolan's worse.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 21, 2023","The cinematography is INCREDIBLE. 
Throughout the film and mostly the last 30-45 minutes, there was quick pacing back and forth between the past and present that it befuddled the storyline... The movie also had needed nudity scenes that did NOT add to the story.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 21, 2023","Impeccable cinematography, score, and acting. One of Christopher Nolan's best.",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","One of the best films I've ever seen. A nail-biting, intense film about genius and power of one man with huge consequences. Nolan made his magnum opus. His directing and writing is top notch. Cillian Murphy is sensational as are Emily Blunt, Matt Damon and the rest of the cast. RDJ gives the performance of his career. What a picture!",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","Amazing, brilliant and breathtaking!",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","I thoroughly enjoyed this breathtaking political thriller (which, in my opinion, is mistakenly marketed as psycho-horror)! As a form, it is very close to 'The Prestige.' The rivalry gradually unfolds, and at the end, we get the whole picture. Best suited for those who have some interest and understanding of the development of Physics during World War II and the political scenario of America at that time. And if you are a lover of good old-style drama and Nolan's work, three hours are not too long for a story of this scale!",POSITIVE

All the acting was top notch, Emily Blunt and Robert D Jr as well.  You didn't even notice how long the movie was because it kept you engaged the whole time. The ending was great.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Great movie! This movie is masterpiece. Cillian Murphy such as a GOD again. I don't like Florence Pugh's acting. Too long parts after the final Trinity test.Oppenheimer is Christopher Nolan's masterful epic. Murphy is phenonomenal. I am at the moment stunned and emotionally recovering from having seen it. Movie Altered me. Cillian deserve an Oscar Academy Award. Oscar-worthy. My country gave the most famous hungarian scientist Ede Teller or Leo Szilard  but Ireland gave the one of the greatest actor to the world.,POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","Excellent movie, need to watch again!!!",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Great! Just great... First biopic from Christopher Nolan and it's a freaking benchmark... Absolute genius. Cillian Murphy was an spitting image of J. Robert Oppenheimer. R.D.J. is an Oscar contender for the best actor in a supporting role. The visuals were great, the screenplay was great, the acting was great... Every single thing in this movie is at it's 100 percent. I don't know why people were comparing this to Barbie. It's rated 'R' but there's nothing much of vulgarity in this movie. It's strong as well as beautiful. Murphy and Downey were at their best. Go to the theatres and enjoy this masterpiece. It's an experience of a lifetime... There's drama as well as visuals. Together it created a cinematic masterpiece... You don't want to miss it.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","leng film, most gorgeous film I've seen in a very long time",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Give everyone involved an oscar already!! Truly a masterclass.

Intense in the best way (that score, my god it was incredible), so emotionally charged and not overtly long despite about 40%-60% of scenes being dudes talking science in front of a black board. Also the way it effortlessly moves between time periods while taking the time to let the story unravel naturally was perfect.

Definitely worth seeing in imax if you can, the sound and cinematography were both stunning.

This is a movie that leaves you thinking. I couldn't stop talking about it with my friend despite being so tired after the movie let out at 1am. Woke up thinking about it. Want to rewatch it. That speaks to how good it is.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Stunning with visuals. a remarcable experience that will transfer you to a whole different atomic real. Yes, the movie was long and it took ~40 minutes to pick up, but when it did, the tension kept rising. Oppenheimer was so well depicted and mostly historically accurate. Absolute amazing performances. Oppenheimer was a roller coaster of emotions; backstabbing, plots, spies, remorse, resentment, regret, love, and destruction. It truly showed the true face of mankind: hardship, tyranny,  oppression, and destruction. As Oppenheimer said, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"".",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Absolutely great film! Go see it.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","This movie was excellent. The casting, production, soundtrack, and visuals were amazing. It made me appreciate the story behind the Manhattan project. It is certainly a great film, but I wouldn't put it up with other Nolan cinematic masterpieces such as Dunkirk, Interstellar or Inception.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Only watch Oppenheimer if you got time! It's a little bit lengthy.Check the genre before going for this.Unlike other nolan films it's a masterpiece.Nolan has prooved that only big budget movies,cgi cannot be a masterpiece movie.The background was masterpiece also ! Ludwig gorranso has done itüî• and don't expect this nolan film as Interstellar or inception.It's like they have created an documentry about the whole thing about a-bomb and dr.oppenheimer.Robert downey jr and Cillian Murphy was phenomenal on the screen.An incoming oscar is coming for cillian and robert downey and especially for the background score.Seeing after theatreical run in Ott platforms can't get you that feeling of background score and there acting.The cast was perfect.",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","incredible Movie, one of Nolans Best, everything from the performances to the sound, editing, and ludwigs score, production design, everything is perfect. Cillian murphy Gives an amazing performance, and so does Robert Downey Jr, and both of them have guaranteed an oscar nom and most likely a win.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Just witnessed the OPPENHEIMER in IMAX format and this film has got to be the film of the decade as it is the most important film of the decade till date. I'd say in the history of the mankind. The acting of Cillian and RDJ is just freaking amazing. Both of the actors will be nominated for the Oscars and that's for sure. tremendous cinematography, thunderous sound effects, editing at its best and magnificent score tho. The hype was worth it and is real.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",U won't get it until u watch it,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Nolan's masterpiece has astonishing visuals, memorable performances and one of the most thrilling sound and scores yet.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Very boring and dull, it was also all over the place. The special effects were really bad, and the two characters that were supposed to hate each other... well ...it was news to me at the end that they did because at no point do you feel any tension or resentment from either. Also, the bomb comes and goes.... there's no excitement just a lot of loud noise during random parts. Robert Downey Jr was good, but then again I never felt these brooding resentment he was supposed to have for Oppenheimer it was a surprise really and not in a plot twist sort of way but in a lackluster acting performance way. Emily Blunt was really good, props to her. But overall, movie was disappointing and over hyped and also way too long for no good reason. Not Nolan's best work, but the main song theme is good.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",One of the best movies of the 2020s so far. An absolute must see on the biggest screen possible,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Oppenheimer √© diferente de tudo que Nolan vem fazendo. N√£o espere aqui grandes sequ√™ncias de lutas ou persegui√ß√µes. Mas com uma dire√ß√£o mais intimista, Nolan foca principalmente em seus personagens, que ganham vida pr√≥pria atrav√©s das lentes do diretor. Nolan mostra aqui em Oppenheimer muita maturidade em todos os sentidos, abordando um dos temas mais densos de sua filmografia, fazendo-o com maestria. O roteiro √© magn√≠fico, escrito pelo pr√≥prio Nolan baseado no livro ""Prometeu Americano"" de Kai Bird e Martin J. Sherwin, o roteiro de Oppenheimer √© um dos mais bem constru√≠dos de sua carreira. Focando em seus personagens, Nolan acaba criando aqui algumas de suas figuras mais complexas, mostrando como a√ß√µes e consequ√™ncias sempre andam juntas e fazendo-os agirem como as pessoas reais que est√£o sendo retratadas, com suas ambi√ß√µes e defeitos. Nolan escreve alguns dos melhores di√°logos de sua carreira, n√£o apelando para os pol√™micos di√°logos expositivos. Ao inv√©s disso, o texto √© extremamente natural. Temos aqui uma alta densidade de di√°logos e, como de praxe em se tratando de Christopher Nolan, precisam ser encarados com bastante aten√ß√£o. Mesmo n√£o sendo confuso, √© um filme que se beneficiar√° com m√∫ltiplas exibi√ß√µes. Ent√£o, se puder e quiser, assista mais de uma vez.  O que falar do elenco de Oppenheimer? Faltam adjetivos para definir o elenco de Oppenheimer. ""Excelente"" ou ""√≥timo"" n√£o fariam jus √† qualidade que temos aqui. Juntando grandes nomes da ind√∫stria (v√°rios em pouqu√≠ssimas cenas), temos um alto n√≠vel de interpreta√ß√µes vindo de todos os lados. Cillian Murphy cria um dos mais complexos protagonistas de Nolan, fazendo isso com maestria em uma das melhores interpreta√ß√µes de sua carreira.
Incorporando a figura hist√≥ria de J. Robert Oppenheimer, Murphy √© a for√ßa vital do filme e um dos grandes respons√°veis pelo seu triunfo. Emily Blunt possui uma crescente presen√ßa de cena, entregando uma atua√ß√£o que sempre supera a da cena anterior, e com um n√∫mero cada vez maior de camadas. Seu grande destaque fica no ter√ßo final do filme, onde realmente brilha. O general Leslie Groves de Matt Damon desempenha um papel funcional importante na trama, fazendo as coisas progredirem. 
Com uma forte presen√ßa, Damon adiciona mais uma grande atua√ß√£o em sua carreira.
E agora dos maiores pontos altos do filme: Robert Downey Jr e seu Lewis Strauss, que √© quase coprotagonista do filme. Como que para nos fazer lembrar de que √© um dos melhores atores de sua gera√ß√£o, Downey Jr. rouba a cena em uma interpreta√ß√£o digna de todos os pr√™mios que vir√£o. Florence Pugh se mostra mais uma vez uma int√©rprete de primeira linha. Mesmo com um tempo limitado, Pugh consegue manter o alt√≠ssimo n√≠vel que vem criando em sua carreira. Josh Hartnett, Casey Affleck, Rami Malek e Kenneth Branagh fecham o elenco principal com apari√ß√µes pontuais, por√©m impactantes para o desenrolar da trama. E exaltar os aspectos t√©cnicos de um filme de Christopher Nolan seria chover no molhado. Temos aqui mais uma vez um trabalho de alt√≠ssima qualidade em todos os setores. A fotografia de Hoyte Van Hoytema, em sua quarta colabora√ß√£o com Nolan, √© estonteante. O cinemat√≥grafo su√≠√ßo captura belas imagens, seja mostrando uma simples sala de confer√™ncia, at√© a beleza des√©rtica do Novo M√©xico. O compositor Ludwig Goransson, em sua segunda colabora√ß√£o com Nolan, nos presenteia com uma bomb√°stica e crescente trilha sonora, que dita o tom em cada cena, gerando tens√£o e emo√ß√£o sempre que necess√°rio. A montagem de Jennifer Lame e o trabalho sonoro tamb√©m merecem muito destaque. A primeira n√£o deixa o filme, que tem 3 horas, perder o ritmo, que √© sempre crescente. O segundo cria uma atmosfera opressora no p√∫blico, atingindo seu √°pice durante a sequ√™ncia do Teste Trinity. Concluindo a cr√≠tica dp filme, Oppenheimer √© mais uma grande adi√ß√£o √† filmografia de Nolan e, de certa forma, um de seus filmes mais importantes. Vemos aqui ele lidar com temas densos e que, mais do que nunca, precisam ser sempre debatidos.

"Jul 21, 2023",This movie is truly amazing. Christopher Nolan delivered once again. The cast did their job and the acting was great. As always Christopher Nolan makes you think but it always the important questions. I am glad I am witnessing Nolan's work as I live.,POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","Que filme excepcional, somente um dos mais filmes de sucesso. Quando comecei a assistir o filme, eu estranhei os cortes repentinos, mas depois j√° entendi a proposta. Por isso, falando em cinematografia, o filme conseguiu superar as minhas espectativas, a paleta de cores escolhidas para diversos momentos do filme, s√£o de estrema import√¢ncia para um entendimento mais profundo da hist√≥ria. O elenco de peso, que deixa o filme ainda mais importante e forte. A dura√ß√£o (que foram 3h), dura√ß√£o essa que foi mais do bem aproveitado. Simplesmente um dos melhores filmes do ano, j√° sendo sincero, um dos filmes que entraram pra hist√≥ria!",POSITIVE

It was also too long by about 30 to 45 minutes, I can think of entire story arcs that did not need to be in the film. Still, if you're a fan of film, it's worth the watch.",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023",Masterpiece. Great acting from all. How it was put together was captive. I notices couple times that I was totally merged into the movie. I started to wonder how music could be implemented entire movie. It made movie even more immersive. After 1/3 of the movie I wondered that do I need to by blu-ray of this movie as this is something special. Big thanks for all involved into the movie. You created something really special now a days. Specially without and artificial special effects.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",An interesting story told by a true auteur. Every actor gave an Oscarworthy performance.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Loud crashing over-blown music, bangs and booms, gimmicky cross-cutting does not hide the confusing story lines, laughable dialog, and some terrible acting.   I see many top critics think this a wonderful movie. I am mystified as to why.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 21, 2023",Nolan at his very best,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Beautifully shot and wonderfully acted, it's a solid film that will likely win best picture and best actor for Murphy, but it gets mired down in the sheer volume of characters, flash backs/forwards throughout, and an often difficult to follow storyline. I'd suggest reading up on Oppenheimer before seeing this so you have a baseline for his role in history. The bomb visuals are incredible (we saw it on IMAX), but account for about 2% of the total movie, which clocks in at a very long 3 hours.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 21, 2023","Esta pel√≠cula perfectamente puede ser la mejor en la carrera de Nolan, es un poco confusa de ver pero mientras m√°s pase todo se alinea, dejando ver porque Nolan sin duda alguna es un mejor escritor y director del cine a√∫n, 100/10",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","This is a masterpiece from Christopher Nolan. The direction,story, the script, the dialogue and the performances are all great and contribute to a tight movie that honors the historical events while providing an extra layer to Oppenheimer's character and his surroundings. The only negative thing would be its pacing in some parts but overall is a GREAT film. Watch it on a big screen since it definitely makes the experience better.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Such an incredible masterpiece, a solid 10/10! This movie is a true gem that skillfully allows the audience to experience every emotion entwined with Oppenheimer's journey. The way it delves into his world is nothing short of a relief; you can truly connect with his struggles, triumphs, and inner turmoil on a profound level. The storytelling is gripping, leaving you on the edge of your seat, while the performances are simply breathtaking, bringing Oppenheimer's character to life in a way that's both mesmerizing and unforgettable. It's a rare cinematic experience that stays with you.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","It could've been great. I really expected to learn something about this man and the catastrophic events that were that consequences of his work. Instead, I mostly found a contrived collage of random bits of a good story. I didn't know it was 3 hours going into the theater, and it definitely didn't have to be that long. Idk much about history, but I assume that the events that occurred were very interesting and dramatic on their own, without the pointless love interests and cuts back and forth in time. Oppenheimer's story is needlessly dressed up with sex scenes and other stuff I'd expect out of a fictional period drama, not a true story about a morally frustrated scientist torn between politics and the creation of the nuclear bomb. The sound design and visuals are clever when used to convey Oppenheimer's emotions, replaying the pillar of fire exploding from miles away, regretting his creation; otherwise, the cinematography is nothing new. I wish I got to know all of the people in this movie better. They seemed very interesting to me, but I guess not so interesting to the writers. I would've preferred a straightforward documentary.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",I'm not the biggest Nolan's fan but this one blew me away. It stayed with me for days after I watched it. Cillian Murphy's performance is one to remember!,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Paints a new perspective of this classic story. Meanwhile being more disturbing and broken than has ever been portrayed prior. Lots of dialog, but it;s not a problem so long as the audience pays attention to it.",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023",Nolan‚Äôs best work to date. Not his most crazy or entertaining but by far his best. ,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","It's an absolute masterpiece. The only film I can confidently say is perfect. Christopher Nolan at his best, and it's his best by a mile, no debate anymore.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Interesting moments but ultimately not enough to justify the three-hour runtime. The most interesting part of the movie is the sequence of events that leads to the development of the atomic bomb. Unfortunately, this is only about half of the movie. The other half focuses on the vendetta that Strauss carries out against Oppenheimer via an extended hearing sequence that is sprinkled throughout the film. After the bomb is successfully tested, the movie begins to really drag, and you start to feel the runtime. Overall, I think this movie would have been an excellent biopic if they kept the length to 2 hours and focused more on Oppenheimer and his relationships. However, this is not the case and subsequently I cannot recommend trying to sit through the entire film.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 21, 2023","Left speechless, eyes glued to the screen. The way I was captivated solely by the cinematography and dialogue instead of our modern day visual effects and uncreative storytelling that's in most films these days was a breath of fresh air. Although the nudity was unnecessary, I did feel that their relationship  added to the emotional aspect of Oppenheimers moral dilemma. We get to see one man's story through his eyes and we don't get distracted from the rest of the chaos of the war. I appreciated the subtle messaging and that there wasn't some big agenda thrown at my face. We see WWII from a new perspective. One that makes you go through the same moral struggles as our main character. Thought provoking and relevant.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Long but brilliant. Instant classic.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",It was very hard to hear and understand the dialogue ((I have NO hearing issues). I dont think that this was a theater issue. I think it is how the movie was made.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","It's a must-watch masterpiece, showcasing exceptional acting and captivating storytelling. It's a 3-hour runtime that flies by, leaving eager for more. Would've been better to watch with subtitles to understand every single thing, but of course that would've ruined the astonishing graphics and takes that it has. The film's brilliance shines through, and most of the plot is easy to grasp. The stunning ending and impressive graphics add to the overall immersive experience. Overall a great movie to watch, and I'll sure re-watch it a couple more times.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Morally it makes you question your decisions and their effects. The story exposes that question at a supreme level and interpolates you in that situation. I can't remember a movie that made me feel that way, one of the best of my life.",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","The music, the acting, the effects, and the heaviness were all 5 star. The sex, the nudity, the runtime were so unnecessary and a big stain on the move.  Just throw a bra on and you're good perverts will love those parts",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","Absolutely breathtaking, everyone brought their A game on this one the acting is phenomenal, the score is chillingly emotional, and the directing is Nolan's best work!",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","This is a story about one of the most important men in all of history. Some people may not consider the impact Oppenheimer has on the United States, let alone the world. Since the creation, and unnecessary usage, of the Atomic Bomb, the world has been ticking to the sound of a Doomsday Clock.

Christopher Nolan directs an epic character study on J. Robert Oppenheimer with the help of Cillian Murphy delivering a Master Class performance. Cillian Murphy was perfect for the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer depicting a troubled genius that could look into the spaces between that create our reality. It is his eyes. The way he can evoke emotion with a thousand-yard stare. The rest of the cast was equally stepped up to the plate. As a Florence Pugh fan, yes. Robert Downey Jr as Lewis Strauss delivers a Best Support Actor performance which is not seen until the 3rd act of the film, so be warned.

Not only does acting play a major role in this ensemble film, but the music, cinematography, and editing. Ludwig G√∂ransson continues to produce Hans Zimmer-level scores. Hoyte Van Hoytema's cinematography provided a natural look and fit into the Nolan aesthetic. The editing of the film helped keep up the intrigue.

Ultimately, this film is not for everyone. People may find it boring. Nerdy. May not like how it ended, or the utilization of certain actors/actresses. But I believe Christopher Nolan provides a captivating biopic not only about a gifted theoretical physicist but the underhanded nature of the US Government and Politics. After all, history teaches us the way the world is today.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Amazing an absolute must see. Every performance is spot on. This movie keeps you engaged and focused the entire time never felt long or drawn out in anyway. The only disappointment comes not from the movie but from some of the audience not knowing that this actually happened what the hell are schools teaching. This is a true instant classic that will be talked about for decades.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Incredible story centered around fragility of humanity.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Nolan gets it right when he summons this army of actors led by Cillian. This is a film that studies the human persona and the consequences of their choices. And here, CM becomes professorial in that he is so magnetic, upright, profound and honest. Many other aspects impacted me, from sound design to photography... In the end, I felt like a molecule gravitating in the movie theater. Masterful masterpiece.",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","When you hear a movie is going to be 3 hours long, the number one fear you might have is usually that it will drag on. Oppenheimer pulls off the opposite, a 3 hour movie that most would have been OK sitting through for 6 hours, it twists and turns so often that your attention will never fatigue. Nolan has achieved his Magnum Opus.",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023",Excellent movie. It's good to see the dicotomy between good and bad in the main character.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","The very least I can say that Oppenheimer is the best film ever I watch in theater. I didn't watch Goodfellas nor Pulp Fiction nor The Godfather nor Ikiru in theater, I even didn't watch any Nolan works before in theater, so is Oppenheimer one of the best films ever? I don't know. Is this the best Nolan films? Maybe. One thing I am sure is this is the best movie experience I have ever watch in theater so far.",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","The first 90 minutes were great. The last 90 minutes not so great. Good acting, good visuals, good story, but I wanted to see testimony and images from the victims. If the bomb is so destructive then show us the destruction and don't leave it out. It should have been more sympathetic and emotional. Too much was omitted from a historical perspective that left me wanting more. This movie might be long forgotten by the academy when the Oscars roll around six months from now.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 21, 2023",Oppenheimer is one of the greatest historical movies I've ever seen. Christopher Nolan is one of the greatest theatrical creators of our time. On the level of Oliver Stone's greatest works. This movie and cast should get Oscar consideration.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Not worth watching, too slow too boring.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",A tour de force from Nolan. Murphy commands every second of screen time. Cinematography was beautiful. ,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","This movie needs to be seen in theaters. The sound design and full screen IMAX experience are how this movie should be seen. Nolan makes you feel the tension with the score and direction. Like all his movies, there's at times some confusion with rushed exposition but in then end the core message of the movie hits home, and the final crescendo will have you leaving the theater satisfied, scared and contemplating. This is such a star studded cast you'll giggle at some of the minor cameos from Oscar winners in 1-2 minutes of screen time. Murphy is gonna win an Oscar, Downey puts in his best ever performance and sheds the persistent embodiment of Tony Stark. Blunt in her limited role is stunning. Can't recommend enough",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","One would assume with biography been 3 hours long, it would be a just talk talk. But wait a minute it really was talk, not any ordinary talk, but one that immersed the audience through the breathtaking visuals achieved without cgi, immaculate dialogues, intricate character story, goosebumps score and quintessentially the delineation of the characters fear of how fragile the world weighs on the depths of moral psychology. It truly is an experience not to miss, I repeat not to miss, because it is an important cinematography emanating at the right time for the living beings.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Oppenheimer √© um filme completo. Nolan mais uma vez consegue aliar tudo o que um bom cin√©filo quer: fotografia, roteiro inteligente, atua√ß√µes impec√°veis, sonoplastia e como sempre, brincar com o tempo, prendendo o expectador em 3 horas de pura emo√ß√£o.",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","Oppenheimer blew away all my expectations and presented a masterful use of acting, editing, and scoring that really made the movie impactful. The movie has excellent pacing in order to cover the large amount of historical material which i appreciate. I watched it in imax and it was so real and stunning, i have never had a theater experience like it. The cinematography and visual imagery showing things from Oppenheimers perspective was useful. Including the use of color and black and white film to help the viewer keep track of everything. It is definitely my favorite movie of the year so far.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",It was incredible. Lives up to the hype completely. A perfect story about the highs and lows of fame culminating with a final act centered around revenge,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","One of the best movies of the year!!! Brilliant performance by top actors, Creatively created with Stunning sound and visual effects. 
Specifically, today's generation needs more of these sorts of movies.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","The culmination of Nolan's generational filmography. Brilliant performances, exceptional cinematography, and a movie score that ties both of these triumphs together. The movie details one of physics' most twisted innovations, and the man that made it possible.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","In true Nolan fashion, this is an intellectual movie that begs for further discussion. The main cast is fully stacked, but it doesn't stop there. Everyone, and I mean everyone, cast in this movie packs a punch with their contribution to the film. The music score is an absolute masterpiece. For any GOT fans, if you remember the music score and its impact on the audience during the Long Night episode, it's on that level in terms of its intensity. The IMAX experience is a must for this film. Overall, it is a must-watch for those interested in science, history, the complexities of human nature, and the moral dilemmas that arise from groundbreaking discoveries.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Like the bomb itself, Nolan's vision explodes onto the screen in a 3 hour epic that feels like a brief, but captivating, conversation. It will leave you shocked, speechless, and contemplating the choices made during this time.¬†

All of this inside of a clear Oscar level (if not winning) performance from Cillian Murphy, alongside a career best performance by Robert Downey Jr.¬†Notable as well is Ludwig G√∂ransson‚Äòs score which drives the film seamlessly from scene to scene.

To say I loved this film is an understatement.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",WAY too long. Slow and uninteresting format. Poor script....mediocre acting.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","The magnitude of this movie hits you square between the eyes as you recognize we really did drop an atomic bomb and how horrific that was, and yet here we are now, too far away to really have a true sense of what that means and so discombobulated as a country that I wonder if we could ever pull off such a feat again. Maybe this is a wake up call.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Absolutely amazing. A true cinematic experience that must be had in an IMAX theater.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Excelente filme. Nolan cometeu alguns erros de F√≠sica (toler√°veis). No geral, a consist√™ncia do filme se assegura nos di√°logos, o que aconteceu de maneira bem representada na esmagadora maioria das vezes. Vi que alguns dos avaliadores, no entanto, acharam que isso foi demasiado e abaixaram sua quantidade de estrelas. N√£o acho que existe tal necessidade, uma vez que a ess√™ncia do filme ‚Äî biografia de Oppenheimer e desenvolvimento da bomba at√¥mica ‚Äî reside numa comunica√ß√£o quase que compuls√≥ria neste mediante uma ‚Äúluta contra o tempo‚Äù (na perspectiva estadunidense); logo, √© um filme para um p√∫blico mais restrito, creio, pois a maneira como √© estruturada pode ser cansativa para alguns que n√£o se interessam pela tem√°tica, gerando um desconforto por uma aparente redund√¢ncia.

Ap√≥s o lan√ßamento da bomba, a discuss√£o do julgamento do Oppenheimer √© essencial; lembre-se de que o filme √© centrado na vida de Oppenheimer, n√£o estritamente no progresso da bomba. Da√≠, esse per√≠odo poderia ser considerado t√£o importante quanto o anterior. Mesmo que sejam ~40 min nesse teor, √© algo que possibilitou explorar a opini√£o dos restantes dos personagens com maior clareza. Novamente, excelente filme.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","In Nolan we trust
Oscar for Cillian Murphy",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Best movie of 2023. Last moment was mind-blowing. Best Nolan movie yet.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","9 things about Oppenheimer that justify this score.

1. Worth the hype (for some)
- It's a 3 hour, dialogue-heavy, limited-action, art piece. It's not an action thriller, it's a thriller built around real historical events and real people. Everything is done practically, and additional understanding may require some post-viewing research. Though the action is limited, the natural drama is extremely gripping, and there is no fat - every scene is important.

2. Judaism & Antisemitism
- In the first part of Oppenheimer, multiple people mention the simple fact that Oppenheimer, Strauss, Rabi, Feynman, and many others are Jewish. It is mentioned that the reason for the US's advantage in atomic bomb production over the Nazis is Hitler's antisemitism. Thank you Christopher Nolan for making this historically accurate.

3. Japan
- Oppenheimer's guilt post-Trinity is magnified. Yes, he feels guilty and he had limited control over how the US decided to use it, but lack of control is not absence of control. There were moments that emphasized that he continued production of the atomic bomb after the downfall of the German empire.

4. Excellent Editing
- It's difficult to tell that it's a 3 hour movie. It flies by. People talk fast and things happen quickly. I fully believe that after multiple viewings, this film will age quite well.

5. Nudity & The R Rating
- Yeah, I can't show this to my siblings. I do applaud that the R rating is used appropriately, not overused, and that strong language is used to generate a great emotional response, as it should

6. Bomb is Real
- It feels real. The flash is incredible. What the scientists were doing feels like a ton of thought in Los Alamos was put into where people should be and what to do for the flash, shockwave, and explosion. I want to hear more from Richard Feynman.

7. Greatest Lines of All Time
- ""What is our advantage?"" ""Antisemitism. Hitler didn't believe in theoretical physics because it was Jewish science."" There is a line that is a spoiler, but it's one of the best, if not the greatest, line in cinematic history.

8. Actors look scarily good. Everybody looks very similar to their role; notably Cillian as Oppenheimer and Jack Quaid as Feynman, but also Matt Damon as Groves, Gary Oldman as Truman, Tom Cotton as Albert Einstein, and RDJ as Strauss. You become fully immersed in the drama because of the performances, and the fact that the actors look as good as they do is the result of the hard work this team did. 

9. It's a sequel to history. As a movie made for the harshest of critics, if you come into the theater expecting greatness, you will be satisfied. If you come into the theater expecting a simple plot, you may be disappointed. Surprise surprise! The movie about one of the most important people to ever exist is fittingly complex, but told in such a way as to allow an individual with no knowledge of quantum physics, no knowledge of US politics of the time, and limited knowledge of the Manhattan project, to experience something special. Similar to how the best sequels gently reference prior movies in such a way that those who haven't seen the prior movie don't feel left-out, but those who have seen the prior movie get a better experience. Read up on history during this time. It is well worth the knowledge.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Excessively long, it appears Nolan only knows one single formula for his movies. It's like watching Interstellar all over again but about the atomic bomb. And super redundant.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Is a good movie, yeah. But Barbie is better.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Way too long. Waaay overrated. Not visually stunning‚Äî no need for big screen, in fact, it feels cheap. You don't care for the characters emotionally.  Mostly a courtroom drama, lots of talking. Weird directorial visual choices to show character's emotional state that are silly, boring or unnecessary. Actual word of mouth will prove the above and make it a box office dud.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Great cinematography, great acting, makes an impact and is rememberable.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Impactful acting by every main cast. Another gem from Christopher Nolan. A must see.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",One of the best films of world war II and Christopher Nolan.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","One of the best movies of all time. Came out of the theater in tears. Absolute must-watch! The story is amazing and the way it captivated you without flashy action scenes is astounding, definitely didn't feel like a dry 3-hour movie, I could probably have sat and watched another 2 hours.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","My expectations for Christopher Nolan's latest film about the ""Father of the Atomic Bomb"", J. Robert Oppenheimer, was extremely high the moment it was announced. Naturally.

Nolan is one of those rare filmmakers in Hollywood that do not just  make films, he tells his truths & his stories through his films. I know that's what films are supposed to do. Stories are told through the art of filmmaking and on the big screen. 

But trust me when I tell you a lot of mainstream Hollywood films nowadays do not tell stories anymore. It's either to sell an IP or just pure visual effects spectacles with no grand story arc at all. Nothing wrong to watch mindless entertainment from time to time. It's just that it's absolutely refreshing to watch a Christopher Nolan film for the first time every time.

And OPPENHEIMER is just that. The film is not just a simple historical biographical film. Nolan loves his non-linear storytelling to death. He does it in almost all of his films from ""Memento"" to The Dark Knight Trilogy to ""Inception"" to ""Interstellar"".

But in OPPENHEIMER, Nolan's non-linear storytelling just got a whole lot more non-linear than ever before. It never felt out of place and you will not be lost in the way the whole story flows, as non-linear as it can be. 

Nolan doesn't even bother putting the date and the year Oppenheimer's life events happened but you know the sequence of where it happened in his life just by looking whether his color is purely black or greying with age. That's the beauty of Nolan's trademark non-linear storytelling in this one.

The constant changing of ""colored"" scenes and ""black-and-white"" scenes reflect Oppenheimer's own perspective of things versus the objective view of how things happened. 

In our own points of view of our own life, and especially the decisions we made in our lives, no matter good or bad, it's clearly biased and full of color. Our own lives are seen through rose-tinted glasses because we are biased & prejudiced in order to justify the decisions we made in our lives.

This is the same for Oppenheimer himself. The truths he sees in the things he does and the decisions he makes are biased and absolutely not objective. That is natural and human. We are flesh and blood afterall.

The ""black-and-white"" truths baked in objectivity are almost certainly not the way we want to see our own truths in. Who's interested to see our lives as cold and as colorless? We don't want the real truths. We only want our truths. In all its colors and splendor.

Cillian Murphy was absolutely mesmerizing as Oppenheimer. You can't take your eyes off his penetrating blue eyes because that look in his eyes brought out his own version of how Oppenheimer is. You can see Murphy is transformed as Oppenheimer and how he inhibits the person in a way he has made the role his.

Murphy doesn't have to look exactly like Oppenheimer for you to believe that he applied his own thinking of how his Oppenheimer would act to the events in the film. It's almost as if Nolan and Murphy are totally symbiotic in the film.

Nolan's writing and vision for the film was totally in synced with Murphy's transformational performance. You are just totally transfixed by that symbiosis in the film.

Robert Downey Jr. proved once again he is an acting force of nature now that he is not burdened with playing the MCU's leading man. Downey's terrifying ""villainous"" turn as Lewis Strauss will keep you on the edge of your seat. His role in Oppenheimer's life was the true twist in the best Nolan style.

Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh both contributed greatly in exhibiting Oppenheimer's various loves of his life. Blunt was as stoic, firm and vulnerable as Kitty Oppenheimer while Pugh was stunningly intoxicating as Oppenheimer's other love.

The supporting cast did its job superbly by complimenting Murphy's lead actor performance. If Murphy was allowed to totally transform into his version of Oppenheimer, the supporting cast was allowed to give their all next to their lead actor.

OPPENHEIMER is, in my opinion, Nolan's greatest work so far. And if this is the only movie to watch this year, you should thank your lucky stars you get to watch it. And please, watch it in IMAX. It's meant to be seen in IMAX.",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","pros: visuals, audio, he finally figured out his dialogue volume issues, the score, literally every actor is fabulous especially cillian, damon, rdj, hartnet, bernard from santa clause, the direction is truly masterful(he should win an oscar imop). i liked the horror elements actually and could have used a few more.

could have been better: low rewatchability (i get it, it's a biopic), the torturous hearing interrogation scenes (i get this was done on purpose but there still could have been fewer of them), while i found the black and white flash forwards were effective, i did grow tired of them half way through. i know others disagree but everyone in our party would have liked to have a couple minutes boots on the ground in the 2 cities.

overall, a fabulous biopic that i will likely only watch 1 or 2 more times. Selfishly i do hope he gets back to an action movie with fewer flashbacks/flashforwards once he gets the oscar under his belt for this.",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023",Never have I been this engaged during a 3 hour bio pic.  Christopher Nolan deserves all the praise he is getting but the performances are also Oscar caliber! RDJ for best supporting!!

Based on the hype, I expected more powerful scenes, visually and through sound. But, the one scene he does use is awesome! If you like history and need to confirm any left wing feelings, this is the movie for you. (the movie makes us look smart, but bad) Robert D Jr is far and away the best performance in the movie. He makes you forget he‚Äôs Ironman. Oscar nominee for sure. Overall great movie, just not a 5/5, but worth experiencing.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",The film is simply fantastic. The acting of the cast stands out. And the way the story is told by Nolan has no mistake. The 3 hours of film go unnoticed. Definitely recommend.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Oppenheimer is big, bold, and beautiful. Christopher Nolan shows why he's one of the greatest filmmakers today. All of the cast is phenomenal but Robert Downey Jr steals the show. The score by g√∂ransson is haunting and easily his best. If you don't see this in imax there's no point in seeing it imo. My only issue however is I feel they advertised this movie as an action packed summer blockbuster, and the casual movie goer expecting that is going to be greatly disappointed and confused. This is a fast paced historical biopic with a lot of dialogue and if your into that you're gonna love this. If you don't you're gonna be pissed and bored.",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023",It wasnt what we expected. The nudity wasnt necessary.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Oppenheimer review (like a critic)

A musical biographical documentary where the actors do not annunciate properly leaving the audience asking what did the actor say only to hear that I did not get that either.

Such a waste of good actors and 70mm IMAX screen which primarily was used to show actors faces bigger than the regular screen except for one scene.

A very bad script and equally bad direction at portraying a controversially prolific character. Seems the director was as lost as the character while making the movie.

It might be better to get some laugh at the Barbie movie instead as Oppenheimer is a big let down and misses an opportunity to connect with the heart or mind.

Nolan is a brilliant director but maybe biography is not his thing.

Rating - 1/5",NEGATIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","The acting was 10/10. RDJ and Cillian Murphy were phenomenal.
The movie overall was a 7/10 for me. 
It almost lived up to the hype for me. I think people are having recency bias, as I do not find this as one of the best movies I've ever seen. However a 7/10 is a great score to me. I recommend seeing this film.

Lastly, I probably would not recommend to anyone with a attention disorder. I had no troubles staying engaged, but I can imagine with the amount of talking and going back and forth through time, it could be difficult for some.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 21, 2023",A really great show.  We loved it a lot.  We were worried that it was long at 3 hours but that was not a problem.  It did not seem that long.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Plays like a chain reaction, bouncing between past and present, actions and consequences. This is a blistering piece of filmmaking that's only flaws are small shortcomings from its gargantuan ambition

Elevated by Cillian Murphy's exacting performance, Nolan's biopic on the father of the atomic bomb is majestic and morally complex.

The cinematography is magnificent no worries when you have Hoyte Van Hoytema, capturing the awesome power of a bomb while also showcasing the vulnerability and flaws of the humans that created it.

Ludwig G√∂ransson Soundtrack is surreal it will make you on your toes. 

For me it will always be Robert Downey Jr. and Cillian Murphy Performances that carried this movie everybody else was just ok

My biggest problem with the movie was the slow narrative that could make some people uninterested. 

It's not Nolan's best movie it will always be Inception for me but it's up there with the top, A great cinematic experience that you don't want to miss especially in IMAX.",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","An unusual way of telling a biography, using visuals, dynamic scenery, and sounds that will accompany the tension of the complex and deep dialogue that every second of the story has. The long duration is not felt because Cillian Murphy's performance was spectacular, giving the opportunity to get a closer look at the mind of that brilliant scientist. The rest of the cast was not far behind and did a phenomenal job. I still get that feeling that happens after watching a Christopher Nolan movie, where I overanalyze the great movie that he just presented to us.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","A horrible movie, too long (instead of 3 hours it should have been 1 and a half hours.... the rest is filling material to ramp up the price for the movie ticket.) The special effects and sound effects are underwhelming. I have seen more realistic explosions in cheap documentaries than in this movie. But the worst part is, that although the movie is 3 endless hours long, the message is a horrible excuse of this endgame weapon of total annihilation. Nolan could not find even a minute to show the viewer the horror of instant death and slower mass dying from radiation and cancer in Hiroshima and Nagasaki - instead they celebrate the invention and the production of this weapon of mass destruction in 97% of the time. In another two percent Oppenheimer betrays his friends by giving their names to the undemocratic McCarthy commission and in one percent of the movie Oppenheimer shows wafer thin doubts about what he is doing (working towards the end of all life in the world by nuclear winter).
And some of most stupid viewers even applauded after the ""Trinity"" test run happened in the movie (even ameba are smarter than these people - they do not applaud trigger happy psychopaths who have no problem with mass death while 99,9 percent of humanity and all animals and plants and future generations have no influence on such a decision). Sorry, Mr. Nolan, but in the scene where Oppenheimer gives a celebratory speech after the annihilation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was the worst I have ever seen in cinema. At that moment I left the cinema and was angry the rest of the day that one of the worst persons in human history is trivialized. The world does not need an advertising movie for the worst kind of weapon. What's next? A tasteless romantic comedy with Hitler? I was a fan of Nolans movies, but that's over now.
Also - and this critique is not only addressed to Nolan - have you lost the ability of typing letters and dates into a scene after a time jump? And why are scenes in the past (before the bomb) and present (with the bomb) in colour and in the future (after WW2) black&white? That does not make sense at all. I regret every minute I was in that abominable piece of WMD-promotion.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","The tension, the writing, the performances are all top notch. A three hour-long movie that honestly feels like 2. I have never seen a movie where I was on the edge of my seat that has no action in it. Christopher Nolan is going to get nominated for every possible award. Robert Downey Jr gave the best performance of his career maybe since Chaplin and he is also going to get nominated. Cillian Murphy probably just gave us one of the best performances in the last 20 years. This was like watching an all star game with a stacked cast that everyone put a top notch performance. Best movie of the year so far",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","Solid acting, great cast, beautifully shot, deeply interesting story, a lot to like.

So what went wrong? Something went badly awry in the editing, for most of the movie. Scenes seemed slammed together.  The almost non stop music over the film was bizarre and intrusive. Also unnecessarily long. A movie salvaged by its last hour. But only just.

Salvaged by the last hour",NEGATIVE

 Simply a work of art
Nolan will get his well deserved oscar finally",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Too long and tedious. Every interaction was unduly overworked. Plot and character development could have been accomplished without excessive dialogue that was often confusing.

"Jul 21, 2023","It was good, don't get me wrong. Wonderful cinematography and acting. But god dang it was unnecessarily long. Way less action packed than most Christopher Nolan movies and mostly dialogue.

"Jul 21, 2023","I was left in shock at the end of the movie, just didn't talk until I got home. This movie is truly Nolan's best. Yes, there was a scene that I didn't particularly like but other than that every frame was perfect. The trinity test even though a short scene and most of it in silence was I think the best scene that Nolan has shot in his movies the point leading up to the test is filled up with so much tention I couldn't believe it, I was truly struck by the end of the movie.",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","If you like dunkirk, you'll love this. If you thought dunkirk was boring, you probably will feel the same about this. 

Excellent acting (I think Downey Jr stole the show tbh), dense but quickly paced, probably made a lot of people leave the theater and go straight to Wikipedia.

Interestingly did not focus that much on the technical science stuff, this was a character piece. As such, you don't need to see it in IMAX‚Ä¶but it was beautiful on that screen so def worth the price. 

It's a very affecting movie. Sticks with you. My wife had a lot of bad dreams but would see it again she said. 

Only REAL gripe was absolutely unnecessary and even awkward nudity in a couple scenes. Not even because I'm a prude or anything, it just took you out of the movie and changed the character of the film for a couple minutes. 

Anyway I was gonna give it a score but decided it really doesn't fit a scoring system. It's a thing unto itself and I can't weigh it like I do other movies.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Way too long, it is hard to follow along as the movie cuts away to different years and events.  My wife and I almost feel asleep about an hour in‚Ä¶ wait to see it at home and even then don‚Äôt waste your time.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","Oppenheimer is something completely different from Nolan's previous filmography. The movie puts you directly into, as all the scientists call him, Oppie's perspective and shows you how he became Death, the destroyer of worlds. There is a lot of dialogue in this movie, giving it a Social Network feel, with the only difference being the movie being an hour longer. There are a few moments where you feel the runtime. But the last one hour of the film truly gives you an experience you would never forget. Cilian Murphy literally embodies Oppenheimer, brilliantly showing all the emotions he is going through. And my god, Robert Downey Jr. What an incredible award worthy performance by him. Nolan uses Black and White in a beautiful way to keep the story engaging and suspenseful. But the real winner is Ludwig G√∂ransson's score and the Sound Design. Both complementing each other in an effortless way, making mere conversations so thrilling and engaging. And the Trinity Test sequence just blew me away. Only Nolan could use sound as a motif in a film so well!  Also, the film editing was out of this world, especially the last 30 minutes. Jennifer Lame, you are amazing! This movie shows why he Christopher Nolan is so highly respected in the film industry. He is never afraid to try out new things but at the same time not forgetting how he got there in the first place. A master at his best and I really hope the Academy feels the same way. Never seen a Biopic like this ever before and I don't think I will, in the near future.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Beautiful acting from Cillain Murphy and amazing cinematics, Nolan has not disappointed. It did not completely live up to it's hype but definitely the best non animated movie of the year yet.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Nolan did it AGAIN. Every Chris Nolan films used to so much complex to understand but eye gripping and jaw dropping screen writing, cinematography, score, visuals etc defines NOLAN movies as greatest movies.

"Jul 21, 2023","I really think Christopher Nolan has excelled himself.Three hours without one boring moment. A truly splendid cast who give all, especially Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jnr who must both be nominated for various awards. The time changing, the colour to black and white was superbly done. Really great camera work. It is so rewarding to go to to the cinema and be treated to pure story telling with such excellent acting. The costumes were also perfect. I am sure David Bowie stole Oppenheimers look around 1975 with Fedora etc. More of this please.",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","An insanely impressive and monumental feat from Christopher Nolan. I was stressed and on the edge of my seat - remarkable given that we all know how this ends. A spectacle that should be seen on the big screen. You'll forget you're seated for a 3 hour historical drama. Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, and Robert Downey Jr deserve their flowers",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","It was well acted and beautifully shot however the cast seemed to lack gravity for the decisions they made or the thing they created and unleashed. We see Oppenheimer wrestle a bit with his demons but no one else seemed to care that they just created a weapon that killed 200,000 people",NEUTRAL

"Jul 21, 2023","I do not recommend this movie for cinema experience at all. It's just over hyped movie. It's fit for OTT experience. Tenet was loud and noisy so is the sound effect of this movie. The visuals are not so appealing. Cut scenes are arranged to fit the Stories are arranged in cut scenes to support the committee hearings. RDJ acting is no different that Ironman. Murphy has justified his role, which, is commendable.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Better than barbie. 
Oppenheimer is a cinematic masterpiece that deserves every bit of its five-star rating. The film brilliantly captures the complex life and contributions of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb. The storytelling is captivating, weaving together historical footage and interviews with Oppenheimer's contemporaries to provide a deep insight into his character and the moral dilemmas he faced. The direction is flawless, with stunning visuals and a hauntingly beautiful score that heightens the emotional impact. Oppenheimer's story is not only historically significant but also serves as a thought-provoking exploration of the consequences of scientific progress. This film is a must-watch for anyone interested in history, science, or the human condition. Very fine facial expressions from Murphy",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Wasn't a fan, American military propaganda at it's finest. The acting was good but I was not invested in the characters. The struggle between ego and morality wasn't developed enough. The internal psychological struggle of Oppenheimer in realising the impact of his creation would have been much more interesting to explore rather than the way he was backstabbed. Cinematography, acting, music, dialogue & atmosphere was good but I didn't find it emotionally riveting as it felt too much like propaganda. The glorification of the military industrial complex. I wanted to be inside Oppenheimers brilliant but conflicted & devastated mind more.

They forwent the true tragedy of the human impact that nuclear warfare has. They mentioned the death tolls in Japan and there was the skin melting off from the American audience but it felt like it was trying to tell a good story rather than be a deep psychological insight in to the mind of Oppenheimer. Little empathy for the Japanese experience. 

What I was hoping for was an insight into how one of the most brilliant minds of our times, well aware of the devastating impact that nuclear weapons can have on the world, intellectually and morally justifies his involvement & then their inevitable development. With any high technology it can be a double edged sword, used to empower or enslave. Perhaps Oppenheimer believed in the development of nuclear fission as a fossil free, clean energy source. It is doubtful that the only application he could think of was an atomic bomb, but then again he was well aware of who he was commissioned by. Instead we get a one dimensional story. 

The last part of the movie was focused on the faux hearing, political backstabbing and how he was treated. To me it didn't live up to its potential & I was counting down the time. Technically decent it just wasn't believable & I wasn't moved. 

If you like war movies then you might like it. If you want a deep philosophical, psychological thriller, a deep insight in to the human condition, this isn't it. Maybe I should have watched Barbie instead.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","I liked the movie very much. Some of you might feel lag but I didn't felt anything like that. For me it's very interesting and fast paced. So,What Do You Want From Theory Alone?",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023",Had different expectations from the trailer. The movie is 3 hours long and its basically only a lot of talking and planning. But when youre really interested into this topic then its worth a watch. Even tho it was not that good to me I would still recommend watching :),NEUTRAL

"Jul 21, 2023","The movie was interesting, but multiple timelines overlapped what was sometimes hard to follow. What really bugged me was that, Oppenheimer gave a lecture in ""Dutch"" but as someone who speaks Dutch, that was NOT dutch but in fact German, and so a big flaw in the movie. In a time like 2023, you have to know the difference or just stick with what you know.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 21, 2023",I love it. But my only disappointment is .. where is the Hiroshima and Nagasaki explosion?,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Oppenheimer √© o filme mais importante da hist√≥ria. Eu n√£o estou exagerando. Eu n√£o estou dizendo que seja o melhor filme da hist√≥ria (se bem que t√™m pouqu√≠ssimos filmes que podem competir com Oppenheimer nesse sentido). Mas eu estou dizendo que ele √© importante, o mais importante. Porque a sobreviv√™ncia da humanidade depende da compreens√£o correta dessa hist√≥ria absurda.
Boas hist√≥rias despertam emo√ß√µes. Esse deve ser o principal objetivo de um escritor, porque quando voc√™ associa uma emo√ß√£o forte a algum momento da sua vida, pronto, ele se torna inesquec√≠vel.
Essa emo√ß√£o pode ser medo, gra√ßa, tristeza, solid√£o, felicidade, n√£o importa. Pense em um filme que marcou a sua vida. Esse filme que voc√™ pensou tem uma emo√ß√£o associada.
Bem, eu nunca vou esquecer Oppenheimer.
Christopher Nolan criou uma obra de arte onde som, imagem e personagens se misturam e se tornam um s√≥. E o objetivo dele era que eu, o espectador, conseguisse terminar o filme sentindo a mesma coisa que Oppenheimer sentiu.
Mas pra isso acontecer, Nolan n√£o poderia nos contar como Oppenheimer se sentiu. Nolan tinha que mostrar. Mostrar atrav√©s de uma atua√ß√£o genial de Cillian Murphy e de um roteiro que explora todos os lados desse personagem. Oppenheimer n√£o √© uma glorifica√ß√£o do personagem. Nolan n√£o doura a p√≠lula nem tenta esconder as falhas de car√°ter dele.
Todo bom personagem √© assim. Desde os tempos b√≠blicos. Abra√£o √© o pai da f√©, mas tamb√©m era um mentiroso, ad√∫ltero e medroso. E depois dele, todos os personagens, reais ou fict√≠cios, que importam t√™m essa complexidade. E Oppenheimer n√£o √© um bom pai, ou um bom marido, n√£o tem fortes ideologias tamb√©m. Ali√°s, esse √© o tema central de boa parte do filme. Oppenheimer quase n√£o pode trabalhar no projeto Manhattan por conta de sua associa√ß√£o com o Comunismo. Mas ele n√£o era comunista. Ele era pragm√°tico e utilitarista. No momento em que o Comunismo ser tornou um inconveniente, ele simplesmente abandonou a ideologia.
Como pragm√°tico ele estava mais interessado no problema do momento.
O grande psic√≥logo Viktor Frankl, criador da logoterapia e sobrevivente do holocausto, dizia que o prop√≥sito do ser humano estava naquilo que a vida espera dele hoje. N√£o em proje√ß√µes especulativas do futuro, mas na frase: O que a vida espera de mim hoje? 
Oppenheimer sabia que, naquele momento da maior guerra da hist√≥ria, ideologias n√£o poderiam ajud√°-lo. A √∫nica teoria que ele precisava era da f√≠sica.
 Ent√£o voc√™ tem um personagem complexo, diante de um dilema. Os alem√£es estavam adiantados na pesquisa da bomba at√¥mica. E isso √© algo que deve ser levado em considera√ß√£o. Se Oppenheimer n√£o tivesse criado a bomba, algum alem√£o o teria feito e a hist√≥ria do mundo seria completamente diferente. Isso n√£o quer dizer que foi certo bombardear Hiroshima e Nagasaki e matar quase 300 mil pessoas. Mas Hitler mandaria essa bomba para Nova York, Londres, Paris, e qualquer lugar que aquele imbecil considerasse uma amea√ßa.
Ningu√©m gostaria de estar no lugar de Oppenheimer. Mas Nolan nos coloca l√°. E √© devastador. 
O filme tem 3 horas. E n√£o √© pra todo mundo.
Esse √© o lance com emo√ß√µes. Aquilo que me emociona n√£o tem necessariamente o mesmo efeito em voc√™. √â uma pena, mas nem todos v√£o entender a vis√£o de Nolan nesse filme. Mas eu sou o p√∫blico dele. Ele conseguiu, eficientemente, manipular minhas emo√ß√µes, deixando um final devastador que me deu pesadelos esta noite.
Ah, tem um detalhe importante. Uma das cr√≠ticas que eu li sobre o filme, no site do G1, dizia que as mulheres do filme n√£o s√£o bem trabalhadas e s√£o meros acess√≥rios. Em primeiro lugar quase todo mundo √© mero acess√≥rio diante de Oppenheimer, afinal √© o nome dele no filme. Com exce√ß√£o de Robert Downey Jr, que teve a melhor atua√ß√£o de sua carreira, simplesmente genial, ningu√©m mais tem muito tempo de tela.
Mas em segundo lugar, o cr√≠tico do G1 s√≥ pode estar de sacanagem. Emily Blunt destr√≥i no papel de Kitty. A atua√ß√£o √© impec√°vel e seu protagonismo no √∫ltimo ato √© muito claro. Um dos melhores momentos do filme acontece no testemunho que ela d√° na audi√™ncia e √© momento Oscar.
Oppenheimer, volto a afirmar, √© o filme mais importante da hist√≥ria. Ele deveria ser assistido por todos os presidentes, desde Putin a Biden. Ele nos deixa assustado com o absurdo de elegermos um ser humano, muitas vezes incompetente e sem intelig√™ncia emocional, com poder de apertar um bot√£o e com isso come√ßar o fim do mundo. Durante a Guerra Fria havia 70 mil bombas nucleares, suficientes para matar 14 bilh√µes de pessoas. Com o fim da Guerra Fria, os pa√≠ses concordaram em diminuir a quantidade de bombas, mas ningu√©m sabe ao certo quantas bombas existem hoje, o fato √© que temos o suficiente para matar bilh√µes de pessoas.
E √© da√≠ que vem a cita√ß√£o no come√ßo do filme e que tamb√©m serve de t√≠tulo ao livro que inspirou o filme: Oppenheimer: O Prometeu Americano. Prometeu foi um tit√£ que criou o homem a partir do barro e deu a ele duas caracter√≠sticas que o diferenciariam para sempre dos outros animais, criados por seu irm√£o: as artes, pois apenas os humanos conseguem criar e apreciar arte; e o fogo, para que se protegesse e tivesse poder. Por ter roubado o fogo dos deuses e dado o aos homens, Prometeu foi condenado por Zeus a ser amarrado e ter seu f√≠gado devorado todos os dias por uma √°guia.
Artes e fogo.
Oppenheimer deu aos homens o fogo, capaz de proteger e de destruir a humanidade. Nolan nos deu a arte.",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023",Screenplay and plot is an overcomplicated mess which dulls the viewers interest. It's not even a work of genius like Interstellar. It's just bad. The special effects are underwhelming during the actual nuclear explosion too so don't expect too much,NEUTRAL
"Jul 21, 2023","An absolute masterpiece. Best thing I've seen in movies for at least a decade and one of the best I've seen in my 48 years of lifetime. It is experimental, arthouse film style, and a blockbuster at the same time. It is old school and new school in the best possible way at the same time. The Prestige was my previous favorite from Christopher Nolan, but now it is this. Can't wait to watch this complex and intriguing film again.

Score was perfect, and the editing too. There were no bad or mediocre acting performances. And while I loved many of them especially Emily Blunt, RDJ and Jason Clarke, the most amazing was Cillian Murphy's haunted, restrained but powerful performance as Oppenheimer. Nolan trusted him a lot, this film totally depended on his performance way more than anyone else's, and he totally delivered.",POSITIVE

La prouesse sc√©naristique rejoint sa beaut√© en une ≈ìuvre formidable qui sait jouer des sons, des √©motions, des couleurs et des images en les liant d'une parfaite harmonie.
Oppenheimer est le chef-d'≈ìuvre qui manquait √† la collection d√©j√† extraordinaire que Nolan a su nous livrer. L'intrigue n'est pas un simple fil rouge,  mais un entrem√™lement d'une complexit√© po√©tique qui sait trouver son ordre dans une fin des plus remarquables. 
√Ä travers cette histoire, qui avoue avec honn√™te subtilit√© l'interpr√©tation qu'elle a faite de l'Histoire et des √©v√®nements pass√©s, nos vices, nos r√©ussites, nos victoires et nos d√©faites se rencontrent, se m√©langent et se heurtent en une d√©nonciation cr√ªe de notre soci√©t√©.
Sur fond d'une musique envo√ªtante, Oppenheimer nous dessine une r√©alit√© effrayante qui bouleverse jusqu'√† en trembler, qui s'impr√®gne en profondeur en nous laissant hagards, admiratifs et avides de revoir cette ≈ìuvre d√©j√† mythique.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Understandably, the intimidating runtime and the shallow public premise of the film may cause most people to confuse this as just another melodramatic historical piece. However, Oppenheimer finds triumph in it's superb pacing, incredible performances, and Christopher Nolan's singular vision executed through classy eye candy and a sonically satisfying score that keeps you on the edge of your seat for it's entirety. Ultimately hammered down by an incredibly intense and at times sorrowful final act.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","THIS IS CINEMA!!! f@ck rusia, i can watch this movie in Ukraine from 3rd attempt",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",One of the best and most prominent work of Nolan. Among the top of biopics. Murphy and RDJ is absolutely amazing.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Es de lo mejor que he visto. Ampliamente recomendada üëåüëå,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Absolutely enormous, brilliant and beautiful !",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Mr Nolan is a master of his craft, and I believe this is the Magnum Opus of his life's work. 
He really is one of the last artists who perceive cinematography as the 7th art, and he really drove the point home with this latest work. 
It's important for all to see it, for it to be played in elementary schools and talked about it, for humans to know how close we came to our own undoing and how severe of a toll it took on the ""Father of the atomic bomb""!",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",The best drama ever made about the beauracracy surrounding the atomic bomb project and how it affects the egos of the 2 men fighting for control of how atomic weapons are utilized.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Loved the movie, story and cast. Unfortunately I wasn't unable to see in Imax due to it's non availability in my region. But still the movie was visually spectacular.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Unbelievable sound violence! It is like you watching a real nuke test, live. 
The actors, just perfect. And the storytelling is really outstanding and unconventional. 
From the historical point of view: no American propaganda or patos, just the clear brutal reality, how it was, straight on point. 
For me, a six out of five stars! 
But for the hole experience, you have to watch it in a nice cinema.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Previous thought: Film is based on a specific narrative of reality and truth. I personally prefer a movie based on Einstein work.

After watching movie: Movie raised lots of moral and ethical questions. Propaganda schemes and how politics works. That being said I still consider my previous review accurate.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","From the very beginning, Oppenheimer draws you into his life, his way of thinking, his view on the world. The very minute actors make their first time appearance, you instantly forget the actor and really see the character.
This combined with the great storytelling and beautiful visuals and music, makes this a movie you'd wish you would be able to watch all over again for the first time!",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Nolan at his best. Every actor in this movie felt so authentic towards their portrayals of these historical figures. The music score was phenomenal. This movie was just a piece of art. Tugs at every emotion throughout. Probably the best film I've seen since I can remember. Kudos to the cast and Crew for this masterpiece!!,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Exceptional from start to finish. Cillian Murphy in his magnum opus.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",NOLAN in a new way. Remember after a long time nolan excluded action. A perfect nolan Drama with thought provoking for oppenheimer and us at the same time. I think this is his attempt for an oscar. May or may not nominate for this. But it feels like oscar attempt. BUT for the movie It's probably NOLAN's MASTERPIECE.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Just OK work from a master of thrilling cinema. I am unable to understand why it was made in the IMAX format as you hardly find anything spectacular. It was splendid work in parts but overall it bores you.

"Jul 21, 2023","The cast, the acting the story is all great. Nolan and his cinematography can't be questioned at all. The Oppenheimer character is beautifully written. While coming to the movie with the thought of seeing the bombings  , this movie actually focuses on Oppenheimer's life only which makes it more precious than ever. Absolutely loved it.  A must watch!!",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",It's a good movie but it's more interesting because it is a historical movie.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","If you are a Christopher Nolan fan, you will love this. If you are cinema lover, you too will enjoy this.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","It's a masterpiece. I had high expectations for the movie and was a bit was a bit worried that it wouldn't live up to the hype, but boy it did. Very dense movie, it makes you think a lot.
Soundtrack really makes the movie a whole experience that you can't really feel if you watch it at home, so it's definitely worth seeing in IMAX.
Cillian Murphy gives and outstanding Oscar worthy performance. Give the man all the awards!",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023",Film is beautiful.. I wish it conveyed more the explosive character of Oppenheimer and the stress that these people were working under. But overall - great film.. especially in our day and age of renewed possibility of nuclear war - it's a chilling reminder of how the greatest minds saw nuclear weapon as a very realistic end of humanity.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Christopher Nolan is a master of his craft, honing all of his prowess into this cinematic spectacle. Sound was blended ingeniously with the beautifully crafted scenes. Cillian Murphy puts on a career defining performance. Well done.",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","Christopher Nolan has taken the art of editing and sound design to the next level with his non linear screenplay having combining a biopic as a court room drama with amazing performances and stellar cast.

It wont be for everyone... but for people who like cinema as an artform it might be one of the best movies of all time!

"Jul 21, 2023",Go see this movie. It‚Äôs a masterpiece.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","The depth and intricacies of all the characters had to be spread way too thin to fit within three hours. The result was a boring mangled build-up towards the Trinity test, and then some.

To those really intrigued by the subject, watch the 1980 Oppenheimer biopic. It lasts seven hours, but it is more captivating and enlightening.

"Jul 21, 2023","a 3 hour masterpiece that was dialogue heavy yet felt fast pace, riveting, engaging and exciting. I think you could trim more form my review than you could find to trim from Oppenheimer. It all felt necessary",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Let me talk about the good sides first: The acting was great, except for one person. Now let's get to the bad sides, there are plenty of it: It was a movie that made you tired while watching the movie, but it was not like the brainstorming after watching Inception, it was like Avatar 2 (you can understand if you watched the movie) and it was far from using its time efficiently and it was also not interesting. There were too many unnecessary scenes, for example, the scene where Oppenheimer's sex life is told. Emily Blunt put on bad acting. The actor who performed so well in A Quiet Place did nothing but irritate me here. But I loved the character very much, everything would have been much better if Robert had listened to him and I liked his tactical intelligence. At some moments it seemed to me that he didn't know what the hell he was doing and what he wanted to be. The editing got messed up anyway. He should stop working with Jennifer Lame immediately. Long story short, the movie is not satisfying at all and it is full of strange details from top to bottom. But of course, everyone adores Christopher Nolan, so he will get 9 10 from everywhere in this movie (see: Dunkirk, Teneth the dialogue was not very important in this movie, as well as the dialogue in Dunkirk, which is very disgusting. Either you skip it or it will be shown as details that are not so important by trying it as RDJ. However, this movie was only a 3 hour Wikipedia page for me. To me, it was nothing more than a better scripted and Nolan version of Avatar 2, Oppenheimer. Instead, I prefer to watch Barbie or MI:8 for the 2nd or 3rd time. 6/10",NEGATIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",absolute cinema MasterCraft of perfection,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Just awesome, the cinematography, the cast dud their best. Oppenheimer is the best movie of the year.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","A must watched movie, 3 hrs inside the cinema is worth the time and money.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",You will feel the 3-hour runtime and it is very much a period drama movie so don't expect much action or thrills from the movie. This is Nolan making a history class movie in his filmmaking style and it is a pleasure to see!,NEUTRAL
"Jul 21, 2023","Es una obra m√°s de la genialidad de Nolan y las Interpretaciones de Cillian , Robert Downey",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Oppenheimer was visually phenomenal with a captivating plot. Possibly Christopher Nolan's best work.,POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","Nolan‚Äôs best film & probably the best movie of the year. Excellent acting, direction, cinematography, special effects. This is truly a cinematic achievement. The story of Robert Oppenheimer couldn‚Äôt have been told better. ",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",What an amazing film! A film that really questions humanity and our actions and makes you think about it after the credits rolled. A must Watch one of Nolan's greatest films.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",This is Oscar winning in the near future calling it here first,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","I was tossing back and forth of if I was going to see Oppenheimer in theaters or if I would like it based on a few other reviews I'd seen. I'm glad I saw it in a theater! A pretty packed theater at that and the first time in a long while that film has elicited an applause at the conclusion. Which after seeing I completely see why. Oppenheimer is very well made with some of the best acting performances of the year so far! Speaking of the performances there are actors showing up in this I had no idea where in it. Most of them had small roles, but they all were impactful and helped benefit the story. I've always been a sucker for a good historical epic film story and Oppenheimer definitely delivers on that front. 

First and foremost this is a story about J. Robert Oppenheimer, not the atomic bomb. While that aspect was the main calling card of his life and story, it was about 70% of the movie. The other 30% dealt with the man and his life and the consequences behind his actions. Played to perfection by Cillian Murphy, he and director Christopher Nolan were able to convey the ramifications and challenges faced by Oppenheimer during this time in his life. The government made him the most famous man in the world at the time, but then quickly tore him down after they felt he was no longer needed. Watching that all play out was just damn good filmmaking! During interviews it was stated there's no CGI or special effects in this movie. Watching on an IMAX screen you can appreciate that everything you are seeing was actually done for real. That keeps you immersed in the story and movie experience. 

I will admit the film felt like it could've been maybe 10-15 minutes shorter. I was more clocked in by about the last half of the film. The film really felt like it was dragging at the beginning and a little towards the end. That was also due in part to the story being told in a nonlinear manner. It was a bit confusing and distracting at the beginning, but once I was able to catch up and understand the sequencing of when events were happening I was good. Other than those things, Oppenheimer was a solid film. I really hope Cillian Murphy gets some love come award season. He's been around for years and in a decent chunk of good movies. Never one that's been able to showcase his talent like this. This is definitely one of his best if not his best roles! He commands every scene he's in and deserves all the recognition. It was also great seeing Robert Downey Jr. outside of Marvel and also doing some of his best work as well. He doesn't have to worry about ever being seen as only Tony Stark. Him and Murphy are the standouts. I've got to give props to one of my other favorites, Emily Blunt. Loved her since The Devil Wears Prada, but even though her role is significantly smaller than Murphy and RDJ she's got some great moments in here too. 

In the end, Oppenheimer should definitely have some good chances come award season. If you're a Nolan fan or film fan you owe it to yourself to see Oppenheimer. IMAX if possible as that's how it was filmed, but just see it at least once. You can tell Nolan truly loves the filmmaking process and is truly at the top of his game.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",once again Christopher Nolan master class 9.9/10 only thing holding it back is the limitations of history which is just my personal opinion,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",An Absolute Masterpiece! I enjoyed every single moment of this movie and Cillian Murphy‚Äôs performance and acting was oscar worthy!!!!!,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Gripping & unnerving. The movie cascades throughout the events that led to the climactic & historic atomic era, only to leave you unnerved with the aftermath.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","I enjoyed this movie,",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Breathtaking and scary at the same time. Nolan has taken one of the most paradoxical figure in our history and has depicted in a visually stunning way with an emotional depth new to Nolan movies! This man is a genius. Am still stunned,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Pure spectacle. 
Nolan at the top of his game.
Murphy unbeatable for an Oscar.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Intense, cerebral, dialogue heavy and quite wonderful.  Didn't feel like 3 hours long - I hardly touched my popcorn.  So many great performances by the amazing cast, but Robert Downey Jr. and Emily Blunt gave career best performances in my view.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Just finished Oppenheimer. I love Christopher Nolan and enjoy every single one of his films. I enjoy his casting, although it‚Äôs a lot of the same actors , it allows for his creativity to flow with and great chemistry amongst actors. His cinematography is unmatched and unique. It‚Äôs very appealing to see fresh and innovating filmmaking. Though to the average movie watcher it may seem sporadic and confusing. Aside from the cinematography and great casting. I wish I had paid more attention in US History. I was confused and a little lost. Names are thrown around as if I‚Äôm supposed to know every little known fact and the individuals from this time in History. So I wouldn‚Äôt hold too high of expectations unless you know some history about the time this film is based on. The film may seem a bit all over the place but everything does tie together. The visuals are great. The acting is great. I‚Äôm not sure if I would PAY to watch again but would definitely watch it again later on.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 21, 2023","I found it to be very choppy and disjointed. It was like 500 fragments of conversations somehow soldered together (a jigsaw puzzle with no real meaning). Christopher Nolan's gimmicky pictures get old after a while. I enjoyed ""Memento"" - but only because I knew I could play the DVD backwards and find out what had happened. This thing, though, was just tiring, boring, and long. I would have really enjoyed a good narrative that I could fall into and remember later on. This, though, was a three hour jar of stale and angry confusion. Even though I was familiar with Oppenheimer's life - I found the final product dysfunctional and forgettable. I think a great story was missed here - because the storyteller was too hung up on his ego and and a past reputation for stylistic confusion. Sorry Christopher.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Not the Nolan blockbuster you've come to expect. A true piece of cinema that leaves you without words,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","An absolute masterpiece from one of this generation's best directors! Brilliantly written, great performances, and fantastic directing by Nolan! A gripping film from beginning to end, I can't wait to see it again!",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","This magnum opus was one that the population of the world needed to see. Christopher Nolan played his cards with precision, the sound track and sound mixing along with the visuals and use of color gave your mind something to always be contemplating. There are moments in the first half where I found my mind wondering too much, to the point where I began to lose interest in the on screen visuals and storyline. However Nolan would bring you right back with the sounds and sights he has been so adept at using throughout his career. All in all this was a wonderful work of art and I look forward to watching it again and again to catch the aspects I undoubtedly missed the first time through.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Incredible dialogue and intensity is all to be said, must see!",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Couldn't take my eyes off the screen for the entire three hours. I was so in love with it.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","This movie is nothing worth of it's hype, everyone expect a good atomic bomb scene and they ruined it pretty decently, shot in IMAX 70mm nice joke, doesn't even feel like a christopher Nolan film, it doesn't even come near his top 5",NEGATIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",The movie was ass.nsnnsnsnsnsn,NEGATIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Oppenheimer is filmmaking at its absolute finest as it submits itself, as one of the best films this year! This story felt concise and focused on delivering a compelling and frightening experience into the Oppenheimers complex story. 

This pulsating  thriller, takes a deep dive into the depths of power and what that power can do to a person. There are moments that just left me so emotionally shook because of the sheer scope that was fully explored of the actions of these people involved in creating this world killer. It's a landmine of a film and one misstep may take you out course but Cillian Murphy performance throughout this film was nothing short of brilliant. Robert Downey, Jr., Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh‚Ä¶literally every single actor no matter the scene time bought their A+++ game. Ludwig's gives the BEST score of the year hands down and and Hoyte van Hoytema cinematography is flawless. Are there moments where the momentum slows up a bit, sure‚Ä¶ but they immediately pick back up like a ticking time bomb. 

No SPOILERS, but there's a scene in a gym that might just be the scene of the year because it left me completely speechless. OPPENHEIMER is a haunting yet captivating study of showcasing both the victory's as well as the  terrors in the chase of world altering greatness. 

This is Nolan's best directing to date combined with his best script. This is a CINEMATIC ACHIEVEMENT!",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","It's a really good movie. Prior to watching this film, I had a Wikipedia-level understanding of J. R. Oppenheimer, but as I swift through this 3-hour long film, it's as if my brain and its fabric of knowledge in the hippocampus was constantly renewed and refreshed. Truly, a masterpiece by Nolan, but we all knew this was coming. Also, if you're just a tiny-bit interested in modern physics and its plethora of thinkers, you may also want to watch this film for it brings forth essential thinkers of physics (i.e. the rise of quantum physics) like Richard Feynman, and many more. There's so much more to cover, but everyone will be better off rewatching it next week so as to take notice of the little details that are currently veiled under the somewhat fast-paced storytelling from the great Chris Nolan.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Nolan's cinematic craftmanship at its peak. No one left the theater for the entire 3 hours. That silence in the IMAX theater from Trinity test scene is truly an experience to remember. A true testament of why cinema exists.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","I love this movie, the music, and the acting is really great in this. I love the suspense that the music builds up to on some scenes.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Masterpiece!!! Amazing!!!,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","I recently watched the movie, and it's yet another masterpiece from Nolan. Although I saw it in a regular theater since we don't have an IMAX in our country, I was still deeply moved by what I experienced during the 3-hour film. I can only imagine how incredible it must have been for those who saw it in its intended format. Murphy's on-screen presence was never in doubt, and Cillian's portrayal finally showcases what a great actor he truly is. Nolan's promise to show everything through Oppenheimer's eyes was brilliantly captured, especially through Cillian's expressive and captivating eyes. His performance made a lasting impression on me. Robert displayed not only his star power but also his exceptional acting skills, delivering one of the most memorable performances in the second half of the movie. As expected from Nolan, this film sets a new milestone. It surpassed my already high expectations, thanks to the remarkable cast, compelling story, stunning cinematography, and Nolan's dedication. I feel fortunate to have witnessed this epic film, and I believe both Cillian and Robert deserve Oscars for their outstanding performances. Without a doubt, it's the best movie of the year.",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023",A interesting amount of depth to a very complex man. Truely the epitome.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","A towering, triumphant tragedy. Christopher Nolan is the greatest single filmmaker of our time and here he shows exactly how well he has mastered his craft. The script for this film is immaculate. The cast is filled with A-list leading men and women, many of them in small parts with extremely limited screen time. The cinematography by Hoyt van Hoytema is breathtaking. The score by Ludwig Gorannson is stressful and beautiful at the same time. Cillian Murphy is a revelation as Oppenheimer, commanding the screen as the father of the atomic bomb. Robert Downey Jr. gives the best performance of his career as Lewis Strauss. Emily Blunt is a standout as Kitty Oppenheimer, her own scenes often brilliant and powerful. The smaller roles in this cast are all great. Casey Affleck is incredibly unsettling when on screen, while Alden Ehrenreich is great. The standout performance of all of the smaller roles is Florence Pugh as Jane Tatlock. This person, someone so important to the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer, is often portrayed as this seemingly bi-polar, waifish, lost soul who drags Oppenheimer down. In this film, Pugh gives an incredibly nuanced performance, equal parts lustful and headstrong. Josh Hartnett is great, loved seeing him in a big film again. Remi Malik was great, really enjoyed him in this. Gary Oldman as Truman was an incredible portrayal; at the same time the politician and the good old boy. This film should be the frontrunner for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Production Design, Best Sound Design, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, and Best Visual Effects (considering all of the SFX work was done practically!) Robert Downey Jr. should win Best Supporting Actor, while Cillian  Murphy should absolutely win Best Actor. One of the best historical epics I have ever seen 10/10!",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","The IMAX experience was incredible. The structure of jumping between past, present, and future throughout the film made a potentially boring movie into something great! There's no surprise, we all know the atom bomb goes off and how it ended up but us knowing the ending doesn't take away anything from the tension Nolan builds in the first bomb drop. Another thing I loved was the random cuts to space and fire throughout. Felt like I was enveloped by these scenes in the IMAX theater. Last thing, take how you think the atom bomb scene is going to play out, look like, and sound like, now throw it out because it's not that but in the best of ways. For a movie to live up to a hype of this magnitude is DIFFICULT *cough cough Barbie* but Oppenheimer delivers on all fronts.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","I had a high hopes for the movie. I knew it would be long and I was afraid I'd fall asleep. However, the music and sound were so loud that I stayed wide awake the entire time. Unfortunately, it was difficult to hear the speaking parts partly because of their soft tones and partly because of the loud music. 

The cast was excellent. However, it was hard to keep track of the characters because the scenes jump around the timeline. I would like to read the book to learn more about each character and to help keep them straight.

Overall, I certainly have a better understanding of Oppenheimer, the scientists, and the politics of the time.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 21, 2023","My son and I went to Oppenheimer today. We like the science true stories and watch them together. This movie will be in the race for several Oscars. The actors were very well cast, Cillian Murphy was excellent. His eyes were mesmerizing. The movie moves along always keeping you interested. 3 hour movie was over before we knew it. I recommend Oppenheimer.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","I think the movie received way too much hype than it deserved. If you're a history fanatic sure I guess it's for you to watch. It is so incredibly boring and does not make me want to delve more into the topic. The visuals, actors, cinematography, etc. is great but nothing ‚Ä¶ new. It's very typical. Watched it in IMAX and the sound quality was great but it only made me want to complete assignments I had for class. It's very much a background movie you would put on in the background while you clean or do homework. So because of that I don't recommend watching it in theaters just wait for it to stream.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Christopher Nolan is a mastermind. No other words needed.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","The way they envolve you within Oppenheimer mind it¬¥s something different. And the tense parts... masterpiece.
PS: perhaps a little to long.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Christopher Nolan did it. Oppenheimer is masterful. High-level cinema, without a doubt it will be a classic. Cillian Murphy is phenomenal in his much deserved leading role, an Oscar performance. The visuals are spectacular. Amazing thriller.

"Jul 21, 2023",The movie is masterpiece.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Great Movie Actually I Think It will Be nolan's Masterpiece But The Only Problem In My Opinion Is The Non stop Changing Of The Timelines Although it Gives You Some sort Of Feeling but Makes it Little Bit Very Little Bit hard to understand But After all Oppenheimer Is The Masterpiece of our decade If Not The century,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Great movie! Highly Recommend!,POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","One of the greatest achievements in cinematic history. It's a near perfect movie. The craftsmanship across all tradecraft is tippy, tippy top. Every frame could be hung on the wall.  It's a true work of art at the highest level. See it on a 70mm film print for sure.  Absolute masterpiece. WOW!!!",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Another spectacular hit by Christopher Nolan. The art direction is incredible and all the actors give themselves tremendously! A hell of a contender to win the Oscar.,POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023",Best film of the year,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","It was a heavy toll on my mental energy to watch 3 hours of Oppenheimer. Chris Nolan takes the viewers into the mind of the great scientist who created the atom bomb, and the moral dilemma that comes with it. The actors did a splendid and memorable job in recreating people from the past on screen. But Nolan should take a break from his non-linear storytelling which makes the film look like a mess sometimes.",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","A beautiful film about the history of the world. The way Nolan has accomplished to guide the viewer through timelines is perfection. The ending is such a powerful scene, how everything went down the way it did just for that one moment is apparently a very constant situation in our world.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","It not only has some amazing and astonishing visuals but the sound immersed you in the film, you can feel that you are in the same room and even though this is Ja√≠r the history of openheimer it has such a good drama and story developing",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","This is Nolan at his finest and most intimate; from the cinematography to Cillian Murphy's brilliant performance as Oppenheimer, this movie shines in every aspect and will be remembered for years to come. Truly a modern classic.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Nolan blew it out of the park. Literally. The imagery and the style in which he crafted in my opinion his best film yet.  The score was beautifully composed by Mr. G√∂ransson Made me feel completely immersed in this masterpiece of cinema. Every actor played their part to perfection Robert Downey Jr. is no longer Iron Man he completely embodied Strauss to perfection. Never has any movie given me chills not once but twice.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Real movies need magic, this one is made from a magician",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Nolan is proving why Cinema exist: Remembering us the truth that we efford to erased from memory and history.

The cast is amazing and next to the filmography and music making a piece of art that you'll be thankful to watch on theatres.

For who we're wating Cillian Murphy's lifes role, THIS IS.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","In the world of film, Christopher Nolan holds a high bar for storytelling. With Oppenheimer, he once again proves why he's at the top of his game. The film is a rich tapestry of skill and creativity, leaving the audience captivated from start to finish.

The direction and editing of the film play out like a master class in cinema, turning every moment into a memorable snapshot. The visual appeal of the movie, enriched by the cinematography, is a feast for the eyes, painting each scene in vibrant tones and intricate detail.

The cast is a star-studded line-up of Hollywood's finest, and Nolan expertly uses their talent to add depth to the movie. Even in brief appearances, the performances shine, demonstrating the respect Nolan commands as a director.

The film's claim of avoiding CGI is fascinating, leaving the audience wondering how such effects were achieved. If it's true, it puts Oppenheimer in a unique spot in movie history, celebrating the power of real-world visual magic.

The bomb testing scene is a high point of the movie, creating an immersive experience that outshines even the biggest blockbuster premieres. The spellbound silence of the audience was proof of the scene's impactful execution.

Cillian Murphy, playing Robert J. Oppenheimer, delivers an emotionally charged performance, infusing his role with depth and pathos. Robert Downey Jr., as Lewis Strauss, gives a standout performance that's already generating Oscar buzz.

While I won't spoil any more of the movie, I urge you to see Oppenheimer. It's a film that grabs your attention and stays with you long after you've left the theater. Ideally, it should be experienced on the big screen, where its cinematic scope can be fully appreciated.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Perhaps the finest movie I have seen in decades. Smart, great acting, nicely paced, moral dilemmas all over the place, 3 hours breezed by. I have not loved all of Nolan's films; some broad and esoteric and meandering but this film had a very tight narrative. A scientific and political thriller. Bravo!",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Oppenheimer is a captivating and thought provoking movie that deserves acclaim for multiple reasons. The movie masterfully weaves together complex themes of scientific progress, moral dilemmas, and the consequences of human actions, engaging the audience on an intellectual and emotional level. Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr, Christopher Nolan & the rest of the cast/crew did absolutely PHENOMENAL! MOVIE OF THE CENTURY!!!!",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","While a very dense movie to jump into, the 3 phases tie itself together in Nolan fashion beautifully to deliver a compelling story. Easily one of the best movies of the year with a Cillian Murphy masterclass giving it the exclamation mark!",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","What an intense, amazing cinematic experience. The cast, the music, a full auditorium of people!!! A must see in 70 mm",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Anyone who says they enjoyed this movie is lying. I have seen words used to describe it as ""thrilling"" and ""horrifying"". No. It was unapologetically dull. Christopher Nolan has made great movies in the past. This was not one of them. I do not know if there was an attempt to be pretentious or intelligent with the script, but for me it failed. None of what I had seen was thought provoking. It would make more sense to go to a museum dedicated to World War II and the Cold War than to sit through this 3 hours sprint through mud and sand.

Who knows? Maybe I'm not smart enough to get it. There wasn't anything I had difficulty understanding and that is most of my issue.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",It was a masterpiece,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",It‚Äôs an incredible film that everyone should watch because it showcases an important part of American history in a way quite unlike anything I have ever seen in a cinema.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Fantastic film, but it wants a bit too much. After the research on the atomic bomb, the film drifts into a, sometimes very confusing, political drama. Sound great, pictures great, cast great. You need to watch it",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",A wonderful depiction of the vast history of the atom bomb and the crucial moments robert and his fellow colleagues went through just to make it happen and the corrupt use of it and not realizing its impact on our future.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","In one of Nolan's greatest works and one of the best biopics ever made, the story of a troubled legendary physicist responsible for the creation of the most destructive weapon in the world is told in a beautiful, haunting picture.",POSITIVE

Es un 10/10 en argumento, trama, actuaciones, gui√≥n, banda sonora y los efectos especiales y visuales son ya la acostumbrada locura que siempre ofrece el cineasta!",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Gripping. Scary the parallels to our current world. Very thought provoking. Never lost interest in the movie. Packed theater and couldn't hear a pin drop,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Definitely an epic film. Get ready for an intense journey into the brilliant mind of Dr. Oppenheimer, the Father of the Atomic Bomb. If the drama surrounding the creation of a nuclear weapon isn't enough for you, the controversy and moral dilemma the characters endure is sure to get those brain cells moving. Soundtrack is just what you would expect from Christopher Nolan. Phenomenal acting from an all-star cast. My only critique is that it is a bit long, so make sure you strap in for the long haul. Definitely one of, if not the best movie of the year.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",By far a masterpiece by Christopher Nolan. The greatest movie of the year thus far. Honestly he is one of the greatest film directors of all time. And the All Star Cast of course‚Ä¶holy crap!  If you haven‚Äôt gotten your tickets yet you need to now. Well maybe not right now cause it almost 2am but later today after you wake up and read this. If this movie doesn‚Äôt bring in multiple Oscar nominations and take them home then it‚Äôs time for the Oscars to Ôøºreevaluate who they let vote and change the committee. That‚Äôs all I gotta say for now. Go watch this movie!!!,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Probably the best movie that I saw in my life , the acting is on another level, the cinematography is amazing , they gave us the ending we need so that's why the movie is a new masterpiece and I think Nolan never miss.
But you better see the movie in IMAX for better experience Nolan wasn't lying about that and enjoy the movie.",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023",The movie flows with a rhythmic pulse.  Intricate details woven together create a glimpse in the life and mind of oppenheimer.  The surrounding characters ad contrasting views and competing narratives consistent with the time.  The acting was fantastic.  The cinematography and editing really pulled together the chaotic scenes.  It was too long.  The plot crept and felt slightly stale towards the end.  Great movie overall,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Near perfection... Cillian deserves all the praise for this one,POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","Oppenheimer was compelling, fascinating, and confusing - showing a view of the Manhattan Project rarely seen and shining a spotlight on the technical, moral, and ethical issues facing the scientists, politicians, and military.  One quibble: 3 hours is an awfully long time to sit in a theater, no matter how comfortable the seat.",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","A must see. A wonderful masterpiece. The best of Christopher Nolan. Amazing performance of Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr and Matt Damon and many many more. You really feel that all actors embrace the movie and try to give their truly best. I was scared that the bomb explosion part will be too long, but this is not the case‚Ä¶ the moving is truly a biopic of Robert Oppenheimer life. Many academy awards to come for this movie.",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","Interesting story but didnt like the editing in the beginning of the movie. As one who was brought up in the Cold War and the fear of nuclear weapons, I think there should have been more reminders or obvious scenes showing the results of nuclear bombing shown to this newer generation. Movie kind of missed a chance to make more of a statement however, the story itself was interesting.",POSITIVE

If however, you are like myself and have no earthly idea about any of it, you will stay lost as I did. I thought it was a good movie to an extent. It did not need to be 3 hours long. I feel like they drug it out as long as possible which was too far. I feel I would've enjoyed the movie more, had it not been so long.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 21, 2023",I can absolutely say this is one of Christopher Nolans best films he has ever made. The Cast was absolutely phenomenal and they nailed their roles perfectly. This movie has left me shook and want to see it again. This movie is a must see on biggest screen possible,POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","I suspect living through the testing of a nuclear bomb you created and witnessing how devastating it would be as a weapon, and then later watching that same bomb completely devastate a country would be monumentally tense and heavy.

"Jul 21, 2023",One of the most incredible cinematic experiences I have ever had.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Just watched Oppenheimer.....My one word review - Brilliant. My Rating - 9/10. It is surely Nolan's finest and most powerful movie till date and will likely be the big winner at next year's Oscars at least for Best Film, Best Actor, Best Director and Best Supporting Actor but it is not a movie for everyone.

Cillian Murphy gives his best performance as he completely immerses himself into this complex character. The direction, acting, music, visuals and overall story is simply magnificent.  The movie is an extremely gripping thriller which keeps its viewers hooked to the screen for the entirety of its 3 hour screen time.

Nolan's storytelling style with multiple parallel storylines pays off at the end but it is a bit complex in the first half and its intentionally slow pace may be a turn off for audiences not used to Nolan's brand of cinema. If you like good artistic and content heavy cinema, then this movie is the perfect theatrical experience.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Nolan gave us a film that will be talked about forever. Different then his usual Science Fiction mind twisters, it was refreshing to see Nolan tell the story of one of the most important humans of mankind. A 3 hour epic that straps you in right from the opening. Cillian Murphy had a STELLAR performance. Ludwig with an incredible score. Easily the best IMAX experience I‚Äôve ever had. I am still in awe. Wow.",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023",Other than having a bit of nudity the movie was excellent. I very intriguing and very in-depth. No one comes out of it as a good guy the movie does a good job of making both like and dislike the same characters.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Another genius and complex movie that shows the brilliant mind of Christopher Nolan.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","So damn good. Gripping throughout. A lot of stuff happening at once which was kind of hard to follow and feels like it possibly could have been cut better but I love the overall choice.
The first 2 hours are electric and lead up to Trinity which is an awesome climax. It's kind of like he slammed on the brakes for 30 minutes right after to let us catch our breath and then picks it back up. 
I thought Murphy and RDJ both put on Oscar worthy performances.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Solid movie, Just like Top Gun Maverick, these films bring hope back into Hollywood. Chris Nolan is the shining light of Hollywood, and his movie ""Oppenheimer"" proves that. Yes, Oppenheimer is a long film, and needing to understand it will make it difficult to watch. Do some research to understand your history before watching the movie. You will have a blast watching this if you have a general understanding beforehand. It needs to be nominated for its acting but the technical stuff, such as the sound and cinematography.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","It lived up to the hype. Had a few minutes that were slow but the rest of the pace was flying by. It's not for everyone. In true Nolan fashion, it isn't a linear timeline... and a lot of people won't be able to handle that. That is not Nolan's fault, it is their fault. Visuals and sound were incredible. It's going to win awards. Watch it on the biggest, loudest screen possible. Don't wait for home release.",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","This movie is brilliant. Saw the advanced screening of Oppenheimer today in an AMC near me. And it was totally worth it. It was a wonderful biopic of an American genius, but it also hit  an emotional nerve seeing the relentless crusade by narrow-minded politicians against Dr. Oppenheimer and his genuine concern for humanity and the deaths of innocent millions in the face of an atomic bomb holocaust.  

The star cast, especially Cillian Murphy, is Oscar nomination worthy. Nolan's movies over the decades have been novel and breathtaking, but this seems exceptional at a different level.  This was based on an American hero who loved his country, but unfortunately was not treated as one during the prime of his life despite his creativity and ingenuity.  It was sad to see tragedy and injustice for Dr. Oppenheimer, but thankfully it ends with positive recognition that he well deserved for loyalty and service to his country. 

 It is truly difficult to explain this movie or its deep impact, so, do yourself a favor and just watch it in a theater near you and derive your own conclusions.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",This call a great movie,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","In the beginning, I thought it would be hard to follow because of the cuts. Sometimes you couldn't hear the actors very well, especially if the music ramped up. I enjoyed it Imax, but it's not something I would need to see Imax multiple times like Mission Impossible:Dead Reckoning. That said, the subject matter kept me engaged and every actor did great work. I'll be seeing Mission again this week, Imax or not.",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023",masterpiece from Nolan !,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",If you give this movie anything less than 5 stars you don‚Äôt like cinema.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",The movie is the bomb.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",I loved this movie. The timing of it is impeccable because it tied into the problems we are having today. Christopher Nolan did a beautiful job as he always does.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Incredible movie with stellar performances and masterful technical achievements across the board. A must see for anyone who loves science, history or politics.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",This is the type of film that demands your attention. The world is heading towards a path that this film does not shy away from showing the audience; told in a very intense and thrilling way.,POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023",Towering movie about a towering man. Engrossing and thought-provoking. Loved it.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Nudity should have been avoided,NEGATIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",It was a phenomenal film & also terrifying at the ending. It'll make you scared a little bit to think that almost every country has nuclear warheads at the push of a button. The end of human civilization it's definitely eye opening.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Utterly astounding, flows seamlessly over the 3 hours. Performances are stellar and the score is enthralling.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Absolutely fantastic!  A lot of dialogue, but every word and action should remain ingrained in one's mind, that mixing politics with science can get us all killed, in an instant!  Cillian is remarkable as Oppenheimer.  Downey as Strauss is a close second.  Entire cast along with some great film crew created an exciting and memorable film. Sound track perfectly fitting, effects mesmersmizing.  Nolan is at his best in directing this film and cast.  The 70mm film and the use of color/black and white for period timing, brilliant.  Makes it worth while going back to the movie theaters again.  BRAVO!",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Thrilling and rooted in facts and actual events,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",much too long. too complicated. too many timelines. a lot of ancillary acting was bad. makeup was bad. a few scenes were very well done tho but did not hit like i expected. really disappointed,NEGATIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Christopher Nolan truly did justice to the complex life of Oppenheimer. This movie brings to the forefront the effect the atomic age had with the world at large as well as questions are perceived notion of if the bomb should have been used in the first place. It leaves you haunted with the realities of the weapon without trying to be capitalize and profit from the horror we inflicted on Japan. if you love history and are interested in World War 2 This is a must watch,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Imagine the adrenaline rush you get in a perfectly edited 3min trailer with lots of highs and an epic score. Now this movie is a 3hr trailer.

Epic stuff from Nolan.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Beautifully complicated, as all Christopher Nolan films are, but this one‚Äôs a true story. The story of the Manhattan Project and the man behind it all is incredibly complex, and seeing this on an IMAX screen was great. The acting was astounding, and Cillian Murphy could not have done a better job!",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",They did well to explore the man and the legend being formed around himself and others. We see his flaws and exceptionalism. Around his big project itself I was brought to tears on the achievement and horror of what was created. Absolute must see.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Very well acted and a solid film. 3 hours is a bit long, but its worth the price of admission.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Not a Nolan sycophant, but I have to be honest, this movie is damn good

""Oppenheimer"" is an interesting cinematic work that brings an extraordinary experience to the audience. The musical score, composed by Ludwig G√∂ransson, gives the story a deep emotional dimension. The beautiful cinematography presents a stunning visual picture, making this movie very enjoyable to watch.

However, even though this film offers a stunning cinematic experience, its duration of up to 3 hours can be a challenge for some viewers. Even so, ""Oppenheimer"" is still able to maintain its appeal and present an interesting story with elegance.

Overall, ""Oppenheimer"" is a cinematic work that deserves appreciation. Ludwig Goransson's musical score and gorgeous cinematography are the film's strong points, but it's worth admitting that its lengthy run can be a bit overwhelming.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",I thought the movie was a bit long. Well paced and scripted.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","1st hours was pretty slow but provided much needed context. It had some weird nude scenes that seemed forced and sorta didn‚Äôt fit, but who doesn‚Äôt like nukes and Tits haha",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Oppenheimer √© sem d√∫vida alguma o melhor filme de biografia disparado! Com certeza o melhor filme do ano.

"Jul 21, 2023","""Nolan strikes again with an awe-inspiring spectacle! This jaw-dropping film captivates for two-thirds, nearing perfection. Yet, the last act feels slightly rushed and overwhelming, missing my personal preference. Nevertheless, it remains an opus in Chris Nolan's filmography.""",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","A true masterpiece of film making, every choice, every performance was truly breathtaking. The use of practical effects instead of CGI crap was just incredible. It's 3 hours, you feel the 3 hours but I was genuinely so engrossed in the story telling and direction of the movie I didn't leave my seat once.
This movie in one word, astonishing.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",In Nolan we trust. He delivered a spectacular film filled with remarkable performances. Definitely going to stick with me for a long time‚Ä¶,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","To those who complain the movie is too long, or doesn't have enough action.... what did you expect, a WWII battle movie? Anyone with a shred of intellect and interest in the subject matter will enjoy this movie. One of Nolan's best!",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Very slow movie, no action. Puts you to sleep.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",A horrifying movie. Incredibly well done.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","The best drama of the year. Excellent film with a extraordinary cast; the spectacular role of Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer will get him
An Academy award. Fast dialogues and complex drama will keep you in suspense throughout the film. Oppenheimer life was complex and extraordinary!",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",The movie was paced really well. The story was easy to follow. The action was Very good Cillian Murphy didn't excellent job in his first leave role for Christopher Nolan as well as Robert Downey Jr And don't listen to the  BS that the sound was so loud you couldn't hear the dialogue or the last part of the movie was boring  the last part of the movie finished telling the story and made it feel complete. My only complaint and it had nothing to do with the movie the crappy IMAX theater I went to was terrible,POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","Mind blowing movie 
#thebest",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","It was interesting, but I thought way too much time was spent on the US political debates. I would have liked to have seen more detail on the creation of the different bombs, and some commentary on the future of nuclear war. I thought Robert Downey Jr. and Rami Malek were great in their roles. I thought the general that Matt Damon played was a bit of a one note performance. He seemed to only have one acting gear to work with. Cillian Murphy was great in the lead role. I was let down by Christopher Nolan's practical atomic bomb effects. It did not look like any atomic bomb I've ever seen online in photos or video. ( there are hundreds of nuclear bomb videos on YouTube ) I think Nolan should have gone with CGI effects for this one. The theater I was in was about 80 percent full at a Thursday 8pm show. All of the seats close to the screen were empty.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 21, 2023",Nailed it!!! Wow truly amazed how great this was. Had been waiting on it since announced and it was truly the best movie I have seen this year. Will be seeing it again ,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","What an profound movie, Chris Nolan, cast and crew did amazing job, well written, and outstanding performances by all. Such an important part of history to be shared with a generation that hasnt really, truely realized what previous generations had to live through.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Well thought out and enjoyable movie! Very thought provoking and entertaining. Found myself at the edge of my seat. Really brought history to life! Must see in the theater!,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Oppenheimer √© forte no quesito t√©cnico, Robert Downey Jr. √â uma das melhores coisas do filme, mas sua narrativa √© um tanto que arrastada e longa, por√©m acho um crime n√£o assistir ao filme em um cinema, trinity √© totalmente devastadora, a narrativa n√£o linear do filme √© um grande acerto, a troca de preto e branco e colorido n√£o √© totalmente necess√°ria, e fico feliz por conta do filme n√£o se explicar em demasiado.

"Jul 21, 2023",Christopher Nolan gave us a masterpiece. Everything about this movie was amazing! Definitely watch it in IMAX.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Well it's certainly one of the best films of the year. I think it's a real film for intellectually curious people that wanted to know how history went down. I would suggest not drinking anything hours before watching to sit through the whole movie.,POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023",Amazing movie very well done,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Master piece from Nolan.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Very different than most Nolan films, but perhaps the most powerful and moving movie I‚Äôve ever seen. The explosion itself was underwhelming a little, but the atmosphere and impact of it was certainly felt. One of the best movies I have ever seen, cannot recommend enough, I sat stunned in the theater for 5-10min after it finished.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","It is a technical film, with good captures and a great soundtrack. Nolan is genius.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","A historical masterpiece. Great actors their depiction of their characters was spot on. Cinematography, writing & direction awesome .",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Definitely a bit long. However, Im not sure where theyd shorten it. Great movie overall.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",The only reason why I did not give it 5 was just too much dialogue,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Seeing what I learned about this man (which wasn't much) come to life was sensational. You learned the true story of what happened and how. The acting was outstanding. The whole cast was on point. Give them all the awards now. The actors really took us on a journey in this film. The emotional rollercoaster by the people in the life of Oppenheimer was fascinating. Finally, the conflict of culture, science, and duty to the country was really intriguing. I really did look like it took its toil on him. I hope people realize that this was a true turning point in history and he knew it.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Masterclass filmmaking by Nolan here. This movie won't be for everyone as it's a long movie that's heavy on dialogue and story telling. There's no crazy action scenes or anything like that. This is about characters and story and all the actors involved brought their A game to this movie, especially Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. The Trinity scene was done beautifully and you felt the terror Oppenheimer felt after witnessing it. This is a top tier Nolan movie for me and if he doesn't get a Best Director nomination I'll be furious.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Very long and boring. Way too long , kind of boring and messy. Third act is completely different from everything else ",NEGATIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Screen shut off for 3 seconds in the middle + there was a green dot (dead pixel I think) on the right side. Movie was good enough to make me not think ab that stiff tho,NEUTRAL
"Jul 21, 2023","Honestly, it was not that good. It could have been better, much better. Not at all exciting, just a whole lot of boring scenes with talking and political nonsense they should have just left out. I was expecting more.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 21, 2023","Really good movie. Entertaining biopic with the most stacked cast I‚Äôve ever seen. Great visuals, definitely worth the trip to an imax theater.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Felt like watching a 3 hour trailer.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Amazing movie. Slightly overlong by 15 or so minutes and is really a movie with 2-3 distinct parts (pre-Alamos, Trinity, and courtroom drama) with the focus on the courtroom drama having a fairly notable departure from the rest of the film. The movie has a Terrence Malick feel in the scope, close-ups, visual effects, etc. but with the distinctive storytelling of Nolan, cross-cutting, chiaroscuro, and build-up using sound contrasts. Cillian Murphy will win an Oscar for this - the way he transformed his voice alone struck me immediately in the opening scene, in a way that reminded me of Daniel Day-Lewis. Emily Blunt was tremendous in one especially notable scene. All the supporting characters were fine - Downey, Pugh, Damon - not a revelation like Murphy was, but good for their intended roles. Nolan will likely finally win Best Picture and Best Director.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",A sublime masterpiece!,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Great story. Excellent acting, especially by Downey.  Dialogue a bit muffled.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","One of the greatest filmmaker of our time proving that why He is the best.This picture follows a beautiful screenplay , direction and some wonderful performances by the cast.The background score manages to reach your bones sometimes only.In short it's another Nolan masterpiece",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Denso, pesado‚Ä¶ O filme vai deixar voc√™ na ponta da cadeira do in√≠cio ao fim! Som e imagens, espetaculares. Cillian Murphy e Emily Blunt s√£o incr√≠veis, mas a cereja do bolo √© Rami Malek‚Ä¶ UAU! Uma obra prima de Nolan.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Filme sensacional at√© agora do nolan, espero que ganhe o Oscar de melhor ator, melhor som, melhor fotografia e claro de melhor filme!!",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Definitely isn't movie for everyone, some will find it boring because of the dense conversation. If you're expecting more about the science of the bomb, you wont get much. I was even expecting for a one exact huge explosion but since its based on a BIOGRAPHY book ""American Prometheus"", i think C. Nolan delivered it well with the filming. I enjoyed it!
The actors all are great!! they are serving and worth an oscar!!",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",idk idk idk idk idk idk,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Definitely a great movie,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","An indulgent film, as expected, from Nolan. Perhaps needs a subsequent viewing with subtitles.  The constant intercutting and almost nonstop talking made it exhausting at times.  Need time to process it and eventually give it another go.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Beautifully shot! Didn‚Äôt feel like 3 hours at all! RDJ and Cillian Murphy did an incredible job!,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Not what I was expecting but very good. For the casual movie lover I think it's just too much and too long. Confusing at times because unless you're a history buff you don't know all the players and it bounces around a lot. Enjoyed it, but was surrounded by people that I think shared the same perspective. Interesting, important historical movie, but the target audience is too narrow.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 21, 2023",The best biopic I have ever seen in my life.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Amazing performances and a great movie and experience. A movie that will have you questioning and debating with whoever you watched it with. If you can, you must see it in Imax. It is a great movie, it was just slow (and possibly boring) in some parts, and occasionally hard to follow. it could have been easier to follow and a bit shorter, but it was still great. an amazing and chilling ending.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Liked - seemingly informative. A couple of great acting roles and introductions of less notable actors. Plausibly believeable at times, but than at other times, blah blah blah.

Disliked - Focused too much on trivialities. Who cares why he lost his security clearance? Do we really need to understand the politics on this for over 1/2 hour? 

Would have prefered more about the affect to the Japanese cities and people, the pilots, and others. More action, less banter. Oh... the filming quality was a horrible, literally too dark and muted. Nothing memorable about the score or the sound imaging other than it was collapsing and irritating the louder it got.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 21, 2023","In terms of cinematography, solid cast & scoring even though the dialogue is dense, the pace is fast so you have to focus.  But if you want to find the best cinema experience, Oppenheimer is the choice.  It would be a shame not to see Oppenheimer in theaters",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Christopher Nolan does it again. By far his best movie to date. Terrifyingly perfect representation of the history of Oppenheimer. Everything about this movie was stunning and brilliant. 10/10,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Oppenheimer blew my freaking mindü§Ø
Oppenheimer 10/10 
Oppenheimer is in the top 10 of the greatest films ever made for the silver screen. And then I remember all this really happened and am completely devastated. Christopher Nolan could direct anything he wants, anything he puts his mind to, he is the best at this.
I sat in the second of the first two rows, and mentally vibrated into a quantum shift. Oppenheimer is the real QuantuMania. Having the History, Physics, and chemistry behind nuclear fission and fussion. What water, nuclear isotopes, and force can do. Cillian Murphy is most central to the real story as Robert Oppenheimer. Robert Downey Jr. my goodness that was his best performance, as it was incredible, along with Emily Blunt. Then Christopher Nolan basically casted actors from my childhood, and I started to remember all the films they were featured in.
What I really like, was the cast was entirely suitable for roles in Oppenheimer, and they were all so recognizable, useful, and notable when they appear in the film. Christopher Nolan made good use of everyone. He made sure actors I hadn't seen in a while got feed. Matt Damon and Florence Pugh were naturals in their roles. Damon in a war general role is what I envisioned him playing. A Saving Private Ryan promotion. Now we should get Matt Damon as Vietnam General in the war.
In the Barbenheimer discussion, I would consider Oppenheimer a slightly more empowering film, because it acknowledges that relationships can be a cause for purpose. Barbie is more a film of individualistic purpose. The function of Oppenheimer is helpful and is the real real world.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Oppenheimer is not just so entertaining with the intense build up to the big atomic explosion, but the movie has this sense of fear building up to it. Most of the movie is people talking & developing the characters. In the first half, it's mostly the characters discovering their capabilities and then inventing the weapon of mass destruction. But as you watch all that it takes to build up to the big event, there's this feeling of how dangerous this all really is. It's not like you're scared for the characters per say but more of the fact of how grounded and realistic this movie feels. It's very much relatable to reality and you're more scared for the world built around the characters instead for the characters themselves. This movie is not just thought-provoking in  that sense but also from the movie being revolved around Oppenheimer himself. There's the questions of, ""Should they even be doing this?"" and ""What have we just done?"" and so the movie really explores the mental side of those thoughts & the guilt, regret, and resentment of building something that can cause such a big catastrophe. I think Nolan did amazing in capturing all of those aspects & making us feel the threat & intensity. The ensemble cast in this movie, for the most part, all got their moments to shine. There were a couple actors who were in supporting roles that I thought could've had a little more time but for the most part they all had their moments. The big standouts to me are RDJ, Cillian Murphy, and Florence Pugh. But even though the acting in this movie was amazing, I had trouble feeling any sense of emotion towards the characters. I feel like that's becoming a common issue with big ensemble movies. The scales of the movie and world building are so huge, there's not a lot of time to flesh out the characters emotionally. Again, when focusing in on Oppenheimer, it's a lot more based on mentality & not emotionally when I feel like the conflicts could've felt more intriguing if there was that emotional side to it as well. Overall, Oppenheimer is just breathtaking with the visuals, and the intense build up leaves you on the edge of your seat with an ensemble that can't get any better & the feeling by the end of this movie is cataclysmic. A-",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Amazing! A great story and amazing cast. There were so many characters that could have been a movie in itself.,POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023",Fantastic movie. Nolan put his story telling spin on this movie like all of his others and created a powerful experience worth seeing more than once.

"Jul 21, 2023","Phenomenal achievement in cinema. Magnificent performances, story, direction, etc. Not to be missed.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",An absolute masterpiece which uses several different narratives to tie together a truly gripping story. Must watch for sure.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Jumped around too much from scene to scene.  Hard to follow even when you know the story.    Unnecessary special effects were distracting,  The switch from color to black/white made no sense.  Matt Damon was not believable in the role.  Robert Downey, Jr was excellent.   Wouldnt spend theater prices.  Just watch on Netflix,  A real disappointment.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",another masterpiece by Nolan. Cillian's performance is always a reminder that he's one of the best actors out there. and Robert Downey Jr‚Ä¶ in those last twenty minutes he showed that this is actually the best performance he has done in his life,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",This movie covered a lot about the political Innuendas and how bureaucratic injustice was done against a man who was asked to lead a team of scientists to develop an end to WWII. And then accused him of being a communist. Nolan is a genius but it was a little boring at time for a 3 hour movie.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",A must see movie. Every frame of this movie is art. The cast killed it in their roles. Oscars are inbound. Super engrossing movie. This film is a masterpiece.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","It is a great story but it was very hard to follow the back and forth in time and the different characters involved. I would have liked to see a small caption showing the date when the movie switched time, and maybe a pause introducing the different scientists when we encountered them for the first time.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 21, 2023",Technically brilliant film. Some film choices may lead a broader audience confused or disenfranchised. Very dense.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","An outstanding story. We all knew some of the details, but this was so much more. The man, the project, the the motivations of Oppenheimer and the other scientists, as well as the finer points of the decisions to use the nuclear device asa weapon of war - those were things we should all be aware of, and ponder. Even more so, as at present, a single man has the power to use those devices as cover to wage a war of reconquest of former Soviet states, without being attacked in turn. World wars have started over lesser things. Now, we still, for reasons I do not understand, sit under a threat of nuclear armageddon. Arm (this) age (and we're) don(e).",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Honestly, THE masterpiece of Nolan's 30 years career. It leads us to a huge introspective of humanity's pathway to self destruction. A lot of Interstellar vibes and ""super-hero movie like"" suspense parts followed by an adrenaline discharge. You will leave the theaters feeling your brain was bombed. It really sinks in...
Completely mind blowing regarding the sound effects, cinematography, etc... It definitely leads to multiple Oscar wins. And Cillian Murphy I mean... a perfect character fit, his best acting so far.
I can say with guarantee, without even seeing the ones yet to come, that this is the best film of 2023, and will VERY likely surpass Nolan's most rated movie and 3rd on the list at the moment - The Dark Knight.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Great cast, interesting presentation, and fascinating and important part of history.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","This was like watching ANOTHER investigation on TV, which we are all completely saturated and sick of.  Even the sound of the explosion was muted.  Was this done to increase the boredom?  This movie could have been amazing if clips of the explosions in Japan had been shown.  Perhaps the clips of the horrific destruction could have been included.  I enjoy viewing these type of programs at home on PBS.  
The theatre was actually fairly full at the start.  Half way through, people began to exit, and it continued until the end.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","Impressive story telling with a dynamic intertwining of the past and the (per the film) present. A compelling history story, this is a movie for thinking adults. Three hours passed seamlessly but there are many characters and it is a challenge to follow who is who. Visually vibrant from the New Mexico vastness and endless barracks to the committee meetings and congressional hearings. Technically, the filming was great but (a) the audio is half mumbled and (b) the soundtrack is distractingly constant.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 21, 2023","In a sea of reboots, remakes, and Marvel failures, this movie was a breath of fresh air.  

One of the best movies I have seen in a long time.  For being 3 hours long and dialogue heavy, the score helped keep scene intense and the pace moving.  I loved everything about this movie.  Black and white scenes really added a lot to the tone and emotions of scenes.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","The true weight given to a story that has not been properly weighed. Unique scenes that tell a deeper story of morals and obligation. Amazing contributions from all actors. The scenes will continue to play in your head for hours, if not days.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Didnt live up to the hype of it.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Oppenheimer deserves to be in the top 5 movies of all time, beating Memento, Inception and Dunkirk (all these are Christopher Nolan films). This is a classic Christopher Nolan film with great cinematic visuals and a deeply intriguing story. Robert Downey Jr and Cillian Murphy were real standouts in the film, bringing a great sense of professionalism and high-level acting to the film. Overall an incredible film.",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","It has been a long time since I've been this excited for a movie, and let me tell you, this did not disappoint! I was a little concerned that I would simply tolerate Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer, but no.  He was Oppenheimer.  I loved Nolan's framing of the character, telling an accurate story while ensuring a common theme throughout and visually portraying the conflicted essence of the Father of the Atomic Bomb. He gives us just enough of a satisfying conclusion while also giving us a warning at the end. I loved it, and I already want to watch it again.",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","movie not totally what I expected, but very enjoyable. 3 hours feels like 90 minutes. but need to stay on your toes and pay attention to characters. the last 45 minutes are hard to follow. so many characters. the actor who plays Oppenheimer completely immersed himself into the role. a small part of the movie actually shows the bomb build. plays more on the politics and turned the movie into a replica of JFK movie. but I still highly recommend. also, RBJ is as good as the lead actor. WOW.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","obra maestra, el sonido es incre√≠ble, Cillian Murphy y su actuaci√≥n es hermosa, la cinematograf√≠a, todo en general se siente org√°nico y transmite m√∫ltiples emociones.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","This is a masterpiece on the level of Lawrence of Arabia. Unfortunately, I think many people won‚Äôt understand the significance of what Oppenheimer sees and feels and hopelessly tries to control. As an engineer, one cannot help but relate to the gut-wrenching experience of being responsible for making technology available to people (politicians) who will assuredly misuse it.  Not everybody will really get it in the first watching. I anticipate schools will offer lessons in this film in the same way that Shakespeare is taught.",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","This is not just a film‚Ä¶ it's an experience. One every fan of cinema must watch. Nolan captures your attention almost immediately and never loses it throughout the 3 hour epic. The visuals, sound mixing, and storytelling are perfection. Cillian Murphy delivers the defining performance of his career and is a shoe in for an academy award. Robert Downey Jr is equally brilliant. Simply put, the film is a masterpiece and is arguably not only Nolan's best film, but up there with the best films ever made.",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023",This movie had some spectacular visuals! Amazing acting! This movie is not for every  person. Ending was great and made you think. This isn't a typical Christopher Nolan film that has loads of realistic action that audiences expect. This film is very dialogue heavy! This isn't a film about the atomic bomb as much as it is about Oppenheimer.,POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023",This movie was gripping the entire time. I never write reviews but I felt compelled to express my appreciation for this masterpiece. I truly feel like I was able to step into these monumental moments in history. There was no point in this movie where I wanted to look away. The emotional rollercoaster this took me on was incredible. Knowing how it all ends doesn't give solice to the suspense but instead adds to the weight of emotions as we watch the world change forever. This will forever be a movie that shook me to my core.,POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","There were a number of different ways this movie could have gone, but Nolan chose the most bland option of them all. The movie was 1.5hrs of backstory, 20min of payoff, and another hour of boredom.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Walked out an hour before the movie ended. This is a story you could read in 10 minutes on Wikipedia, it doesn‚Äôt need three, long, boring hours. The actual bomb scene is all of three minutes and it takes two, long boring hours to even see it. And, the bomb scene isn‚Äôt anything you haven‚Äôt seen before on TV. If you really want to see a GREAT movie, that hasn‚Äôt been overhyped by Woke Hollywood, go see ‚ÄúThe Sound of Freedom‚Äù. That will be a much better investment of two hours you‚Äôll never get back with Oppenheimer ",NEGATIVE

"Jul 21, 2023",Move is fantastic worth seeing,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Technically good (great acting, artistic, etc), but ultimately boring. There isn't one likable character in the movie and, once the bomb has been built/tested it's all down hill from there. Save your money and just watch the Oppenheimer documentary on YouTube.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Cillian Murphy does it again. Oppenheimer is a master class of story telling, showing the troubling perspective of the world renowned physicist Oppenheimer and everything that entails with the creation of a nuclear bomb.",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","Best film Nolan has made. This is his masterpiece and it's beautifully brought to life by an outstanding cast. Cillian Murphy is on his way to an Oscar nomination. While 3h long, the time kind of flies. Extremely engaging, smart and compelling movie. The bomb test scene is one of the best cinematic experiences you'll see - no one in the theater dared to move or breathe. This is what cinema is supposed to feel like, and Oppenheimer has brought it back to life.",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","I expected a great movie, but was nevertheless blown away by the gravity of the story and the power of the performances, cinematography, sound and special effects that together grab you in the heart and the gut. Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr., Matt Damon, Gary Oldman and Stacy Affleck are superbly perfect in their roles.  But it is the deeply moving story of Robert Oppenheimer himself, and Cillian Murthy's intense and sensitive portrayal of him, that ultimately tears your heart out.  If you can, go see the movie in IMAX.  A movie this big in the power of its story and delivery of its message deserves to be experienced as if you are standing alongside the characters in real life. This is a movie that will be talked about for years to come!!!  It is a masterpiece, of which Christopher Nolan should be very proud.",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","An instant classic I feel. Drawn out perhaps, yet exquisite nonetheless. The japs had it comin!",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","The worst thing going for this movie is the positioning as a summer blockbuster. This film is really an action-less dialogue-driven art house movie wrapped up in a loud score and Universal‚Äôs hype. I am fine with dialog and Nolan‚Äôs trademark ‚Äúall over the place‚Äù timeline jumping, but this film required me to do way too much mental concentration to enjoy it. I‚Äôm sorry, but I was really missing the magic of something like Inception. Or the twist end of the Prestige. It just seemed like a pet project he really wanted to make, and finally got to at Universal, but without much regard of a summer audience or if anyone would actually enjoy it as much as he enjoyed writing it.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 21, 2023","I think most people will be disappointed. 95% of this 3-hour movie is mostly men sitting around talking. It jumps back and forth in time too much. More talk about Communism than the bomb itself. The acting was great, especially Damon.  But it's a movie that I'll never watch again.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 21, 2023","SPOILERISH: Once an atomic bomb is created and hundreds of thousands of people are killed offscreen, the events of Robert Oppenheimer's life seem trivial and superfluous to me. Well acted, but anti-climactic in my opinion. But the movie wasn't called Hiroshima nor was it a remake of Fat Man and Little Boy, so I should have expected what I saw.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 21, 2023","Oppenheimer is an unbelievable achievement in the art of film. Christopher Nolan undoubtedly showcases why he is one of the great directors of our era, redefining every genre he dips his toe into. He made a three hour film feel only two and a half with tight editing, great writing and brilliant directing. 

Cillian Murphy should be a lock for Best Actor as he puts on the performance of his career. His best scenes are right after the US dropped the first atomic bomb and you can see Oppenheimer‚Äôs mix emotions of guilt, shock and accomplishment. And Murphy does it all without saying a word. 

Films like this don‚Äôt get made by a major studio unless it is by a true auteur like Christopher Nolan. And we should be grateful that he uses his influence to tell a story about a man lost in history.

"Jul 21, 2023","I think while the visuals were gorgeous, the themes extremely profound, and the performances inspired, the editing was just a bit too jarring, and not leaving enough time to linger on the incredible acting and weight of the situations say for a few moments. I also think that maybe the plot could have had more focus, so as to make the stakes a bit clearer and also help the audience to have a clearer focus on Oppenheimer as a character rather than also have so many other moving parts that somewhat take away from the dramatic weight. But on the whole, strong themes, great performances, and a lot of strong moments make this film something I would recommend.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 21, 2023","Excellent film and one of Nolan's best. Easily his best script and Cillian Murphy delivers the performance of a lifetime. This is a movie refreshingly devoid of CGI and IP branding. Its a real, effective drama for adults. The long runtime seemed to fly by and I was left wanting to learn even more. Nolan somehow has made the scenes of dialogue more thrilling than any recent action film. Highly recommended.",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","This film was mostly the interrogation of the man who put together the team that made the nuclear bomb. About as interesting as an interrogation of the man who invented the toaster. Everything is drawn out talking. Political rhetoric. I was anticipating more science, explosions, that was about three minutes of a three hour film. If you have ever personally been screwed by the legal system it will be nails on a chalkboard. This will likely be one of the most over rated movie of all time.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Oppenheimer is a sensational film that is an absolute masterclass of movie history. The performances are absolutely incredible, especially from Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. The directing is stellar and yet another proof of the brilliance of Christopher Nolan.

Additionally, this film is a true audiovisual experience with all of its visuals and brilliance use of sound effects that enhance the viewing of the film. All around 10/10 film, one of the best ever made.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Awesome masterpiece. A biography about Oppenheimer is going to be complicated, the screenplay about the making of the United States Atomic bomb could get lost in the tech and simply become a procedural.  Instead we are taken for a ride through Oppenheimer's world that careens through time and space faster than a Japanese bullet train.  Don't get me wrong, this isn't an out of control chain reaction, the story unfolds in a number of time frames and the precision editing keeps it moving along at a comfortable pace for a film that runs over 3 hours. The sound track is amazing, as well as the special effects and cinematography, and nothing outshines the actors - just look at who's in this film - they all do an incredible job as you'd expect.  Do yourself a favor and see it on the BIG screen -IMAX- where available.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","A good movie with the good storyline.

The thing that disappointed me which I absolutely can't stand is when Hollywood tries to force a cringe worthy father, daughter age gap relationship. The actor is 47 and the actress is 27. 

Pretty much there wasn't even a need to do a sex scene between these two. Just seems like a Hollywood agenda to force these types of relationships to be normal. They're not!",NEGATIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",One of Christopher Nolan's best movies. The movie captures the life of Oppenheimer as well as the production of the bomb and the effects. This is a must see and is engaging for the entire 3 hours. Perfect if you are into history and science also.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Oppenheimer‚Äôs story of his journey through physics and his meetings of other brilliant minds that played their roles in the Trinity test is a great part of this film. Oppenheimer‚Äôs past associations with Communist party in the United States gives ammunition to his unknown adversary (for most of the film), while he was never a card carrying member of the party. This film is also about how individuals in our government abusing their power and influence in a grudge against someone they perceive to be an enemy because they don‚Äôt echo the same views or opinions. A cautionary tale with lesson that we all need to learn or learned again.",POSITIVE

Him and Albert Einstein(played by Tom Conti ) were some of my favorite characters. Emily Blunt (Katherine ""Kitty"" Oppenheimer) played an amazing wife in this movie, and stand on her own as a great character to parallel Oppenheimer. James Remar that played Henry Stimson, for the scene he was in was very recognizable with his voice. He did an amazing job. Robert Downy Jr that played Lewis Strauss, the morally grey character. Did an amazing job as seemingly the villain, character. For me, this is best acting role. From what I seen him in. In addition,  David Dastmalchian that played William L. Borden, was a great character. Also with him going through friend and to where he ended up. and Josh Peck (played Kenneth Bainbridge), came an extremely long way from Drake and Josh. With his acting, the characterization he had was amazing.",POSITIVE

OVERVIEW: A fantastic work of cinema made for a movie theater. A film that might bore the general population for about 30-40 minutes before quickly accelerating into undeniably one of the most intense experiences ever in theaters. 

ACTING: Cillian is excellent as expected but RDJ is the one who earned the Oscar. You will not dare take you're eyes off him a second of his screen time. Even in the background he commands his scenes and reminds us he's more than a product of franchise marketing and charismatic characters but one of the greatest actors of our generation. 

FINER DETAILS: Chris Nolan is refreshing and yet undoubtedly Chris Nolan. Choppy editing and beautiful use of sound (it really makes the film at times) creates an intentional yet uneven pacing that won't be for everyone. It's probably one of his more lateral films timeline wise. Through the dialogue heavy film and Nolan's reputation for dumbed down exposition he manages to hold that back as much as he can to string the brilliant plot along well. 

THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM: As a movie about the atomic bomb and it's creator, in this current world matter, Nolan had every opportunity to push politics and certain ideology. And while the film doesn't shy away for a moment from the politics and morality of it all, he plays both sides in a non neutral way while laying the truth out quite well, but inviting the audience to make up their own mind rather than ""helping"" us decide as he could have. 

FINAL THOUGHTS. From the opening sequence to the end you'll feel the heat and intensity. The editing and sound I mentioned earlier play a big part in it and you won't realize what you're watching even if you think you do, and trust me we all did, until the final moments. Speaking of which the ""highlights"" we'll call them will leave you with a mouth open, goosebumps, and on a weird verge of tears. It is a masterfully crafted film that can rival Nolan's impressive filmography for the top spot. Although it can be a slow burn and feel pretty redundant to start, I walked out that theater devastated and emotional in a way movies haven't made me feel in a very long time, and reminds me in the sea of mediocrity, why I fell in love with cinema.",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023",Absolutely astonishing movie!!! For the first time in awhile a movie has fully consumed all my attention! I will never recommend any movie as much as this movie for a movie with a 3 hour runtime I can firmly say you won‚Äôt one feel like you have been there for 3 hours and 2 it will not be a waste of time. A absolute masterpiece that I feel is perfect for people who love the history and the feeling of horror of what is humans can make such mass destruction. The entire cast really really did a great job and as always Christopher Nolan did not disappoint! A perfect 10/10,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","phenomenal.
heartbreaking the things american government did to these scientists as well after they got what they needed from them after putting them through hell. 
oppenheimer's story was so interesting through the lens of Nolan",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023",This movie was great best movie that I've ever seen,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",expected more from Nolan. The hype made it seem like it was going to be a masterpiece but in the end it ended up quite disappointing,NEGATIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Really amazing! For me, the best Nolan movie.
I were with high hopes but somehow the movie were beyond my thoughts.
The first 30 minutes I was impressed, of course, but I couldn't think that would be better than interstellar. 
After that, was like the last season of succession, you can't even breathe.
Nolan explore a lot the silence, the darkness and the sounds, that are sometimes people foots, sometimes are are a music, he explored and worked.
Some scenes to comment: The nudity scenes were perfectly made, wasn't about  sex, there were a whole lot happening at the time (literally in the nudity scene).
The bomb explosion, omg, was exceptional, everybody thinking about the explosion, how loud would be, and I was counting together, but when it happened, hahaha, he made that silence and was really really perfect.
The last one hour particularly, was something of other world, so perfect. The acting (that was perfect in the whole movie) simply becomes above the really good, the actors really give all for us, they need the oscars.
The plot in the end was very good, really surprised the whole theater.
I dont want to write a Bible so, that's it.
This is cinema, just that, Christopher Nolan made what I thought that he couldn't, make a movie better than interstellar, and he not only achieved that but made something that somehow end up being the best movie of the decade.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Amazing movie. Can‚Äôt find a flaw in it.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Masterpiece. Incredibly inventive sound techniques. The trinity test scene will be an iconic piece of cinema.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",A Bit long and somewhat disjointed.,NEUTRAL
"Jul 21, 2023",Simply incredible. I don't know what else I could describe it,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Probably the best movie I have seen so far this year.  Presents a balanced story of Oppenheimer good and bad.  The story is not linear so it goes back and forth.  Oscar worth performances by both Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr.   It is three hours long, so watch your fluid intake!",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",This film was truly impactful on my brain. Genuinely stunning.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",The movie was amazing That was a great experience. The screen was providing surprisingly high quality image.,POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023",Incredible. Best Nolan film yet,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Amazing visuals and sound design, great acting and a compelling story that will get you to think.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Oppenheimer is truly incredible! It‚Äôs not only an impressive achievement for Christopher Nolan, but an achievement for cinema as a whole! I was lucky enough to see this film in 70 mm IMAX and it‚Äôs spectacular! The visuals in this movie are unlike anything I‚Äôve seen before. The sound design, score, editing, cinematography, and more are really top notch and help lay the tone and emotion of this film perfectly. This is one of Christopher Nolan‚Äòs most emotional pieces of work to date. And that is in large part due to the incredible acting by Cillian Murphy! Murphy perfectly shows the internal turmoil that Oppenheimer is going through! He really deserves all of the awards nominations he will get this awards season. There are also some great supporting performances by Robert Downey Jr. and Emily Blunt. It‚Äôs not a perfect movie for me, and it loses a little bit of steam towards the end but at the end I can confidently say it left me in awe! This may just be my favorite Nolan movie to date! Full review coming soon!",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","If you like history, then you need to watch Oppenheimer. Even though it was a 3 hour movie, it felt like under 2.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Another contender for movie of the year 2023.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",While not my favorite movie ever Oppenheimer's historical and political significance and beautiful cinematography and storytelling lend it to be a must watch in my opinion.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Acting was Oscar worthy. Visual effects were Oscar worthy. Was long and a little slow but I would definitely recommend it.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Best picture winner for sure! FANTASTIC from acting to cinematography to makeup!,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","The best cinema experience you will ever have! Must see, would strongly recommend you see on 70mm film",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Speechless! Powerful Film,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","HOLY CRAP!!! What a cinematic masterpiece coming from the legend himself Christopher Nolan!  Coming to the insane visuals and the best storytelling to man. This is a definite watch in IMAX, there's no other way to watch this movie.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Masterclass from Nolan and Cilian Murphy,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Oppenheimer is an incredible film: writing, structure, filmic language, acting by everyone. The lead performances are breathtaking. The film will pierce your heart. It is a masterwork.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Overly long due to Christopher Nolan's fetish for nonlinear story telling, it still comes out as a mostly enjoyable film if you have three hours to spare.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 21, 2023","A long, hot and confused mess.  Intersecting and very confused story lines.  Some written in stream of consciousness, others in narrative.  No beginning, middle and end.  Poorly written dialog delivered by excellent actors.  Needs an editor and edit.  As well as a master's degree in that period's history.  What is this film about?  The development of the atomic bomb?  The consciousness of the bomb makers?  Japan?  WW2?  Communism and the red scare?  Los Alamos and Trinity sites?  Patriotism?  All of the above as well as a few other themes?  Just the power of visiting the closed Trinity site, touching the stone monument, running one's hands over the embedded and radioactive glass beads, the beauty and monumental quality of the site is not displayed here.  I know.  I've been there twice.  The most intriguing moment of the film comes at the very end, when, out of nowhere, JFK is tied to the plot's resolution.  Really????!!!  Watch MSNBC's Oppenheimer documentary first and then this hot mess second, third and fourth!  Good luck.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Just watched it now and honestly it's overrated,  2 hours and 58 minutes of talk, talk, talk, talk and more talk and 2 minutes of bomb testing, no reason for IMAX at all, just people talking.
It looked more like an attempt to clear a guy who knew how terrible his invention would be, a guy who hand picked the drop zones in Japan (as mentioned in the movie), a guy who knew that it will lead to a nuclear arm race. Great score and acting by Murphy and RDJ tho.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 21, 2023",An amazing cinema experience!,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Oppenheimer is an absolutely outstanding biopic of Oppenheimer's life. Though it is also very long, kind of hard to follow, and a real downer.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","The fastest 3 hours of my life! Most would expect a 3 hour bio-pic to be atleast a little bit of a slog, but Openheimer was incredibly dense and fast paced.my favorite movie yet from Nolan.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",This is Nolan at his best. It's a masterclass in every area of filmmaking from start to finish. His ability to tell a story in non-linear fashion is second to none,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Exceptional. Went to IMAX tonight and will be seeing 70mm tomorrow morning. That said, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs Christopher Nolan‚Äôs best movie, but it is certainly his most timely/important. ",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",This was the first 3-hour movie I've seen in 20 years that I didn't take a toilet break during.  Absolutely fantastic character performances and production value.   Can't wait to get to an IMAX 70 theater to see it again!,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",We left the theatre half way through.  Probably the only movie I‚Äôve seen that I thought about asking for a refund.   Fell asleep twice.,NEGATIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Oppenheimer is extremely well-acted with a star-studded cast. The film is made for the cinema, the pacing works as there are frequent jumps from past to present. Robert Downey plays Lewis Strauss and is great in the role, but most of his screen time is inconsequential to the core of the story though gets a lot of focus in the 3rd act. Cilian Murphy is oscar-worthy as Robert Oppenheimer and he tells a great story of a complicated American physicist. Run time is too long at 3 hours. I felt Nolan could have easily cut down 30 - 45 minutes of the Strauss arc and had a more tolerable run-time, I would have given it 4+ stars.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 21, 2023",Oppenheimer is an absolute masterpiece. Christopher Nolan's best film to date. The movie is engrossing from start to finish. And Killian Murphy's performance is a master class.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Nolan's magnum opus. what an achievement.  Murphy and RDJ shine.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Liked everything. Very well done and made movie with a tremendous cast. The makeup artists for this one deserve an oscar!,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","The movie was great. With bias, it was a 100% rating movie. Constructively about 95%. Anything 90+ is acceptable. Firstly, Nolan does not disappoint in the visual department. Good tone, not as sad as it might have looked. Variety as well. And of course, the effects were beautiful. Hard to describe but it felt great. Secondly, the storytelling was great, personally for a few moments a little bit confusing, wasn't sure what was done at what point in time, but that cleared out quickly and it might have been and probably was me just not paying attention at some moments. The story was of course good and well made into film. In this department, I missed only a few things that could be great if portrayed in the movie but in conclusion, everything was well picked and well portrayed. 
The two main parts of a movie, the story and visuals are great and it also holds a strong and well-portrayed message about nuclear power, war and peace.
It was nice to see a movie about Oppenheimer and the whole project made well by a master and masters of their craft, meaning Nolan and all the other filmmakers ofc.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","It's incredible. The movie is powerful & creates a sense of aw that leaves you a little in shock. I did however, feel the trinity test was a bit underwhelming",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Easily the best film of the year so far. some of the best acting I have ever seen in a movie. Must watch for anyone who is a fan of Christopher Nolan.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Long, boring, I know this film has gotten good reviews all around, that's why I went to see it.  But it was over my head!",NEGATIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr give Oscar worthy performances. However, three hours of dialogue is too much.  About 30 seconds of an explosion. Nothing about the scientists killed on the project. Direction and writing were lacking",NEUTRAL
"Jul 21, 2023","This 1-star is not for Oppenheimer, but for the 70 mm screening at AMC Rivercenter 11 in San Antonio. Thanks to an audio issue that they were unable to fix, the screening was canceled 45 minutes into the movie. This format is sold out for over a week, and all screenings were canceled today due to this issue. I have no idea if/when we'll get the chance to see this movie in this format at all now. We'd been so excited and this was horribly handled. A refund is simply not enough to make up for this missed experience, especially for those who travelled here from out of town.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Great movie, a long one for sure. Definitely one of Nolan‚Äôs best.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Amazing cast and acting,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",If you are a fan of movies‚Ä¶this is a movie!one of the best movies I've ever seen.  I was left speechless as I left the theater. It is one of the few movies I can say actually needed the 3 hours. A masterpiece if I've ever seen one.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","It was one of the best experiences I had with movie. It's not an action movie with bombs exploding everywhere, it's deeper than that, it's emotional, it's everything you could ask for.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",unbelievable movie. everyone in the cast put in amazing performances so it's hard to pick a true standout but wow the way the movie really made you feel the weight of what was going on was something special. feels very relevant in modern times as well. I hope people flock to the theaters to see this because it deserves every cent,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Those weren't clips in the trailer, those were full length scenes from the movie.

I never thought I'd say this, but I think I just watched a bad Christopher Nolan movie.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Como mero espectador, venho descrever que NUNCA na minha vida de todos os filmes que vi tive uma rea√ß√£o parecida com a que tive vendo Oppenheimer, para mim, √© uma verdadeira Obra de Arte, parab√©ns ao √≥timo elenco e ao diretor Christopher Nolan, al√©m, claro, de quem esta por tr√°s das c√¢meras do filme. Um sincero obrigado sobre os momentos e a emo√ß√£o que esse filme me proporcionou, al√©m de deixar-me profundamente reflexivo. Que filme meus senhores.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",This is the most important movie of our lifetime,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Greatest movie of all time. Trinity test scene was unbelievable.,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","I tried hard to enjoy, however Nolans use of music to disguise the fact that the editing for the first 2 thirds of a movie is a mess was insufferable. Turning the film into simultaneously egotistical and insecure at the same time. Also the third act ""thriller"" twist/reveal was a sad attempt at justifying the audiences attention past the things they came to see.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Just one word: perfection. The cast, the music, the cinematography, the story. One of Christopher Nolan‚Äòs best movies so far.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Robert Downey Jr. puts on a masterful best supporting actor worthy performance through effective use of his limited screen time to drive the movies multi faceted mystery subplot to its exciting crescendo.

Nolan's excellent casting process for his second tranche characters is second to none.  They truly help bring the story to life and make world feel like a truely lived in place.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","We just saw this in a true DL2 IMAX theater and it was phenomenal. The way the aspect ratio changed with the different time periods was true cinematography and nothing like I've seen before. Yes, the movie is long, but you're watching some of the most brilliant people to ever live make literal history. In our opinion it was worth sitting in the theatre for 3 hours. So you should definitely go see it especially on a true DL2 if you can find one so you can watch it they way it was meant to be watched because it was an amazing experience. üñ§",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",Exceptional and haunting,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Delivered in Nolans characteristically dense, non-linear style, Oppenheimer is a character study, crossed with political drama. The bombs are more likely to explode in intense dialog exchanges than out in the desert, and the first nuclear explosion delivers more on a personal, than spectacle level. Well worth a watch.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","An amazing story, so many details, the ending was amazing and wrapped everything together, the acting was also very well executed. 10/10",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","Incredible, visceral, beautiful",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023",AMAZING! Christopher Nolan is a genius!,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Ambitious and unrelenting, which it needs to be. Although it is unmistakably the work of Christopher Nolan I did find echoes of Terrence Malick, Paul Thomas Anderson and most surprisingly Oliver Stone. Cillian Murphy's performance is revelatory and the supporting cast is fantastic (Robert Downey Jr. is sure to get a Best Supporting Actor nomination). The last shot was a little too on the nose for me (as well as the brief mention of a certain Senator) but they are mere seconds of 180 minutes of pure engrossing filmmaking.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Had the privilege of seeing it tonight,  presented in its full form at the massive IMAX in Indianapolis.  My assumption was the entire film fills the massive screen, but less than half of the scenes did. (striking when it did.) Incredibly powerful score. The rich intensity of film was moving as well, it was nice to see an entire movie on film again. Fantastic Acting by Murphy, Downey Jr, Blunt, and Pugh. About 50% of the film was exceptional to me, 25% could've been cut from the film and still retained its impact, 15% I was indifferent to and 10% was unbearable.

 Really wished for more transparency about the fallout and consequences of the drop- but massive respect for Nolan in not using the horrific images as violence porn for affect. It's a film mostly about one Man's stress- and lacks the power of Nolan's other films. There was so much left out of Oppenheimer's story.

 Ideology and science govern all of our lives, but in this film, Its narrow intense look at the landscape of law, did not teach me new about the human experience. Curiosity is often destructive, war is cruel. Mankind is weak to its own impulses. We try to make laws of life and morality, we know this. It was an important story to tell, but I would not watch again.",NEUTRAL

I love the practical effects that Nolan was able to put into this film and how he uses sound as a device so that we can feel when the Atomic bomb was dropped. The cast were incredible. I think this is Cillian Murphy‚Äôs greatest performance as an actor. He doesn‚Äôt need to talk for us to know what is going on. Robert Downey Jr. really sold himself in this and both men were incredible together. Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh were amazing as well.

Nolan is experimenting with new styles of surrealist and subjective filmmaking to him which is so incredible to see from such a seasoned writer and director. He's pushing the envelope with Oppenheimer and challenging the audience like never before.

Nolan's character study merges a thematically resonant story with a breathtaking soundscape & epic visuals. The IMAX experience for this one is a must.

You will need to stay focused because the film moves very quickly with sharp snappy dialogue.",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023","The movie plays a lot with our emotions. It is a film that has an endless number of themes and sub-themes on the one hand science and on the other the philosophy with which it takes us by the hand to understand why the atomic bomb was made. We went through infidelity, morality, law, politics, and communism. It is definitely a movie that everyone has to see at least once in their life. Possibly win for best picture at the Oscars. Do yourself a favor and watch it in IMAX.",POSITIVE

Mas openheimer de nolan mostra que tudo que criarmos ira ter ou j√° existe consequ√™ncias.. define um grande passo para a humanidade na ci√™ncia qu√¢ntica, mas o maior j√° dado para destrui√ß√£o e um  regresso  sem precedentes. Obrigado nolan!",POSITIVE

"Jul 20, 2023","Christopher Nolan deserves everything and then some! You need to watch this on IMAX cause the visuals are terrifyingly STUNNING. Another masterpiece from Nolan that leaves you speechless and in awe, while clutching your pearls‚Ä¶ The cast over-delivered, with a few unexpected cameos.",POSITIVE

"Jul 20, 2023","A perfect biography of the father of the Atomic bomb, but to some it might still be a confusing movie.",POSITIVE
"Jul 20, 2023",One of nolan's best films if not the best.Loved the realism in every part of the movie and it surely had left me thinking about the film and the  historic story that it was based on since i watched it and it left a huge trace in me in which the beauty and the intelligence u feel allowed my mind to reach certain thoughts I've never thought of.Nolan always surprises us in the ways of how he can play with timelines but to do this in a biography movie is something else!!,POSITIVE
"Jul 20, 2023",Perfection in everyway. Nolan is a treasure.,POSITIVE
"Jul 20, 2023","Oppenheimer is more like a documentary, than a movie. It's way to much of everything, way to long, to boring, to melodramatic, and to way to noisy and loud, it has a lot of unnecessary scenes, the nudity and sex were not only unnecessary, but disgusting. The story is interesting, but Nolan's way of telling it's not good at all, is confusing. I just liked the role of Robert Downey. The worst part of the movie is the soundtrack, It's unbearable! To much noise all the time, because that's not music. Don't waist your precious time, you can do a lot of fun things in three hours.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 20, 2023","It's a masterpiece. As a historian from the moment the movie was announced I was extremely curious and excited (American Prometheus is one of my favorite books).
Since I discovered what a talented actor Cillian Murphy is, I became a huge fan and I've always been disappointed, because he didn't get enough credit for his work. I hope more people will be able to recognize his talent after watching the movie.",POSITIVE
"Jul 20, 2023",This movie is a monumental achievement in cinema. Superb acting and incredibly cinematography not perfect but one of the best films I've seen. Please go watch this!!!!,POSITIVE
"Jul 20, 2023","Another cinematic masterpiece from Christopher Nolan. Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.

Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.
The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.
Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.
Ludwig G√∂ransson's work in the musical aspect of the film is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. Visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge. In fact, his movie is a masterpiece in pretty much all technical fronts as well.

The year is not done yet but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead. Give Nolan his Oscar!
I highly recommend this film to everyone. Watched it 5 times on IMAX already, and if they return it to theatres before awards season I will go and watch again.",POSITIVE
"Jul 20, 2023",I Just finished watching Oppenheimer and I need to say it This is one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life. I'm speechlessüò∂ One of the finest and marvelous acting done by both Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. With all the supporting cast has done an incredible job. What I enjoyed about the movie is that the theories made by Oppenheimer about the hydrogen atomic bomb and using it against the war between Hiroshima and Nagasaki which also led to even deeper investigations and a good battle in which he didn't gave up and kept fighting through till the end. 10/10üëÄ This is gonna go down as one of the best films in this decadeüòéüòéüòé. I highly recommend to watch this legendary filmü§©ü§©ü§©üî•üî•üî•.  Oppenheimer is Christopher Nolan‚Äôs best work to Dateü´°,POSITIVE
"Jul 20, 2023",Phenomenal..Cillian Murphy was INCREDIBLE and I left with the painful awareness of the internal conflict that Oppenheimer had.and disgust of Washington throwing him under the bus after.,POSITIVE
"Jul 20, 2023","Christopher did it again. This movie was absolutely fantastic. One of the best of his entire career. Cillian shines in every moment. He's literally THE character and plays it flawlessly. RDJ is basically him, his personality is on the character and plays him perfectly. Visuals are stunning. Soundtrack is mesmerizing. Just a Nolan film. It's definitely a 10/10 in every aspect.",POSITIVE
"Jul 20, 2023","Eagerly anticipating this film, I harbored great hopes of a gripping experience. The exceptional performances and stellar cast left an indelible impression, yet the historical narrative meandered without reaching its cinematic peak, as if stuck in a political History class for 3 hours. 

The director's intent, whether deliberate or not, failed to transcend and engage the viewer, leaving a void in the underlying story. The score, though sporadically evocative, lacked coherence with the film, an F grade imitation of Hans Zimmer's finesse, lacking the intuition to know when silence is necessary - and failing to do the thing Zimmer does best; motif. 

It was revealed Oppenheimer created the Atomic Bomb, whilst the film failed to ignite. My desire to adore this film was left unfulfilled, yearning for the elusive",NEGATIVE
"Jul 20, 2023",This movie kicks in hard. Absolut must see.,POSITIVE
"Jul 20, 2023","No word's to say! 

A Nolan Masterpiece ‚ú®",POSITIVE
"Jul 20, 2023","Pretty disappointing to be honest. Lacked the intensity I expected, very shallow and not elaborated enough the character of Oppenheimer. Scientific achievements were taken for granted, and his beliefs not properly explained.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 20, 2023",one of the best movies i have seen recommended,POSITIVE
"Jul 20, 2023","Apsolutely peak cinema, beautiful story telling with amazing sound design that lets you feel what the character is feeling",POSITIVE
"Jul 20, 2023","As a to-be-physicist this movie was the literal best experience I've had in cinemas. The cast is perfect, the cinematography and sound no less and the plot is extraordinary, though very hard to comprehend. It takes probably 2-3 watches to understand everything but that's what I'd expect from a Nolan movie.",POSITIVE
"Jul 20, 2023","One of Nolan his greatest achievement about one of humans greatest achievement, gave me goosebumps throughout the movie, sometimes a little too fast paced but in the end it all made sense. This movie will defintly be one for the history books.",POSITIVE
"Jul 20, 2023","Simplesmente,  incr√≠vel 
Um filme focado na trama do personagem com grava√ß√µes cinematogr√°ficas impec√°veis",POSITIVE
"Jul 20, 2023",Amazing. Didnt feel like 3h.,POSITIVE
"Jul 20, 2023","I thought I had paid for an IMAX ticket, but, alas, I guess I can't understand this European language where I am now. So, this review is for a regular screen. I intend to rewatch the movie asap at an IMAX theatre.

Christopher Nolan made a cohesive, moving, thrilling film. The casting was brilliant. Cillian Murphy, as expected, gave an outstanding and magnetic performance. I also loved the performances of Josh Hartnett, Matthew Modine and Rami Malek (who? me? I'm not boy crazy). But Casey Affleck is in this movie? I don't recall seeing him.

I appreciated the intermission (about 6 minutes where I was) but a couple of more minutes would have helped me.

I teared up towards the end, and it didn't help that when I went to Lidl, a German grocery chain, for some groceries afterwards, the song playing in the store was haunting and in a minor key.",POSITIVE
"Jul 20, 2023","One of the best movies i ever saw, the details in the film, the music, sound, just absolutely perfect. Masterpiece by Christopher Nolan once again. ABSOLUTELY PERFECT",POSITIVE
"Jul 20, 2023",It was the best movie i have ever watched‚Ä¶ had to sit in a theatre a few minutes after it ended as i had to gather my feelings and strenght to continue life..,POSITIVE
"Jul 20, 2023","An epic biographic feature about a truly fascinating Personal Story of Robert Oppenheimer. While at times the length of the film is noticably, the end and final scene makes for a great impression, that leaves you thinking long afterwards.",POSITIVE
"Jul 20, 2023",Absolutely incredible! A must watch for everyone. Especially if you've been to the Hiroshima peace memorial museum! The movie puts the meaninglessness of the Atomic bomb into perspective in a beautiful way...,POSITIVE
"Jul 20, 2023","I expected a better movie. Technically it's fine, but in terms of screenplay it's extremely tiresome and ambitious. Some actors stand out, however, although many applaud it is still the story of a murderer.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 20, 2023",Absolute Masterpiece.,POSITIVE
"Jul 20, 2023","I have just watched it and it was a masterpiece & mind-blowing! I knew it was gonna be this masterpiece bcos it was directed by the most-hyped director of the last fifteen years, Mr. Christopher Nolan! üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª",POSITIVE
"Jul 20, 2023","Christopher Nolan voltou com mais uma Obra de Arte. Ele pegou uma hist√≥ria hist√≥rica que conhecemos um pouco e a transformou em um drama de cora√ß√£o na boca, O Oscar pode esperar porque esse mais novo filme do Nolan pode levar tudo esse ano.",POSITIVE
"Jul 20, 2023","Oppenheimer is what cinema has been waiting very very long for 

christopher nolan Made a masterpiece that rivals his best other work 
Which being the : the dark knight 

It's story telling. 
The dramatic drama 
Character building 
The practical effect over cgi 
The sound design 

Everything works so well that this movie is so genuine in what it wants to be 

I could continue to list everything so good about the movie but that would honestly spoil you of how well the movie is 

It's worth watching especially in a imax theater 
It may release in America on the same day as Barbie 

But this is worth watching far more then Barbie",POSITIVE
