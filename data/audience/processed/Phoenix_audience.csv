"Aug 21, 2022","Well structured with some unique dynamics involved, but maybe a couple too many. Alot goes on in this, which naturally causes focus problems for some viewers... and explains while I didn't hear about it until now.  At least they avoided flash forwards and flashbacks.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 16, 2019",Raining all the time in this movie.....i wish it was that rainy here in Phoenix.....,NEUTRAL
"Sep 23, 2018","Danny Cannon's film noir features an impressive cast but nothing new, storywise.",NEGATIVE
"May 5, 2017",Watchable B-movie. Has many holes in its storyline but given the b-rate cast this is to be expected. Watch it without too much expectation/hope for it and you will enjoy it best. Ray Liotta gives a decent performance.,NEUTRAL
"Feb 18, 2016",another tale of a good cop gone bad,NEGATIVE
"Oct 19, 2014","Uninspired 1990's Tarantino rip-off, complete with violence, crime, humor, pop culture, and even a slow motion walk of a crew of dudes over the opening credits. Highly derivative and offering nothing original. The only saving grace is that the film somehow managed to wrangle a strong cast of leading men and women, along with a lot of familiar character actors including Ray Liotta, who was also one of the producers on the film, Anthony LaPaglia, Daniel Baldwin,  Jeremy Piven, Royce D. Applegate, Xander Berkeley, Brittany Murphy, Giancarlo Esposito Anjelica Huston, Tom Noonan, Giovanni Ribisi and Kari Wuhrer (who I've always kind of had a b-movie crush on). Graeme Revell provided the music.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 26, 2014","Ray Liotta flicks don't generate a lot of positive buzz, but I like his acting which I find personable and quirky. Here he plays a bad cop with a gambling addiction and manages to make me like the character. Throw in early performances by Brittany Murphy and Giovanni Ribisi and the always sexy Kari Wuhrer, and I was even able to stomach Anjelica Huston (something I can't usually do). Good stuff.",POSITIVE
"Jan 19, 2014","Crappy start, good ending.",NEUTRAL
"Nov 10, 2013",Good movie. Definitely not your typical bad cop movie.,NEUTRAL
"Oct 20, 2013",Ray Liotta really delivers in this role. Slow burning and character driven. This is one of the best neo-noir crime dramas doing the rounds.,POSITIVE
"Aug 23, 2013",Betrayal and deceit is the underline plot in this semi-heist movie. Its worth watching.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 31, 2013","The main character's role as an antihero-spiraling, looser is intriguing enough to watch. The villains are dynamic. The plot needed some more sustenance. I enjoyed it without any high expectations. A classic 'B' flick.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 17, 2013",Definitely one of the most underrated crime dramas I've ever scene. That's all thanks to a great cast and smart pacing back and forth between characters.,POSITIVE
"Sep 30, 2012","I almost didn't even watch this movie because of all the negative reviews on it. I'm glad I did. 
I suppose I'm the minority hear but I did enjoy this movie. Ray Liotta played his role well and so did most in the film. My belief is many people underate this because they have missed much of the subtleties. When it doesn't seem like it, charactors are being developed. I agree with many that there could be much improvement to the film, but i still thought it was great.

The movie was a great framework, a little needed to be added to spice things up. With maybe 20-30 more minutes of film added they could have developed deeper charactors and a thickened plot. If they spend a little less time on basically unimportant dialog, they could have humanized the charactors more. 

The film, in my opinion, was good but would easily be great (maybe even a classic?) with the following:
-Deeper plot development
-More development of charactors(background, habits, personality, humanizing, emotion)
-More time spent on antagonist like Louie, Lt. Clyde Webber and especially Chicago
-Development of the relationship between Harry and Leila, or just leave the parallel love story out to make time for other scenes
-Less ambiguous ending, Particularly charactor motivations. for example:
  - Why did Nutter and Henshaw decide to have a shoot-out with the cops instead of trying to pin it on Harry Collins? They didnt seem to be backed in a corner.
  - Why did Henshaw kill Nutter as he was surrendering to the cops, ensuring his own death?
  -Why did Harry keep only SOME of the money to send to Leila and burn much of it rather than keep all or most of it?
  -Why didnt Harry take the money after Chicago and his boys were dead?
  -Why didnt Harry Collins say goodbye to Leila or try to run away with her, with the money for a better life?

This seems like it may be a lot to change or a lot to improve a film but when you think about all that went into the film it really is not that much to change or add. It would have been a good bit of time as far as filming these changes would go but thats it. This movie was great in everything it did, but only good because they left much of the juicy goodness out. As a resuult of this I am giving it an 80%, I would prefer to go with 75% but RT does not allow for this which they should.",POSITIVE
"Dec 8, 2011",Unknown but pretty darn good,POSITIVE
"Oct 24, 2011","A classic rare gem, Ray is an awesome actor, what is wrong with you people.  Ray Liotta have you have you ever watched him, act, seriously, this is a master at work, if you look up in intense in the dictionary theres a picture of him, explaining the word.
Movie dick over and out",POSITIVE
"Apr 20, 2011",Some sharp writing and good performances from Anthony LaPaglia and Anjelica Huston make this otherwise drab movie worthwhile.,NEUTRAL
"Apr 10, 2011","Superb acting of Ray Liotta. Good plot, action, and ending.",POSITIVE
"Mar 16, 2011","Great cast, good story, Kari Wuher.  No way this one could miss.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 6, 2010",the film satisfies the goal: entertaining.,NEGATIVE
"Apr 29, 2010",Poor thriller without a standout storyline and actors who can't rise to their roles.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 27, 2009","Harry is a police officer - he is also a degenerate gambler in debt to bookie Chicago for $32K. That's basically the plot, it seems simple but it is enough to drive the film's core once it has been surrounded by plot twists, tension, strong performances, interesting characters and good dialogue.

Hats off to Danny Cannon - he was the great British hope once after making Young Americans and going to the US he then messed up with Judge Dredd. But here he shows that he does have talent to lead a dark thriller successfully - albeit he is helped greatly by the plot and his actors. The film follows Harry and his 3 colleagues as they revolve around several loan sharks and bookies whilst also trying to have lives and relationships. The main focus is Harry's addiction to gambling in all areas of his life. There is also a subplot involving Angelica Huston which is meant to represent Harry's potential redemption, but this is not well developed and is secondary to the main story. The story eventually turns into a heist-gone-wrong movie but even then has enough twists to keep the interest.

The main strength of the film lies in the actors that are assembled together here. Liotta plays the role well, making it possible to like this person but also making his gambling side believable - it's hard not to feel for him and his bad luck as the film progresses. Anthony Lapaglia, Daniel Baldwin, Jeremy Piven are all excellent for different reasons as his colleagues. Piven good as the cop drawn into things he doesn't want to do and Baldwin and Lapaglia are as solid as every in corrupt roles. Both Ribisi and Huston are capable of great performances but neither have a lot to work with here in terms of time or plot involvement. Giancarlo Esposito is as good as ever in a small role as Louie the loanshark - but then I've never seen him put in a bad performance, even in a bad film.

Overall the plot is similar to many other crime thrillers out there. What makes this rise above the normal TV material is a dark atmosphere from Danny Cannon, a strong lead in Liotta with uniformly great support from the rest of the cast and tension an twists throughout.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 30, 2009","Phoenix... a little belter...Ray as harry a hopeless gambler, who just happens to be a cop.....1 of his best `TWISTED` cop roles....up to his neck in debt to a loan shark...desperation, tension & twists all the way through keep you glued to the screen....& the delicious RAY....solid cast...unusual match with Anjelica Huston...1 to watch again & again...just did......",POSITIVE
"May 5, 2009","Not bad thriller about corrupt cops, containing enough violence and decent humor mixed well together, with great performances by Anthony LaPaglia and Ray Liotta, and with young super sweet Brittany Murphy.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 31, 2009","British director Danny Cannon ('The Young Americans', 'Goal') manages to assembe an impressive cast headed by Ray Liotta involving a game of poker and a heist, but somehow the movie never quite takes off as originally intended in this underrated low-budget thriller. But there are certainly some great moments, including an exciting final shootout and Britanny Murphy is much better looking as a brunette than as a blonde.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 7, 2009","An excellent film which somehow seems to have escaped public acclaim. The basic storyline is quite conventional - it's based on the well-known fact that any serving police officer in the United States is necessarily corrupt, venal, violent, sexually promiscuous (not to mention abusive and perverse), frequently drunk, often overweight, and at least borderline psychopathic ... unless their name is Cagney or Lacey (although overweight can apply in this case). Ray Liotta plays a more or less honest cop who has a major flaw - he gambles (on anything and everything) and he is currently on a losing streak which has left him heavily in debt.

Liotta finally realises he has no option but to obtain money illegally, but he'll only steal money from crooks, money which has been illegally obtained - like I say, he's more or less an honest cop. It should come as no surprise that a gambler may not be the best person to assess risk or to plan a robbery when his major worry seems to be whether or not he'll be lucky. He is, of course, not going to be lucky. The heist, when it happens, does not go altogether smoothly - which doesn't diminish the fact that this is one of the best, most memorable hold-ups on camera.

It's a well shot film, neatly edited, with excellent performances from the entire cast. Liotta is rugged and charming, delivering a convincing portrait of a man obsessed with the nature of luck and the need to try to capture it, challenge it, beat it. He's a man with morals, and with the absolute conviction that you have to honour luck, that you can't welsh on a bet, or a debt. The film has a noir feel to it, though shot in colour and in far too sunny an environment.

If there is a weakness, it might be the setting - the action takes place in Phoenix, Arizona, but you rarely get any sense of place; there are a couple of shots of cactus to remind you it's in a desert, there's a neat panoramic view of the city with mountains in the background, but really, it could just about be anywhere. The city is anonymous, the action finely paced and the plot given a mounting dynamic. It is a much underrated film, certainly better than average, and deserving of a wider audience.

Translation to DVD is fine - though you do get the sense the odd establishing shots of desert and wide open spaces would be much more impressive and effective on the wider screen.",POSITIVE
"Feb 11, 2009","Fun and  underrated movie.  While it does have a distinct ""90s"" feel to it that may make it feel dated, its still an overall good movie.  I liked the whole neo-noir atmosphere to the writing,and all the acting is very fun to watch , especially Ray Liotta.  Jeremy Piven is also good in the scenes that he shows up in, playing a character much different than ""Ari Gold"".  Also the score by Graeme Revell is really good, especially when its used in the final scene when Ray Liotta goes off on his ""King Kong"" monologue.",NEUTRAL

"Dec 29, 2008","a brilliant film wi ray liotta in top form, great story-line anall, vg.",POSITIVE
"Nov 19, 2008","Surprisingly well made noir flick. Don't let the poster fool you, the heist thing is not the main focus of the plot. The casting makes this work, Liotta can be fun to watch in the right roles. Anjelica Huston's casting do make for an odd choice.",NEUTRAL
"Sep 26, 2008","A cop witha  gambling habit who does some bad things but it's ok cause he has a moral code - yes a slightly wacked moral code but one none the less. But there is the problem, I couldn't buy into that this guy was ok because he did beleive in something. This fails to get the same character empathy as goodfellas - althoguht thatis what it is clearly trying to create a goodfellas cop thing. In the endyou don't care too much for the main character and sympathise more with those who get in the way. Even at the end where the character attempts redemption through action eels hollow and the fillm ends and feels incomplete - justice has not been served - and these guys are supposed to be cops. It's Ok when mobsters act like mobsters. a Poor film -not worht he effort to look for this one but if it's on the TV give it a go",NEGATIVE
"Sep 6, 2008","Harry is a cop whose gambling habit gets him into trouble. Not a bad neo noir, especially as I got it at WH Smiths for a quid!

The influence of tarantino can be seen in parts of the film, which went straight to video and premiered on TV rather than in the cinema. Some good performances and an enjoyable enough flick for fans of the noir genre.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 26, 2008",every now and then a low budget film comes along that's made what it is by a certain actor being in it. this is one of those. ray liotta owns this film. he plays a gambler that can't stop himself but there's a good man fighting to get out. he has his own moral code which includes never welching on a bet. it gets him into all sorts of trouble with his gang of crooked cop friends. the dialogue in this film is the dogs nads. i love the king kong rant in the car!! haha fricking awesome movie,POSITIVE

"Apr 10, 2008","A VERY UNDERRATED THRILLER FROM THE DIRECTOR OF JUDGE DREDD.THOUGH IT NEVER GOT TO SEE A THEATRICAL RELEASE AND WENT DIRECTLY ON TO VIDEO , THE MOVIE'S MUCH MORE THAN A MEDIOCRE POLICE THRILLER.UNLIKE MOST OF THRILLERS MADE FOR VIDEO , PHOENIX HAS A SMARTLY WRITTEN SCREENPLAY THAT COMBINES VIOLENCE AND HUMOR EFFECTIVELY BUT THE MOVIE'S STRONGEST HAND IS IT'S TERRIFIC CAST LED BY A SUPERB RAY LIOTTA...",POSITIVE

"Apr 20, 2007","An interesting tale of gambling, money and betrayal.  A great part played by Ray Liotta, but did anyone else feel that he and Angelica Houston were oddly matched?

This film shows a very young Brittany Murphy.

  And he carries this movie. He manages to bring his character to life, the other cast members don't.
  I don't blame them, their characters aren't fleshed out that well. The unneeded love story didn't help.
  Neither did the dialogue, that all too often tried to copy Tarantino's.

[font=Book Antiqua][size=5][color=#000000][color=black][font='Book Antiqua']  Hello again! I watched this movie last week called, ""Phoenix"".  I really liked this movie.
