"Apr 14, 2024","So dumb, bad acting, predictable, dumb... Like really dumb.",NEGATIVE
"Apr 14, 2024","It is an obvious Seven Samurai Sci Fi ripoff. Seven Samurai is an be if my all time favorites,  and this movie does it justice. The visual effects are outstanding and the creatures are some of the best ever. I am very pleased that I turned this on.",POSITIVE
"Apr 13, 2024","Characters are too dull,too many unnecessary scenes that tried to look cool. No chemistry among the ""rebels"". With all the scifi movies and series being released recently, this one seems outdated in terms of themes and direction. 10 year old kids would love this though.",NEGATIVE
"Apr 13, 2024",Another star wars imitation gone wrong . When the girl brought the bird back to life I just had to laugh. What the flip is this üò≠,NEGATIVE
"Apr 10, 2024",One of the worst movies I've ever wasted time watching. Comical how bad this was.,NEGATIVE
"Apr 10, 2024","Visually it's a very impressive film. Lots of great sci-fi action sequences and the slow-mo fight scenes are pretty fun to watch. However, the overall story feels pretty generic and bland. The main characters literally just go on a fetch-quest for bunch of people that they've heard of who can help them on their journey, watch as they demonstrate some kind of badass ability or fight, and then they join the group. That's pretty much it up to the end fight against the main villain which was also pretty underwhelming. While it has its fun moments, overall it falls pretty flat. Let's hope part 2 coming up soon expands the story and makes up for the lack of substance in part 1.",NEGATIVE
"Apr 9, 2024",I'm impressed with the bad reviews...I loves this series. I thing was amazing!,POSITIVE
"Apr 8, 2024",Everything star wars still wishes it was!! Absolutely brilliant movie!,POSITIVE
"Apr 7, 2024","This movie was great.  Not perfect but great.  Funny, expansive, world building, familiar but not a duplicate.  It was FUN...remember when movies were sometimes just entertaining and FUN?  When everything did not have to be a shakesperean or orwellian masterpiece and it could just be loud and entertaining and scary and funny and diverting and FUN...well it was.",POSITIVE
"Apr 7, 2024",I really enjoyed the show nd can't wait for part 2,POSITIVE
"Apr 5, 2024",It was rushed and had the most generic charachters. And the big finale didn't make any sense. A Dreadnought that literally leveled planets a minute before gets defeated by a guy with a spear.,NEGATIVE
"Apr 4, 2024","It was nice break from reality which all this type of movie needs to be. Looking forward to part 2.

If you're expecting cinematic greatness go watch Citizen Kane or Ben Hur.",POSITIVE
"Apr 4, 2024","I knew nothing about this movie before I stumbled on it. Wow! Love the story, love the perfectly cast characters. It is a great action adventure movie. Not long before I hit pause to Google who the director is. No surprise. I've watched it twice and will watch it again.",POSITIVE
"Apr 3, 2024","Rebel moon has rich visual storytelling. The opening scene with the narrative of an empirical world who destroyed their planet and the tragedy that forced the loss of their Monarchy, teasing treachery, and political intrigue and strife while introducing an indomitably cruel and sadistic minor antagonist who is but a pawn for the final Villain antagonist directing things from the shadows is an ominous launching point for the story.  

The protragonist, Kora, later to be revealed to be a girl in hiding by another name has an intricately complicated relationship with the final Villain antagonist which only strengthens the plot surrounding her journey to gather individuals to her cause that could defeat this indomitable foe.

Her journey however, begins on a planet as a simple farmer, but we soon learn what she is and her intricate background soon reveals itself in narrative and action as well as her knowledge of how to deal with the newcomers to the planet Veldt, which to the imminent peril of the inhabitants of Veldt is largely ignored. 

The history of the story at times is spoken in narratives to move the story along, but this seems to be due to the time limits placed on the story, which sits roughly at 2 hours and 16 minutes. It could have been an 8 hour show, filling with  expansive descriptive storytelling about the people, the universe and the cultures.

The actual narratives accompanied by flashbacks are rich with historical significance and recognizable symbolism, and has all the action packed nuance of previous Zack Snyder works with well choreographed fight scenes that move the story in references to previous scenes, and expansion of the influence of powers in the universe. These action scenes also offer supplemental knowledge to the dialogue revealing strengths, weaknesses and experience of characters that help you understand who they are, where they came from and why they are there. 

This first installment is an incredible introduction into a rich and vibrant universe that has the potential to become more than just the story that's told, and I look forward to future installments that continue to create a more vibrant painting of a universe, it's politics and it's people who live within it.

With incredible performances by Sofia Boutella (Star Trek: Beyond, The Kingsman: the Secret Service) , Djimon Hounsou (Gladiator, Guardians of the Galaxy, A Quiet Place  part II), Ray Fisher (Justice League, The piano Lesson) , Anthony Hopkins (The Silence of the Lambs, The Father, One Life, The Mask of Zorro) and many more.",NEUTRAL
"Apr 2, 2024","When they walked into a bar full of weird aliens and then immediately picked a fight, I told my wife that if they walked out with a guy who had a spaceship to take them to the next place then we were turning it off.  So.  I don't know what actually happened because I had to be true to my word.",NEGATIVE
"Apr 2, 2024","It's like it was supposed to be a short series, with back stories and subplots, but instead we just get little episodes of characters that have meaningless background.

Cool action scenes but a bit over choreographed.

Setting changes were jarring and haphazard.

And the final scene was completely unnecessary.

Always good to see my boy Charlie Hunnam.",NEGATIVE
"Apr 1, 2024","It wasn't as bad as they say but beautiful visually and we shouldn't forget that 2nd part will also come, so just wait and watch.",POSITIVE
"Apr 1, 2024",Nice ! Entertaiment !,POSITIVE
"Mar 31, 2024","Rebel Moon starts off quite well but then the actors starting acting and things go WAY DOWN from there. There's also the immense issue with cinematography which is all over the place, not bringing the characters to life...and many many parts of the story feel cheap and hollow.

I WILL NOT be watching Part 2!",NEGATIVE
"Mar 31, 2024",Still enjoyed it thoroughly despite faults.,POSITIVE
"Mar 30, 2024","Action packed, top notch special effects. Zack has done it again.",POSITIVE

"Mar 28, 2024",This was entertaining.,POSITIVE
"Mar 28, 2024",Dreadful. This is why the DC universe was buried. Watch this then watch Dune for a real contrast in film making.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 25, 2024",Two hours of not caring,NEGATIVE
"Mar 24, 2024","Very predictable storyline. 

Too many cliche characters and introductions of characters with a constant use of average fight scenes to build a connection instead of a compelling narrative. 

Can't go 5minutes without something being in slow mo diminishing actual important/cool parts",NEGATIVE
"Mar 23, 2024",Why do they have electronic doors but do the rest by hand?! After this guy has this griffin ride I had enough.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 21, 2024","Could be cool, we'll see if a poor rating from most viewers kills this franchise where it started.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 21, 2024","Yes, the dialogue is cheesy. Yes, we've seen all the tropes portrayed in this movie before. Yes, the slo-mo was gratuitous. However, the story itself was relatively original, most shots were beautiful, and there's enough familiarity for any sci-fi/fantasy fan to just lock in and be entertained for a few hours. It may not be groundbreaking but it's still a good time and worth a watch if you enjoy the genre. Don't expect to be blown away by any twists or completely original ideas. Instead, enjoy it for what it is: a fun movie with some original creature designs and a classic good vs. space Nazis plot.",NEUTRAL

Minha opini√£o: Resumo √© um Star Wars de 2¬™ classe. Existe um Imperio que domina a Galaxia. Que o seu l√≠der imagina existir um grupo de rebelde e envia Noble no confins da gal√°xia para conter. Porem o planeta que ele vai √© um planeta agr√≠cola onde tem um povoado. Porem Noble tras terror a aquele planeta. E  l√° tamb√©m tem Kora, uma jovem, que esconde algo maior, mas quando ela v√™ uma jovem sendo molestada entra em a√ß√£o e tem a ajuda do androide. Ela sabendo que seria eliminada resolve sair do planeta e conhece Kai e assim resolvem formar um grupo rebelde e v√£o de local em local buscar outros integrantes. Nemesis, Titus, Gunnar,... At√© o momento que est√£o recrutando um exercito. Aparece Noble e neste momento descobre que eiste um traidor, quem ser√°? At√© que sonseguem fugir da emboscada. Os efeitos s√£o bons, interpreta√ß√µes medianas, mas nada que traga de novidade, pois √© um roteiro que j√° conhecemos. Lembra um pouco Han Solo. E temos o rob√¥ que acredito que no 2¬∫ filme tenha uma atua√ß√£o maior. Pois aqui ele ganha vida pr√≥pria.
Roteiro e enredo como j√° descrevi Classe B.
Vale apena assistir? Humm Se voc√™ j√° assistiu, Star Wars, voc√™ se desasmpotar√°. N√£o que seja p√©ssimo, simplemente e classe B.

"Mar 20, 2024","Absolutely abysmal, from beginning to end, with laughable action scenes, card board cut out characters, and the plot my 11 year old self would have written.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 19, 2024",Just a meh! I didn't really liked the main character...,NEGATIVE
"Mar 19, 2024",Why introduce man taming griffin when it won't even be of use later.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 19, 2024","Honestly, considering how much money and effort was obviously poured into this movie, it is one of the worst things I've ever watched. There are one or two okay action scenes, but even those suffer from being overproduced and pointlessly self indulgent. I wish they'd get rid of all the slow motion; maybe then they'd have enough time for an actual story. Terrible dreck, but if you are a fan of bad movies a la MST3K there is solid material for riffing here. Reminds me of Battlefield Earth.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 18, 2024",This was nothing more than a pretty collection of tropes.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 18, 2024","Solid scifi movie with tons of emotion, a good (if not tried and true) storyline, and one that takes itself seriously in a good way.",POSITIVE
"Mar 18, 2024","Great movie of every movie iv seen so far in my lifetime‚Ä¶ This movie along with the scott ridley's alien series with prometheus are thee best. I wonder why it only has a low rating, do people not know what is good and bad??‚Ä¶ All i can say is thank you Zack and cant wait to see the 2nd part of Rebel Moon!",POSITIVE
"Mar 17, 2024",I loved the movie and cast and excited for the second one.,POSITIVE
"Mar 17, 2024",I just find it boring. It just drags on. And then teases a part 2. But I don't care enough about the story or the clich√© characters to want to sit through a sequel.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 17, 2024","The story is borrowed from quite a few different sources, so I felt like I'd seen the movie several times before in some form or another. The fight scenes weren't very well done, the slow motion they're shot in looked to me as if they were trying to hide how bad they were, but eventually made them look worse. 

I do give kudos to the worldbuilding visuals, they were awesome.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 16, 2024",While it has some good visuals everything else was just off. I found myself struggling to pay attention and the overabundance of slow-motion sequences was downright exhausting.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 16, 2024","This movie was in the same category as The Perils of Gwendolyn in the Land of the Yic Yak, which I saw on the recommendation of a 16 year old video store clerk 35 years ago. Lol.so that makes it the second worst movie I have ever seen. I did force myself to finish it.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 16, 2024","The movie had a good idea, but it looks like they couldn't implement their idea. Even though it's visually brilliant and a good idea. The plot doesn't stick together, the characters are largely flat. To sum up, it was a waste of time",NEGATIVE
"Mar 16, 2024",I really don't understand the hate. I agree it's not totally original but I was entertained. Looking forward to seeing the second half and the R rated versions.,POSITIVE
"Mar 16, 2024","Yet another Seven Samurai ""retelling"", this time as written by an apparent 15 year old who wanted to incorporate every Sci-Fi and Anime character they ever encountered.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 15, 2024","I could only manage 25 minutes of this, it is SO bad, it was awful! truly terrible, pacing was incredibly slow, characters were all people I wish they would all kill one another to save me the pain of watching any more, I just couldn't take it anymore after 25 minutes, thanks, but no thanks",NEGATIVE
"Mar 15, 2024",Quand on conna√Æt le montant qu'√† co√ªt√© le film et le r√©sultat a l'√©cran. Les effets sp√©ciaux sont parfois tellement risibles et les acteurs jouent si mal que c'est une perte de temps et que des millions de $ ont √©t√© d√©pens√© pour un travail b√¢cl√©.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 15, 2024","I have no idea why people equate it with a star wars rip off. It seemed much more like a Chronicle of Riddick missed with bad Amime like One Piece. Input Vin Diesel in the main character and boom same thing. It's visually good, but world building was rushed and clearly made to be 3 movies, not one that stands on its own.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 14, 2024","An absolute mess, boring and had really bad acting.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 14, 2024","I really enjoy this film. The colors, tone and pace. Excited to see the directors cut and then part 2.",POSITIVE
"Mar 13, 2024",Seeing as all the reviews seem to be terrible I have to say I am very surprised by that. I found the movie to be very good as I am not one to usually watch sci-fi movies my father turned it on while playing board games and I surprisingly was drawn to it instantly. I think the main issue now days is people not being able to understand some movies aren't for them and instead of giving feedback of pros/cons it's a constant attack against the director and actors/actresses. Excited for part two.,POSITIVE
"Mar 13, 2024","some good materials, a real potential but it would deserve more screen time to go into details. A series format would have been more appropriate",NEGATIVE

"Mar 9, 2024","Way better than your stupid plastic Star Wars.
Seems to be mockery of every bit of sci-fi movies for the last decade or two.",POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2024",Awesome popcorn si fi flick. Can't wait till next. Harsh critics can go fly a kite!,POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024","As someone who had nothing to do with the making of the film I thought it was a fun new adventure something That wasn't already an established Franchise. Like all the garbage That comes out of the Disney franchises These days that everybody seems to want to compare everything else to as if there some kind of masterpiece. That being said this movie is not immune to some hiccups.
 But I was entertained swept up into the universe, Love the cast And the special effects. I was Away from the world's problems for a few hours And enjoyed it, which is at its core. What entertainment is supposed to do i look forward
 To part 2.",POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024","I'm just not sure why this needed to be made, it felt like the plot for a video game from the early 2000s. Everything felt rather flat and uninspired and there were too many characters and not enough development or performance to make me care about any of them.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 7, 2024",I really enjoyed watching and am looking forward to the next movie.  I like the different angles and direction the director has used,POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2024","This was trash. Going in not knowing anything about the movie, I actually paused it to see if it was not the result of some kind of high school project. The acting was ordinary (possibly the result of a poor script) and the story was just lazy. It was so bad that it inspired me to leave my first ever review.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 7, 2024",I don't pay much attention to what the critics have to say about any movie. I rate my movies based on if I was entertained. (and I was),POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","Overall this movie is bad but not funny bad. The first thing one notices right away are the very unnatural cheesy dialogues that seems to spawn out of the blue. Then the acting... Even the main character is really bad. Maybe they had a really tight budget because they spent everything on visuals, which is the only somewhat decent thing in the movie. The plot is also fact paced and confusing, with many unnecessary details that do not make any sense. They use a lot of speech to fill in the gaps but it is not enough and it comes off weird. If I have to read the book in order to understand the movie, it's not a good movie. I had to quit halfway because it wasn't fun. Conclusion: rotten, do not watch unless you want to waste your time, especially if you liked the book.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 6, 2024","Not Zacks best work at all, I dont want to spoil anything for those who havent seen it. But if you watched any Scifi of the last 50 yrs, you have seen this mess. Some good actors, but a lot of over acting too in strange scenes not edited well.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 5, 2024",This was a cool movie. Low score likely from excess of expectations ,POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2024",I honestly didn't see why everyone was bashing the movie the way they did. Was a decent action movie with a good special effects for a straight to tv movie. Yes some of the characters are cliche but you can't be too original now because everything has pretty much been done already. I'd say watch it for yourself before casting judgement and formulate your own opinion on whether or not it's a good movie.,POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2024","Those were 136 minutes of my life I will never get back‚Ä¶such potential, perhaps the only thing were the special effects, EVERYTHING else was so purely done, from the script, to the acting, to the storyline üëéüèΩüëéüèΩüëéüèΩ",NEGATIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","God this movie is awful.
The cgi and the action is good but the rest.
The characters are boring and forgettable and they are a copypaste of other characters.
The villain is the most generic bad dude you could see in a movie.
It's a ripoff of Dragonball,Star Wars and Harry Potter.
I still ask to myself how Snyderbozos like movies like this.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 2, 2024","It has beautiful scenery and effects, the antagonist really leaves an impression, the protagonist leaves us wondering a bit.
To be honest, it feels rushed at some points so it's not easy caring about some characters, but it's a cool action/sci-fi movie overall.
I went in with no expectations and was surprised, so give it a chance if you like the genre and do the same. If you're looking for something life changing and extremely mind blowing, this one might not be for you though.",POSITIVE
"Feb 27, 2024",An absolute mess. A hodgepodge of the worst sci-fi elements all in one film.,NEGATIVE
"Feb 26, 2024",Worst waste of perfectly good effects since Ad Astra. Why not take one of the great SciFi plots (Radch) with a similar setting and make an awesome movie?,NEGATIVE
"Feb 25, 2024","This is unbearable garbage.  2/3 of the movie is slo motion and the other third is lens flares.

I am baffled on how you can rip off so many plot points from other franchises and yet end up with a nonsensical plot.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 25, 2024",Absolute trash in every way. Just horrible. I can't believe there's going to be a second part to this. I won't be wasting my money on it again.,NEGATIVE
"Feb 25, 2024",I enjoyed it. Looking forward to the extended cut which tends to be Snyders bread and butter.,POSITIVE

This is my first review of anything ever. This is how upsetting I found this garbage",NEGATIVE
"Feb 24, 2024",the movie had good visuals and good storyline,NEUTRAL
"Feb 24, 2024","As the beginning of a story, Rebel Moon hits all the marks it aims to. It's a film that wears its influences on its sleeve and still manages to provide a few surprises along the way. In particular, the film's handling of major themes like colonialism and empire are top-notch, providing a grounding realism to what could have been simply a flashy space adventure.",POSITIVE
"Feb 24, 2024","The first hour felt interesting enough.  The second hour felt generic, and ultimately not very satisfying/compelling.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 24, 2024","it tries to create this big world, but gets rushed and ends up to be flat.
In summary, it's a chain of quick quests to get new companions so you can fight the final boss.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 24, 2024","There's a lot of potential in Rebel Moon's universe, but the haphazardly handled mess of a story proves to be a dumb ride from planet to planet in search for a team to fight a battle that never takes place in this movie anyway",NEGATIVE
"Feb 23, 2024",I was thoroughly entertained. Good vs evil. I watched it for entertainment only not to pick it apart.,POSITIVE
"Feb 23, 2024","Slomo. More slomo. Slomo agian. It was literally only slomos. Fight scenes were really bad. Animals well animated. Robots having to much of human movement. No one asked for backstory, got it anyway. Exact the same scenes from H-P, Star Wars etc. Good plot.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 23, 2024",The more I watch the better it gets,POSITIVE
"Feb 23, 2024",Enjoyable film. Loved the action and visuals. Looking forward to Part 2,POSITIVE
"Feb 22, 2024","Visually stunning but the story plot does need some work‚Ä¶ all in all, I actually quite enjoy this movie. Honestly don't get why it get so much hate. Starting to think it got reviewed bombed pay for by Disney to keep their Starwars franchise on top.",POSITIVE
"Feb 21, 2024","Despite the vitriol it received, I oddly found some enjoyment in this film. Its concept may not be original but the CGI effects managed to shine, hinting at a potential for redemption in the upcoming sequel.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 21, 2024","Nothing is special about this film. And a handful of moments, like an acting performance, are terrible. This was part one of a two-part story. We'll see if I see the second part. What I know is that I don't have any investment in the characters.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 21, 2024","So happy I got to see this in 70MM. After a slow start, once the movie kicks into high gear it never lets up. Sofia is a star and a great lead. The other characters could've been more fleshed out but still do enough to be memorable. Can't wait to see the sequel and the extended Rated R cuts.",POSITIVE
"Feb 20, 2024","Great visual effects. Pretty trash acting but i think its more due to poor lines/writing, and attempts to make scenes grandiose and significant (and sooo much slow motion). All in all its pretty cringe to get through.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 20, 2024","OMG, I can't stand watching scenes in slow motion anymore, other than that The movie is only beautiful, thats it.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 20, 2024","Didn't blow me away, was good to watch, worth it's time",NEUTRAL
"Feb 20, 2024","Uggh - this is not an homage to Star Wars but rather a dull mockery of it. So many stolen ideas but, even worse, so very very boring. None of the characters are developed and one feels no investment in any character. Honestly, I was rooting for the bad guys to use their ""death star"" spaceship to blow up everything so that the movie would end. Alas, no such luck.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 19, 2024","This had a lot of potential, but the best character in the film is the villain. If the film had a longer run time it could've had the opportunity to flesh out the characters further. As you get no time to develop Any care for them",NEGATIVE
"Feb 19, 2024","This film was lame, flaccid, boring and had really bad acting. I had to stop watching after 45min. Don't watch unless you're so bored that this couldn't possibly bore you any further!",NEGATIVE
"Feb 19, 2024",This is literally the worst movie I've watched the last 10 years. Please don't make a sequel.,NEGATIVE
"Feb 19, 2024",Movie visually WOW scenery colors tones depth use of slow motion action scenes look pretty good better with some then others story was basic but that is ok most movies take from others n combined and rename etc I would easily recommend this movie which I hope turns into a universe of it's own n competes well with rated R n pg13 titles I'd love for Zack to get a world to display his talents because they r so amazing n this movie shows it. Omg if u thought light sabers were cool this movie does it WAY BETTER so stop reading and check it out emerge urself into the world of rebel moon u wont want to leave I promise,POSITIVE
"Feb 19, 2024","I liked it. The visual effects are amazing and acting is very good. Although the storyline seems to be borrowed in parts from different movies (such as Star Wars), it is grand, epic, has a twist and certainly is entertaining. The good wins over the evil at the end, and thankfully no animals were killed in the process. Good movie and look forward to part 2.",POSITIVE
"Feb 19, 2024","Really solid movie. I know that due to hype and other factors some had really high expectations, but this movie exceeded my expectations. 10 out of 10 will watch it again right before part 2 comes out.",POSITIVE
"Feb 18, 2024","Poor dialog, poor character development and even poor action scenes",NEGATIVE
"Feb 18, 2024",Fantastic fights.  Female protagonist.  What's not to like.  Simplest dialog I will admit but the fantastic visuals are holding all of your attention anyway.  I hope everyone who loves a rebel joins me in watching this exciting movie. I can't wait for episode 2.,POSITIVE
"Feb 18, 2024",Entertaining. It's like if Star Wars and Dune had a baby.,POSITIVE
"Feb 18, 2024","I thoroughly enjoyed this film, as a fan of Star Wars it's a big reason why I enjoy it, I understand for some it feels like a blatant ripoff in a lot of aspects but I think it still does a good job at being it's own thing, and having it's own unique creatures etc‚Äî the constant slow-mo shots were very repetitive and annoying and would constantly take me out of what was happening but it's still a fun movie. Not the greatest thing ever but also not as bad as people make it out to be. Really like the main character and I'm excited to watch part 2",POSITIVE
"Feb 18, 2024",I liked the plot. Characters were badass. effects were decent. Dark tones and atmosphere. I liked the different alien and costumes. Bad guys were your typical space nazis and the main antagonist has a face that screams punchable.,NEUTRAL
"Feb 18, 2024","Too bad, this film could've really been something interesting.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 18, 2024",Too bad it's so cliche and predictable. Set pieces can be fun at times.,NEUTRAL
"Feb 18, 2024","This movie, was a potential Star Wars script, abandoned, adopted and adapted. It's a DEI mess of a movie with zero character development, plot line or focus. Most of the ‚Äòmain characters' don't even have lines for roughly thirty minutes of the movie. The only thing missing from this absolute disaster of a movie is a heist montage, to the tune of a Rick and Morty satire.",NEGATIVE

"Feb 17, 2024",Why even on a Part 2? The sound was great. Other than that a cheesy film with bad acting and directing.,NEGATIVE
"Feb 16, 2024",You can call this movie war because it too is good for absolutely nothing,NEGATIVE
"Feb 16, 2024",if you like slow motion shots then this will be for you..... as every other shot is a slow motion sequence. there were even slower motion moments within slow motion shots.  appears if there is a directors cut that kept all the charachter development to itself. charachters killed off with the music in the background trying to bring some emotion it seems but we dont know why as a viewer that we should care as dont know anything about them other than they turned up 10 minutes ago with a big build up to it.  i am a big fan of the genre but think i will give the sequel a miss,NEGATIVE
"Feb 16, 2024","Devoid of creativity, humor, originality, and entertainment value; as soulles as if it were generated by an AI chatbot.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 16, 2024","Great cast, some great actors in the film. I think instead of TWO PART it definitely should've been compressed into one movie, with a load of the unnecessary scenes cut out. They attempted to make some ""epic"" character introductions, which felt pretty cringe‚Ä¶

Parts of the movie had literally no impact on the overall story apart from being filler. why the heck are some characters speaking in an Irish accent? The plot twists were mediocre and overall progression of the film was disappointing.

It's not something you should go out of your way to watch. However, I will give part 2 a watch as hopefully it's a slightly better than part one.",NEGATIVE

"Feb 14, 2024","This sci-fi action movie was pretty good. Sofia Boutella, Michiel Huisman, Charlie Hunnam, Ed Skrein, and the rest of the cast did a pretty good job in this movie. The plot of the movie was action-packed, dramatic, and thrilling. It's about fighting against an enemy that wants to destroy everything. If you haven't seen this movie yet, check it out sometime. It's not great, but it's still worth it.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 13, 2024",Well its better than the last two Star Wars film......and the only reason why this film is better than those is because this film is its own universe and they are not breaking established lore.

"Feb 11, 2024","Completely lacking in originality and personality, but entertaining enough sci-fi action and drama with a dark and serious setting.  The interplanetary settings and CGI mostly look good as did the frequent action scenes, even if the amount of slow-motion was bordering on excessive.  The plot is your typical child of destiny starting a rebellion to take down the space Nazis by recruiting a multicultural team, but the acting felt awkward rather than dramatic and the lower age rating made it feel a bit tame.  Hopefully the next film will add some depth to the characters and explore the interesting seeds such as the robot's humanity.",NEGATIVE

"Feb 7, 2024","This movie lacks in early character development but doesn't disappoint with a healthy supply of action and plot events.  I think it is easy to dock the movie for the early lack of plot, but it also must be remembered that this is part 1 and if part 2 delivers the same amount of action and build upon the lackluster story, It might blossom into what most of us would consider a terrific sci fi film.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 7, 2024","Gritty. Stunning. Builds a universe on the genius of Star wars, dune, bladerunner et al.  I cannot disagree with the critics on the concepts 'stolen' but does this movie not combine the best of elements of the above.  Epic landscapes, worlds dedicated to mining, human nature at is worst... greed and power, and best....  Where it is unique is in not introducing Jedi force magic like Star wars, therein lies the fantasy of childhood dreams. 
However, we do have several 'magnificent samurai' , who although they do not use magic are so incredibly talented that we are being led to believe that they alone can take a stand against a hugely powerful controlling empire like governance.  The magnificent seven, the samurai too were outnumbered but not outgunned.  In this first movie the inspirational characters needed more development, they needed to perhaps survive an attack and realize that they needed to split up and rally their own factions over time.  The village is merely symbolic here, it's about the struggle against a cruel oppressive rule, a fight for peace through autonomy, a drive for fairness and respect, in that respect it is, or should not be, the seven samurai. Sadly the closing scenes are the seven back on the original planet, perhaps the second movie will see people and weapons flocking to the planet but somehow I doubt it, sadly those super hero types will be held responsible for the defense rather than use their influence to gather support, inspire resistance against the oppressor, lead a truly sizeable force , but then will we criticize for copying star wars again. Easily done but unfair. Every historical battle has had its unequal sides but always had the weaker been able to take stands against the stronger.  Should the resistance in this movie franchise start a guerilla war , inflicting stings and retreating into the shadows or will we then criticize it for representing the futility of our own struggles against oppressive governments and controlling mega corporations.  Ultimately it may come over as a twee, feel good movie based on the fantasy that a small number of skilled individuals can single handedly deliver us from tirany.  'I wish'... Is the downfall of any review. Let's look at what we have, consider the concepts, the screenplay, the cinematography, the predictable script, the heroes, the obvious weak points in the oppressive regime and realize that those of us who hoped for an adult sci-fi have sadly been let down. At least there wasn't a gun toting raccoon and small taking tree in this one.
Do we think the producers and directors had to fall foul of the modern movie scourge of 'general box office appeal'.  Capitalism scores another nail in the coffin of individualism and uniqueness.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 5, 2024","Rebel Moon Part 1: a Child of Fire - 5.7 - So from the get to I had mixed feelings about this movie. It was okay, it was not as bad as some or the internet portrayed it to be, but it was by no means great. It felt like a rushed edgier version of star wars. The fight sceens were great, that was the bread and butter, but the actual character development and plot seemed extremely rushed. For starters so the main plot the army needed to take over this planet to feed its entire army, and then a gang of like 6 people were going to take on this army. Seemed very far fetched, the twist was unexpected, but it was also a character that I most liked so far, so that caught me off guard. Overall it was worth the watch for the fight scenes and pure action alone, but this movie is no second coming of star wars or any space saga.
Hopefully the second part will be alittle better, and I will be there to check it out. The robot ended up being my favorite character for what it is worth. Official sundaynightstreaming rating of 5.7",NEUTRAL
"Feb 5, 2024","I realy enjoyed this film. Best film I have seen this year (2024)

I am going to watch it again and update my review further.",POSITIVE

Not for us!",POSITIVE
"Feb 4, 2024","The visuals are interesting at times especially the alien creatures and some of the ship and the sound effects are very good. For me I can't think of a single other positive, this is simply an extremely poor movie, possibly the worst I have seen in over a decade. The dialog is just atrocious, the acting at best wooden, and the plot somehow manages to be super predictable and at the same time absolute nonsense. Action scenes were so poorly done that they were immersion breaking I struggled to watch.

I think the only reason to watch this is for the curiosity of wanting to watch a high budget car crash of a movie.",NEGATIVE

"Feb 4, 2024","I don't see how it's low rated. I thought it was a series and I wanted episode 2 but it was too long to be one episode. Can't wait for part 2. If the only knock is it borrows story parts from other movies then that tells you all you need to know. It's a great movie and they just found something to give it a negative review. Watch it, I really liked it. Anything in space has to be compared to Star Wars so if it's not a Star Wars story it's a problem! Ridiculous banter I tell you!",POSITIVE
"Feb 4, 2024",Ambitiousness and world-building are the key elements of the film but lacks in character depth and originality.,NEGATIVE
"Feb 4, 2024","I should like this movie. It is Sci fi, action, great effects, but for some reason I didn't. When I thought about why, I realised it is because I had no affinity with any of the characters. I didn't really care if they lived or died. The only one I warmed to was the faceless robot. There is no soul in this movie.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 4, 2024","Really pretty scenes with a ""less than"" story. I actually love all the cast, but the script, story, and pacing were lacking.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 4, 2024","This story has obvious parallels to the Seen Samurai. The first part is about their selection, ending with their return to the village and the resurrection of the evil outlaw. Part two will undoubtedly continue the saga of the defense of the village/moon. Not sure what all the fuss is about....it's like complaining The Magnificent Seven wasn't as good as the original Samurai film. Just make some popcorn and chill.",POSITIVE
"Feb 3, 2024","If you love sci-fi and love fantasy Rebel Moon will not disappoint. 

Zack is building such an epic universe and this film feels like it's only scratching the surface. 

Sofia Boutella is an incredible leading lady and Ed Skrein as Admiral Noble is terrifying. 

If you can't wait for the R-Rated cut I highly recommend picking up the novelization. The PG-13 version doesn't do the story justice.",POSITIVE
"Feb 3, 2024","Beyond bad. Incoherent, derivative, sloppy, boring. The narrative was nonsensical, the action was boring, the ""stylish"" cinematics were interesting‚Ä¶in 300. Now, they are just tired, massively overdone and forced.  The movie was overly long while still managing to feel like another two hours were needed to actually clue the audience into the motivations of the many characters, none of whom were anything but one dimensional caricatures of bad tropes to begin with.  I truly wish I could get the time back in my life that was wasted on this utter garage of a movie.  I knew exactly what was going to happen at the end, even while there being nothing whatsoever that could have clued the audience in. Why? Because it was the stupidest possible thing to happen and that tracked with how bad the movie was.  The only halfway decent thing about the movie were the special effects. Too bad they were so horribly wasted on this trash movie.  Now, pardon me while I leap is slow motion through the air in exactly the same way nearly every character does to come crashing down with whatever random weapon assigned to me onto something that will have zero actual consequence. Again. Oh, just for giggles, again. Once more, because it's apparently my signature and my fans won't know that it's my review without it being done again. And again. Seriously, this movie sucked.",NEGATIVE

"Feb 2, 2024","A visually stunning and engaging movie. Like any first entry, the focus is on world and lore building so the story does come across a bit linear and straight forward.

"Jan 31, 2024","I think people need to not be so over critical about this movie. Yes, it not very original, but what is these days? The cast is impressive and delivered in the acting department. The story was predictable but the majority of stories are these days. I say it's not about if it is original but how well the already done ideas were executed. I personally thought this movie was executed very well. Hell I liked this better than the first part of Dune and I love dune. Sci-fi movies are mostly garbage right now so, this was a breath of fresh air for me. I just think everyone should give this one a chance or even a second chance if they didn't like it the first time.",POSITIVE

I knew about the bad reviews and the story, which is quite close to ""Star Wars"". I usually don't mind that at all and I thought that the bad review could have come from a lot of ""Star Wars fanboys"" who just wanted to hate around.

Unfortunately, the movie is really bad! It's like someone watched Star Wars drunken while reading a fantasy novel and the next morning made a movie out of what he could remember. 

In one of the comments I read something about ""dazzling lights"" or ""dazzling scenes"". That's not an exaggeration and it is not meant in a figurative sense. Really disturbing.",NEGATIVE

But character wise and plot wise it just didn't resonate all the way.  Really bewildering character decisions that keep the plot going or turn it on a dime. Like putting a weapon in the hands of your enemy telling them to do one thing then being surprised when they use it on you kind of thing. Also, the actors and actresses were a little to ""glam"" looking for the character experiences they were representing. That didn't quite work for me.",NEUTRAL
"Jan 27, 2024","Just another low-quality girl boss movie with exceptionally mediocre acting. And I have so many questions.

How is it that the ""farmers"" have no weapons? Wouldn't they all be dead long ago? Too many plot holes.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 26, 2024","cringing in slow motion.
This is a difficult movie to watch to the end. The beginning, the first 5 minutes, is so absurdly bad that it feels like the film is a sarcastic parody of Star Wars, but the narrative tone suggests otherwise. It seems like a script that wants to be taken seriously but lacks a compelling story, is verbose, constantly over-explains itself, with many loose ends in the plot, caricatured characters lacking charisma and clich√©s. The cinematography is poor, the choice of lenses is subpar, with characters participating in a scene appearing out of focus or blurred. Always, always slow motion. Cheesy soundtrack. This is bad in everyway.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 25, 2024","Not bad, not really great though. Flingers crossed the director cut will make this movie really shine, cause I wouldn't say any scenes were bad enough to take out, they just didn't really add up to a whole lot.

Skinny girl beating up grown man wasn't to much. Some things didn't come across, it had so character development in a way. But not really. It felt like explained character for a new franchises universe boring waste of time.. and jet , I didn't hate it. It was only just before the battle sequence I started looking at my phone .. thinking of some random thing.. the movie lost me. Would I watch the movie knowing what I know now ? Probably not.

"Jan 17, 2024","This movie is so bad I actually got a Rotten Tomatoes account so I could tell everyone how bad this is.

Some people say, quite generously I think, this is a space opera in the vein of the ""Seven Samurai"".

That is an insult to at least Six of the Seven Samurai.

This is more like a over CG'd version of ""Battle Beyond the Stars"" which, in itself was a poor copy of the Seven Samurai but at least the characters were well developed.

Rotten Tomates is making me rate this movie by the use of Stars.

I gave it a half a star but, if it were up to me I would give it half of a protostar.

To be honest, much like a plate of Brussel Sprouts, I couldn't finish watching the movie but I had eaten enough to know it had a terrible taste and needed a couple glasses of something to force it down my gullet.

They could have reformed Alex in the movie ""A Clockwork Orange"" by making him watch this instead of ultraviolence.

Could have cured him in half the time IMHO...

While the film introduces viewers to a rich and expansive new universe with intricate characters and deep motivations, it is not without its flaws. The main issue lies in its duration, as it undeniably needed an extra hour or more.

The pacing feels rushed, and if the intention was to encourage viewers to watch the extended cut, it would leave me feeling somewhat deceived.

I find myself wishing this were a series rather than a film, allowing each character the opportunity to shine. With a longer runtime from the start, this could potentially evolve into a new cult classic, and the decision not to provide it with ample time was a significant oversight.",POSITIVE

"Jan 14, 2024","Epic space fantasy. Incredible representation of other worlds. A wonderful escape from - well my daily life! 

I don‚Äôt agree with the movie critics who appear too hung up with derivative references to other movies and consequently and (imho) inappropriately rating movies down. I have worked for many years with professional music recordings and quite frankly everything is derivative - and it is of little relevance. This movie was an epic emotional and experiential escape - and yes it is a movie - and not a TV series like Star Wars' Andor, where the time for solid character development is readily available. Nevertheless it was easy to connect and empathise with the salient protagonists against the Nazi-like galactic regime, and enjoy the journey and vision delivered in Rebel Moon.",POSITIVE

Unlike other reviewers who thought the movie opened slowly, I thought the first half-hour was terrific, leading up to a satisfying action scene that set the story up beautifully.

Casting was good but the acting direction is all over the place. Sets had visual flair but there's just so much nonsense going on that it's distracting. Whatever made ZS's other films so good is clearly missing from this production. Watchmen and 300 were incredible films. ZS's DC films were good.

The main character barley exchanged two words with half her team mates and they were convinced to join her ? Not to mention the shoddy patchwork of sci-fi clich√©s. It felt gimmicky at best and just embarrassing at worst. I hope part two will wrap up the MANY loose ends but oof.",NEGATIVE

"Jan 10, 2024",The visual effects are good. That is where it ends. You can tell the makers have trolls writing good reviews because there is nothing good about this movie. The actors are ok but the writing is so poor you never care about their stories. They are comic book characters with poor links between chapters. I felt like I was watching a video game where you advance to the next level once a key was found and there was no connection between the levels. The writing is so poor. I watch hundreds of movies and this is top 5 in my worst movies ever made. I am sure Part 2 will make it there also. Save 90 minutes of your life and avoid this disaster.,NEGATIVE

"Jan 10, 2024","Spoilers Ahead:

There was nothing original in this movie. I love 300 and am a huge Star Wars fan, so went in with an open mind. But this movie was Seven Samurai/Magnificent Seven set in the Star War universe, with Gamora from Marvel as the main character (Kora's backstory is exactly Gamora's- girl on a planet that is slaughtered by a megalomaniac, she is spared, adopted, and raised by said megalomaniac, becomes a super soldier, and then decides to fight against her adoptive father.) They even had an actor from Gladiator portray a general who was betrayed, and ended up in a Gladiator fighting pit in a coliseum. 

I actually really wanted to like this movie, but it was so unoriginal, and had so little character development, that I just couldn't get into it. 

It only really got my attention with the last shot of the Anthony Hopkins robot wearing the antler crown. I doubt I'll watch part two, but I'll at least read the Wikipedia plot synopsis to see what that was all about.",NEGATIVE

"Jan 8, 2024","Have to admit it this way. I actually loved this film! I know some negative reviews are trying to be harshly against the film because it was ""Inspired"" by Seven Samurai and most other types of films, but honestly, which other films haven't been that way before? This however is definitely not a ""Rip-off"" of Star Wars at all, it is a completely different story compared to Star Wars. It appears such expectations were too high with not enough open minds to take it all in differently. At least I went into this film just open minded, lowering my expectations, without ""Nit Picking"" on parts of it like I used to. Because I enjoyed this for what it is and that's that. It's only a story to setup more happening in part 2, which made total sense. ""Rebel Moon Part 2: The Scargiver"" needs to hurry up though, because it will truly explain a lot more and go deeper. This is part 1 after all. It's a Two-Parter type of film, and patience is the key to slow-paced films like this. Hopefully more installments take place after.",POSITIVE

I also cannot understand the decision by a streaming service to offer a recut of a movie before it's even out - other than to somehow use it as a gimmick to earn more views. I'm not wasting more time watching an alternate cut when this has already been a truly rubbish viewing experience.
I need to go watch re-watch Andor to get this terrible taste out of my mouth.",NEGATIVE

"Jan 7, 2024","I can't believe how astounding this movie is and yet how many bad reviews it has received. It does follow 'The Seven Samurai/The Magnificent Seven,' set up, I love how it has that 'Spaghetti Western' grittiness to it, but that it also has a slower pace in storytelling. Watching this movie made me feel like I was reading a good novel. The flashes of reveals in Kora's past, the mystery over who killed the Royal Family, the glimpses of how the Imperium does things. It is so rich in cultures in its story-based universe.

I will say now that I am a HUGE Star Wars fan and I am happy to see another Space Opera coming out. So others comparing it to Star Wars and are angry that it is not Star Wars, need to chill. This is a different story. 

The CGI is smooth and enjoyed seeing the styles of the spaceships, I am so happy to see a griffin! Loved that part and loved the fight scenes - Kora can kick serious butt!

But anyway, despite what the haters say, Rebel Moon is a good movie with plenty of intrigue, lots of fights, and its story has a beginning, middle and an end that promises continuance into movie 2. Yes, the plot is familiar because it is a Sci-fi version of the Seven Samurai. Yes, we know what is going to happen next, but I simple can't wait for Part 2 and see what other twists Zack Synder comes up with.",POSITIVE
"Jan 7, 2024","No original plot, dismal dialogue, mostly terrible CGI, tired action scenes. The dialogue is so bad that it's laughable, and not even experienced actors can save it. If I see another damned slo-mo fight scene I'm gonna wanna gouge my eyes out. What a mess.",NEGATIVE

"Jan 7, 2024","Rebel Moon Part 1 has some good visuals and passable performances from the cast. There was also a clear attempt to take the world-building seriously, which I appreciate, and it didn't go down the Marvel route of forcing inane jokes and zaniness on the audience every ten seconds in case boredom sets in (these desperate attempts at humour are often the most boring part). However, that's all the praise I can give. The film would've benefited a lot if the characters had more presence and personality, as few of them stood out as memorable. At one point there's a supposedly emotional moment where one of the good guys heroically sacrifices himself, but it has little impact given that we know nothing about him and his personality is 100% interchangeable with several other characters.  The story feel formulaic at times - go to planet, recruit another hero, dump some exposition, rinse, repeat - and there's nothing in the plot you won't have seen at least a hundred times before. So this movie doesn't have anything that marks it out as excellent, but it passes the time amiably enough if you don't expect too much from it.",NEUTRAL

"Jan 7, 2024","Rebel Moon was absolutely terrible. Copious amounts of slow motion just everywhere, the acting was on par with The Room.

But these space pig farmers are ready for a fight! Queue in a space samurai for dramatic effect! It's an absolute disaster caught on film.

"Jan 6, 2024","I liked the start , and the general outline of the story but film probably needed to be longer for more character development for us to have a connection to the characters and there fate at the end ,and main character her actor lacked any gravitas when she was trying to show anger or inspiration.",NEUTRAL

"Jan 6, 2024","Honestly just alright. Don't think it's as bad as people say and also not as incredible as what was promised.

"Jan 6, 2024",I really enjoyed this movie. It feels rare to see this level of world building in movies and especially world building done fairly well.

"Jan 6, 2024","I've never seen a worse film, to the credit of this film.  Not only is every scene a joyless exposition dump or a slo motion fight you've seen 100 times now; but many of the elements most bad movies do ok on are also done terribly here. The Cinematography is bad, the CGI is all over the place, the dialog is horrendous, and most of the sci-fi or fantasy elements are very very obviously ripped from Dune or Star Wars. You would think that if you got the chance to make a Sci-Fi and fantasy universe you'd make your own original things, but nope. The bad guys are a mix of Nazi's and Warhammer 40k; there are Griffins, and most of the plot is just a terrible and boring assembly trying to mimic Seven Samurai. 

Diarrhea is a better time than this.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 6, 2024",Story line was weak.  I'm surprised they made this movie.,NEGATIVE
"Jan 6, 2024","If some kid wrote a movie using scenes from their favorite films you would come out with something better than this. Seriously, the story is stolen from Star Wars, Battlestar Galactica, The Seven Samurai (and every version ever made including A Bugs Life) Road Warrior Furious Road, Harry Potter, Pirates of the Caribbean,  Anastasia, and so forth. Then you do slow motion in every battle scene. You have zero backstory for any of the character so you can't name them or care when they die. And a lot of ""how convenient"" twists. Come up with ridiculous plot twists like an interstellar battle dreadnaught is brought down with a hand spear. And so forth and so on, sheesh. Oh and Focus! Focus!",NEGATIVE
"Jan 6, 2024","Disjointed. Rambling. Rutterless. A very, very poor attempt at trying to steal, then sniff, Lucas' junk-strap --  Soo... thousands & thousands of people died in a misguided effort to save 50 meaningless farmers... lead by a small band of misfits who all met in like a day... and risked their lives for... free?! I was so incensed, I actually signed up for Rotten Tomatoes just to save another life from wasting over two-hours of their lives scratching their head over this drivel. It seemed to have a decent budget, mostly wasted on endless slo-mo, when they should have hired some decent writers -- This is not the sci-fi you're looking for.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 6, 2024",Great production and performances by the cast but it seems so unnecessarily rushed and a mishmash of some pretty tired sci-fi tropes.,NEUTRAL
"Jan 6, 2024","Bad acting, boring and predictable story, and overall just dumb. Not worth watching",NEGATIVE
"Jan 6, 2024","Not sure what the haters dislike about it. Most of them seem to think it fails in comparison to Star Wars which is one of the most overrated storylines in sci fi movie history. An enjoyable 2 hours with a clear beginning, middle and third act.",NEUTRAL
"Jan 6, 2024","Cheesy dialogue which couldn't even be pulled off by the great actors involved. Storyline was nonsensical, like they tried to cram a whole miniseries into 2 hours. Might have been a little better if I had known the entire story before watching because they didn't give you enough story to understand what was going on.

"Jan 5, 2024",Sadly I had high hopes for this movie. Iflt had parts that were very cool then parts that bored me to tears. The scripted needed a rewrite and it could of been awsome. Ohh well. I will skip part too.,NEGATIVE
"Jan 5, 2024","At first I was hesitant, but NOT too hesitant. So I had decided to check this movie and see it for myself (unlike some people who are too far in negativity and listen to just critics all the time these days). Movies don't have to be perfect, oscar worthy, or anything close, but this one was really good to see. I'm not sure what these 1 star low rating people were expecting at all. You expect almost too much and then you'll never like it. Probably not going to enjoy anything that's a simple movie. I went into it with lower expectations, and it paid off. Can't wait for part 2. Haters gona hate! But not me or many others around! YEAH! üëç",POSITIVE
"Jan 5, 2024","Such a disjointed, sluggish, boring mess. The title should be called ""And Then‚Ä¶"" because it's just a bunch of random flashy lights stitched together devoid of charm, characters, or personality. I really wanted to love this movie but was so disappointed.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 5, 2024","I watched the film in its entirety, but it wasn't a movie worth wasting popcorn on.

The beginning of the movie kept me engaged, but it lost me later on. Overall, Rebel Moon has boring and unimaginative characters, dialogue, and plot, topped with poor pacing and an overuse of slow motion. I feel as though the world-building has some potential, and despite my rating I'm interested on how the sequel will turn out.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 5, 2024","This is a great way to kill boredom for a couple of hours.  Is it Oscar worthy??  No.  Do I care, no.  Liked it fine.",NEUTRAL
"Jan 5, 2024","Let's not forget, this was originally pitched as a Star Wars movie, so move past the obvious parallels and see it for what it is. Yes, it's obviously derivative (reread my previous sentence) but it's an impressive attempt to move beyond being rejected by the franchise and carry on regardless. And Sofia Boutella is absolutely awesome in it. Yes, the Empire have been replaced by half arsed Nazi knock-offs and the back story is never adequately explained, but the action set pieces are really well executed. I really don't get the complaints about the amount of exposition, I can't say I noticed it being particularly dry and if you're world building some context is necessary. There are some ropey characters that let it down a bit but overall this was enjoyable. And the trailer for part 2 looks even better.",POSITIVE
"Jan 5, 2024",Excelente pel√≠cula todo un √©xito.,POSITIVE
"Jan 5, 2024","Absolutely loved it. So many negative reviews nearly put me off. I sat back, watched it with zero expectation and thoroughly enjoyed it. For something with so many inspirations and an obvious plot, I honestly could wait to move from scene to scene. I think the fact it doesn't try to hide the story or the influences oddly gives it the freedom to be its own thing. 

Great bit of shameless fantasy in space. I think some people forget what makes a movie great.",POSITIVE
"Jan 5, 2024",I don't know.  It has potential but the antagonists were a bit derivative.,NEGATIVE
"Jan 5, 2024","Dreadful, forgettable, incomprehensible. I know what this film wants to be, but unfortunately, the film does not and struggles to be even a mediocre Star Wars rip off. I mean, Battle Beyond the Stars, the Roger Corman Star Wars rip from 1980 is an absolute master piece compared to Rebel Moon. This is not a rebellion worth joining.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 5, 2024","Tent-poles of an idea with no actual story and rushed to conclude early with an unsatisfying ending. You spend the whole time waiting for a storyline that never comes. The movie started with a cheesy but perhaps promising premise, and went downhill fast. The use of freeze and slow effects were annoying and contributed nothing. The new character introductions were set across all different genres (including Western and Roman) and were timed exactly as they were completing some heroic action, strangely with no normal human reactions from the other people present, but they were cliche and predictable. Even the epic speeches were so cheesy it was painful, and nevermind their motivations. Everyone signing up with no money or incentive was just ridiculous and not thought out at all. Each scene seemed intended to push the story along as quickly as possible to get to the main battle with this elite super special team, but they shut the end of the story down early with the suddenness of a film that ran out of time or budget. It didn't leave any kind of cliffhanger or arc to give the disappointed viewer any interest in the next film. I haven't watched a film this bad in a long time.",NEUTRAL
"Jan 5, 2024","Not the best, but definitely not the worst movie I've ever seen. Story needs more depth and the characters stories were not as intriguing as they could've been but I will watch part 2 when it comes out.",NEUTRAL
"Jan 5, 2024","Poor story, a cliche",NEGATIVE
"Jan 5, 2024","From the very first seconds of the movie we can understand that it is going to be a total absurd. 20 farmers on a moon plowing soil using horselike animals, no electricity, no robots, no gadgets, and they trade their crop to intergalactic rebellion with spaceships, warpdrives and stuff. 
Acting, dialogue and the scrips at its weakest. Superslomotion is annoying and absolutely unnecessary.",NEGATIVE

"Jan 5, 2024",Terrible. Absolutely.,NEGATIVE
"Jan 5, 2024","Easily the worst big budget  scfi / action movie i've watched. In my opinion there was no character development, which meant  i didn't care about any of the characters throughout the film. There were many slow motion scenes throughout the movie relating to character moments, suggesting those scenes were meant to be poignant, and suggesting the audience should feel something for the character in that moment, but i never did. In stead of world building, i would say it was simple location building, given nothing was explained about the different planets the movie introduced. Maybe a movie that would have worked with way more character development, or before gathering the hero team together, each character had already had there own movie, to fully establish there past and audience cared about who they are, endured and would bring to a team. I didn't think much of the CGI, where most of the movie appeared to have been shot on a green screen stage, and everything looked flat. Lastly the movie stakes, is one ship threatening a farm hamlet of maybe fifty inhabitants ( as seen in the movie). Not really the type of stakes i was expecting of a scfi movie pitched in the trailers as having a galactic enemy ""the Empire""

The movie was just awful.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 5, 2024","It will never be an epic, but this movie is not 1 star or 24%. Google users give it 77% likes (a bit to high), but this movie is a solid 2.5 to 3 stars (50%-66%). Nice special effects, decent acting, good story but script could use way more work. We will see what the part 2 will bring. Sometimes I wonder if the ""professional reviewers"" are high or just blind. Good thing that these days I rather trust goigle reviews than some stucked up ""reviewer"".",NEGATIVE
"Jan 5, 2024","Whoa, what an absolute stinker of a movie. There is no sense even going into it. I don't want to think about this movie anymore. Brain, just move that 2+ hours to repressed childhood memories, thank you very much.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 5, 2024","I love this movie, i'm want to SEE the second part",POSITIVE
"Jan 5, 2024","This first installment was rushed - and probably should have been a ten show season.  As it is, The characters jumped from place to place, having brief encounters with others, only to jump to the next location‚Ä¶. Frankly they could have filled in A LOT MORE activity at each location, and given the characters more heft.  As it is, it is passable.  The general story arc is good enough that if they had taken the 2 hour show and instead produced 10 -1 hour installments‚Ä¶ eg a full season of shows, this could have been an excellent tale.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 5, 2024","It was enjoyable. You can tell this is the setup,get the band together installment. This is not a Star Wars movie. If you are expecting that, you'll be disappointed. 

If you like SciFi you'll enjoy this. Can you pick it apart. If you want to. Just sit back and enjoy this for what it is. A new SciFi world with characters I hope they expand on.",NEUTRAL

"Jan 5, 2024",This movie takes the worst of many sci-fi tropes and ruins them forever. Is there any original ideas left in Hollywood? How did this movie ever get made? See Seven Samurais and view the masterpiece in it's original form. I hope part two never gets released!,NEGATIVE
"Jan 5, 2024","This movie borrows far to much from other sci Fi movies. Although it had a lot of potential it didn't reach expectations. it's beginning is strong to build a world but it loses all sense once they reach the 30 minute mark, If you really still want to watch a movie like it, watch Star Wars.Also, I really hope that the second part can redeem this movie.",NEGATIVE

"Jan 4, 2024","Usualmente me entretengo con casi cualquier pel√≠cula de ciencia ficci√≥n porque la mayor√≠a intenta ser coherente, pero este no es el caso. El gui√≥n de Rebel Moon no es solo simpl√≥n sino que atenta contra la l√≥gica. Por si fuera poco piratea ideas y escenas de otras pel√≠culas, malas y buenas, so pretexto de que est√° rindi√©ndoles un tributo cuando lo √∫nico que hace es robar con descaro. Y  ni que decir de las cargantes escenas en c√°mara lenta que se llevan un tercio del metraje. En suma, una pel√≠cula sofocante y dif√≠cil de ver. Absurda hasta lo indecible. La dej√© de ver faltando 15 minutos. Me importa un bledo como concluye.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 4, 2024","A movie with an interesting universe, but absolutely horrendous pacing. It feels as if someone wrote a season script for a TV series, then took the footage and concenced it into a feature length film. The action is solid, but also ludicrous.

"Jan 4, 2024","I think the movie delivers what it promised. The story in this first part of Rebel Moon is somewhat shallow but filled with good intentions. Anime and science fiction enthusiasts will be thrilled by the breathtaking scenes.

The visuals truly captivate, offering a feast for the eyes. The characters, while not deeply explored in this installment, show potential for growth and complexity in future parts of the series. The film successfully captures the essence of both anime and sci-fi genres, creating a visually stunning experience that resonates with fans.

However, a more intricate plot development could enhance the overall storytelling. Despite its current simplicity, the film sets the stage for potential expansion in subsequent installments. The combination of stunning visuals and the promise of deeper narratives leaves audiences eager for what comes next in the Rebel Moon series.",POSITIVE

"Jan 4, 2024","visually striking and powerful, the world building and introduction to all of the characters and their unique personalities, abilities and pasts was perfect meanwhile also telling and moving through the story, the pacing was very smooth. 

the creatures, as they travelled to the different Moons in search of other Rebels, were intense, beautiful and one of them rather spine chilling at first glance (Harmada) but in a way i also felt for her too, to be scared but also sympathize is something the directions did very well here. 

i have to admit my favourite scene was a beautiful moment that made me tear up between Jimmy and Sam by the river when he was telling her about Princess Issa, how she reminded him of her, and you could see how broken he was that he was not able to protect Issa in the way he was programmed to as she was killed. The way Sam sat, completely immersed in what he was saying, but also making a flower crown from daisies, and placed them on his head, it melted something inside of him. She showed him warmth and kindness, and i think in the future films / film, he will be Sam's biggest protector. 

a really beautiful and visually dazzling movie filled with action but also holds these delicate moments where you really fall in love with the characters. ‚ù§Ô∏è",POSITIVE

"Jan 4, 2024","This movie had so much potential but it wasted it. The basis for the plot is...The big empire from earth goes to the outer planets to find some rebels and harassers a small farming village of like 40 people. The farmers go out to find other people who want to defend them from the empire... which is the majority of the movie going to location and picking up people. My whole issue with it is that the people they pickup are just some randos with no story and no reason to join helping these few farmers when they have nothing to give them as a reward. The whole plot is dumb.
What they could of done is make the movie into an exponential plot which keeps increasing the scope like Gurren Lagann;  Help a farm, save a city, defend a planet, galaxy at war....",NEGATIVE
"Jan 4, 2024","Look, it's not a cult or a classic... we've all seen the plotlines before. It is though, a great mindless bit of very well executed sci fi drama. Ed Skrein in particular puts in a gloriously OTT performance as the archetypal sadistic villain. It's just Entertainment folks, fast paced and punchy. The over harsh critics need to see this film while wearing the right glasses. Perhaps they can be excused as the film does occasionally vear towards delusional pretensions of grandiosity. If you ignore this you are left with a terrific action adventure to settle down into and enjoy.",POSITIVE

"Jan 3, 2024","This was a hard watch. Personally I'm a huge fan of fantasy sci-fi films but this was a struggle. The dialogue was like a copy/paste version from other films of the style, the slo-mo shots were too long, too many and unnecessary. What worked well in 300 doesn't work here. The theme of ""explaining who people are"" was painful to sit through. Unlikely to bother with the sequel.",NEGATIVE

"Jan 3, 2024","This film felt as if it were just a collection of action sequences interspersed with lackluster dialog. The plot was one that has been seen a thousand times before and the visuals that cost so much money fluctuated between mediocre and downright awful. Some cgi felt akin to cutscenes from a decade old video game. Much like the Hobbit trilogy the poor use of visual effects really takes you out of the film. 

Ed Skriens performance was the only part of the film I enjoyed. Although he was let down by the material he was given. 

It beggars belief that anyone greenlit this woeful production.",NEGATIVE

"Jan 3, 2024","Overall very disappointing. Despite being quite interesting in the early scenes as we meet the characters but soon goes downhill. Comically pantomime nazi villains. Poorly directed actors emoting all over the place and being allowed to do their best ""epic"" performances. 
Being a Star Wars type space fantasy where a ragtag band of rebels take on the established order against the odds isn't necessarily the problem‚Ä¶ if this had any charm, characters we cared about, or the feeling anything really was at stake other than the next slow-no action sequence it could have been fine.",NEGATIVE

I finished it only hoping it would get better..... But no. 
And the races/world is boring or disgusting. 
Such a waste of money and opportunity to make something good and long-lasting.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 3, 2024",Stars Wars copycat.  It was okay but nothing special.  And the villain character doesn't even come close to Darth Vadar.  When you are trying to copy and fail that much it takes away from the story.  They tried to top Star Wars instead of just creating a new story.,NEUTRAL

"Jan 3, 2024","The film definitely borrows thematically from historical science fiction westerns like Star Wars and Dune, but I don't see that as a negative. I really enjoyed the film, and I especially enjoyed the universe it is creating. If you are looking for a science fiction world to be created in film with action and the classic oppressors vs the opressed, you will enjoy this. I grow tired of ""lack of character development"" arguments from film critics regarding every sci-fi film, because they are complaining about something which is of minor relevance to what this film is supposed to be. It is not tied to a specific character's development. It is creating a universe. These same ""character development"" critics probably complain that a jeep wrangler isn't refined. If you want refined, buy a Mercedes. You buy a Jeep for the ruggedness. If you want a ton of character development, watch a historical fiction drama. If you want a new scifi universe, watch this film.",POSITIVE
"Jan 3, 2024",A bit confusing to start. Sci-fi and fantasy movies are generally poorly reviewed but I thought I'd watch this anyways and I thought it was great. Less childish than starters.

How often do you get to see an entirely new world with this type budget and cast behind it? But this movie was so disappointing. There was no story, nothing new or interesting at all. Just copy paste from a bunch of other stories. There are parts of the movie that are visually very stunning but that's not enough to make up for how bad the writing is.",NEGATIVE

"Jan 3, 2024","It's kind of fitting that the best character in this movie is a robot, because while Rebel Moon has interesting visuals it lacks humanity. Ironically that robot possesses what little humanity exists and once he leaves shortly after the first act gets going it's all downhill from there. 

The bulk of the movie is a planet-hopping recruitment drive for NPCs. Each has a name, a micro-vignette where they demonstrate the functionality they bring to the party, and a brief dialog tree that, once clicked-through (alas, no ""skip"" button is available) adds them to the group. Then they fade into the background, never to be heard from or interacted with again--except to take their turn in each round of combat, sometimes accompany their attack action with a random bark of NPC dialog. 

Cool-looking armor and 5-minutes with a charming Tin Man are not enough reason to sit through this film. Skip.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 3, 2024","It's an enjoyable movie, just for super fans of the genre.
The FX are good enough and the fighting scene are fast.
Unfortunately the plot it's way too basic, and the characters had literally zero characterisation. For a movie wich bet more than half run time in recruiting characters they didn't do a minimum effort in give them a proper introduction, it's all very rushed like, they meet they talk 1 minute to each other and they get convinced to join the cause. Not plausible at all.",NEUTRAL

Other cast MEH, story, SUPER MEH. 2HRS or BASIC STORY TELLING.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 2, 2024","The film, solely featuring aesthetically pleasing and hence sometimes uninteresting actors, encounters challenges in its direction. The execution falls short, with issues in blocking and timing affecting the overall cinematic experience. The narrative setup lacks the necessary differentiation and depth, rendering it somewhat simplistic and naive. The portrayal of culture appears to be approached with a somewhat idealized perspective, resulting in a cookie-cutter representation. Furthermore, the characters, unfortunately, come across as one-dimensional and predictable.

One is left pondering the significant craftsmanship and time invested in the creation of the story. However, the absence of a robust foundation in world-building and emotional relatability diminishes the impact of these efforts. A more comprehensive exploration of these aspects could have elevated the overall quality of the film.

Regrettably, due to the aforementioned shortcomings, I found it challenging to immerse myself fully in the film, ultimately leading to an incomplete viewing experience.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 2, 2024","It was good,great story and good visuals.I think it deserves better critics that's why i'm ranking it 4.5 .",POSITIVE
"Jan 2, 2024","Some of the character development is a bit...rushed, but this fever-dream mismash of  sci-fi is pretty and engrossing.  The character development is a bit rushed, but the general flow of ideas and worldbuilding is pretty spot on.  I would like to see both the directors cut and second part of this series, and will recommend it to my friends.

Upon a bunch of further introspection, I think I get why this movie is so divisive.  I think perhaps the professional critics and a fair bunch of the non-professionals are pretty uninspired by this film, because they want to take it as an individual piece of art, and a complete work.  This is the new normal, where a production house can take ten or twenty hours to deliver a story that once had to be encapsulated in 120 minutes or less.

This has to be viewed through the lens knowing that this film is only the first part of the narrative, and a truncated version at that.  When you only get to see the first act, you only get exposition and not the character development or building that will happen in the second act, and the full heros journey wont complete until the third.

I think the reviewers here that think this movie is great are viewing with this episodic lens.  I know that watching this, I know that there are further episodes coming, and I am curious to see how the story develops and what ideas will be presented later on.  I am also anxious to see the full release of this episode later, as this will also reveal the true vision of this first act, hidden here by the PG13 rating requirements.
",POSITIVE
"Jan 2, 2024","we are in luck because of the dazzling visuals, very nice! It is also the only thing that kept me watching, since the plot is so focking bad. it's like a speed run for the most clich√©s in 1 movie. This feels like a collection of every storytelling aspect i hate. Characters are given personalities that are totally not explored and feel very unnecessary, running through the story and leaving immersion and depth at the side. The plot could be so much easier but they made it complicated, wich is not a problem. But please do enlighten us with the complexity of your universe and story. It feels like skipping from branch to branch. 
BAD CLICH√â, BUT NICE CGI",NEGATIVE
"Jan 2, 2024","Not sure where to start. The story, screenplay, acting & characters all seem horrendously shallow, cheesy and cringe. It's basically a kids films story with a PG13 theme which underdelivers and therefore isn't one or the other as the depth feels extremely watered down. They planet hop to spend 15 minutes on a supposedly secondary character for them to only have 3 more lines for the rest of the film. There are times where I don't think the main characters speak for extended periods of time. I liked the world building around the current story, the flashbacks and the aesthetics but everything else is a huge miss. Even the action feels janky and stupid with their huge lean on slow motion. I have no idea how they were comfortable publishing this. The reason I'd watch the second one is to see how much worse that is.",NEGATIVE

Defend your settlement from raiders - Fallout 4, go on a quest to gather a host to defend your settlement - D&D, A Bug story.

I am pretty sure this movie is taking a big ol' dump on Warhammer 40k in hope of putting a negative light on the franchise. Belisarius? Mechanicum?! REAALLY?!! I am expecting to see Spacemarines, the Inquisition and Titans in the next chapter.

"Jan 2, 2024","Slightly interesting in the beginning but from then on, the story and the acting just goes downhill. Way too much color, and as in most of Snyders films, too much color and effects that just feel like an attempt to cover up poor storytelling and shallow characters.",NEGATIVE

"Jan 2, 2024","I am not sure I have the vocabulary to describe how bad this film is. 

The script is more banal than a three year old's storybook, the plot is a hackneyed take on Stars Wars mixed with the Magnificent Seven and the characterisation is non-existent, leaving the viewer not caring at all who lives and who does not.

Add to that the feeling that the Universe has now become the Wokeverse and it is a movie to avoid at all costs.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 2, 2024","A bunch of stuff happens to people no one cares about. 

Rebel Moon is one of those movies that focuses more on visual appeal than telling a story people care about. It's far too plot driven while the characters sit in the sidecar. It's not worth watching beyond the first act which was just ok.",NEGATIVE

The romance if it can be called that is shown by a few impassive glances.

The story is yet another shameless ripoff of ""Seven Samurai"" with a random collection of sci-fi tropes thrown in for good measure. Two-dimensional characters and wooden acting are the final nail in the coffin. I stopped and started the movie about four times trying to give it a chance and hoping it would get good, I turned it off with about 20 minutes left because I couldn't bear it anymore.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 2, 2024",It's nice to have a regular schmegular hero's journey movie that's sci-fi. They haven't made anything epic since the early 2000s. Ignore critics if you're a regular person. They like Atonement. ü§ÆEnough said.,POSITIVE
"Jan 2, 2024",Good movie. Funny and great FX.,NEUTRAL
"Jan 2, 2024","You have to be in the right mindset for this movie. If you think you won‚Äôt like it, chances are you won‚Äôt. But if you keep an open mind you‚Äôll see the movie for what it really is. I thought it was pretty good and I‚Äôm looking forward to the other movies",POSITIVE
"Jan 2, 2024","From reading the reviews I guess boomers don't want their memories of star wars be besmirched.  It was great.  Casting, acting, the sets, story was a great heros journey... the best space movie since the original Guardians of the Galaxy.",POSITIVE
"Jan 2, 2024","This is a good-looking sci-fi movie of the typical ""Hero's Journey"" story genre. Are there parallels to Star Wars? Yes, because that is another ""Hero's Journey"" story written as a sci-fi space rebellion arc. I liked the characters and villians in this story, the acting was well done, the story is interesting and written well. I await the sequel(s) to see how it all ends...or continues.",POSITIVE
"Jan 2, 2024","Whilst a slow burn, I found myself on the edge of my seat. The world building & introduction of characters has created space for what is sure to be an epic saga. Whilst the storyline is something that has been told before that is the case with most sci-fi & fantasy novels, it's a hero's quest for redemption & for what is good in the world. The visuals were epic & the characters have depth that I look forward to diving into as they the journey continues.
Can't wait for part two!",POSITIVE
"Jan 2, 2024","Ignore the critics, this is a brilliant first part to a new space adventure. Looking forward to Part 2!",POSITIVE
"Jan 2, 2024","It was nice to see a new Sci Fi film, and I was really ready to enjoy it, but it was so completely unimaginative. There was so much room to develop characters more, but they didn't. The story was boring, so everything felt predictable. It took too much from other stories and just seemed lazy and cliche. My partner loved it though because he doesn't overanalyze.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 2, 2024","It keeps a fast pace of an action movie, but the story is uninteresting and the characters shallow.  The villain goes around with a a large bone in hand while commanding a ship that is ""worldender"". The physics and the anachronism of the movie are so bad that would wake you up in case you fell asleep between some slow-motion combats scenes.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 2, 2024",I think this movie is severely underrated. I love a good futuristic sci-if and this movie checks all the boxes. The special effects don't look cheap like most movies with that much background animation. The action scenes are very well done and super entertaining to watch. The fantasy aspect is captivating and visually appealing.,POSITIVE
"Jan 2, 2024","Rebel moon-part 1: a child of Fire meh, I watched it. Alot of obvious, see me camera angles. Music ok, not great. The usual underdog , treachery, back-stabbing underhandedness. Supposed to be #1 in filums. Underwhelming.
6.5/0.",NEUTRAL
"Jan 2, 2024",Absolutely awful. A bunch of random sci-fi and fantasy tropes smooshed together with some decent special effects. Story was ridiculous. Fight scenes make less than 0 sense. I would trust an 8th grader to come up with a better movie plot.,NEGATIVE

"Jan 1, 2024",This movie is pretty good.  I'm not sure what people want. There hasn't been a war based sci fi film that isn't a remake that got good reviews in forever.  Be thankful that this one is pretty good.,POSITIVE
"Jan 1, 2024",Loved it. Something different for a change.,POSITIVE
"Jan 1, 2024","Basically a remake of 'Battle beyond the Stars'. Some good visuals, baffling accent choices (yes of course the villain went to Eton!), clearly laying some storylines for future parts, but ultimately, nothing to justify the money spent.
No better than many straight to TV/Streaming films that cost a fraction of this budget.  Glad I didn't pay to see at the cinema, but entertaining enough to watch through.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 1, 2024","It's classic space opera. The problem being that if already with the pilot , it accumulates lots of negatives : far too many unnecessary lengths & narrative exposition which weighs down the already not """"good"""" pace. As much as the 1st fight in the camp is nice & punchy. The 2nd (in the inn with the badguy wanting to fck one of the characters), but it's sooo slow... A sensation that will come back, ofteen üôÑüòñ",NEGATIVE
"Jan 1, 2024",Watched because of the great actors. Movie really sucked. Storyline was very weak just like the movie in general.,NEGATIVE

"Jan 1, 2024","Love the start of a new story. The visuals of each planet has its own beauty. There are also shots in a scene that make you wonder if a hidden image or meaning exists in that shot. There are characters in this film that one can identify with. Some of these characters, you just love to hate. And there's still more back story and future story to tell with these characters. I understand that Part One has set up the team. I am so ready for part 2.",POSITIVE
"Jan 1, 2024",Universe is cool would have liked to see more than just a pit stop at planets,POSITIVE
"Jan 1, 2024",Thoroughly enjoyed it. Many artful scenes.,POSITIVE
"Jan 1, 2024","I can't really describe how boring this movie felt. Everything seemed so generic. I felt no involved at all with the charatcers, that felt incredibly dumb at times. I mean, is it so hard to write something a little interesting? Slow motions and lens flares are not enough to make it a decent movie. I usually tend to finish watching even things i don't like, but i'm not going to watch part two.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 1, 2024","I don't even know where to start with this one. The pacing was horrible, they had a crazy over-reliance on slow motion, they introduced a bunch of super interesting characters with little to no backstory or development, and the main character is, and I cannot stress this enough, literally Gamora, but instead of being adopted by Thanos, she was adopted by the empire from Star Wars. This movie was horrible.",NEGATIVE

"Jan 1, 2024",Very entertaining.  A fun ride from start to finish,POSITIVE

"Jan 1, 2024","Not enough time given to develop each of the characters, and sooo full of fantasy stereotypes. This is a story that would probably be better as a 3-book trilogy and then another trope can be checked. Visually pretty.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 1, 2024","For once, the pro critics are right.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 1, 2024",300 meets star wars love them both and love rebel moon.,POSITIVE
"Jan 1, 2024","The lack of creativity is strong here, the cynical way of trying to get away with copying various science fiction masterpieces verbatim. So much visual garbage, unnecessary VFX abuse, and painful slow motion.
And Snyders said his cut is the best? Save time and avoid this mistake.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 1, 2024","Dull, wooden script and acting and so much slo-mo you have time to take a nap during action scenes.",NEGATIVE

"Jan 1, 2024","Zack should let actual writers do the writing and not force them to insert his ideas into the narrative. EVER.
Rebel Moon is nothing but a collection of sci-fi/fantasy tropes, cliches, dressed up with tired and over-used designs swipes from video games, comics, and other better movies and tv shows.
Rebel Moon is absolute garbage!

"Jan 1, 2024","Maybe it's so bad, it's good? The dialogue is cheesy (and thereby hilarious) and overall it's stupid. I watched the whole thing.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 1, 2024","It was visually very nice but felt like a mash up of star wars, guardians of the galaxy and Dune. The winged creature was stright up from Hogwarts but in night mode. If some one hasn't seen any of the movies, they would find it cool. Story line is pretty formulaic so much so that you can predict whats gonna happen in the next movies.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 1, 2024","I delayed watching this after reading the critic's review, so was surprised by how much I enjoyed Rebel Moon.  Yes, it's derivative, but so is almost every modern sci fi film I've ever watched, with the possible exception of Blade Runner and Inception.
The backstory narratives were important to set the scene for the series, the acting was good and pleasantly low-key, the dialogue was nicely minimalist, the cinematography was wonderful and the action was gripping.  
And the Magnificent Seven was an excellent remake, so using Seven Samurai as inspiration is a bonus.
We need to stop with the whining Star Wars fanboy reviews or we'll never see Part 2.",POSITIVE
"Jan 1, 2024",It's like watching a bad superhero movie....meh,NEUTRAL
"Jan 1, 2024","This was nothing more than a rip off of the very first Star Wars movie. Rebels. Weird music and characters in a bar. Finding rouge pilot to fly you to look for more future  rebels. Fight off empire fleet while vastly out numbered. Acting that's not even that good. And to make it even worse, enough CGI to choke a horse. If you want to see this kind of movie, watch Star Wars. 100 times better.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 1, 2024","It looks great, and if you're inclined, you can spend your time guessing which movie a scene has come from or see how many of the actors appeared in Game of Thrones. But to be honest it is over two hours long and that's only part one!! I don't think we're gonna make it.",NEUTRAL

"Jan 1, 2024",very good start to the saga... waiting for the sequel which seems promising,POSITIVE
"Jan 1, 2024",If you like watching other people play video games then you might enjoy this. There is no acting required for this film. The dialogue is either voice over exposition or grunts and orders during fight scenes. This is an idea for a movie but not a realized vision.,NEGATIVE
"Jan 1, 2024",The movie was not a masterpiece but entertaining and hopefully it will get better with part 2. The universe has potential. I like   the movie.,POSITIVE
"Jan 1, 2024",Poor Battle beyond the Stars rip off with a modern diverse cast,NEGATIVE

"Jan 1, 2024","Visually stunning. It is a good idea, but the choppy story weakens the film and the (at times) patronizing dialog suffers. You'll get mad at the film's potential to be great, but in the end, you'll have enjoyed watching it.",NEUTRAL

"Jan 1, 2024","Superb special effects cannot help a story built on tropes of the Star Wars series. Rebellion by downtrodden characters against an evil intergalactic empire, a lovable robot, a weird assemblage of aliens in a space bar etc. There are certainly moments of a little tension but the outcome is never in doubt. Add to this that the inconsistencies are alarming - a society where people plough with horses, hunt elk and cook over fires, yet have automatic sliding doors and electric lights. Spend your time on something better.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 1, 2024","Tries hard with plots and lines from
other various sci-fi movies but fails. Some good effects but not that engaging.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 1, 2024","Its pretty. Its familiar. It's mildly entertaining and will fill in two hours. Don't come here looking for anything original though. 

Take the best, most cliched parts of all the sci-fi and classic western movies ever made and put them together into one sci-fi movie. Be sure to go extra heavy on the ""Star Wars"" franchise. Take inspiration and the best bits from everything from slang and clothing from gangster movies, mafia movies, action movies and even a smidgen of Harry Potter beasts and Voila! You've got it. Its Rebel Moon! 

Entertaining, pretty, but not an original bone in its body...",NEGATIVE

"Jan 1, 2024","The visual effects were superb throughout with compelling characters and outstanding performances, especially Cara. The plot and setting reminds you of several universes but it never detracted from the viewing experience. I thought one scene at the Trading City bar was reminiscent of the Star Wars Cantina but that was the only blatant borrowing I saw. Obviously it is about a group of Rebels that rebel against an Empire, so you can see some of the parallels to Star Wars. I also felt it had some homage to Dune and Chronicles of Riddick. The movie plays quickly at 2:15 I never felt it dragged and let me just say there is a twist near the end that surprised me and something unexpected. I understand this is a multi-part series so hopefully it will develop a following. If you love Sci-fi, give it a chance and enjoy it for what it is and do not try to overanalyze it.",POSITIVE
"Jan 1, 2024","I would give it a 4 out of 5 for what it's worth. It was obviously a Star Wars rip off but it was a rip off I enjoyed while I hated the character development, pacing and length it was a movie I enjoyed and excited to see the future.

Esta versi√≥n abarca lo suficiente en cuanto historia y desarrollo para introducirnos a este universo y a estos personajes y justamente al mostrar solo lo suficiente para comprender la trama y personajes te hace querer conocer y ver mas d√°ndole a la audiencia el ideal de seguir enganchado y querer ver la parte dos de esta historia y el futuro corte del director para indagar en el pasado de los rebeldes y en el trasfondo de la historia a√∫n mejor; Rebel Moon va directo al punto, una din√°mica que se puede percibir tal vez apresurada pero para lo que intenta ser esta versi√≥n lo logra muy bien, una introducci√≥n √©pica pero sencilla al p√∫blico a un nuevo universo.

- RebelMoon as a pg13 movie meets all expectations, it is entertaining, it has very good action, good VFX, beautiful cinematography, and an excellent score, a very relatable issue with an easy to follow story.
This version covers enough history and development to introduce us to this universe and these characters and precisely by showing just enough to understand the plot and characters it makes you want to know and see more, giving the audience the ideal of staying hooked and wanting to see part two of this story and the future director's cut to delve into the rebels' past and the background of the story even better; Rebel Moon gets straight to the point, a dynamic that can perhaps be perceived as rushed but for what this version tries to be, it achieves it very well, an epic but simple introduction for the audience to a new universe.",POSITIVE

"Jan 1, 2024","Quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen.  It's not original at all, it's directly a 1 for 1 rip of Battle Beyond the Stars for the first half.  Nothing in this movie is actually original.  It's as if the writer took his favorite clips of movies he's watched and fed them into an AI script generator and filmed what came out the other side.   Also 75% of the film is purposely blurry for artistic reasons, but only served to annoy me.",NEGATIVE

Some parts are predictable almost painfully so - but doesn't hurt the overall movie, the acting could use a little polishing, as some ""serious/dramatic"" scenes were almost comical and I'm sure that was not intended.

"Dec 31, 2023","Very boring, far too long, and the usage of slow mo was so completely pointless. It was like someone just hit the slowmo button at random times and far too often, as if my 4 year old was manning the button. The characters and acting were boring, weak, and just plain bad.

No idea why there was so many slow-mo's‚Ä¶. It was like I was back in the 1980s‚Ä¶ or maybe it was an attempt to divert attention from just how shite this really was.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 31, 2023",Writing was pretty poor. The acting was not very good. Lots of inconsistencies and jumps. If this is supposed to be a brand new movie and not just the Star wars rip off than it needs to fill in the gaps and explain the motivation of the characters. A lot of the characters just were given one or two sentences and suddenly just jumped in and started helping the protagonist. A lot of the acting was just grossing chewing and just not a very entertaining movie.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 30, 2023","Absolutely not a single original line, trope nor character. Takes itself way too seriously without delivering any kind of actual plot, storyline or arc that anyone over the age of 11 would care.

Photography is excellent, scenarios are net and believable, the characters still are not developed only introduced, the rhythm is fast and enjoyable but probably is missing at least one hour of deeper content (sure will be delivered on part TWO), it's only the PART ONE of TWO (careful with that), the characters and encounters are fun.

So for now we can see only half of what's to come, for me was fun, entertaining and solid basement for the climax on Part II. 

The references for this film are Star Wars, Warhammer 40k and 7 Samurai.",NEUTRAL

"Dec 30, 2023","A truly awful waste of a sci-fi film. It is so rare to have an original big budget sci-fi in a scene dominated by Star Wars, superheroes, and adaptations. Unfortunately this is anything but original. It's A New Hope meets Seven Samurai whilst trying to be Dune, but it fails on all fronts. Every single line of dialogue is exposition or a cliche inspirational diatribe. Just a really dumb and boring film.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 30, 2023","Same old story, been done over and over to the point you'd think they would know how to make interesting characters and there are writers and directors out there that can make a good story and interesting characters.

It was trying to be deep and funny at the same time without managing to do one.
And get ready for Slow motion shots every 5 minutes.

Stereotype mess, bad storytelling and shitty Slow motion.",NEGATIVE

I don't know how seven other directors haven't sued over the blatant plagiarism of Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones, Guardians of the Galaxy and Thor, to name a few; it's not even subtle! That might be just about be excusable if they could disguise it inside a half decent story line, but this is just one pantomime cliche followed by another in a sequence that could be predicted by a 5 year old! A real shame given the extent of the casts potential talent... They must have known how basic this was... Smells rife of cash before quality!!

"Dec 30, 2023","Its a great movie with clear flaws. The main cast arent very interesting, too many slow-mo scenes, and some bad CGI.

Rebel Moon is much needed in the recent times of Marvel domination in that it's a film that does what it should, entertain!

I guess they best thing about it was the action choreography, but that isn't enough to sustain a movie for me.

In the end, I felt no emotions at all in this entirely forgettable movie.

In the new sci-fi space, The Creator was MUCH better in all aspects (story, characters, world-building, art direction, cinematography, writing, et al.)",NEGATIVE

At the point that a particular US (wannabe biker) actor appears with a truly terrible Irish accent playing a character so obviously based on Han Solo I understood why this film has so frequently been described as derivative.

The scenes where you're introduced to a new samurai are painfully cliche - almost like they were jacked from another movie (like Avatar).

Boutella just isn't leading lady material, characters are zero dimensional points, it's gratingly expositional, and the action scenes are comically ineptly choreographed, burdened with jump-cuts and slow-slow-slower-motions.

As a fan of Snyder's distinctive style, I eagerly delved into this space epic. Snyder's signature visual flair is evident in every frame, elevating the movie to a cinematic spectacle. A Child of Fire serves as the inaugural installment in a series of adventures. One notable aspect is its ambitious attempt to construct a comprehensive universe; however, its drawback lies in the challenge of functioning seamlessly as a standalone movie.

"Dec 30, 2023",Great movie!!! Don't know why it got so much hate. That much slo mo and I'm all for it. I don't know why people see that as a problem. I feel like the people who do not like this movie are just nit picking. It's hard to please the nerds,POSITIVE
"Dec 30, 2023","Formulaic and predictable. Made it about 75% of the way through before giving up, having seen this before in about 100 other uninspired movies. Pretty though.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 30, 2023","Very cool movie. Pretty good original story with awesome special effects. Despite the critic reviews, which I don't trust these days I think this movie is going to catch on. The so called professional critics definitely got this one wrong. This movie is going to be huge and finally for once we don't have to wait years for the next part to premiere. ",POSITIVE

"Dec 30, 2023","I was hoping for better, nothing ground breaking but also not horrible.  The movie was shot beautifully but the lead who played Kora felt wooden with her acting and the side characters weren't provided enough screen time to flesh out there characters.

A world with spaceships that can destroy civilization and bend space don't need bushels of grain from psuedo futuristic farmers that use horses to till, and a fireplace to warm their homes yet have a metal electronic sliding doors that I assume use electricity.  Of course how can I forget the weird kings army that has uniforms that are a cross between a nazi army, ancient Persian military looking alien advisors and halo dressed warriors.

"Dec 30, 2023",Nothing terribly compelling about it.   It's long and slow and not terribly original.

"Dec 29, 2023","There's a lot of logic gaps.  Why would a dreadnought ship want to buy 10 bushels of something from a farm in the middle of nowhere?  There's almost zero humour, why not tell a few jokes?  
People shouting and running when blasters are being fired is silly, they're not running faster than the plasma bullets.  They probably need a lightsaber type person to deflect bullets to make it interesting because it doesn't matter how strong someone is they can be easily shot and killed.
The imagery is impressive and it's emotionally moving in parts (rebel commanders death), just the tone is almost continuously orchestral.  It's hard not to be impressed but it does let itself down.

Finally, why are the evil guys all talking with Irish accents?",NEUTRAL

"Dec 29, 2023","really bland and forgettable. The characters were so underdeveloped, and it was so derivative in the story department. Would not recommend at all",NEGATIVE
"Dec 29, 2023","What a mess. Visuals were unnecessarily blurry (a side-effect of the lens used during filming unfortunately), poorly color-corrected, and a fair amount of the effects looked unfinished. 

Neither the plot nor character arcs go anywhere meaningful, even if this is a ""Part One of Two"" situation. Charlie Hunnam's performance in particular is one of the worst I've seen in some time, and Sofia Boutella's can be described as nothing more than ""quiet farmer wearing a cape."" 

People say there is a longer, R-rated cut of this coming, and I'll be completely honest here: if the first cut of your film is this bad, you've killed any interest I had in a director's cut.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 29, 2023","Thought the movie was well done, kept me entertained throughout. The pacing seemed just right to me. I liked the way they introduced characters. All in all I thought it was great and I'll be looking forward to part 2.",POSITIVE
"Dec 29, 2023","Formulaic, Star Wars wannabe.  No new ground broken here.  The characters are stiff and one-dimensional, if that, and completely uninvolving. It feels like it should have been based on a book, which might have given it some ""excuse"" to say that it hewed too closely or strayed too far away from the original, but apparently that's not the case.  There's no one else to blame!  If it were free and running in the background while you were on a treadmill, that's about the right level of investment.  Definitely no need or desire to see a Part 2.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 29, 2023","Where to start with this waste of 2 hours....

Look I will just answer the parts you all care about. The action scenes even suck. Now that thats out of the way and you know you can skip it.

The dialogue seems to have come from a middle school level drama. The character development is really quick and in your face at first, then suddenly just disappears its absolutely jarring. The pace is atrocious. And the amount of holes in the movies plot and development could fit the milky way. Im really not sure what to think. I know Im not going to be looking for episode 2 as this shamble of a show illustrated that maybe Zack should stick to directing others writing as his is pretty much bottom of the barrel.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 29, 2023","The movie isn't that bad, but it is very choppy and doesn't flow very well. The visuals are really pretty good. The biggest problem that this film has, is Sofia Boutella is completely unlikeable. The hero needs to be somewhat likeable and heroic. Sofia Boutella is neither of those. She makes you want to cheer for the bad guy.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 29, 2023","I can see why the ""top critics"" panned this film, I nearly gave up after the first few minutes as it looked like it would be a weak, low budget, boring affair. BUT how wrong I was! Once the characters are introduced and developed over the first part of the film, the pace slowly ramps up and up and I got carried along on what is an exciting ride with great characters (as good as those in the super hero movies- and you could almost see this film in manga form with its style and action sequences. I'm glad I stayed the distance- and can't wait for part 2 already!!! Don't believe the downbeat critic reviews, which whilst understandable from the first few minutes, I think are disappointed it's a fairly simple premise. Like Star Wars was lol- a fabulous film but at its core good vs bad, albeit done with incredible mastery by all concerned. Give Rebel Moon a chance, I don't think you'll be disappointed, and maybe you'll love it as much as I do. Bring it on‚Ä¶",POSITIVE

"Dec 29, 2023","Rating says, meh it passed the time, but it felt like I wasted my time. Nice visuals and makeup. The plot and pacing though were ridiculous - more like watching various cutscenes from an ""epic"" video game and with similar plot jumps - go here, collect character, build party, have fight / pass trial (and absolutely no context - the spider thing?!?!), continue on. Almost zero character development beyond the main character. 

[SPOILER]
Got to the ""last"" big scene / fight of the movie and I thought, wait, this isn't the end of the movie already?!? They basically got tricked to land at the equivalent of a warehouse loading bay and...oh the big bad is here, uh, tension, capture, escape, fight, explosions, loss of important-but-not-really character, reflect on challenges overcome. Oh, and apparently a five-story space warship can be crashed by flicking a single switch from the gunner's chair.
[Sp Off]

Check that, I can't even give it two stars the more I think back.

Your critical reviews were strangely alike and totally worthless. I can't wait for Part 2.",POSITIVE

Snyder's style is his, creative. Many time times with new ideas. Many times looking and using the past. All movies and books do the same.

I loved it and can't wait until the Part 2!,POSITIVE
"Dec 29, 2023","I felt the movie was a good shoot-em-up with lots of action. I respect rebels because they have to fight the man and it is tough to fight the man.

"Dec 29, 2023","Incredibly bad film. Repeating the main devices and plotlines of classic sci-fi films would be fine if they could make the story or the characters even remotely interesting and engaging. You feel no connection with the characters and it's unclear why many of them are even there. The costume summed up the movie when they put the bad guy into a shirt and tie...

After what Disney has done to Star Wars I was hoping someone would give us a new sci-fi franchise that was exciting and interesting but unfortunately Rebel Moon isn't it. I feel it would have made for a better series than it did movie. It felt rushed and it didn't give me the character building and back story I was wanting. Hopefully the extended version and part 2 will give me more of what I was hoping for. It was visually appealing but way too much slow motion.,NEGATIVE

"Dec 29, 2023","This was a hard watch. The scenes, many of which seem to be repurposed from older sci-fi films, seemed almost entirely disconnected from each other. The character writing is non-existent, there was no reason to care about any of them although the movie is nice enough to tell us about a romantic subplot it never showed. It's not actually a story, just assembling a thin cast to tell us there WILL be a story.

From the opening sequence when our hero is lovingly grasping fistfuls of soil in a quasi-sexual manner, through the tortuously uninteresting assembly of the seven nouveau samurai, and on (and on) through the swamp of dull set-up for part two, this film goes nowhere and does very little, and what it does do, takes twice as long as it should. It wouldn't know an original idea if it jumped up and bit it. Unless it's out of morbid curiosity, I'd avoid this lumpen mishmash of other people's poorly rendered ideas at all costs. 2 hours and 14 minutes of your life you'll never get back.",NEGATIVE

Everything is so literal, the characters spend their time explaining why they do what they do (to make sure that we, the poor stupid audience, clearly understand what we absolutely must understand), the characters have no stakes, it's blatantly obvious, it's unbearable. I hate it when a director treats me like an idiot!",NEGATIVE
"Dec 29, 2023",Absolutely amazing movie! Exactly what keeps driving science fiction and fantasy films. A must watch!!,POSITIVE
"Dec 29, 2023","The constant slow motion cinematography felt so out of placed and over used that the actual effect it was supposed to have became a miss. The cast was heavily underused as the film tried to balance itself between being a sci-fi thriller and a grind house film. 

Plot was extremely lacking as the entire glue for this ragtag band of heroes was to protect a farm from a force that we seen on screen level an entire kingdoms and worlds but 5 people could really whip farmers together to fight off that military force.

The story seemed to have great things but they feel hidden behind a paywall made of a DIRECTORS CUT AND a PART II.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 29, 2023",I'd echo what some of the critics have said a    boring star wars like rip off with no story. There is nothing moving or motivating but pretty pictures and really good looking slomo.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 29, 2023","I enjoyed this movie because it has a really good story, the cinematography is beautiful and the music fits perfect. I wasn't sure if I was going to like it, but I loved it. Very entertaining and I highly recommend watching it and having some popcorn with it.",POSITIVE
"Dec 29, 2023","The movie was really good if you like sci-fi. Cool unique worlds and races/aliens. Don't read any further if you like what I just mentioned and just go watch it and enjoy. 

I believe it was intentional to not have all questions of the character's backgrounds answered. More questions will likely be answered and certain things addressed in part 2. Critics argued that it lacked substance but then if all questions would have been answered the critics would say the film was pandering. Nothing will ever please critics of most sci-fi because they have no imagination and make it difficult for the genre to succeed. My only dislike of the film was the overuse of slow motion in action sequences. It was still cool but a bit unnecessary I think.",POSITIVE
"Dec 29, 2023","Tasteless movie, shallow plot, rushed action scenes, caricatured characters. I'm not picky when it comes to action movies, but this is the first time I've stopped watching before the end.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 29, 2023","It's an enjoyable watch, there is just nothing new or interesting about it.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 29, 2023",Ignore the haters and think for yourself. Finally an original sci-fi/fantasy movie that lacks the nauseating stench of Lucas. I loved sharing some bonding time with my teenage daughter with this film and we're excited for what's to come. The effects were a health mix of cgi and mind bending live action stunts. The story was a great set up for more stories to come. The acting and script writing is far above par for genre. I can't wait for more.,POSITIVE
"Dec 29, 2023","I also made an account just to comment on this. Like a lot of people said it was predictable. The acting was literally atrocious, i knew right away that the brother wasn't going to be important. Dont know anything about any of the characters, no background at all just quickly introduced them like we already had an idea, didnt even see a connection between them to join up together, no chemistry. Also how quick and easy it was to convince them all it was just lame.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 29, 2023",Starting watching with my 11 year old son. He said it was too cringe and boring. Then there was some action. Then more unlikable characters. Then we watched Fail Army instead. It's really bad.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 29, 2023","I can't believe someone spend all that money and wasted all those talented actors time in a movie as bad as this. I mean, the plot is a patchwork of non related topics most of which are dropped without any reason, the characters a really poor caricatures and you don't get to connect with any of them and most of all the number of references (if you're being nice), or as I would call them: straight up plagiarisms are the final detail on a total waste of time (and money probably). 
I mean we got 7 samurais, Star Wars, Wild West stuff, gladiator and when you think it's over even matrix on it and it still sucks.

Give yourself a favor and never watch this.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 29, 2023",What a good start to re-fuel all 0f us Baby Boomers,POSITIVE
"Dec 29, 2023","Overall an enjoyable film, though it is a bit derivative and is strangely paced. The main set pieces are very watchable and have some interesting visual touches. There's a lot going on, and it seems that it would have been better as a miniseries with time to flesh out each of the characters. The general structure of the seven samurai is to spend time building up the characters of the supporting squad so that their eventual deaths are meaningful. Here, we spent a little too much time on the bad guys and search for the squad, rather than on the squad themselves.  Thus, we really don't care enough about the crew. Perhaps that work will be done in part two.

In any case, the visuals and action were enough diversion for a few hours.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 29, 2023",La trama no se sostiene a lo largo de la pelicula; no se profundiza en los personajes. las escenas de acci√≥n es lo que hace la pel√≠cula llevadera,NEUTRAL
"Dec 29, 2023",Too many similarities with the story of Thanos going into defeating multiple worlds saving a girl. Similarities with Star Wars and Ray. It definitely wasn't a clever storyline. Most of them were stolen ideas. The action could've been more gory and detailed. The preview was definitely way more entertaining than the actual movie. I give it one out of five stars I wish I could get my 2 1/2 hours back.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 29, 2023",Bad movie. Obviously inspired in the seven samurai movie. Poor acting. Poor special effects.,NEGATIVE

"Dec 29, 2023",A fascinating introduction to a new universe. I want to see much more. Definitely much more interested in this than new Star Wars stuff.,POSITIVE
"Dec 29, 2023","I really enjoyed the movie from start to finish, I think critics are always searching for Oscar performances and forget that movies are to entertain.",POSITIVE
"Dec 29, 2023","The film was entertaining from a visual effects perspective. I appreciated that the story moved quickly, however the plot was predictable and somehow felt like it's been ""done before"". I found myself anticipating outcomes which materialized. Unfortunately, this can make a film lack luster. Rating of 2.5 Stars. Hopefully Part 2 will provide unforeseen plot twist and more action.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 29, 2023","I think the movie would have benefitted from more back story about the ruling force, but that being said it was enjoyable and worth the watch. Hope part two builds a more complete picture of this Universe.",NEUTRAL

Me hace gracia tambien que esten al descubierto en un tiroteo (contra soldados experimentados) por varios segundos y no les dan ni una bala es algo surrealista ni siquiera se molestan en buscar coberturas ni nada. La historia basica plana y sin sentido, y ademas los actores no lo actuan nada bien con planos de las caras a 1 milimetro de la camara y un monton de camaras lentas que no benefician nada.

"Dec 29, 2023","Look, did I enjoy it? Yes, it was worth the watch. But was it great? No, far from it actually. The best I could describe how I feel about this film was that it felt like a sequel film. You get into these characters lives with barely any context or build up, which creates the inability to buy in to the entire story. I loved the casting, they had the talent for an amazing film, but scripting and character depth kept it from that. This could have easily been a three part series. Again, if you're just looking for a film to watch on a rainy day, watch it.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 29, 2023",I loved the movie but you get tell that the pg13 version isn't the final version. So much is missing from the action scenes but beyond that the characters I could connect with on an emotional level.,POSITIVE
"Dec 29, 2023","This movie was total and complete garbage.  No character development, plot was lame and the CGI was horrible.  A majority of the movie was like the Rick and Morty espisode where they make fun of heist films where they assemble a team of rando's for the heist.  Hot freaking mess of a movie.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 29, 2023","Terrible rehash of the seven samurai/magnificent seven and other films with a terrible nod to Star Wars.  
Just trash story, bad acting and poor lighting.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 29, 2023","So, movie was very derivative.   Basically if you have seen seventh samurai/magnificent seven + star wars, you know the basic plot.   Heck, a post apocalyptic seventh samurai could be interesting but the character development is 0 in this movie so it misses the point.  Over used dark filter just further drags down the movie as everything is washed out.   Just overall not a good movie, and not worth the time to watch it.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 29, 2023","Epic filmmaking is what you get in Rebel Moon. Beautiful imagery with an interesting story. Does it hurt that you only get part of the story in one film? Maybe, but I'm willing to wait until April to get my answers. Do you see reflections of other sci-fi franchises in Rebel Moon? Sure you do. Same as you do in most any sci-fi film. I'm sold on the vision. Ready to wait for the payoff.",POSITIVE
"Dec 29, 2023",Loved this movie. I think critics tend to hate most of these movies and that's ok. Great action. I really enjoy the universe that's building. It feels like a Star Wars universe but it isn't.,POSITIVE
"Dec 29, 2023","Was a brilliant movie and a breath of fresh air to see an original film series start out, my only criticism is that it did not go on long enough.

"Dec 28, 2023","Every scene and every line is dark and depressing throughout , not one character is worth caring about , it was just a dark pointless waste of a few hours . I've seen B movies with better characters and production",NEGATIVE
"Dec 28, 2023",Complete and utter trash.  I really wanted to like this but I knew this movie was in trouble when the first scene is a ship and portal that resembled genitals.   Really?!?!  The dialogue was bad.  The backstory hodgepodge.  Despite some actions sequences the movie at times was dull.  Some of the design was completely uninspired.  There was about 20 minutes of a good movie and the rest was just terrible.,NEGATIVE

 absolutely average",NEGATIVE
"Dec 28, 2023","It entertained me. It can have its cringy and predictable moments and It's basically  Magnificent Seven in Space, but I like both so it's a yes for me. Looking forward to see what another cut brings and part 2 and hoping it gets a little better.",NEUTRAL

Apparently, the character bios created here before preproduction were about one paragraph each. I'm not sure what this team was trying to do. It's like painting a picture with a single brush stroke. It's not going to turn out anything like what you intended and you'll end up with an incomplete and unsatisfying result. You are not always able to depend on visual effects or a directors cut.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 28, 2023","This movie reminded me of a story I have wrote when I was 12 years old. Same storyline, great threat, collect x,y and z, betrayal and so on. And of course due to my age they lacked character development, and context for anything, no memorable characters or no meaningful relationship developed. Back then I remember that after reading it again I figured it was not so great so I decided to do with it what you do with garbage stories, toss them in a drawer and forget about them or even better repurpose the paper. Little did I know it had the exact requirements for a Hollywood  movie and at an early age I have written something equivalent with one of the great writers in the industry.

"Dec 28, 2023","Firstly, in terms of the rating I think 7/10 is more precise and reasonable. Not sure how ppl are giving it a 1/5 or anything around or less than that fractionally. Those reviews, to me, seem driven by some peculiar emotional mix; ""worst movie"" or things of that sort, I sense, are written by folks that either don't watch many films, had a bad day, or don't know how to assess films like this.
Now to the movie; it's a hodgepodge of parts of other cinematic IP, which is not a novel notion considering the director openly stated that it was pitched as a Star Wars spinoff. Can't quite tell if it feels more like star wars, dune, or, at times, a Western but, for sure, it doesn't feel too original. The dialogue is o.k. I was expecting more/better, however, the acting is stellar. The cast picks up for any slack, and so, it seems appropriate and relevant to identify that and take it into account with gradation. It's worth noting the movie has its share of puzzles it never quite places, and, side persons i feel it should invest more time in expanding on. Film is littered with a lot of interesting pictorial angles. 
Act 2 is best IMO.
If you're looking for space fighting aesthetic grandeur and a decent plot this is for you.

"Dec 28, 2023","Meh. As Yogi Berra said, it's like deja vu, all over again. While it had high production values and fine acting, the plot seemed unremarkable, familiar, derivative - mainly of Star Wars (even the blasters make the same beeyoo-beeyoo-beeyoo sound).  About every 20 minutes I'd raise the remote to switch away.  Right then a kick-butt fight would erupt, so I'd stay, eventually raise the remote. Another fight.  Warcraft uses the same trick to keep players playing. The main character Kora (Sofia Bouttela) is believably intense, athletic and can kick the horns off 8 charging rhinos. The antagonist Nobel (Ed Skrein) is suitably sociopathic in his role as an admiral of a (too) Naziesque strike force from the Motherworld. He plans to extract one harvest from the farming world Kora is on and then wipe out the population - an idea that makes no economic sense - but galvanizes Kora to assemble a ragtag army of rebels.  This whole hero's journey has been done a billion times before. You can tell where this story is going the moment you lay eyes on Kora fitting into her adopted farming village like Riddick into an all-girls kindergarten class. The plot is like Muzak where the tune is familiar but the highs and low have been taken out.",NEGATIVE

This could and should have been the universe that filled the hole Disney left behind when they butchered Star Wars.

Yet I feel like half the movie or more was left on the cutting room floor.

Who is the lady with the swords? We don't know...they just turned up to the planet she was on and brought her along... Why? Don't know! She's just part of the group now and that's a running theme of the movie...stuff just happens with little to no explanation why. 
Characters die but you don't really care because you aren't given the chance to get to know them in the first place.

"Dec 28, 2023",I thought this movie was a great opening to a potentially fascinating movie series.

"Dec 28, 2023","Ok, so I have really mixed feelings around this film. Definitely has some similarities with Star Wars, and other SiFi films but has it's own story. Really great effects, and perfectly designed sets. Where it falls short is the plot and characters. Outside of Charlie's (Played Jax from SOA) character, they simply aren't interesting. The plot for recruitment of the ""Rebel"" force feels rushed. I think the bones of this story had promise, but the lead protagonist and most of the supporting cast just aren't interesting enough to pull you in.

"Dec 28, 2023","1) It is supposed to be a movie. Show. Don't. Tell. It is just so laboriously slow with an intro of seemingly endless narration.

2) A good movie is more than a collection of action scenes strung together with monologues and narration.

Lots of interesting concepts but not put to good use. Plot makes very little sense.  For example, the evil empire is evil for the sake of being evil.

Evil Empire: Hey we can sell/give you farming robots so you can have massive yields.
Farmers: Naw we want to work by hand, we are just a tiny farming community on this planet and don't exactly grow much food.

A semi-intelligent evil empire would say, okay, cool. Then take their farming robots and farm the hell out of a different part of the planet to get the food they need. Maybe offering to pay for some time with their master gardener.

But nope, instead they kill a couple people, and drop off their most sadistic troops to ensure their plan goes to hell in a hand basket right away. Protagonists can't be chronically stupid and yet have a track record of amazing competence.

It simply isn't very good.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 28, 2023","Great visual effects with some good action sequences but character development so shallow they'd drown in a puddle. No real character development, weak script writing which sadly lets down some great actors. If it had a better script this could have been a great film.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 28, 2023","I think the stark chasm between the critics and viewers is proof critics are severely out of touch with what people love and enjoy. It does not matter if it has elements from other IP, so does literally everything. The film is epic fun. Stop hating.",POSITIVE

"Dec 28, 2023","I'll start off by saying I do love science fiction movies. But what did I just watch. The movie has a weak storyline and a lot of random characters from different timelines and mythologies, why?? It was like watching a mixture of avatar, star wars, harry potter, the gladiator and Tarzan who all join up to battle a few nazis. So very disturbing. üòµ‚Äçüí´ And one really bad nazi gets all his teeths knocked out in the end, no wait, all the teeths are back in place i next scene.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 28, 2023","This movie isn't an original but it's packed with excitement and fun. A digital masterpiece. A decent storyline, excellent acting and great special effects. Anthony Hopkins narration set the movie up to be great right from the start. It's definitely worth a watch.",POSITIVE
"Dec 28, 2023","My family and I massively enjoyed this film, and look forward to part two!

"Dec 28, 2023","Very entertaining. Visually stunning and interesting story. I do not understand all the online hate, most people i know liked the movie. Good that there is a new original film instead of another prequel or sequal, even if it is inspired by other movies and stories.",POSITIVE
"Dec 28, 2023",Seriously garbage - an embarrassment for the sci-fi genre. A mash up of far better films with cheesy tropes by the score. A heinously clunky script with characters shallower than a puddle that the creators are trying desperately to have us connect with using 15 second back stories (if that) and OTT dramatic music and exposition. CGI/ SFX overload with bad green-screen shots and too many absurd slo-mo's. Why do we need to look forward to the directors' cut if he can't make a decent film in the cinematic cut?,NEGATIVE

I give this film an extra star for Tarak's fine, oiled up abs ... but next time Zach, a little more story and a little less pretenscious slow-mo.
And FFS .. stop using that awful camera lens. When I go to see a movie at the cinema I'm interested to actually SEE the film, and not feel like I'm developing cateracts!",NEGATIVE

"Dec 28, 2023","Very much don't understand all the hate and low IMDB and Tomato Score? Usually when this is the case the films end up quite good which means that critics always go in with extreme high expectations, not going their way and so, bad score. 

It's a fresh sci fi, action, adventure which is entertaining and one of those ""can be watched over and over again"" kind of films. It's rare these days for films to have that unique quality. 

Very much excited about part 2 and hope Zack manages to finish what he started.",POSITIVE
"Dec 28, 2023","predictable ,boring and not fun.
It looked like a bunch of slow motion highlight reels for a bunch of characters no one cares about or is made to care about.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 28, 2023","This movie felt a bit disconnected - you never feel that the story is unique - 20 minutes in you realise you are watching a ""highlight real"" of all your favourite action/adventure movies...the accents doesnt match the characters, the costumes are all over the place - we have a ""nazi"" bad guy, han solo wannabe, viking farmer, braveheart's brother and sister, cowboy ninja with lightsabers, a General Gladiator who played in Gladiator with a very similar back story than Maximus and a ""hero"" that escaped from the script of Sucker Punch...and the story line almost feels a bit like ""Foundation meets Star Wars""...one more thing the nazi bad guy is resurrected the same way in which Neo wakes up from the Matrix.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 28, 2023","Seven samurai for gen Z. Not great but not bad. Has potential that the directors cut will fix the uneven pacing. Good special effects and over the top characters. For what amounts to a prequel for a Part 2, sets up the real story that will make our break any future sequels.",NEUTRAL

"Dec 28, 2023","Think ""Bug's Life"" as a space opera with aliens and humans. 
Big bad guys come to take the annual harvest. 
Threaten to hurt everyone if they do not provide a full harvest. 
One of the farmers takes on the role of finding even meaner 'bugs' /people to fight the bad guys away from their farming community.... 
Sword wielding Ninja mercenary named Nemesis 
Bad Han Solo owns a ship 
Roman themes throughout - including a general or two 
A displaced prince who can speak to fantastic beasts (and apparently can handle the massive thermal changes without ever wearing a shirt, but he needs pants 
A bad guy who is killed and then restored to life with a new mission to bring back the kidnapped/adopted daughter of Thanos... wait, no, but kind of... 

... aside from the thin veil of plagiarism, the special effects are pretty good. The story telling is subpar. I watched this because it got 'great' reviews. I see that I was maliciously misinformed.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 28, 2023",I thought it was pretty good. I feel like the directors cut or 2nd will be even better. With that said I'll probably rewatch again soon. Was visually stunning and thought the story was pretty good with a lot of potential,POSITIVE
"Dec 28, 2023","Acting is what makes or breaks a movie. The storytelling is key so I can see how some review this poorly.  Good action and some CG that was overdone.  Character development seemed rushed, and flowed a tad clunky.  It's rewatchable when the next film releases.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 28, 2023","Like a much, much worse version of Star Wars. Extremely cliched stuff. Paint by numbers sci-fi. A cartoonish villain who is dressed like a Nazi. The dude with the Irish accent is unintentionally hilarious because he feels so out of place. After the first 20 minutes, this movie was an absolute meandering slog.

Also, the plot is ripoff of A Bug's Life, lol.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 28, 2023","Bad in a lot of way, good in very few.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 28, 2023",It's a familiar story with a bit of twist. The movie is definitely laying the foundation and building up to what I think will be an amazing story. I enjoyed it.,POSITIVE

"Dec 28, 2023","A really waste of time.
A copy paste of every science fiction franchise.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 28, 2023","Rebel moon is a worthy watch, but don't expect to be thrilled. It definitely borrowed the star wars material including the lightsaber.  It's tons of fun though and shouldn't be missed.",POSITIVE
"Dec 28, 2023","Visually ok. Truly terrible story, direction and dialog. No original characters or creatures.  Too many characters and they're all ridiculous. Worse than I feared. But not the absolute worst thing I've seen. Actors are like-able. Some of the action sequences are ok. Starts out well enough.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 28, 2023",Very poor story line and script writing,NEGATIVE
"Dec 28, 2023",Amazing better ending then most things we get and it has a part 2 keep doing great work,POSITIVE
"Dec 28, 2023","Let's start with the good. Great visuals and acting throughout the movie. 

There is a lot of bad. The story is stale and becomes even worse as almost every situation has a predictable outcome. You also have quite a lot of ""that makes no sense"" moments where it seems something happens to specifically move the storyline forward but also defies rationale.

There was some character development but again, it took a backseat in order to force the story progression. This movie needed at least 30 more minutes of runtime as it didn't progress smoothly and felt extremely rushed/constrained.

I probably need to rewatch it as I dozed off on it a few times (which rarely happens while I'm watching an action movie).",NEGATIVE
"Dec 28, 2023",Treat the movie for what it is. An origin story to a new world. Great movie from the beginning to the end. Was able to watch in one showing can't wait for the next installment,POSITIVE
"Dec 28, 2023","The first thirty minutes were interesting, even though none of the characters showed any emotions. But after that it just dragged on while going nowhere!",NEGATIVE
"Dec 28, 2023",What did I just watch?   I was really excited for this film and maybe I had too high expectations.   I found it lacking...,NEGATIVE
"Dec 28, 2023","A little cliche, but still a fun Sci Fi movie! Worth supporting new universes that can expand and become even greater in my opinion. Love the risk on a new IP. Worth a watch!",POSITIVE
"Dec 28, 2023","Good, not great.  Seems like the characters were thrown together kind of fast.  Not a lot of meaningful interaction that made me care about any of them.  I'm most interested in the robot who doesn't want to fight.",POSITIVE
"Dec 28, 2023",Very entertaining. Great visuals . This is a solid action move that is well done and Sofia Boutella is the ultra rare actress who plays a convincing female military character. Not deep or philosophical but entertaining  escapist entertainment.,POSITIVE
"Dec 28, 2023",This is the worst movie I've ever seen. It's the perfect homage to the popular media of this Era. Soulless unoriginal nonsense. It's genuinely astonishing how bad this movie is. It's worth watching just to revel in its total failure.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 28, 2023","This movie was fantastic!  The world building and cinematography was on point! The story did a good job of introducing us to a new world and the major charcters while laying the foundation for a larger epic story. 

Somthing that I enjoyed in particular was the many visual and story homages this movie pays to some of the great SCIFIs of the 90s. 

It was a fun ride! I highly recommend!",POSITIVE
"Dec 28, 2023",Cinematography was distracting. Shooting wide open for the whole movie looks terrible,NEGATIVE
"Dec 28, 2023","Where is the story, ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è you get to the end and you don't actually care for any of the characters. This movie has no heart, there are moments where you almost glimpse the team their trying to build but it misses the mark.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 28, 2023","It was entertaining but it was definitely overhyped. Some things seemed off, like the story itself, the random slow-mo scenes, and none of the characters had any chemistry or connection. That said, it was visually entertaining, the action scenes were fun (minus the overdone and unnecessary slow-mo scenes), and the series has potential if it's steered back on track. I give it 4 stars because it was a fun watch, and because we need more shows of this production quality on streaming services. Though I hope they can learn from their mistakes.",POSITIVE
"Dec 28, 2023",Great world building but all the character relationships felt super forced and cheesy. Nemesis has the most depth of all the characters and she gets 7 minutes screen time. The design of the characters and the art direction is the only good part about the movie.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 28, 2023","Yes, it's all very derivative yada yada yada‚Ä¶but it is entertaining, some interesting characters, good action sequences and for the most part, delivering impressive visuals‚Ä¶let's wait and see what Part II yields in April before getting too carried away‚Ä¶",NEUTRAL
"Dec 28, 2023","If you like Sci fi, you'll like this. Does it have flaws? Yes but it pulls you in, in an unexplainable way.",POSITIVE
"Dec 28, 2023","Awful as a whole. Characters are boring and forgettable. Every scene was stolen from some other sci fi or fantasy great. The only thing this had was great graphics, but with that it also created probably the worst part of the show which is the fact that the fight scenes were ultra violent but only had PG 13 outcomes. In multiple scenes arms were broken, but not really broken. The scenes occur in what should be very gruesome but no gore whatsoever. It just didn't fit together. At least in like a PG 13 Marvel movie the combat matches the outcome. A lot of hype for the ultimate let down.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 28, 2023",Beautiful cinematography and action the story also keeps you on the edge of your seat!!,POSITIVE
"Dec 28, 2023","Like most other people's opionions, this movie has great visuals, but some below par characters and acting. Also Charlie Hunnams Northern Irish accent is just so annoying.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 28, 2023",Awesome sci Fi film!!!  I loved it.  Really looking forward to the next part.,POSITIVE
"Dec 28, 2023","I had high hopes for this, and it's not bad per se. Truly beautiful, action was amazing! It was just too much content in too little time. Jumping from planet to planet, person to person so quickly I couldn't remember main characters' names, let alone feel a compelling connection to them. This would have worked far better as a 6 or even 8 part series so that each world/character could have been explored more in depth. Such huge potential only to over pack it and miss a lot of depth. I will still check out part 2 but can't get over my disappointment at imagining what could have been.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 28, 2023","The movie was very appealing visually, but the lack of entertaining writing and borrowed tropes alone can't make a good movie out of a less than appealing narrative. The over abundance of slow motion makes this movie incredibly boring. It is predictable and cannot be carried by its amazing cast alone",NEGATIVE
"Dec 28, 2023",I feel like this is gonna be fodder for Mystery science theater 3000.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 28, 2023","This movie was one of those ""epic"" movies. Sure, the storyline felt like it was on fast forward at times, and the acting could've been a little better, but this movie satisfies the fantasy of fighting an intergalactic war that isn't too far fetched.",POSITIVE
"Dec 28, 2023",Loved this. Can't wait for part two.  The slow burn here and there doesn't bother me.  It's setting up part 2.,POSITIVE
"Dec 28, 2023","I believe the critics got this one wrong, they could only credit the visuals which are epic, but it creates a brand new IP were a female protagonist who has to face the demons of her past to save her future, fantastic!! Avoids the Mary Sue Star Wars narrative also doesn't get bogged down in the metadology of the force or explaining the ability of their warrior, the narrative that ultimately killed star wars over explaining the force and restricting the abilities to someone who was force sensitive. Thankfully this new space opera creates a story of survival and resistance that is both familiar and fresh!! The movie has Star Wars, Avatar and The Matrix inspired moments, moments that shocked cinema and it's definitely recaptured in Rebel Moon!!",POSITIVE
"Dec 28, 2023",Great sci-fi film with the epic scale you'd expect from one of Snyder's pieces of art. The only thing missing is more of it! I can't wait for the longer cut and part 2!,POSITIVE

Muy interesante propuesta, me encant√≥!",POSITIVE
"Dec 28, 2023",What on the garbage did I just watch? Missing plot lines. Rushes to the ending in the longest way possible. I'm still not sure why the protagonist and antagonist started fighting at the end. It's not even an original concept. It could have at least been done better. I made this account just to tell everyone how disappointed I am. Now I know how my father felt.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 28, 2023","Dazzling, entertaining, and unexpected brilliance. Will need to watch again on a larger screen!",POSITIVE
"Dec 28, 2023","If you like slow-mo and terrible writing, then this is the film for you!",NEGATIVE
"Dec 28, 2023","It has an OK start to it, although the accents of the bad soldiers was a bit on the nose.

Then it turns into Seven Space Samurai but unlike the original where you understand what they're doing and why it's a lot more ambiguous here. In the original you understand what both sides want and how they plan on achieving it. 

In the original it's a village full of people guided by the ronin in a defensible position. They are against a gang of bandits. This is a winnable fight.

In Seven Go To Space they're defending a village against the equivalent of The Empire in Star Wars. The second they encounter hardship they could just destroy the village. Or the entire planet. Our heroes even seem to acknowledge this... but still don't seem to have any kind of plan beyond join forces and defend the village.

So after they leave the village pretty early in the movie it's just a recruitment drive. We go to next guy and collect for team. We have no plan. It's shockingly boring.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 28, 2023","Ok so here we go. The sets looked fake and were so damn bland, the cgi was good sometimes but mostly not, you could tell where the sets ended and the green screen started, the plot was dumb and the practical effects were horrible, and too much slowmo. A very average film from an extremely overrated director.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 28, 2023",Loved it. In fact it had many many elements of what make a large action science fiction story work. Ignore the critics. Sure it isn't the Martian but enjoy it as it's a fun amazing ride. Can't wait for part 2 and hopefully part 3.,POSITIVE
"Dec 28, 2023","First of all, having a strong female lead without cheesiness and over the top emphasis is rare, and Rebel Moon has managed to write a great one. The characters and visuals are stunning also. My only gripe is that it's quite slow at points and characters haven't been fully developed but that might be down to it being a two parter so I'll hold my judgement until watching it.",POSITIVE
"Dec 28, 2023","A truly terrible movie with no engaging charaters. Overly dramatic music, some good acting by the main villain (allthough his resemblance to Hitler is so clich√©) but the rest very bad. And don‚Äôt even get me started on the bad Irish accents. It tries so, so hard to be Star Wars but comes off as desparate. Thinnest of plots. The fighting is so artificial and exaggerated. The death of Darrian Blodaxe with tears in his eyes was downright silly. The fight between the villain and heroine made me laugh it was so ridiculous. And the speach about honouring those who gave their lives? So overly dramatic. I‚Äôve never seen a movie taking itself so seriously and with it‚Äôs head so far up it‚Äôs own a‚Ä¶.Will spare myself watching the sequel!",NEGATIVE

I loved the action and loved the seriousness of the movie a lot more than, most of the cheesy and corny marvel movies of late. We are now looking forward to watching the Directors cut and part two.  Could they have spent more time building the characters, maybe. Either way, we enjoyed the movie, and I may watch it again.",POSITIVE

"Dec 27, 2023",It is ok to be derivative as long as you can bring a compelling depth to your story and characters. Sadly Rebel Moon is paper thin tracing paper.

"Dec 27, 2023",A worse version of better movies. How do you make Seven Samurai in space bad? Truly an impressive feat.

"Dec 27, 2023","Bad. So bad. There are too many characters with absolutely nothing interesting about them, no motivations and half assed traumatic back stories.

The plot is a mess with yawn worthy lengths of exposition the only thing holding it together.

And the slo mo omg the the slo mo.
Unnecessary, ill-timed and hard to watch. It happens so often and so out of place that the few times it's used correctly aren't impactful whatsoever. It's honestly cringe worthy.

The visuals are trying to be something but the terrible writing and plot just undermine it entirely.

"Dec 27, 2023","A test of the degree of imagination shown in a sci-fi film is whether it could equally have been done as a cowboy movie. ""Rebel Moon Pt. 1"" could have, and the movie would have been ""The Magnificent Seven"" (1960, 2016, 1998-2000 as a TV series, or indeed ""Seven Samurai"" of 1954), because the plot is err.... identical. And I expect the plot of the second half will be identical too. So if you have ever seen any of those and a spaceship taking off, you don't need to see this movie (OK, some of the spaceship imagery is very good). But I have to wonder whether anyone was actually paid for ""writing"" the script :-)",NEUTRAL

"Dec 27, 2023","A very clich√© filled sci-fi movie.
Unfortunately, the story-telling is very fragmented and the film has difficulty retaining its audience.

You feel very annoyed by the lack of content and you feel you are missing parts of the story.

The film is beautifully made, but it cannot measure up to the poor narration style and the vast ocean of ‚Äã‚Äãclich√©s",NEGATIVE

"Dec 27, 2023",What a hodgepodge of stolen ideas with no cohesive story arc. Not sure how or why this was ever made. Kind of fun spectacle at times but really not worth your time.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 27, 2023","As I watched ""Rebel Moon Part 1,"" I couldn't help but feel disappointed by what unfolded on the screen. The film, which promised an exciting sci-fi adventure, was marred by a series of critical flaws. Firstly, the script was a letdown, filled with clich√©s and lacking in meaningful character development. This made it hard for me to connect with or even care about the characters and their journey. Additionally, the pacing was painfully slow, with numerous scenes dragging on without adding anything significant to the story. Although the visual effects were technically impressive, they often felt excessive and seemed to compensate for the lack of a strong narrative. The performances, too, left much to be desired, failing to bring any real depth or nuance to the lackluster script. All these elements combined made ""Rebel Moon Part 1"" a forgettable and rather frustrating viewing experience, falling short of the captivating sci-fi epic it aimed to be.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 27, 2023","Excelente filme, recomendo a todos!",POSITIVE
"Dec 27, 2023","This is an objectively terrible movie. That said, it is a really fun drinking game movie. Get a group of family or friends and have a drink everytime you spot a scene, character or storyline ripped from another movie. If you know your sci-fi and fantasy movies you will be quite drunk by the end! 

I am frankly quite amazed a second instalment is imminent. The acting was very poor, the effects were ok (some effects were terrible), the characters were ridiculous, and the story line wholly unoriginal. As a new cast member came on screen, an Asian lady, we took bets on whether or not she was going to be a ninja. Sure enough, Asian lady is a ninja with lightsabers. 

Skip this movie, unless you watch it is a group for some drinking fun.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 27, 2023",Great combination of different scifi and fantasy movies. Stunning scenes and awesome actors. I truly don't understand the negative reviews. I even registered to this site to let you know that you should definitely give this movie a chance. Can't wait for part II!,POSITIVE
"Dec 27, 2023","Really enjoyed it. Obviously going to get comparisons to Star Wars. Not a massive Star Wars fan but enjoyed the style and gore(somewhat) that I always thought Star Wars should have. 
I will say the main character is pretty terrible, not a great cast whatsoever. Incredibly boring and she's genuinely just not a great actor. But would have rather have her than the a cringe John Boyega cutting about my screen. 
This film has been somewhat panned  from reading the reviews. If this film had Star Wars attached to its title, it would be clearing 4 out of 5s easily from most reviewers. Also, people love jump on a hate train,  Zack Synder is victim to this most of the time. Big man should change his name, and he'd be getting decent reviews. 
But aye, if you're reading this and you're on the fence, give it a bash. It's a good watch for sure.",POSITIVE
"Dec 27, 2023","This was just bad all around. Overdone visuals with undercooked plots (plural, since this film shoved every trope into itself).",NEGATIVE
"Dec 27, 2023",An Epic sci-fi journey!,POSITIVE
"Dec 27, 2023","Absolute Star wars fanfic trash, Stupid slow mo scenes, no emotion robot actors and horribly boring and borrowed plot. Disney should sue Zack not because it's basically a Star wars ripoff, but because it sucks so bad.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 27, 2023",Well I liked it. Its only a part one so there are going to be disfunction and questions unanswered but considering people get all excited about a Marvel movie (that has zero plot lines) I don't understand the hate for Rebel Moon. I look forward to Part two..,POSITIVE
"Dec 27, 2023","I love these types of movies, but this Star Wars wanna be lacks time and depth into characters. Seems like they ran out of money and skipped over important notes from what I assume is the book. I will still watch the second movie!",NEGATIVE
"Dec 27, 2023","33 minutes into movie and nothing grabs my attention. Boring, slow, cant get intimate the characters. Pass.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 27, 2023","Thoughtless, mind numbing trash. It feels weird to say a movie both has way too much exposition and at the same time absolutely none. The viewer is spoon fed melodramatic flashback scenes of over delivered dialogue to establish the main character's tragic trope of a back story, while every other character is given a short segment of an over the top action sequence and some crumbs of dialogue. Only to take up arms and join the party without any meaning or reason, then getting shoved off screen, exit stage right.

Sci-fi fans will quickly realize that everything put on screen by the design department is something they've seen done before. From costumes that look directly ripped out of other franchises, to weapons so uninspired and unoriginal your brain will be convinced they pulled them off another set. 

Backgrounds often appear as flat, wide open poorly rendered cgi spaces that serve to remind your brain that nothing on screen is real, and none of this matters. The special effects look like mid 2000s video game cutscenes that seem intentionally blurred to hide the mistakes.

Nobody will be talking about this movie a month from now, and if there's any justice in the world this flop will serve as a reminder to future sci-fi writers and directors that if you want to start your own IP you have to be at least somewhat original.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 27, 2023",Dazzling images and effects but falls short of drawing viewer in. Poor character building that felt extremely rushed at times. Movie fell short of its potential due to poor dialogue and missed opportunities for character arc building.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 27, 2023","Rebel Moon is a movie that follows the protagonist's point of view most of its time, all we know about the team is what she knows and we get to know some of her story and relate to her, knowing about the universe she lives in through her sights and story. The movie hints on some interesting points, like origins and behaviours of some characters that aren't digged in the part one, but maybe they will in the extended version or in part 2. The bad guys aren't dumb or miss all shots. There are some misteries to be delved into as well. I really enjoyed it and look forward to the extended cut of the movie that's supposed to come out before April 19th.",POSITIVE

"Dec 27, 2023","Honestly dreadful. Charlie hunnams terrible accent is only a highlight as it adds a comedy aspect to this otherwise abysmal film

Character design: 1\10 (everyone is a cliche)
Character development: 0\10 (there isn't any)
Dialogue: 1\10 (reads like an angsty 14yo)
Plot: 1\10 (trope after trope after trope)
Choreography: 1\10 (clunky fight scenes)
Cinematography: 1\10 (nothing but CGI)


One of the worst films I've sat through, dialogue sounds forced and every phrase is done 'tough-guy' speech. This film relies on green screens and slow motion fight scenes to make up for it's lack of everything else like the cloying absent father who tries to buy your affection with expensive toys",NEGATIVE
"Dec 27, 2023","I don't know how you rip every part of your movie from so many great pieces of media and somehow not one minute of your runtime is engaging or interesting. The characters have no depth, and their motivations don't make any sense. The characters also weirdly never interact.  The aesthetic is a cheap knock off of Star Wars and Warhammer 40K.  It's an insult to your intelligence from title card to credits.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 27, 2023","If you are looking for a visually good entretaining movie, this is for you. But, if you are looking for a good story with deep meaningfull characters and their development or motivations, you should look elsewere. Characters suddently join a rebellion because it's ""the right thing"", none of the characters besides the protagonist have any background story or motivations and they feel like they are inserted in the movie for the sake of the story. Feels like an expensive (worst) copy of star wars and serenity.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 27, 2023","Very entertaining, visually stunning. You can tell the world is rich in lore and a lot of thought went into it. Cgi is excellent (83m budget!!!) and by far outshines any blockbuster from recent years. Set up for the sequel at the end left you wanting more.",POSITIVE
"Dec 27, 2023","Not his best. But I enjoyed it. The camera work... The story. I wished it was longer to complete the story. Can wait for part 2.

"Dec 27, 2023","hello
well i liked the movie
It is really a Warhammer 40 K meets Starwars take on the 7 samurai.
The cast is good, the plot is good for the genre. This movie does not suffer of the modern plague that is characters being used a plot device.  

A fair amount of people complain about characterisation but for me it is on par with the first part of the 7 samurai (which is 207 minutes long in the Japanese version). On that front ultimately the next instalment is going to be mesure of that point. They have hinted enough through each characters to  make  me quietly confident on that front.

"Dec 27, 2023",There is nothing new in the story line but the filmography is very good and you can see where the money has been spent.  At a guess I reckon good will win over evil by just enough to perhaps have a part 3 and 4.  Looking forward to watching episode 2.,NEUTRAL

"Dec 27, 2023",I think as part one of the series it is a good start. I don't know why people think it was a waste of time. Yeah somethings were not upto the mark but even marvel movies have some illogical stuff and bad dialogues but people tend to ignore that. I think it is a good start and a spectacular visually,POSITIVE
"Dec 27, 2023",I give this a half star for its visual effects budget. Everything else about this is so incredibly derivative that I think the only way It could be any more derivative would be if it in fact straight up copied itself. I have a feeling that's exactly what the other 3 movies will do.. wait theres 3 more of these? OH GOD slay me now!!,NEGATIVE
"Dec 27, 2023",Loved that movie and can't wait for the second part. I just love the strong visual language of the director and other than light saber like weapons it disn't feel like Star Wars. Once again this is one of the examples where I clearly have the impression that critics (that do it as a job) are more wrong than right and that they are just unnecessary for the audience.,POSITIVE

"Dec 27, 2023","A disclaimer. My general mode of watching a movie or tv show is all about my entertainment. I do not fancy myself as a wanna-be critic and I don't spend the majority of my viewing time critically dissecting the plot line, the acting or finding a reason to punish the director for some past sin or disappointment.  Having set that as my viewing criteria I will say this movie entertained me. There was plenty of action and the universal design pleased my science fiction sensibilities.  Yes, the plot line had a familiarity to it but I enjoyed it just the same. I had no expectations for a more provocative level of sex or violence so I had no disappointment there. I will endeavor to watch part 2 when it comes out.",POSITIVE

"Dec 27, 2023","Honestly. There are so many slow mo action scenes that show nothing, you wonder why it's slow mo in the first place.
The characters are forgettable.  I can't even remember the names of them. Half the movie is them teleporting to places(because of lack of transition) to gather random people when we don't even know why they want then to join. Nothing in the movie makes any sense. The characters pick the absolute dumbest options possible. Please hire writers the story/plot/dialog all suck.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 27, 2023","""Rebel Moon"" falls short of expectations, showcasing a convoluted plot and disjointed storytelling.

"Dec 27, 2023","This movie can only be reviewed with a pros and cons list as the polarity of what was good and what was bad was so dramatic, I feel the need to break it up. 

Pros:
*The graphic design of this movie is unbelievably good! Whomever designed the worlds and graphically created them, did one of the best jobs I have ever seen. The work they did into making the worlds feel so realistic were phenomenal, I was beyond impressed. This maybe some of the best imagery I have ever seen in a movie ever. +10 Stars
*The movie soundtrack has a very well balanced epic nature to it and felt very dramatic, but still felt smoothly placed along the different scenes of the movie. 
+4 Stars

Cons:

*The main female actress was not good, her acting was atrocious. What really ruined it for me is that it is an action movie. It was abundantly obvious that she had zero athletic ability, even her ""run"" looked non athletic. It was weird and made it very hard to take her serious in the action scenes. Triple camera angles bouncing around and slow motion scenes for days to make up for her inability to do any real action choreography. Also, this actress is like 90lbs. I very much doubt shes able to do any hand to hand combat yet they kept putting her in scenes where she is........ 
-5 stars
* Plot armor......more plot armor....and.....well more plot armor. I am convinced that a 10 year old wrote this plot line. It just does not have one real piece of developed plot. It was beyond cliche, there were no surprises, everything was obvious, and half the time the plot made no sense. The ""collecting"" warriors montage was so dumb....I almost turned the movie off on the ""gryphon scene"". I love gryphons, but there was no need to add this part to the movie other than to attract that small portion of sub 80 IQ viewers.
-5 Stars
*Acting. Almost every major actor in the movie, besides the main actress who is horrible, are usually really good actors/actresses. It hurt my heart to see some of my most favorite actors and actresses going through the motions as they participated in this horrendously bad movie. You could feel that they just were not in it. I recognize I know next to nothing about directing a movie, and at this point I am 100% certain I could make a better film. This is absolutely painful to watch. 
-5 Stars

Conclusion:
This movie is absolutely horrible. What makes this movie even more terrible is the fact that the creators of the imagery and music did a beyond well done job, only to have all their hard work just flushed right down the toilet with terrible writing/directing. This movie had some amazing potential and could have rocked the socks off of any viewer, but the never ending plot holes, the terrible acting, the unrealistic and mediocre main protoganist, the sidelined better actors/actresses, and the cliche ending were absolutely deflating. The producers/writers/directors should be ashamed of themselves.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 27, 2023","It's a good flick. I'm not sure where all the negative comments are coming from, but I started the film with an open mind and found out it's good.",POSITIVE
"Dec 27, 2023",Plot is all over the place of mashed up other movie plots. Character development was rushed I guess the plot holes are meant to be discovered later but I really never got invested enough to care.

"Dec 27, 2023",Definitely a great watch...Yes the story building was a little slow but there's gotta be a back story to give all the additional characters life and substance..VERY excited to see the second one..,POSITIVE
"Dec 27, 2023",It's better than anything Marvel has put out since Spider-Man: No Way Home.,POSITIVE
"Dec 27, 2023",The awful acting and cringeworthy script could not be saved by the wonderful special effects. I can usually watch any sci-fi happily: this was a massive let down.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 27, 2023","I appreciate all the detail to the lore of the entire movie, just finished it now and already want to watch it again. I would have gave it 5 stars if it were rated R but other than that it was really good!",POSITIVE
"Dec 27, 2023","Don't listen to what the critics have to say, see it for yourself. It's like some of the movies in the past couple years they raved that they were great but they just sucked so bad. Rebel moon is what the Star Wars sequels should have been. Instead we got stuck with Rey Skywalker and some how he returned. In Rebel moon, the visual effects are awesome, the script and story telling is well written and executed, perfect cast that blends well. Overall great movie and screw the haters.",POSITIVE
"Dec 27, 2023","This was a great popcorn movie. While it would never be confused with a film, it did feel like a well made video game. What it lacked in dialogue and plot it made up for with great visuals, a fun style and high quality production.",POSITIVE
"Dec 27, 2023","If you enjoy ridiculous amounts of slo-mo, one of the worst accents in movie history, and a thinly veiled it to bring people together, this may be the movie for you. I fell asleep twice, even when I just started using it as background noise.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 27, 2023","The first 35 minutes of the movie begins with a decent plot, a group of vulnerable colonists are threatened by a military force. They must give up their crops or die. The characters and dialog were compelling and it seemed to be the start of a decent movie. However, from there the story devolved into a shamockery of the worst kind. The hero assembles a group of tough guy (and gal) fighters, painfully one at a time, to save the colonists. Each new fighter is more simple, over the top, and under-developed than the last. The script quicly becomes a total effortless joke. The move stumbles incoherently from one scene to the next as it assembles a league of extrodinary goofs. The final fight sequence is so hard to believe and painful to watch that I had to fast forward thru it or risk vomitting. This movie is an insult to sci-fi fans.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 27, 2023","If the story would move past looking for fighters for a war, it might have been a bit better. It passed the time, not in a hurry to see Part 2",NEGATIVE
"Dec 27, 2023","Don't get all the hate. Solid cast, easy to understand what the core elements are. Look forward to part 2.",POSITIVE
"Dec 27, 2023","Visually appealing at times, but plot is simple and the characters even simpler. There is no depth to the story as each character joins the fight with little to no convincing preventing the viewer of any immersion. This felt like more of a limited series than a feature film.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 27, 2023","This movie was a very fun watch. Visually stunning,lots of action likable characters. I can't wait for the second installment. It felt like an adult StarvWars. I hear there's a R rated version coming soon. If you ignore the critics and just watch the movie,I believe you will have a good time. Didn't feel like a 2 hour movie to me.",POSITIVE
"Dec 27, 2023","It was pretty to watch some parts, but the CGI was horrible, the storyline was not smooth at all.  It seems liked a ton of backstory was just skipped over but then referenced later in the movie.  I had to rewind parts of it because I thought I must have dozed off and missed important things, but they just skipped them apparently.  I had no idea how they got to some places and found some of the characters.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 27, 2023","The film borrows from movies like 7 Samursi. Dirty Dozen, A Bugs Life, OG Star Wars, and a little of LOTR but that is not a bad thing.  This movie has a lot of action and is better that Disney Star Wars. 3.5 starts out of 5.",POSITIVE

"Dec 27, 2023","It's AWESOME!! Yes, it's yet another remake of 7 samurais. But I don't care! I like that story and am fine that it's a basis of so many other stories. Yes, it's a bit too much backstory and world building can be a bit slow. I just hope part 2 carries enough momentum to make the backstories worthwhile for MANY future tales... I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, it's visually stunning, the characters are cool and I LOVE this kind of Sci Fi and support this endeavor!",POSITIVE
"Dec 27, 2023",Decent movie but it's convoluted and I hate the mains voice.,NEUTRAL
"Dec 27, 2023",Slow motion for me has a brand new meaning. This was a chose to watch and somehow might be Snyder's worst work yet and that's saying something as he beat up Superman with a kitchen sink.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 27, 2023","My wife and I thought it was great. Lots of action and stunning visuals.

"Dec 27, 2023","As a hater of Disney Star Wars and the majority of marvel films I can honestly say that this film was good not a masterpiece but very good . If this was set in the Star Wars universe like it was created for it would be pretty epic Disney missed out on this and are stuck with the trash they churn out . Some decent twists and character development is swift and satisfying enough to get the story moving . Some people might prefer a tv series to introduce the side characters in more depth but I would rather it be like how this film did it and make me want to find out more about them later if the film succeeds in keeping my attention . 
I'm looking forward to the sequel and at this point I'm invested in this project . Can't believe a lot of people are bad mouthing this film i almost didn't check it out cause of it but I'm glad I did .",POSITIVE

"Dec 27, 2023",Me and my family watched on Christmas night and half left and the other half fell asleep. If it wasn't for the slow motion this movie would be like an hour and half instead of the two and half hours it is. The characters and writing is so bad and has so many references to other science fiction (Star Wars and Warhammer) It feels like a B movie with good visuals and the visuals are the only reason why its getting a 2 instead of a 1.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 27, 2023",Wow‚Ä¶ that was just terrible. Nothing redeemable about this hunk of junk. If I could give no stars I would.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 27, 2023","I never reviewed a movie in my life. Yet I compelled to do this. I'm 40 and generally love sci fi movies. Having said that, there is one thing I can say that is extremely positive about this film. It's consistently horrible for the entire 2 hours. So if you are 15 minutes in and are thinking, man this is garbage, it probably gets better, don't, because it doesn't. If you pay attention to the clues, the film makes it very clear that it's terrible and gives plenty of clues to stop watching it. Listen to yourself. Or you can spend 2 hours of your time hoping this eventually gets better until the credits start rolling and you find yourself disappointed by your optimism",NEGATIVE
"Dec 27, 2023","I'm not huge into sci-fi but thought it was entertaining, excellent fight scenes, and had great visuals.  I would definitely watch the next one.  A lot of people are crapping on this movie because it is similar to other sci-fi movies.  If you aren't obsessed with Star Wars you will enjoy this movie.  Almost no movies in 2023 are all original ideas anymore. . .so try not to take things so seriously and enjoy it for what it is.",POSITIVE
"Dec 27, 2023",It's a great movie. Not many are coming out like this!!!,POSITIVE
"Dec 27, 2023",i hope the directors cut version plugs the gaps in the storyline - the edit in this version makes episode one painful to digest.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 27, 2023","This film stands as a profound disappointment, a stark contrast to the expectations set by its promising premise. It's plagued by a multitude of shortcomings, the most glaring of which is its poorly structured plot. The storyline meanders without clear direction, leaving the audience bewildered and disengaged. The script is another weak point, filled with dialogue that feels artificial and forced, further detracting from the movie's potential to resonate with its viewers.

In terms of performances, the actors seem to struggle, unable to breathe life into their one-dimensional characters. This lack of depth in character development results in a failure to evoke any emotional investment from the audience. The interactions between characters feel stilted and unnatural, exacerbating the film's overall lack of cohesion.

Furthermore, the direction of the movie is lackluster. It's evident that there's a missing sense of vision or creative flair, which leaves the film feeling uninspired and tedious. This is compounded by the subpar cinematography and special effects, which are neither innovative nor particularly well-executed. Instead of enhancing the storytelling, they feel like afterthoughts, failing to add any real excitement or visual appeal.

Even the soundtrack, which often serves as a redeeming feature in many films, is unremarkable and forgettable in this case. It neither complements the scenes nor adds any additional layers to the narrative.

Overall, the movie is a significant letdown. It fails to deliver on many fronts, from storytelling and character development to technical aspects like cinematography and special effects. The end result is a film that is not only unsatisfying but also forgettable, lacking the elements necessary to make it a worthwhile cinematic experience.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 27, 2023","I watched Rebel Moon, so you don't have to. The plot is a mess of scenes copied and pasted from other sci-fi. There's a noticeable lack of any character development or motivation. Action scenes are so-so, and some of the production design is nice.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 27, 2023","Spoiler alert: This is my first ever review but I feel like I had to warn people. This is garbage with glitter on it. It is 2 hrs of no character development. Like at one point this sword lady kills something and all she says is ""remember this could be you dead in a field chasing revenge"" like it is supposed to mean anything to us. I dont know who you are lady. It made no sense. Then later all of a sudden the dude you totally knew was gonna be backstabbing, backstabbed but you didn't really care. Apparently this whole time there was some massive love happening between to characters. They literally had to say it because they never showed it. At that point I was low key rooting for a comet to just come out of no where and wipe out both sides. That would have been the real hero.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 27, 2023","Made an account specifically to give this movie an awful rating - that's how bad it was. My favorite genres are sci-fi and fantasy, so this seemed like it'd be right up my alley.

The writing, acting, and directing were all atrocious.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 27, 2023",This is a very good movie & I am looking forward to seeing more.,POSITIVE
"Dec 27, 2023","The visual elements are fantastic.  Based on this alone, Rebel Moon is worth the price of admission. However, the characterization and dialogue is fairly canned throughout.

I do recommend this film and will be ready for Part Two when it arrives.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 27, 2023","I'm not even reading what the critics say because I want just my opinion out there. It was a fun new sifi film that we have not had in a hot while. To tired of the marvel hero trope, so this was a breath of fresh air and story telling",POSITIVE

"Dec 27, 2023",‚ÄúI like this movie it was good,NEUTRAL
"Dec 27, 2023","This movie had so much potential but ultimately fell flat. I'm optimistic for the sequel because it is an interesting world to create a compelling story in and all the pieces are there it just comes down to the actual story and the development of the characters. 

My primary issues are Kora's character development being done entirely in voice over flashbacks which messed up the pacing of the movie; the complete lack of characterization of everyone on the elite team they gathered; and the climax taking place at an unnamed undisclosed trade depot, which drastically reduced the stakes of protecting the farm planet the primary conflict was based around.

The biggest positive was Kai. The acting was spot on, the costume choice and props he had made him intriguing and I don't want to spoil anything but his twist had a good set up and payoff.

I hope the sequel is better because I really believe it can be good.",NEGATIVE

I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for an exciting sci-fi adventure that the whole family can enjoy together.

Looking forward to part 2.",POSITIVE
"Dec 27, 2023","If I had to summarize this movie it would be riddick meets dune meets Star Wars. It was an okay film, some nice epic scenes here and there. The film could be better, I would have liked to see more character development instead there was a lot of characters quickly introduced to speed the story along.

"Dec 27, 2023","I watched it last night and enjoyed it quite a bit considering I wouldn't say I like Zack's other movies other than 300 and Suckerpunch.  Interesting characters and ideas but I also like how I kind of got lost in the movie and forgot about a lot of real-life concerns. Movies like that usually end up becoming long-time favorites for me.  I'm no critic as I don' have my own youtube channel, apparently, that's how you qualify. I enjoyed it more than overhyped Oppenheimer or stupidly overhyped and quite awful Barbie.",NEUTRAL

"Dec 27, 2023","Really disappointing mashup of Magnificent Seven/Seven Samurai with everything from Star Wars and Avatar to Firefly.

The hippogriff from Harry Potter, Queen of the Aracnos from Dr Who just 2 small examples and why oh why is Charlie Hunnam attempting a Northern Ireland accent with emphasis on the word attempting. Well acted, great effects and cinematography but all the time I was distracted by remembering which other film was being ripped off in virtually each scene and let's not forget the massive overuse of slow motion.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 26, 2023","I truly had high hopes for this film and its sequel, but I am sad to say I was severely underwhelmed and disappointed by this attempt at a space opera of sorts.  First, the visuals, while elaborate and meant to be ""eye candy"" were ruined by poor decisions such as Zack Snyders continuous use of slow motion throughout the film. All the major battles/action packed moments were ruined by ridiculous slow motion cuts.  The characters were really hard to ""get to know"" and almost there to just create an ensemble of ""rebels"" yet you barely get to know anything about them. The movie was slow, yet jumped quickly from location to location in an effort to fit in as much as possible in the short window of time the movie was allotted.  Sadly, I went into this movie with zero idea of what it was about and was open to just enjoy another ""Star Wars"" like film and I hate to say how utterly disappointed I was.  There was basically nothing redeeming about this film and unfortunately it rewatchability is basically zero.  Not sure how part 2 can rescue the mess caused by one.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 26, 2023","Poor story, lack of original ideas, second-hand univers, borrowed characters. Actors have nothing to play. Visual makers use a huge scene and tules for nothing original to show. Could anybody point one new or original idea, character, plot? All looks as AI production glued from slightly modified ideas from other shows, cartoons and games soaked in bombastic music. A good thing is that sometimes one have to watch a spoiled movie to be able to give a credit to a good one. Pity that producers would again deny the disaster to minimize loses and author be allowed to act a success. Definitely waist of resources that could have some better use.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 26, 2023","While watching the visually stunning images, I kept asking, ""What is this scene?"" The story structure and various character arcs are compartmentalized, with the leads standing around watching a side character fight a villain with no backstory. This movie's connective tissue suffers from the ""and then..."" syndrome with a lot of ""Why did that need to happen?"" and ""Who the fuck are these people?""",NEGATIVE
"Dec 26, 2023","Although visually interesting and having a few nuggets that suggest a greater potential.  The film seems badly edited and most of the story is spent assembling a team of characters with little depth and really do nothing to warrant the effort to recruit them.  There is no time to develop any of the characters, the story feels tedious, and the ending is nonsensical.  If you like science fiction mostly for the eye candy and not the story, it may be worth the watch.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 26, 2023","I've seen redemptive stories before, but this style was a tad bit different. The action, the story, and the characters gravitated you closer to what was happening on the screen. I thought this was going to be something I could play on my phone while watching this movie. But I quickly found out I was missing out on important details. So I quickly put my foot down and locked in.",POSITIVE
"Dec 26, 2023","Takes derivative to a whole new level.  Visuals are phenomenal. Acting is adequate (mostly).  Action scenes were okay. Character backgrounds and overall story are among the worst I've seen in quite some time.

"Dec 26, 2023","Personally I really liked the movie.  It entertained me and I loved it visually.

"Dec 26, 2023","Clearly had the funding and the idea was there. How ever the script wasn't and was disappointingly predictable. The combat scenes were visually nice; if you can get past the fact whoever wrote it has no idea what they were doing.

"Dec 26, 2023","Meh...Meh...and more Meh. Was really going in looking for a good movie. What I got was a Syfi retelling of Magnificent Seven (or earlier Seven Samurai). Special effects are decent, but some of the mechanics are questionable. Character development was nothing but monologs, which never captures the hart of the watcher. There was at no point I really cared who lived or died. Even the surprise bad guy was not a surprise. Oh no!...meh...whatever. I really blame very poor, maybe rushed, writing and overall story arc. Will I watch the second part, probably, but with a lot less expectations.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 26, 2023","This movie was the combination of tropes from other movies in this space, mashed together into an uninteresting plot driven by unrelatable and uninteresting characters. In Rand-speak, it's the kind of movie Roark would have made if he compromised on his principles and designed buildings with Greek columns, porticos, and triglyphs, divorcing form from function.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 26, 2023","This was a horrendous movie. The first quarter was watchable, but the story-line quickly falls apart after that. The dialog is immature, the story is akin to the Nazi in a galaxy far, far away.  One of the best characters in the movie is killed. None of the other characters carry their weight. I loved Army Of The Dead and Army of Thieves, bit this trash was worse than Batman Versus Superman.",NEGATIVE

Stale re-used tropes left and right, plenty of costumes that seemed taken from other movies, and loooootttssssss of slowwwwww motion (hey, it needs to fill air time to justify its supposed $160 million price tag).  Nothing new to see here.  I wish I could have given it a 0.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 26, 2023","I thoroughly enjoyed it. I felt it was a little short, even at 2hours 15minutes. I could have sat watching for another hour at least.

"Dec 26, 2023","A movie that was 30% substance 70% VFX. An ensamble reminiscent of Star Wars, Lord of The Rings, and Dune with about half the heart. 

The movie has beautiful environments that weren't explored with the characters being the same. Poor back stories and a rushed premise give a lack luster feeling leaving you with wanting more in a ""half satisfied way"". 
This movie was hoping to capture hearts through visuals only to flood the screen with them. The plot, villains, and supporting cast were all a copy paste of pre-existing universes just with extra steps. The movie feels like another expensive flop where unhinged, coked up producers wanted to shove something down our throat with the monomer of ""Biggest Movie of the Year"". When can we get another movie that loves us? When can we get that fluttering feeling similar to that of Harry bidding farewell to his son, Luke saving the galaxy, or Frodo growing old? Where is the sense of a long adventure coming to an end where you crave no more. Where our story telling appetite has been satiated? 

The movie was visually amazing- stunning? No. Thrilling? Also no. But if you're looking for a movie that will make you reach the bottom of the popcorn bucket, get up off your seat and get a refill mid movie, this is it. Startle up for a modern time B movie with a larger budget than it deserved. Trending the flops of 2023 this movie will leave you not wanting more of it. Part 2 in April 2024? Yeah, I'll leave that one in the queue for a while.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 26, 2023",The critics were a little harsh on the movie. It was entertaining. Some similarities from previous Synder work.

"Dec 26, 2023","I saw a lot of critics say that this film is a Star Wars knock off. While that is true, for example, the introduction explaining what we are about to watch is a 100 percent Star Wars carbon copy. Rebel Moon also plagiarizes other popular blockbuster franchices such as the MCU. Kora was taken in by the Regent and raised as his own after he destroyed her entire village. Have we seen that before in the MCU? Let's remember that Thanos destroyed Gamora's village, but sparred her and raised her as his own. She then turned on him by joining The Guardians. Similarly in Rebel Moon, Kora betrayed the Regent. You see two more instances of this regurgitated in the MCU. Loki turned on the King of Asgard & Captain Marvel fighting against the Kree.",NEGATIVE

It's not breaking any new ground nor is it painfully derivative to the point of being dull. It was a great time and I look forward to the director's cut and part 2.

That said, i thought about it enough to watch it again today so there has to be some entertainment value in that so 2 stars.",NEGATIVE

I love sci-fi and have my entire life and I couldn't stand this cliche driven trash pulled from every other sci-fi move and series for the past 40 years. The premise is dumb. The guy who tames the big crow by just talking to it, inane. The opening scene, plowing a field, at night, with a hand drawn plow with a huge Saturn planet looming overhead is visually interesting, but denies science on the scale of a flat-earther.

"Dec 26, 2023","This film copied several other franchises, made them dull, and stuck them together with dollar-store duct tape. I cared nothing for any of the characters, who were predictable and themselves boring.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 26, 2023",Pretty but bad(that's it).,NEGATIVE
"Dec 26, 2023",Found it hard to find its feet and the constant switching of camera and scenes helped the feeling of disconnect with the characters. Felt like an explanation before an actual movie came out.,NEGATIVE

"Dec 26, 2023","I was hoping to like, or even love, Rebel Moon; but it left a lot to be desired and I found myself bored. The writing was bad, the characters poorly developed, and the action sequences were just a mess of slow motion/fast forward special effects. The were only a couple characters that had any intrigue and they were completely ignored for most of the film; likely setting them up for more in the 2nd part. But with how forgettable part 1 was; I don't know that I even care to see more.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 26, 2023","Awesome movie. It kept me entertained throughout.  Visually stunning.  Interesting story that I want to see more of. 
The biggest issue is that you can tell a lot of the backstories for the characters are missing. The director's cut should fill in the gaps. 

Other than that it's a great start to a new universe.  And overall a very entertaining film.",POSITIVE
"Dec 26, 2023","I thought it wasn't half bad. I am not that tapped in to upcoming films to have been aware this was coming out, and as I was watching it I did wonder if it was a Star Wars spin off (had to Google to find out it isn't). I did feel like certain elements of this first part could have been better developed (or not left on the cutting room floor), but will wait to see either the directors cut that I've now read about and/or Part 2 due for release in a few months, to see how it all hangs together. For now though I feel it wasn't all that bad, but I do see why people have a sense there are elements of it that are unoriginal or perhaps ‚Äòborrow' from other films. Still, I would say to folks to watch it.",POSITIVE

"Dec 26, 2023","Rebel Moon has great visuals and the nods to other Sci-fi media are great, but that's about it.

"Dec 26, 2023","Visually stunning including realistic CGI, authentic feeling costumes, beautiful sets, creative animals and unique characters. There was no emotion, there was no attachment to characters and not one bit of humor. I'm fine with the humor but halfway through the movie I didn't even remember the main females name. This movie could have been amazing with a few tweaks! You just don't care or get attached to the characters after they're introduced and it's a shame because they're all very cool in their own right. I'd give it a 5/10. If they had me attached to all the characters, sped up the long speaking parts and helped you understand where certain plot holes were headed I would give it a 8-9. Enjoyable watch. Just need to get us viewers more emotionally attached to main characters",NEUTRAL
"Dec 26, 2023","Shamelessly copy/paste of ""Seven Samurai - by Kurosawa"" theme, gathering fears and concerns that actually came back in our century. There is no new idea and the quality of the story is poor - regardless of the big budget that should ""give success"" for any trash movie.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 26, 2023","This movie is a big mix of nothing. It tries to be a Star Wars movie but it efforts not to be, so... It became a western, then an epic movie and then a space movie, situation that never happens. It's predictable and boring.

It's better to watch how the grass grows.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 26, 2023","Started strong, got the story going, than it felt rushed, wasted too much time setting up the ""why we need heros"" than cheeses out on their stories and rushes them, liked the different planets but they had no personality and costumes were all over.

"Dec 26, 2023",The story was visually beautiful to watch but it lacked soul. There were absolutely no likeable characters because we didn't see any development in that area.

"Dec 26, 2023","Need therapy to forget this movie. It looks like he created the film with bits and pieces from other films and games. A scene from ""How to Train Your Dragon"", another from ""Gears of Wars"", another from ""No Man's Sky"", there's even ""The Fellowship of the Ring"". This is a ""fan made"" from YouTube. I still can't believe it.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 26, 2023","Really enjoyable movie, look to see how the franchise develops",POSITIVE
"Dec 26, 2023","It's a nice adventure to watch, a beautiful sci-fi world building and good casting. I didn't love the narrative and think it was shallow and too simple, maybe too much explanation on everything specifically on the recruiting part, the audience is smart than this, we can get when things are not explicit. Overall it doesn't deserve all this hate, as a sci-fi film lover I think we should enjoy having people interested in making movies that imagine fantastic worlds and explore imagination. It could be much better, but I enjoyed watching. It's better when we simply seat down and watch instead of looking for reasons to criticize everything.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 26, 2023","I enjoyed it, more style over substance to be honest and I probably wouldn't have seen in the cinema, but it was a very beautiful popcorn flick that entertained me for the better part of the movie. The plot definitely could've been better without major overhauls, but considering this is supposed to set up a triology of sequels I'm more than willing to cut them some slack.

All in all, I'd definitely watch the sequel(s) however I'm not sure this flick has a high rewatch value. Still beter than most Disney Star Wars movies, Rogue One being the exception.",NEUTRAL

"Dec 26, 2023","Worth skipping. Was grossly derivative with some aspects bordering on plagiarism (e.g. if you're going to use a six-legged spider-walker-esq design for your AT-TE knockoff in your Star Wars reject film, maybe don't copy/paste the Fallen Walker from Bungie's Destiny series). Worldbuilding and art direction felt like a mashup of other sci-fi universes, with little to no originality, one could almost be convinced they were thought up by an AI image generator. Finally, it's all brought together by a story so boring, predictable and lazy that the striking vistas, decent acting, and well done cinematogrophy couldn't stop the yawns.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 26, 2023",Simply a bad movie with pieces of scenes and ideas from different movies. Mix dune with star wars and a lot of slow motion in every fight and the B series movie is served.,NEGATIVE

There's not a shred of originality or something of interest in this entire film.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 26, 2023","After watching the trailer, I had high expectations, but honestly, the movie is a 1.5/5. It's the typical film where just 30 minutes into watching, you know who will betray them, who will save everyone, and what the outcome of the whole story will be throughout the film. They make the female protagonist extremely powerful; the secondary characters are almost useless and are not generally ""introduced"" to you. They touch a bit on the backstory of the main character but nothing beyond that. Throughout the entire movie, the protagonist doesn't even get a scratch; no bullet hits her, and she dodges every blow. It's like she's a god fighting because I can't explain how she manages a 1 vs. 5 alone without getting hurt. Overall, a pretty mediocre movie, another one of those that tried to copy Star Wars but backfired. I don't recommend watching it, but if you want to waste 2 hours of your life, go ahead.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 26, 2023",At its best moment this movie is a cliche sci-fi flick that relies on copying many far better movies. And its best is pretty lacking. Most of the movie is poorly written and poorly acted. Utter rubbish. One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time.,NEGATIVE

"Dec 26, 2023","In a nutshell: What if Seven Samurai was playing Star Wars in Firefly's house while wearing a Warhammer 40K outfit, but with no character development?   

The good: 
Visually, its amazing, costuming, props, fight choreography,  lighting, and cinematography are all top notch.

The bad: 
The plot is a paint by numbers ""gather the team"" which would be fine, if they gave us a reason to care about ANY member of said team.  There's zero character development, unless you'd consider a few, exposition heavy, flashbacks for the main character, development. I'd have listed the cast among the good, since from other work I know them to be talented, but the script here gives them so little to work with, you wouldn't know it. The dialog feels stilted at the best of times and like they're just dumping info on the audience at the worst. Rebel Moon rushes the viewer from big action set piece to big action set piece never stopping to let us get to know a character beyond ""look, they can do this cool fighty thing"". Worst of all, the big ""twist"" betrayal is so forced that it's practically telegraphed before the character who does it even joins the group. 

There's supposed to be a ""director's cut"" to come later, so maaaaaaaybe the character development was left on the cutting room floor, but unless they're adding another full two hours, I highly doubt it.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 26, 2023","Great movie, awesome characters. Loved everything about it.",POSITIVE
"Dec 26, 2023","Rebel Moon is choppy, doesn't provide any back story for important characters, and the story is cliche. It looks good on screen, but if you don't like a lot of explosions, it's probably not for you.

I don't know what the budget for this was, but if you're going to spend money making a movie, why not write it well? This was just one uncompelling scene after another, with plot holes and contrived nonsense, some farce of an ‚Äòassembling the crew'‚Ä¶ I mean, it's so generic and formulaic that I'm writing this through the climax of the movie and missing nothing. This movie is a tragedy and it really didn't have to be.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 26, 2023","I'm a big sci-fi/fantasy fan, but boy was this movie absolutely garbage. 

It's like they tried to use a Firefly type vibe to try to cross Lord of the Rings and Star Wars. Sprinkle in some Dune and Warhammer 40k, and there you go... the hot mess that is Rebel Moon: Part 1. They can go ahead and not bother with Part 2. 

The gratuitous use of slow motion in action scenes and long voice overs to explain the storyline only sour an already sub-optimal offering. I give a lot of sci-fi movies the benefit of the doubt, typically saying ""great concept, poor execution""; but even the concept here was so convoluted and derivative that even a good execution probably wouldn't have made up for it.",NEGATIVE

The main character being a victim of genocide then taken by the enemy and raised as their own is always an interesting concept.

I watched the entire thing, though I did stop it 3/4 of the way through, when movies, especially of the action variety, are at their most exciting. I opted to go do some random work instead. I then returned to the movie but only to see  how the train wreck ended. Saying it borrows a lot from other sci fi is an understatement. It also borrows from fantasy as well, which just makes the world building muddled at best. The pacing is horrible and too much info is left out leaving you to almost have to do some absurd mad libs in your head. None of the characters seem to mesh together organically either. If I fully had to describe this movie to someone I would tell them that someone filmed a little kid pretending to play Star Wars with his toys. Except for none of the toys are from matching series. Plus all the toys aren't legitimate licensed toys buy stuff you'd get off Wish.  I will probably watch the r rated version when it drops to see if any coherency is added but I doubt it.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 26, 2023","It must be said that the cinematography is really marvelous, some shots are really worth it and the soundtrack sometimes really hits, but none of this really matters when the story is boring, full of cliches and worthless. Although it has good and enjoyable moments.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 26, 2023","The movie has too much explaining going on that could be presented in a better way. The main protagonist doesn't seem to look as strong as being portrayed. Movie has great action, visuals and storytelling in a griddy setting. Hope they make a lot more of these.",POSITIVE
"Dec 26, 2023",Good movie and I would love to see more like this made.  Is it an Academy award winner?  Probably not.  Is it entertaining and have a few surprises you don't see coming?  Yes.  It is a good movie and worth watching.,POSITIVE

"Dec 26, 2023","Taking inspiration from other genre movies is not a problem. The boring and not engaging story and action are the problem.

The visuals are good, the action scenes are not, and while some of the characters are promising the majority are lack luster and seem to be improperly cast. I give it a meh.",NEUTRAL

"Dec 25, 2023",A lot of things simply didn't make sense,NEGATIVE
"Dec 25, 2023","I'm going to have to agree with most neh sayers here. Over hyped junk, waste of my time. The slow mo in 300 was at least well positioned and followed the right places at the right times but in this movie it felt like someone threw darts at the story board in order to decide where and when the slow motion action was to happen. So many stolen seens from star wars, Blade Runner, Harry Potter, the Matrix to name a few so no originality here either. The only reason I gave it 1.5 stars is because I have a large 100 inch screen which made parts of it watchable. The dialogue was very weak and getting the ""team"" together was laim, if you know the famous western The Magnificent Seven, it is the same but weaker, less charisma from each character. Also wtf? We never got to see the General fight ???",NEGATIVE
"Dec 25, 2023","Zack Snyders directing is that of a child playing with action figures.

Generic plot, barebone characters, just uninteresting filler to get to the action sequences.
The action sequences themselves are filled with childish ""cool"" explosions and almost entirely slow-mo.

Entire movie gathers up these ""legendary"" characters that literally do nothing, say nothing, have zero personality, no crew dynamics or interactions, all for the buildup to this final battle.... that doesn't even happen.

Even the main antagonists and their ship are built up to be this unstoppable force of destruction on paper but I swear even a gentle fart in the wind could have taken everything down.

Waste of 2 hours unless you REALLY love lensflares, in which case you should go watch star trek instead.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 25, 2023","Visually stunning and not disappointing, even if they went over the top with the slow motion scenes. However the story line was anticlimactic and disappointing, and frankly the similarities to Star Wars, even just the scenes of ships, should be illegal. Really disappointing as the fight scenes for the main character are epic, but it's not enough to cary the whole film.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 25, 2023",Bland copy and paste of several major franchises. Very bad script like the writing is poor. Extreme use of slow mo that renders it pointless and extends the runtime needlessley.  Just a bad movie.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 25, 2023","Despite it's many, many flaws, overall it is still entertaining and not worse than some recent Star Wars movies. Action is decent enough and visuals are too artificial, but it still is nice to look at. Sure, it's one of the most generic movies ever, like it's story and overall design was done by AI. But the main problem is that it's neither fun, nor thrilling, nor likable. You just don't care about any of these characters.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 25, 2023",Visually stunning with the depth of a toddler's picture book. Laughably bad.,NEGATIVE

"Dec 25, 2023",Absolute trash. A masterpiece in copying all possible sci-fi movies there are. But ending up as a total joke. After 45 mins it literally hurts to keep watching.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 25, 2023","There's no problem borrowing ideas from previous movies if you use them with some respect and originality, but isn't there a law against stealing every idea from Star Wars? And why does a drunk depressed general suddenly turns into a motivated fighter just because a girl watches him in the eye? Sorry, but this movie is bad.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 25, 2023",Visually striking with an ambitious scope but without a clear direction. Its inspiration is clear but makes it its own. The set design & cinematography are beautiful yet parts come off as random.,NEUTRAL
"Dec 25, 2023","Definitely has its issues, biggest being that this is basically a long trailer for the ""Snyder Cut"" of this film. With that said I found the world building to be great and extremely excited to see how Part 2 wraps up.",POSITIVE
"Dec 25, 2023",It's well made and the history is developing just right. I like that has a conclusion and still there's more to see. Effects and photography are quite good. Now days it's hard to please people. We need to seat and enjoy movies instead of criticizing so much every single aspect of an original creation.,POSITIVE

Mediocre special effects, waste of time and money",NEGATIVE
"Dec 25, 2023",Getting a lot of unnecessary hate. Fantasy and Sci Fi interestingly mixed. A bit of a disjointed feeling but kind of LotR-esque in that way. A LITTLE bit too much slow mo. But overall some solid stuff and I'm intrigued for more.,POSITIVE

"Dec 25, 2023",A mix n match of superior movies that barely make any sense. The futuristic universe they paint is 2D and boring. I feel like this movie was made by movie studio suits who sit around spitting buzz words at each other,NEGATIVE
"Dec 25, 2023",This film is getting way too much hate for very little reason. The only reason the film is not getting 5 stars is because it felt like alot of the film was missing and I will wager alot of plot and character development will be found in the directors cut that is r rated and longer.,NEUTRAL

"Dec 25, 2023","This theatrical cut is eye-candy and a basic story with holes that I imagine will be filled in with the Director's Cut. There is a lot going on and a sense that there is way more story to tell than we're seeing with the theatrical cut. Still, this film is entertaining and eye candy and reminds me loosely of the premise behind the 7 Samurai.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 25, 2023","In a world characterized by its slow pace, where time meanders like a lazy river, a touch of nonsense adds whimsy to the mundane. Amidst the deliberate crawl of moments, there exists a peculiar charm, a dance with the absurd that keeps life unpredictable. Within this concoction of leisurely strides and whimsical detours, a hidden reservoir of potential quietly waits to be tapped. It's a delicate balance, a nuanced symphony where the unhurried tempo reveals unexpected opportunities, turning the seemingly nonsensical into a canvas of untapped possibilities.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 25, 2023","Bloomin' Fantastic!
A true return to the kind of epic space fantasy that we all crave!
The only slight let down was in costumes being a little too ""current earth"", other than that the movie is extremely well paced, the characters are well understood by simple introduction. People like to criticise the use of 'tropes', but good storytelling relies upon character archetypes -- you know who these people are and why they're doing what they're doing and that's a good thing.",POSITIVE

"Dec 25, 2023","A very cliche story that you probably already saw in movies from the Star Wars universe and other sci-fi franchises, same characters and similar weaponry/tech. If you merge Dune with Star Wars sequels you'll likely get Rebel Moon. Good scenarios and visual effects, but they don't overcome the overall lazy writing and not so creative universe.

"Dec 25, 2023",This movie was awesome,POSITIVE
"Dec 25, 2023",The movie was great. I am looking forward to the directors cut so we get a deeper and darker delve into the characters. I wish the oversight for releasing a movie didn't have to cut it down. Give these directors final choice and release the movie with their edit. I am tired of seeing paid critics bash the way they do because some people won't succumb to the disnification of all content. Looking forward to the second part but more importantly that directors cut as well.,POSITIVE
"Dec 25, 2023","A must see indeed! LOVED THIS! A phenomenal one!

This is why I don't trust Critics or what they say about movies anymore. Plus, either these low rating haters didn't see this film, or they just chose to let Critics speak for them. 

I mean, both Critics and low rating haters got this one wrong. Good thing they don't speak for me at all, and I have my own brain and my own eyes. My own conscience. 

This was an inspirational, impactful, dark, and adventurous story told! And I guess expectations were too high when comes to them. The slow-mo in some moments makes this film even cooler! It makes a film mean something!

Honestly though, these lowlives have a problem with the slow motion in this film, but they had no problem with slow motion being in The Matrix films, did they? 

Again, this is a phenomenal film. I was entertained and inspired by it for countless reasons, and I'd see this again as I wait for Part 2.  LET'S GO! ‚úä",POSITIVE

Fui assistir ao filme j√° sabendo das avalia√ß√µes negativas, mas descobri que Rebel Moon √© surpreendentemente legal at√© os primeiros 40-50 minutos. Depois disso, vira uma bagun√ßa COMPLETA.

Muitos personagens, muitos enredos e pouco tempo para apresent√°-los corretamente. Um universo inteiro, tantos planetas, mitologia e hist√≥ria. Voc√™ simplesmente n√£o consegue apresentar tudo isso adequadamente em 2 horas. Foi tudo muito corrido e cheio de explica√ß√µes.

Kora, Gunnar, Kai, Tarak, Nemesis, Titus, o almirante Noble, os irm√£os Bloodaxe, o droide... Tantos personagens com potencial.

"Dec 25, 2023","Great visuals, interesting world. Sets up the characters well for a next episode.",POSITIVE
"Dec 25, 2023","Rebel Moon: Part One is cinematographically stunning but narratively bereft. You are introduced to an (arguably bloated) ensemble of characters for whom you feel next to nothing, because none of their stories are explored properly. And to make matters worse, nearly every scrap of backstory that is successfully purveyed to the viewer is delivered through a series of dreary monologues. The nail in the coffin for Rebel Moon is the story itself, which is not so much a story as it is a series of hastily glued-together sci-fi tropes from other (far more competent) films in the genre. All in all, it is a beautiful and bland appetizer for the remaining installments, and I am not confident many will be interested in the next course.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 25, 2023","Don't listen to the so called ""professional critics"".   I loved this movie and can't wait to see how it all ends.  Wished I could have seen this on the big screen.   You want a big epic sci-fi movie; Zack gave you one!",POSITIVE
"Dec 25, 2023","The Good:
  1)  The story moved along at a good pace.   I never found myself reaching for my phone.
 2)  The visuals and editing were top-notch.
 3)  Action Sequences were well-done
 4)  Sofia Boutella (Kora) is nice to look at and  turns in a fine performance.

The Bad:
  1)  Very derivative.   Not an original idea in the whole movie.  From the overall plot to each scene
  2)  The dialogue is bad.  Really, really bad at times.  
  3)  Outside of Kora, most of the characters are 1-dimensional
       Admiral Atticus Noble is an embarrassing cliched villian. 

Overall, a bubble-gum movie that doesn't require any thinking and goes well with alcohol.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 25, 2023","So after watching Rebel Moon , I have to say

Special effects - meh
Story - Cut and Paste from other better films (Star Wars, Dune, John Carter etc)
Acting - meh

At over 2 hours long its about 30mins too long

Sure,  it's worth watching....just don't expect anything original",NEUTRAL
"Dec 25, 2023",Enjoyed it for what it was. A space sci fi.,POSITIVE
"Dec 25, 2023","I was really looking forward watching Rebel Moon; yet it was a waste of time. Despite the good visual effects/ CGI and the 40k vibes, this movie story sucks @#$. Character development could be done better by  a 5th grader.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 25, 2023","I want this film to succeed but sadly the writing chops are just not there. I'm hoping that, like with many ZS films, the extra hour for the extended cut will add some much needed depth to character and plot because it's hard to care about anything in this version. Ray Fisher deserves a callout for his stellar moments, I'd watch a whole film about that guy.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 25, 2023",Basically a super cut of every popular sci-fi move mashed together with no character design and too much slo-mo. Tacky and chiche. Once again Zach needs to stop making movies. He's past it.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 25, 2023","That was a big ol' oof! A feature length prologue designed for audiences to engage with it's characters, their situation, the world etc but it all felt just so... meh... A bunch of contrived storyboard panels mashed together with what feels like no coherent plan or substance. An Ocean 11 style ""getting-the-team-together"" spread across 2 hours and each of the players involved don't offer anything unique and to be honest if their names were not being mentioned over and over again I wouldn't remember who any of them were, even Kora. All in all it's a shame because I was looking forward to a new IP, even it was from Synder, someone who hasn't created anything really outstanding since Dawn of the Dead imo... sorry SnyderCult.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 25, 2023",I honestly do not get how movies this bad keep getting made. The special effects are great everything else is terrible,NEGATIVE
"Dec 25, 2023","I really, really liked this. Intentionally watched it before reading reviews. Obviously there are recognisable themes in the story (a journey, an overarching peril, a moppet, a traitor, a disgraced but genius general, a brooding female heroine etc. etc) - and yet it is a swashbuckling, exciting epic. The cast is broad, diverse and visually stunning - there is chemistry between the leads - the heroes and the villains are credible - and the core peril (an empire devouring itself) is a worthy platform. I would give it 5/5, but we still need part 2!!!",POSITIVE
"Dec 25, 2023","I liked this movie. Some of the pacing was off, but overall a very well done movie. It was enjoyable, with some great characters, and I can't wait for part two.",POSITIVE
"Dec 25, 2023","The film looks pretty, but it lacks depth to the characters. The pacing was way to fast for you to really be invested in anything or anyone in the plot other than the main character. I honestly felt like I was watching a dozen other movies, that I've already watched, while sitting through this. Star Wars? Check. Seven Samurai?  Check. Throw in an M. Night Shyamalon twist, that everyone could see coming from a mile away, and you end up with a really mediocre movie.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 25, 2023","Poniendo todo en su contexto real, es decir que es la mitad de la primera pelicula de una nueva IP pensada para ser seis peliculas, novelas graficas, corto de animaci√≥n etc, la mayoria de las criticas negativas que est√° recibiendo que absolutamente vacias de contenido y carentes de sentido.
pare que alguien tiene mucho miedo de que esta nueva IP pueda hacer sombra a las suyas.
La pel√≠cula es de factura impecable y te deja con ganas de m√°s, mucho m√°s.

Putting everything in its real context, that is, it is half of the first film of a new IP intended to be six films, graphic novels, animated shorts, etc., most of the negative reviews it is receiving are absolutely empty of content and meaningless.
It seems that someone is very afraid that this new IP could overshadow theirs.

"Dec 25, 2023",Amazing VFX and characters. An excellent part 1,POSITIVE
"Dec 25, 2023",Please don't waste your time with this movie. It's 2 hours you won't ever get back. Bad acting is BAD. Narrative has so many holes and you are just left confused and frustrated by the end.,NEGATIVE

Great movie to kill 2+hrs",POSITIVE
"Dec 25, 2023","While an R rated longer cut will be much appreciated, Rebel Moon is still lots of fun, visually stunning and epic! It is everything we need in today's blockbuster market oversaturated with 300 million dollar superhero movies.",POSITIVE
"Dec 25, 2023",A desperate attempt to recreate Akira Kurosawa's 7 Samurai set in space but with heavily over dramatic attempts in creating tension. Decent CGI can't make up for the atrocious script and the huge plot hole of a system fairing army not completely decimating a pacifist village and a few mercenaries.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 25, 2023","Had to stop after few minutes, story was dull and cringy. Characters flat and quite pointless.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 25, 2023",It was meh. Very cliched and seemed to take inspiration from every scifi movie ever made. I have no idea who the characters are and by the end I didnt really care. Felt like I was watching a tv series cobbled together into a movie. If you dont watch it you wont miss anything.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 25, 2023",Enjoying this slice of mindless fun but forget Star Wars - this is a sci-fi remake of The Magnificent Seven with many parallel scenes and references.,NEUTRAL
"Dec 25, 2023","I cannot say enough good things about this movie. Kora was amazing. She is a natural hero and fighting to get back all of her humanity back. The romance was not forced. It's subtle and has the potential to blossom. I want to know more about Prince Tarak. I wonder what happened to Aris. They should have spinoff series exploring all the other characters. I'm gonna watch it again tomorrow. I wanna see the Director's Cut and Scargiver Part 2 really bad. Glad I don't  have to wait long. I had to see this movie before Aquaman. Definitely, Rebel Moon is better than Aquaman The Lost Kingdom. I like both but Rebel Moon stands out.",POSITIVE
"Dec 25, 2023",i just could'nt pay attention the dialogue was cringe and cgi looked weird at some point. but the idea of the movie is good and hope the part 2 is better,NEGATIVE
"Dec 25, 2023","I've seen a lot of expensive bad movies but this one takes the cake. Every aspect of the movie is just bad. If you are too curious just watch for a few minutes and if you start to see how bad it is, stop watching cause it's not gonna get better.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 25, 2023","As always, Zack's ability to create visually immersive scenery is top notch. However, I firmly believe he should completely stop writing and directing as his vision is always disjointed and discombobulated. Enough please.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 25, 2023","Personally I believe this movie to be a great sci-fi action movie. Although many see a substantial amount of problem with the movie. Let's discuss. First off the intro to this movie is slow and the grabbing of sand to smell is off putting to put the least. Not a great start. Although many of the fight scenes are amazingly choreographed and the visual effects make a spectacle of a movie, this is not enough to carry a movie alone. The story telling is a tough subject, many thematic choices and the fact this is a two part story limit the first film to as set up for the second. Meeting characters, history's , so on. Which I didn't see as much a problem. Biggest concern being the lack of use of many of these characters in the ""unexpected"" final fight scene. I wanted to see the farmer fight in the fields, and the robot was barely in the film. Although I chalk most of this up as movie prep for the second film. Overall I genuinely enjoyed this film and would recommend (when the second releases). It's half a story, and I'm treating it as such. It's like stopping a movie half way through, it's unsatisfying ultimately. I'm excited for the rest.",POSITIVE
"Dec 25, 2023","This movie was a jumble of several trailers for other movies I'd definitely see, but all completely disconnected from each other.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 25, 2023","There could be a good movie in here, If Zack had handed over character development to a decent director rather than just info dumps every five minutes, there is no character development and barely any character Interaction, which makes them hollow, merely vessels to get from one pointless set piece to another, I mean what was the point of the bird scene, or the spider entity scene, its just action for the sake action.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 25, 2023","So glad the critics are getting slammed. No.1 in over 60 countries. Loved it, can't wait for part 2.",POSITIVE
"Dec 25, 2023","The movie does tell rather than show a bit too much, but for what was going to be Star Wars movie, it was way better than the last three main Star Wars saga movies (I think they had great actors, but horrible and pretentious writing), this was at least entertaining, without plot flaws. It grew on me more with the second viewing. Looking forward to Part 2.",POSITIVE
"Dec 25, 2023","1000 kings? Not sure you know what that means! seeing how only one blood line died, to end the line? what happened to the other 999? I wanted to like this but did no one do a read thought?",NEGATIVE
"Dec 25, 2023","I loved the universe, with strong themes and visual styles.Looking forward to the Directors cut and part 2.",POSITIVE
"Dec 25, 2023",I love this movie. Kora and the rest of the characters are chosen very well. The whole cast looks great. Kora is hot. Tarak is smoking hot. Those abs are to die for. Aris is very handsome. The movie was very stylish and intensely vibrant.,POSITIVE
"Dec 25, 2023","Sooooo disappointing. Pretty generic, predictable stuff.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 25, 2023","It's kind of like Riddick without Riddick. Or the Witcher without Geralt. Or Die Hard without John Mcclane. It's got an imaginative world that takes itself seriously, too seriously, but no one to comment on it and let the audience in on the joke.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 25, 2023","Yes, this is indeed a mash up of different genres and prior story lines from other movies and plots. However telling them and matching in one new story would be a daunting task but I think achieved in this movie. 

If the story is not your cup off tea, the effects and cinematic experience alone would make any true scifi fan happy. After all, this is only part 1.",POSITIVE
"Dec 25, 2023",Kora was a hero who didn't want to be a hero but necessity brought out the bravery in her. I like that she was not over confident. Sofia Boutella's acting was superb for action sci-fi. This film has a lot of heart. It reminds me of when I first watched Fellowship of the Ring LOTR Part 1.,POSITIVE

"Dec 25, 2023","This was a pretty but boring and derivative film.  The good; Costumes, most of the fight choreography, cinematography, etc...  The bad; poor character development, bad storytelling, derivate plot, and loads of cliches.  It is almost a B movie; with cartoonishly evil villains, a character that stays shirtless and oiled the entire movie, and griffins.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 25, 2023","The hero's journey is a age old tale. This movie is a good hero's journey tale in the spirit of many others. It isn't deep, but I'm really interested in the characters backstories. It's a good yarn that looks beautiful.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 25, 2023","The story is plagiarism of other, better works. The main character defeats all combatants that attempt to win. The only reason we kept watching was to guess the next movie or franchise that would be plagiarized.  We made it a game. I will NOT continue to watch the following episodes/sequels.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 25, 2023","Well, enjoyable, fun and characters I wanted to learn more about. Great music, CGI was a little too obvious in places but Jimmy wow.

"Dec 25, 2023","I'm blessed with ""suspension of disbelief"" being one of my abilities. Take all the critics' whining about previously used sci-fi  tropes from other productions and reduce their significance. If you are are watching this movie, you know what you're gonna get. Maybe the critics need to find a new profession... like reviewing the newest ancient Greek tragedy found among the ashes of some wartorn city in the mideast. This is sci-fi for entertaining those of us blessed with a level of suspension of disbelief that is not weak kneed at the sight of a sounds and sights that have been seen before. 

Kora is good. Moody. Terrifying to those who are her enemy. 

The robot. OMG! Anthony Hopkins is the voice? And with more humanity than humanity itself. Brilliant! 

Farmers who just want to dig in the earth and grow food. What more humble and honorable people need defended against the merciless ""motherland"" in other movies? 

You want entertained? Enjoy the movie. You want to feel like you are reliving your first ever glimpse of some childhood hero and villain, grow up.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 25, 2023","This movie is a visual wonder but really falls flat everywhere else. Not nearly enough character development is attempted to make me interested or invested in this world and almost the entire plot can be traced to better sci-fi fantasy works. I was so hopeful about seeing elements from other works I enjoyed (Warhammer, Star Wars, Dune, etc.) but I left seeing nothing but an unorganized uninspired mess of the elements with no clear passion. I'm hopeful the second part will prove me wrong but so far, I'm not impressed.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 25, 2023",I'm watching it for the second time now. It makes more sense. Zack is a genius storyteller. Everything about this film looks great. The colors are magnificent. The only thing I would add to it is more soundtrack music during the fighting.,POSITIVE
"Dec 25, 2023","Terrible. Basically a retelling of seven samurai but incredibly bad. 
The first few seconds of the movie, she pauses the plow to move a rock then smells the dirt. Such a stupid moment. I get the director is trying to set a character but it did not play well. It only went downhill from there. 
How many characters do you need that are ""out for revenge against the empire because their entire planet was wiped out and they are the sole survivor""? I counted at least 4. Couldn't someone have written a unique backstory? 
No dialog between the gathered warriors, they all just accept the story at hand and to go along for the ride. 
If each of the warriors are found so easily, why couldn't the empire have picked them off before?",NEGATIVE
"Dec 25, 2023",A really expensive piece of trash. Character development was utterly trash. Action was deplorable. Dialogue was incredibly shallow.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 25, 2023","Such a breath of fresh air compared to the garbage from Star Wars, Marvel, and DC recently.

"Dec 25, 2023","This movie was so bad I made an account to say it was bad. I saw that the audience reviews were much higher, there's lot of good movies with 60-70% ratings but this one just sucks, so I made an account to lower the average. Do not waste your time. This movie was so inconsistent and stupid. The costumes were so bad, the villains had a mix of space Nazi outfits, us army lookalike outfits, and these weird clergymen things. It felt like they were using whatever leftover props they didn't use on other projects. They stole elements from like every space sci Fi they could. The story was basic and lacked depth. They went on journeys for numerous characters which ended up serving no purpose. This movie was laughable.The special effects were cool though.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 25, 2023","It was aaaawful. For bad movies, this one went ""plaid"". A pair of out of work writers from the Pornography Screenwriter's Guild could of drummed up a better script overnight. The cinematography was really cool and well done. Outside of that, puke.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 25, 2023","Loud, boring, pointless, and awkward, Rebel Moon wears many grand inspirations on its sleeve (from Star Wars, to Seven Samurai, to Warhammer 40K, to Princess of Mars, and beyond), and yet somehow pulls all the wrong lessons from those sources. The end result is a painful dull, self-indulgent slog that occasionally flirts with some genuinely good ideas only to squander them. Unfortunately, this movie is simply not worth anyone's time.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 25, 2023","Have you ever read Steven Eriksson's Malazan Book of the Fallen book-series? It's an epic high-fantasy series well worth the read, but it's always been kinda love/hate due to its complexity and unwillingness to hold the reader by his/her hand. The story told in the series takes place in a world with hundreds of thousands of years of history and context and, for lack of a better metaphor, basically throws the reader into the deep end of the pool to sink or swim. Those of us that learned to swim learned to love the books. The ones who drowned not so much.

The books work, in part, because they build and present strong and memorable characters that can drive the story and keep it coherent when the context is missing. This takes time, effort and a clever pen but Eriksson lives up to the challenge and the series is well hailed as one of the great ones.

This movie made me think of Eriksson. This, I think, is how a movie would look if someone decided to make an Eriksson-inspired film with deep lore and lots of complexity and context but forgot about the part where they also needed strong and believable characters to drive the story forwards. Because they most assuredly did. Forget about the need for believable characters, that is.

Don't get me wrong, the characters are strong. Any and all of ‚Äòem seems capable of taking out an entire platoon of soldiers at any given time, at least until the plot-armour weakens. That, sadly, does not mean that the characters are believable or able to carry the films lacking scrip or pacing. Because the movie is sadly underwritten in this regard. The scrips consist of people talking ‚Äì at ‚Äì each other, often in an unintended parodically manner, not people talking ‚Äì to- each other in any meaningful way. And the pacing is not just lacking, its plain gone. Often we are forced to witness a more-or-less random scene where people - who have just met and doesn't know each other ‚Äì tell of the most intimate things in order to either establish some sort of tragic background or to make us believe that this is a sort of bonding moment between the characters. To say that it's unbelievable is an understatement.

In sum we are left with a bunch of stereotypical archetypes ‚Äì an assassin, a rebel, a misunderstood and (most likely) unfairly judged traitor, the mandatory actual traitor, the tragic general, a prince and a few others I can remember just now. They are all honourable, have a stereotypical trait or two and are willing to take up the fight with the evil overlords who conveniently dress, talks and acts like nazis, random violence and torture included, so that the storyline can soldier on. This is not the way to build or present your characters, this is not the way to tell a complex story (or at least a simple story in a complex context). This is ‚Äì simply ‚Äì not good enough. 

The visuals are, for the most part, pretty good. There are some good action scenes here and there. The movie, overall, is mediocre but OK enough for the first hour and a half. But the last hour takes it into the land of the unintended and unwillingly funny and not in a good way.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 25, 2023","The critics are far too biased, this was cinematic joy. I take one star away for a five minute section with average visuals and dialogue. Beyond that this was 2 hours of fantastic entertainment, why we watch movies üçø",POSITIVE

"Dec 25, 2023",A breath of fresh air in modern Sci-Fi films nowadays! Great background story for Kora and I hope we could see more of the background stories for the rest of the rebel squads in the directors cut or in part II. Slow-mo scenes are well delivered to emphasized the impact of the scene. The only downside of the movie is the lens blur for some of the scenes hampering the CGI.,POSITIVE
"Dec 25, 2023","Mute the movie and make up your own storyline.  The dialogue is garbage, the plot is cobbled tropes from at least 5 other franchises.  Chronicles of Riddick meets Star Wars meets Seven Samurai meets a stream of consciousness from three nights of disconnected dreams.  I do feel sorry for the actors who were given this script with what I'm sure were promises of the ‚ÄòSnyder Magic'.  The only thing I thought was cool were the robots which disabled and grasped the ‚Äòrebels'.  The bounty hunter switcharoo might has well been the subtitle.  Not impressed.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 25, 2023","There were moments, only brief moments of a good movie. They were quickly interrupted by unnecessary slow motion sequences. I think they could have easily shaved 35 minutes off the movie if they would of left out half of the slow motion scenes.

Overall it was a quality cast and a really good story that was cut short by horrible direction and more slow motion than should be allowed by law.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 25, 2023","I personally enjoyed the movie but think it would have been better off as multi episode series to go more in depth and show off it's array of interesting characters. Introducing each felt rushed and didn't really flow with the whole story. Graphics and action scenes were decent but the overall directing style was weird for me personally. Still, it was a good watch and I look forward to part 2.",POSITIVE
"Dec 25, 2023",Rebel Moon looks like the best video game played by a bad gamer that I have ever seen. The story seems to have been written by ChatGTP or someone edited the movie while blindfolded.

"Dec 25, 2023","Visually stunning with a deep universe with diverse aliens and cultures. The technology is advanced but seems rooted in science.

The supporting characters all have believable motives for their actions. I can't wait to see the next movie.",POSITIVE
"Dec 25, 2023","While not the best sci-fi plot wise, it scratched that itch for me. Part-1 seemed more focused on world building rather than character, but I'm excited to see what comes in part 2.

Desperate to be different from anything, yet so far from anything at all... It's like a weird Warhammer/Star Wars/Dune and mishmash of other Action Films all jumbled together with a predictable outcome and yet feels like 2 hours of just having your brain smashed against a wall. Really sorry for all the work people put into this, but it's just not good. It sadly isn't.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 25, 2023","This movie has amazing potential. It starts out quite good and then goes downhill. Writing gets worse and worse, the pacing is weird, slow yet rushed. And the motivations of people are either unclear or half-baked.

Every actor has a movie they regret making and this will be Jenna Malone's. And why do all bad guys have to look like Nazi's.  I'm a huge sci- fi fan and was really looking forward to this one.  But the trailer was the only redeeming quality of this movie.  I'd like to see statistics on what percentage of people started watching this but didn't finish.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 25, 2023","So where can I start, I did not finish it, looks like a waste of time: 

The story is as old as it gets, nothing new under the sun other than the interstellar context but that could have worked if the rest would have been at least ok. 

Some green screen shots are just plain bad.  

- bad acting with just a few exceptions
- difficult to buy in to the decisions of some characters the story goes so fast that just it does not like the missing pieces. It was so easy to understand where it will go, such poor decision making for the main characters while on a big journey. 
- fight choreography makes you think there is no choreography, everything is random. Some slow motion scenes are ridiculous. The actors definitely had no reference for the CGI. 

Artistically is beautiful, but unfortunately that fades as everything else unveils.

"Dec 24, 2023",Dull. Very thin plot.  No character development. The only fun bit was trying to name which sci films has been graverobbed and stitched together in this Frankenstein of a film. Absolute embarrassing trash. The characters were so poor I wouldn't have cared if they'd all been killed at the end.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","If you rate a movie on ""it steals from other movies"", you are not rating the movie, are you? All the Star Wars movies stole their content from Foundation Trilogy, Star Trek, etc. 

This movie is entertaining. That should be the only thing that matters. It's visually high class, has solid characters, engaging back stories... Perfect? No. Fun to watch? Yes... Unless you are so jaded that you cannot suspend your disbelief for a couple of hours. Why bother watching SciFi movies at all, then?

Can't wait for Part 2.",POSITIVE

"Dec 24, 2023","Stereotypical cliche characters are just being thrown in one by one with weak character development or explanation. Actors overacting makes you roll your eyes almost every minute. There is also a massive overuse of slo-mo which becomes frustrating after 30 minutes of the movie and spoils every action scene.

"Dec 24, 2023",Visually this movie is on par with the best of it's peers. Storyline is a bit weak and it feels like they cut up several other stories and then jumbled the bits up to make this story. There are parts that are simply left without explanation and it just didn't feel very cohesive. Towards the end everything moved so quickly that it felt forced and it felt like they were running out of screen time. So much of this just isnt explained. It is moderately entertaining but there is a major lack of introduction to things and several major plot holes and frankly stale plot elements.,NEGATIVE

"Dec 24, 2023","Firstly, I do think this was a promising story, I thought Boutella was great as Kora and most of the special effects were clean and looked great!

However, I think this film fell into the trap of following the Sci Fi epic cliches (evil faction trying to take over the universe but being stopped by a unlikely band of rebels against the odds‚Ä¶ sound familiar?) and films that do that are never going to live up to Star Wars which is why they need to be a Sci Fi epic in their own right rather than leaning too heavily on these influences. Even down to naming one of the main warships of the Motherworld the ‚ÄòImperium Dreadnought', let's just say the movie wasn't the most original.

I also feel the story was thin and slightly rushed and dialogue a little disjointed at times. Plus I'd like to have seen a bit more character development as well as background, we're thrown into this ‚Äòepic' space story with a 2 minutes briefing of the history of this universe and absolutely no information on these characters when we meet them (who they are, where they come from, what their story is). The only character you could say developed and we found a little about was Kora and the most promising character was one we see the least of (Jimmy). Unless you class Ed Skrein's Atticus giving a 10 second description of why each character hates the Motherworld as background. Things did feel a little frantic. On top of that occasionally some of the visuals were uneasy on the eye and Hunham's accent‚Ä¶ I truly hope his character is dead so I don't have to hear his accent again in any upcoming Rebel Moon media. 

That being said it wasn't all bad and I am invested in seeing where the saga leads us and look forward to the sequel with anticipation. The action sequences were a positive as they were well choreographed and the majority of acting and special effects were enjoyable as well. I do want to see more of Kora and see where her story arc goes plus how the Motherworld reacts to the ending of Part 1. Despite the shortcomings there is something about the film pulling me back in for more. 

I perhaps was expecting a bit more of the wow factor and originality from the team behind the film and the budget behind them, they're not exactly amateurs! Room for improvement but if you are a lover of Sci-Fi and have a couple of hours free it's worth a watch.",NEUTRAL

"Dec 24, 2023","Nonononononononono.  Cheap copy pasta from every Sci fi flick, except poorly done.  It even ends with a matrix like scene, and i swear elon musk can sue because they used the term neuralink.  It started with promise, but then turned to boring, cliche, predictable absolute garbage.  It just kept dragging on..  its the plot of The Magnificent Seven except in space and poorly executed, since the characters are boring and feel disposable.  From space vikings, to space nazis, followed by space irish and space mexicans, and the space indian.. then the space Scotsman comes along..  and they find the space jamaican and they go from space Finland to space mexico..   Zero originality.  You'd swear it was max Payne at times, the way they liberally apply bullet time.  They overdo the bullet time scenes.  It makes you wanna vomit.. they slow everything down to try to make miniscule actions seem breathtaking.. and some scenes drag on for like 10 minutes and add nothing to the story.

The movie feels like a D&D session run by a 10 year old kid running for the first time, without a clear story in mind but just grabbing scenes / encounters that he or she thought were cool from the different movies he or she has seen. There was NO character development, no reason to CARE about any of the characters, and nothing interesting happening in the story. The movie should have a warning in the opening credits NOT to create a drinking game every time there is slow motion since that will certainly result in death by alcohol poisoning. The villains in any Scooby Doo episode have far more depth and far more realistic motivations than the Emp... Impe... errr, ""Motherworld"" space baddies. This was bad. The only reason why I would give Rebel Moon an edge over awful Last Jedi is that at least Rebel Moon wasn't urinating on a franchise that I actually cared about. This movie was not good.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","There are ingredients for an interesting story. This isn't it. The pros are mostly good visual effects and a good performance by Ed Skrein as the main villain. Unfortunately the script is more tell than show, and the story is little more than a retelling of Seven Samurai in a blended Star Wars and Warhammer skin, with paper thin characters, most of whom are entirely forgettable. I'm not sure the promised extended version in the future can save this, and it's unfortunate that it's even necessary for it carry that burden.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 24, 2023",I wanted to like this movie but the opening scene CGI was on par with the painted backdrops of 70's era sci-fi series...and it was down hill from there.  Not a single original concept to be found ensures you'll be 5 steps ahead of this story from start to finish.  More painful exposition than a Star Wars prequel.  Textbook example of how important good writing is....and what happens when it isn't. Oh and the title should have been Vikings vs. Nazi's in Space.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 24, 2023",It's so bad. Looks like bad trip. Star Wars +  Suicide Squad and too much slow motion.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 24, 2023",Ridiculous! I've managed only about 30 minutes torturing myself with that... Awful.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","I wasn't sure about the movie, but within the first 30 minutes the movie causes you to be drawn in! I definitely enjoyed the movie! There were parts that felt drawn or not needed, but overall it's a worthy experience for someone who enjoys a Star Wars, Star Trek type feel. The movie is daring and excels making you wonder or take the edge of your seat.",POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","Fun movie and it looks like that part 2 is going to be even better, the only thing I didn't get is that it takes too long in introducing characters but with not enough depth to care for them.",POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","The thing about films is that there's very little that's truly original, especially true of sci fi. So the fact this has elements of Star Wars, Matrix, Dune etc is to be expected. That it does it quite well comes as a pleasant surprise. Fast paced, great heroine and baddie to unite against, excellent visuals all made for a real treat. Looking forward to the next!",POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","Nice polish but that's all. Stiff, wooden dialogue. NO character development, no sense of danger, urgency, direction or plot. Whatever ideas can be found are all stolen from Kurosawa, Pandora, Tattoine or similar places. I don't care if the main chars live or die, I don't believe in the places or sets.

"Dec 24, 2023","Visually stunning, with a mash up of all your favorite sci fi fills in one. Where it struggles is with it's character development, making it hard to draw an emotional attachment to them. The extended edition might fix that.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 24, 2023","This movie was badly written. The script is soo bad. Soo bad. The acting is subpar, yes. But the script is soooo bad. Sooo bad.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 24, 2023",The best movie of the year.,POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","Pretty visuals; however, the entire 2 1/2 hour long plot is just collecting companions on different planets. If I wanted that experience, I'll just play Starfield.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 24, 2023",Not sure there is an original idea in this movie.  Many of the scene ideas came from Star Wars and Guardians of the Galaxy movies.  Visuals were stunning though.,NEUTRAL
"Dec 24, 2023","This movie was so bad I created a rotten tomatoes account to review it.

Just a ripoff of other great sci fi films. 

Some of the worst cgi in a ""blockbuster"" film.

Terrible and cliche villain.

It's boring, filled with slo mo and exposition dump.

Some of the most cringiest and terrible dialogue to the point I would just laugh, especially Ray Fishers characters dialogue.

Speaking of Ray Fishers character, his name is Bloodaxe, which made me laugh because it made think of Guardians of The Galaxy Volume 2, where James Gunn made fun of dumb names like Tazorface.

Just wait for the directors cut because at least that one will be filled sex and titties to keep you entertained.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","If you go into it, expecting Star Wars, you will be disappointed. However, if you go into it, expecting a good sci-fi movie, you will be pleasantly surprised. It is a good space adventure movie.",POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","I imagine this is the movie we would get if we entered the following prompt into Chat GPT:

"Dec 24, 2023","I don't know what movie these ""critics"" watched, but what I saw was a pretty fun movie. Maybe the published reviews lowered my expectations, or maybe some of these ""critics"" have become too jaded to enjoy their jobs anymore. Movie was fun, no more derivative than most movies being released these days, and at least it wasn't some stupid remake, which nobody really wants or needs.
 Ed Skrein was perfectly cold and creepy as the main villain, and the rest of the cast was decent. Looking forward to the next movie, and hope they make more after that.",POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023",Creativity outweighs the similarity.,POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","Awful. There's no story, it's just a series of cut scenes from a.game no-one wanted.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","Buena pel√≠cula, visualmente hermosa, muy buen score y una historia, que si bien no es perfecta, es entretenida y cumple su objetivo que es introducir la historia, sin duda la versi√≥n extendida ser√° mejor y la pt2 promete demasiado.",POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023",Overall the movie was enjoyable.    Reminded me more of Warhammer genre over starwars.   The movie has great potential and looking forward to part 2.,POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023",I liked it - It has clear Starwars vibes (for obvious reasons) but with grit and less cheese. A good part 1 intro story that left me wanting more. I just hope it doesn't stop at part 2. Only criticism was that it didn't pick up the pace a little sooner.,NEUTRAL
"Dec 24, 2023","With fight scenes stylistically reminiscent of Sucker Punch's fight scenes, this is a must see for fans of Zack Snyder's work. He's also the cinematographer on the movie, so it looks amazing. It's possibly a little disjointed and truncated, but I'm expecting that to be addressed in the director's cut, which was made concurrently with this release, and is supposedly like a whole different movie.",POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","Not sure why the low score, this was one of the best movies to end 2023. Grinches should just go back to hibernation.",POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023",This movie was amazing! People forget that any great story has bits and piece's of other great stories. Even Star Wars pulls pieces from The Foundation. This movie was another important step for Science Fiction. Do not let narrow-minded people turn you away from this!,POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","Solid movie visually, entertaining enough. The R rated cut should be better though (looking forward to that when it comes out).",NEGATIVE

"Dec 24, 2023",I think the movie was really good! ,POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","It's an intergalactic re-make  of 7 Samurai/The Magnificent 7, but it works. It's good escapism which is sorely missed  right now in Hollywood. My only complaint is that Zack takes too long introducing the characters and their is too much exposition. Visually, the fight scenes are stunning. Yeah, he does a lot of slow-mo ,but they are fun and great to look at it. Not perfect, but entertaining.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 24, 2023","The plot is exciting and well-connected. Some fight scenes could be less evident they were choreographed. As a Star Wars fan, I see several elements from Star Wars in this movie.",POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","Nice visuals, which is a norm for Synder, but the story is generic and the characters are boring, how he still makes movies is baffling to me.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","It's not as good as I had hoped, but I enjoyed it. Yes, it's derivative, but so is every movie so using that as a reason to give it a bad review is a bit unfair. The visuals and action were great. The dialogue was meh. The story does feel like it's leading somewhere, but the spoken exposition was a bit much. Would have liked to get the backstory in a better way. I'll say this, though. It's better than all of the recent Star Wars movies except Force Awakens and Rogue One!",NEUTRAL
"Dec 24, 2023","Its all just pollox!! üòÖ The film is just a baltent ripoff of much better films, theres nothing new here, you may as well be watching star wars or dune or anything else made in the last 15 years, very poor attempt Zach Synder",NEGATIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","Dude, just watch Star Wars instead.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","If you want to watch a movie that's full of sexual tension, has a character lead that looks constipated at all times, and is chock full to the brim with slow-motion captures (even the falling of grains has slow-mo), then this is the movie for you. Otherwise, you'd be bored to your wits and you'd keep wondering 'what the heck is going on?'",NEGATIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","Esencia de zack, visualmente buena y me quede con ganas de m√°s",POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","I think the movie is awesome.  It was filmed like an art house, or graphic novel movie, somewhat (no expert, but that is what it seems to me), so it looks and feels a little different than what I was expecting.  However, once I understood that, I was completely onboard.  It draws on the Seven Samurai, which might be the only (little) let down.  Not that the story isn't good, but it has been done (a lot).  So, you know where it is going.  Over all, I think its a good watch and I really enjoyed it.  Looking forward to the next one.

And personally, I don't give two cents about the critics opinion, they don't care about the audience, and never did.",POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","Um dos melhores filmes sobre fic√ß√£o cient√≠fica, o enredo do filme deixa um pouco a desejar mas o filme prende muito bem durante essas duas horas de filme.",POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","Loved it. But it feels rushed, the editing makes it feel like we're missing some scenes. And you can tell in the gun fights the laser shots leave some horrible wounds, but we don't see them. This is definitely a pg-13 version.  We need the rated R version now.",POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023",Amazing movie.  I have no idea how it is only 23/100 on rotten tomatoes.  Goes to show that this place is not credible.,POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","I understand this is a part one, but it spends the majority of it's runtime assembling its cast of characters in the most basic way. Then, they barely interact or speak. It gives us nothing for us to care about this group. The little we learn about them is in the form of a one sentence description delivered by the villain near the end. All the while lacking in any kind of originality. 

The lead gets the most backstory told in flashbacks which sounds like a much more interesting story. Truthfully, most of the characters seem to have their more interesting stories already behind them. 

There are some nice visuals here and there, but it also looks ugly at times too. There's a good action sequence early and that's where the film peaked for me. The third act is a pretty standard shootout. It's fine for a film to have a small scale conflict, but there was so little going on throughout the movie that it felt like nothing happened at all. 

Ultimately we got a derivative movie, nothing-characters, thin plot, inconsistent visuals, and an unsatisfying end. Very disappointing.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","There's nothing new to see here. There are space vikings, space samurai, and space nazis and a group of them form a league in a quest for justice. There's plenty of CGI and slow motion shots but the story is seemingly written by an AI that understands all the familiar tropes but isn't interested in any of the details.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","This movie is not an original concept and borrows heavily from multiple stories you've already seen, but that doesn't mean it lacks entertainment.  The story is compelling and the visuals are top notch.  Well worth a watch, and I'm looking forward to more.",POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023",Es excelente pelicula tiene cosas muy buenas las escenas es tan excelente me encanta to do esto,POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","Maybe among the worst of 2023 and one of the most difficult films in recent years, to fully watch till the end.

- Story really bland and slow-paced. Maybe with part 2 some parts make more sense but as a movie alone - no.
- Characters uninteresting, Ed Skrein did a pretty decent job
- Visuals, maybe the worst part of this one. The awful use of DoF and ridiculous amount of slow-mo usage makes some scenes look very bad. The film itself has a grim, unappealing look with some nice scenes.

I can't recommend this movie to anyone - it felt like a waste of time.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","Les recomiendo mucho est√° pel√≠cula, es muy buena e interesante. La tem√°tica es un acogedora y la verdad me gust√≥ mucho y estoy seguro de que a ustedes tambi√©n les va a gustar.",POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","Great first movie that feels like Star Wars mixed with the Magnificent 7. Some ""speeches"" about things are a bit cliche', but overall it was a great action movie with a story good enough to keep it going and make you wonder where it goes in the sequel.",POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","Ambitious, dense sci-fi, with some recycled tropes, lack of character development and  some actors (e.g., farmer) not fully committed to their roles.",POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023",Rebel moon felt like a behind the scenes and vfx tutorial movie but instead of showing how they did it they just copy paste some 'show your emotion' bits in between scene's from Michiel Huisman.,NEGATIVE

"Dec 24, 2023",I liked it a lot. I knew to watch out for a pacing thing and I had no issue with the middle bit being fast. great to have a new scifi world over xmas. ho ho ho,POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","Meh, wasn't bad, wasn't amazing.   If you are looking to be entertained for a couple hours, it's not a bad choice.  But don't expect a new incredible epic either.

The good:
Effects and visual quality were great, top notch
Cast is solid and interesting
Fight/action choreography is decent

The meh:
Starts a bit slow, gets a bit better though
Characters are somewhat interesting but not well developed (yet)
Not much interplay between characters, they are just existing next to each other
Acting is ok
Unlike Star Wars, Avengers or even LOTR, little humor.   That can be good or bad depending on what you are looking for (I'm ok with it).

The bad:
Completely cliche, plot is nothing new or groundbreaking
Suspend your disbelief...plot holes abound

The above two points are my only major criticisms...but they are HUGE.   The plot is predictable, totally unrealistic (even for a space scifi fantasy movie).   How are these individuals supposed to fight a huge empire and space ships...with their swords and a pistol?

If the writing/plot were greatly improved, it would very cool.  But for now, it's kinda just ok.   Not a waste of time if you like action and sci-fi, but don't expect an epic.   I'd compare it to feature length ""The Expanse"" with better effects and choreography but less interesting and more cliche' plot.",NEUTRAL

"Dec 24, 2023","I literally thought I was watching ""A Bugs Life"". The first part of Rebel Moon is nearly IDENTICAL to A Bugs Life. They come for the grain, that has yet to be harvested, intimide the natives and leave with the warning that all of the grain should be ready when they return in 10 weeks, one week after the harvest should be complete or face a fate much more terrible than possibly starving.

It's more like a smorgasbord of lines and scenes plagiarized from other Sci-fi movies. The acting is wooden, and the script is clunky - it's like a bad Star Wars fan fic. The writing makes George Lucas seem as sophisticated and witty as Oscar Wilde. Also, the director loves lens flare even more than JJ Abrams. An absolute stinker.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","At its heart, Rebel Moon is a fun ride. Who doesn't love the gathering of fallen heroes in pursuit of a lost cause and a chance at redemption? It does borrow heavily from Star Wars, Warhammer 40k and the Seven Samurai. It's visually stunning and has a good pace. It sets up a part 2 to be VERY interesting. I encourage all scifi geeks to take a look and judge it for yourself.",POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","A full lack of imagination on display. I am surprised the writer is not being sued for poor plagiarism.

"Dec 24, 2023","It wastes a bit of time recruiting guys that at last they don't perform enough actions to give sense to them. May be it's because they will have more time in the sequel.

"Dec 24, 2023","The tough thing with Rebel Moon is that it has so much going for it in visuals and uniqueness... however, story, dialogue and some aspects of world building are a bit too unauthentic to make this a great film.

"Dec 24, 2023","I saw someone describe this as an RPG when you skip all the dialogue options and I feel like that's about the best description there could be. There's no character development, hell there's not really even any characters. They hired some actors to immediately join the party without any personality or reason to care about them. Absolutely no depth at all. The big betrayal doesn't matter because we haven't gotten to know the characters enough for it to matter. There's no chemistry between the characters so there's no emotion to it.  The party is assembled on a bunch of planets we're given no information about or reason to care about in a universe that short of some generic exposition we don't have any reason to care about.  The action was poorly choreographed nonsense to the point the tiny steps people were taking ""running"" and awkward body posture when they knew things are going to be slowed down just looked ridiculous.  The fights didn't flow and were the worst ""bad guy stands around and waits their turn"" possible.  The story isn't just rushed it's fractured and disjointed. Things just happen without any reason for them.  I have no idea how this has as high rating as it does because this film is trash.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 24, 2023","Derivative, poorly acted, written and choreographed. Almost comical in its blatant thievery from better sources. Harry Potter, Star Wars, Firefly and more. Time I'll never get back.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","This movie is marvelous. Well written, magnificent visual effects and the story goes in a way in which you feel connected with each character. Kora is a character who shows you and let you see and feel the sorrow of being a child of war. Kora pain is well played by Sofia Boutella. Is a shame that all those critics hate this movie. All of them have no honor, respect and suffering from a lack of professionalism. My advice is, watch this movie and enjoy this new world. The action is amazing, the dialogs are deep and well written.",POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023",Story was bland and unoriginal. Predictable in every aspect. Feels like scraps held together by thin pieces of tape. Casting was meh. Not a single character I was drawn to. This is something you throw on just to have background noise.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","- Beautiful visual.
- Empty boring script
- Bad cast.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","It was a predictable, you can tell it was written by politically left leaning people.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","It's a really bad version of A Bug's Life crossed with Serenity, Star Wars, Dune and Battle Beyond The Stars with a sprinkling of The Magnificent Seven. The slow mo gets boring very quickly, the dialogue is terrible, the story is derivative, there is zero humour. It takes itself so seriously that it's painful to watch all the way through. It's a series of really cool set pieces that look great in a trailer. I really wanted this to be good. It isn't.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","Exposition intercut with low stakes action. A good looking assortment of characters you don't care about, or even like, are thrust between unconnected action scenes with little drama.

The use of The Volume is woeful and obvious throughout. 

Part 2 doesn't deserve to get finished.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","Cast was great. Story is still building but so far has kept me heavily invested. Can't wait for the directors cut. The movie needs to be longer and I am sure the directors cut will fill it in nicely. Lazy writing? Not really. If you dont like 7 samurai in space, you will most likely not find it appealing. Lazy commenters who complain about the script but can't proofread before sending? 100%.",POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","Overall a good movie. Some cliches apart. Te worst thing to me is the Skinny body of the ""most dangerous warrior"". She is a good actress but with the wrong shape for the role. Put someone like Gina Carano or Lucy Lawless and would be perfect for the role.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 24, 2023",A fresh and mature sci-fi movie that's gonna make you want to watch more! Can't wait for part 2.,POSITIVE

"Dec 24, 2023","As one who does not read comics or books I make no comparison in movies. I like to be entertained and that is what this movie gave me. Good character development, good story lines. Only complaint is movie was too short.",POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","Ok, so it does have the smell of other movies/series in this genre. But it does stand alone in the amazing cinematography! It's incredible. The major sense I got in the beginning was firefly. It just has that homestead come sci-fi feel mixed with some chronicles of Rodrick and a pinch of Dune. It is a little slow in the beginning and I felt myself drifting a little. Also the bringing together of characters is slow. My major issue though is that when it finally started to get going and you settle in, it ends and as of writing this, we have about five months until the next part comes out. And by then it won't have the same impact. But I would like to feel that a new ""thing"" is being created here. I hope that this goes on to having its own universe with more depth to it, being learned. I won't spoil the story. I just wanted to give a feel for it. But definitely watch it. I look forward to watching it again around when the next part comes out",POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","Zack is a good guy however, he cannot write a story. This movie is so bland. All style over substance",NEGATIVE

should be charged with plagiarism.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 24, 2023",Pretty good movie was it the best no but definitely enjoyed it and looking forward to the 2nd part 8/10 rating would prefer a bit more depth on each main character but overall a good experience ignore the hater critics they are seriously jaded,POSITIVE

"Dec 24, 2023","Terrible moon. The script was so shallow, uninspiring and predictable there was nothing left to do but turn this film off. I have seen more nuanced and interesting characters in children's story books. Graphics were over engineered making the set and style feel more like a video game than a film. Do no watch, spend your time better elsewhere",NEGATIVE

They way she goes to these people to recruit them, she give some lame speech to the

"Dec 24, 2023","Very good sci fi movie, better than last Star Wars and Star Trek production, but still Guardians of Galaxy on top.",POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","The saving grace for me was Sophia Boutella & the character she plays. This film visually has so much potential, but story wise is chaotic & very poorly edited. Again, the only protagonist interesting is Kora (Sophia Boutella)..",NEGATIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","In the running for worst movie of the decade. *spoilers*
Consistently nonsensical plot. Characters introduced early then forgotten until the end of the film. Recruit a general, he's absent from all the planning, recruit rebels, immediately murdered. See informant captured, tell no on that their covers been blown.
Writing is equally amateurish. 20% of the film is poorly written monologues from the protagonist, ""she was named Issa after an ancient Queen, Issa the life giver. It was said she could give life"". Or a long monologue telling us about how she was ""adopted"" and raised to be a military officer. followed by ""at the age of 18 I was made an officer and given a command"" OBVIOUSLY, WE JUST WATCHED THAT HAPPEN OVER THE ENTIRE MONOLOGUE, WHY ARE YOU ALSO TELLING ME THIS????.
The whole film is scenes and tropes lifted from other media and pasted into Rebel Moon. 40k fake Latin and fancy uniforms, bad Mos Eisley Cantina ripoff, Jason Mimosa inspired Gryphon taming scene from Harry potter, Blades edge Mts ripped from Wow Burning Crusade.
Barf.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 24, 2023",So bad like worst parody of Star Wars...painful to watch...,NEGATIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","A tired plot with paper-thin characters, this is a film by numbers, each required element being checked off a list. It's 3 stars only for the visuals. Do something better with 2 hours of your life.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 24, 2023",I enjoyed it as a first part and introduction to the characters and backstory. Looking forward to seeing where it goes for part 2.,POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","This is a good film, who cares if it is similar to other movies. It would be almost impossible for it not to. I feel like it would have been better as a series though as it seems like there is not enough build up to have any empathy with the characters.",POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","Visuals were stunning! The story was quite interesting, did feel a bit slow in places but I felt myself paying attention the entire time. fight choreography was great too and felt real, and you did notice the slow motion after a while.

Was an enjoyable movie and am looking forwards to the directors cut of this",POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023",I loved it. Very entertaining,POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","This is why I don't ever listen to critics. They know absolutely nothing and I have no idea how they got the job.  This film was absolutely amazing. Best film I've seen in a long time, better than any star wars and I love those films.",POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","Very watchable, think the directors cut will be better as R rated would suit this movie better, otherwise, enjoyed.",POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023",Absolutely brilliant film. It's Star Wars for adults and I can't wait for part 2,POSITIVE

"Dec 24, 2023",It's a fun movie with some great cinematography....it's not a ground breaking story line as it borrows from other movies but most good movies do. Looking forward to the second part.,POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","Is a great movie with very amazing visuals. Characters are so cool made, CGI at its best. The movie has nothing to do with Star Wars. The story is really good and is opening door to more parts. Only hating people will say is not a good movie.  I will definitely look forward to upcoming parts.",POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023",Its a beatiful scifi epos. Is it inovative? No. So what? Still great. Loved every second of it!,POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023",The was so much over use of slow motion that I thought my brain could suddenly slow time. CGI looked like a late 90s Fox television series.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","This movie is a hybrid between a comedy and a sci-fi trolling movie.
The way the movie is put together, it seems like a 4-year-old trying to copy the classics in a dumb way, stuff like Star Wars, 7 Samurai, Iron sky and copying parts of lore of videogames in an awful and tasteless way.
How people can appreciate this stuff is beyond me. I was able to go through the movie because the big budget gave some almost decent action scenes and some good actors.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","Visuals outstanding, storyline was lacking, choppy and no character development.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 24, 2023","Loved it!   Fun, good entertainment. Really well done visuals. Waiting for the next installment",POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","Yes it really is that bad. Even before you get to the story, character development etc, you have to deal with out of focus scenes and patches of CGI that only just surpass Ant Man. Of a family of 4, that included a fresh out of uni film director, 3 of us were on our phones in less than 30 mins and the 4 unconscious.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 24, 2023",I really liked it from the moment it started I was wrapped up in it. I can't wait for the next part definitely a must watch and am telling all the people I know it's definitely worth a watch!!!,POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023",essentially a hard to follow clip show.  Nothing in the plot to make you care about any of the characters although the main heroine might be worth fleshing out,NEGATIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","Hilariously bad. The dialogue is cringeworthy. Full of boring, poorly acted, humourless monologues. Even the action sequences are in slow motion, like some 90s student movie.  The visuals are however very impressive on the whole, it's just a shame they don't wrap themselves around a better movie.  All in all, we had a lot of fun laughing at how bad it all was, but seriously... They spent 170 million dollars on this... And that's actually not funny....",NEGATIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","Arguments are a little childish. You will not find original ideas in this movie; it's a mix of Seven Samurai, Star Wars, and any western movie.

Graphics are ok, but not enough to justify the script.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","Instead of a single 2 hour movie, it should have been a 3 episode...regarding the story, it's great & uplifting. Amazing choreography, vfx, action & on point slo-mos...
The story is too good to be that short, felt like scenes were cut, which definitely were..",POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","Pulp si-fi with cliches and underdeveloped characters, but certainly not the disaster some would have you believe. Several things I've not seen before. I look forward to part 2.

Awesome movie, can't wait for the R Rated version and Part 2.",POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","It's not so bad as some people want to make it out to be, I appreciate the effort to make a ""new"" IP‚Ä¶that said: ""slowmo"" is excessive and in most cases unnecessary, CGI is inconsistent, fight choreography should significantly improve, character development is minimal-to-none and characters don't have chemistry‚Ä¶leading to me not feeling for them when they get killed off, main character is bland at best, antagonists are far more interesting; it needed to be rated R to get the best out of it, unfortunately it's held back by the PG-13 rating that makes it convoluted in the editing room.

I'd watch the entire series, but it missed the mark in terms of being ""a new classic"".",NEUTRAL
"Dec 24, 2023","Zack definitely delivers on epic fight scenes, some good visuals and strong character's but the world building is a little lack luster‚Ä¶‚Ä¶",POSITIVE

"Dec 24, 2023",Absolutely brilliant.  Great direction and awesome story.  Can't wait for part 2!,POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023",Yes it has been inspired by many other movies but what movie hasn't. Just because there are tropes doesn't mean it's trite or hodgepodge. I judge movies by an emotional connection and it had that for me. The cast is insanely all hot but also not in the CW way; actually interesting and good acting. Highly recommend for fans of this genre.,POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","Rather than pay the rights to use an existing IP, the writers of this film and the visual effects people borrow chunks from others from Judge Dredds (90s movie) lawgiver, to the space dreadnought from Homeworld 2 (game), to the style and language of the bad guys of the imperial guard (w40k) and story from numerous movies and particular another space movie battle beyond the stars, which had more originality and humour. I won't even go into the dodgy accents, are English actors still allowed to do Irish, and are we still doing the obvious evil empire as British?",NEGATIVE
"Dec 24, 2023",An unnecessary show of visual gymnastics. Really,NEGATIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","Nowhere near a Starwars rip off. So good, I can't wait for the story to continue.",POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023",Rebel Moon continues Zack Snyders exploration of the heroes journey. As expected it is a visual feast. The storyline is relatively straightforward with a few surprises that appear along the way. I look forward to re watching this excellent film.,POSITIVE

"Dec 24, 2023","I loved it- but we needed more background-possibly in the Directors cut.

"Dec 24, 2023","Who cares if it resembles Star Wars? This was a banger, visually stunning and action packed. Great fight choreography, soundtrack and special effects. Top ensemble with badass names: Tarak, Devra Bloodaxe, General Titus. Costumes and makeup on point. Loved it!",POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","Unlikable characters, hasty and disconnected narration. An embarrassing film.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 24, 2023",Movie was SUPER entertaining! We really enjoyed it,POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","What's worse than a movie that shamelessly plagiarizes elements from other sci-fi or fantasy products? A movie that does all this and fails to even build a world in which you feel interest and curiosity in finding out how the story will evolve. However, if the terrible world-building is Rebel Moon's biggest flaw, it certainly cannot be said that everything else is able to compensate for the extremely poor script. Direction, visual effects, photography, costumes are all so aseptic and unmemorable that it is guaranteed that nothing of this movie will remain forged in people's minds for years to come, as movies and TV series have been able to do like which Rebel Moon would pretentiously love to place itself.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","A movie with forgettable characters, boring dialogue, no pacing, mediocre sfx, more lens flare than a J.J. Abrams.
I switched the film off after 97 minutes, as I had lost the will to live!",NEGATIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","My thoughts on Rebel Moon:
1. Whoever said it's slow and has no character arch should visit their therapists ASAP!
2. 2 hours are not enough and might lack in proper editing
3. Sofia is a powerhouse
4. Direction's Cut will be the brilliant R Rated version we are all eating for",POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","A compelling setting with great visuals squandered by a cast of paper-thin characters and a soulless story. This movie attempts the classic Seven Samurai formula but fails to create compelling and likable characters. The film casts character development and plot cohesion aside to squeeze in as much action as possible, which might be a plus for some.

If you are looking for a mindless action film that allows you to turn your brain off and marvel at the gorgeous setpieces and action sequences, you will enjoy this film. If you are looking for a compelling narrative with a cast of lovable characters, you would be better off searching elsewhere.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","This has everything, a new story line, a new universe to get your teeth stuck into, characters to care about, visually it is stunning to watch and the time flew in watching it!! Can't wait for the extended version to see more!",POSITIVE

"Dec 24, 2023","It felt like a mediocre console game. The team recruiting, streamlined objectives with no parallel plots etc made me feel like I was watching a playthrough. At some point I was searching for a compiled list of stolen cliches from other franchises as they were so many. The visuals were decent thought, I'll give it that.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","Long awaited Zack Snyder's new universe doesn't disappoint! Loved it from the beginning til the very end. Should've been R rated cut right away but hey, I'm still happy!",POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023",I really wanted to like it but it was so disjointed that it was in many sections almost nonsensical.  It was clear they knew they were doing a directors cut and so when they edited down this release it was not with an eye towards making it a coherent story.   Don't bother watching this version.   Wait for the extended addition and then decide if you'll watch the sequel.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","Possibly the most derivative and unoriginal sci fi movie ever. Manages to rip off Star Wars, Dune, Avatar, and Harry Potter all in one movie!  In that regards I guess it is quite a. accomplishment.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 24, 2023",I liked the idea (even though clearly picks from many other movies)and the visuals. I think there is a lot of potential here but to be honest he felt a bit rush in the finale. Overal I liked it and looking forward to the second part.,POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","Slow. Over done slow motion scenes. No character building, and  over hyped. Feels like a waste of time. Only thing good in the whole thing was the griffin scene.

"Dec 24, 2023","The acting was good and great visuals. It borrows a lot from other SciFi movies, Star Wars in particular. However, it was entertaining and worth watching. Don't know why it has so many negative reviews. Looking forward to Part 2.",POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023",This movie is entertaining from start to finish. This movie is Sci-Fi Fantasy.  The viewer expects to have some things left unexplained. That ok. We know it's make believe. We don't need a narrator to explain everything.,POSITIVE

"Dec 24, 2023","You know, I'm a fan of many movies and many directors, but most of all I'm a fan of good stories and good characters.  This has both.  Sure, there are some issues with battle scene slow motion (which personally I think can detract from the chaos and intensity of battle) but it's a minor niggle if the story works. It's also refreshing to have a story not beset by a big studio ""message"" or pandering to be relevant in today's society and just being a story.  It's a traditional story about empire stomping on those that it claims to protect, the things that real world rebellions have been caused by, but it's an enjoyable ride along with a band of characters and protagonists that left me wanting to see a) the next chapter and b), the extended r-rated version.",POSITIVE

This movie was amazing. I normally don't watch gritty sci-fi, but I always want to give Zack a look expecting the movie to be okay, but I was surprised how engrossing the story is. The characters, the visuals and the settings top notch. And the villain is one of the most scary and gross villains I had seen on a while. The choice of weapon, a blunt object, makes him more sadistic and guttural. Very fresh way to present a villain in these sanitized times. Can't wait for the director's cut and the sequel.",POSITIVE

All and all enjoyable watch.  Descent action and great cinematography.  Dialogue could've used some work. I don't get people bashing on the tropes and retelling of Seven samurai.  Everything has been done and most stories are told, we have tropes for a a reason. I thought it was a fresh take on the story. That being said, it was just cut and edited all wrong.  Maybe the rated R cut will be better.",NEUTRAL

Me encant√≥ el desarrollo de la trama sin tantos rodeos, no se siente pesada la pel√≠cula de 2 horas con 11 minutos, me hizo recordar mucho a mi infancia las pel√≠culas de como el actor principal iba a buscar a los personas secundarios que usualmente son unas bestias para pelear tambi√©n me record√≥ al se√±or de los anillos en la trama.
Le fall√≥ un poco en los efectos especiales los fondos algunos s√∫per fakes eso me disgust√≥ un poco pero los puedes superar con todo lo de m√°s que est√° s√∫per bien hecho.

"Dec 24, 2023",This movie is as expected    It is good.  It felt quick.    It's part one and it plays like a part one.   You want to watch part 2 when it's over.   It's like good Star Wars.,POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","Visually impressive, and generally entertaining. There was potential for this movie to be one of the best science fiction movies in a long time. It started strong, and had compelling characters, but then it all started to feel rushed. New characters were introduced like we already knew their backstory--and were immediately trusted by the protagonists without question. There is an overwhelming Star Wars theme throughout--from the villain emerging from near death, to bar scenes, and the hero rising from a modest farming community. What saves this movie is the visuals, action sequences, and there is nothing that is noticeably terrible, like dialogue, or massive plot holes. It definitely would have benefited from pacing, character development, and a longer runtime. They should made this into a limited series.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 24, 2023","Excellent fantasy and sci fi flick. If you're looking for dramatic acting in the sense of Opemhiemer, this ain't it, but if you want an escape from reality and a couple hours with sheer visual and conceptual delight, this meets all those points. Thank you Zach for not making movies for critics and in turn giving your fans something to delight in. 
One more thing, I'll never watch movies because some stuffy nose that thinks they know better tells me what is enjoyable.",POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","The
 storyline reminding me too much of an old show called Battle beyond the Stars. The special effects were actually pretty lame and acting really was flat. It was really a big disappointment, I will not be wasting my time watching the next episode when it comes out later this year",NEGATIVE

"Dec 24, 2023",One of the worst sci-fi movies I have ever seen. The entire story is disjointed and fails on so many levels. It is like bad Star Wars fan fiction if the fan had never watched Star Wars and confused Star Wars with Star Trek but wanted to make a space opera with lots of slo mo parts of battle sequences.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","Loved every minute it. Yes, there are elements of Star wars, dune, and others. But in this day and age the basic plots of all movies are the same. The story fits well into the classic heroes journey.",POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","I've seen and enjoyed a lot of bad sci-fi movies. But the only enjoyable thing about this movie is the costume and set design. The heavily used CGI is okay I guess, it's at least passable. All the excitement of the action scene is snuffed out by over used slow motion. The acting is wooden and you can easily forget characters in the main crew. Worst of all, the movie is just predictable and boring with, what characters you barely remember, being moved along by the plot. I would say the movie is all edge, no point but there's not even an edge to the movie.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 24, 2023","An world and story full of potential, but intrigue is lost when the it started to feel formulaic. The start of the film had me interested in the world and Kora, the main character. But as she goes on a venture to recruit an army, it turns into a predictable structure of ""land on planet, observe a character overcome a great feat, and have them join the crew for no convincing reason."" This would have been a better format if done as a series with 8-10 episodes. If each episode could have been spent on a planet, exploring the lore, culture, races, and laws of that world and making us care about the character that's eventually recruited, it would have been way more impactful by the end of the season. But rather, when the big fight happens at the end of the film, I had little to no investment into the characters (at times I couldn't even recall their names), therefore, I have no reason to care who lives or dies. I just simply watched it feeling next to nothing.
It had good graphics, but while the battle scenes look nice, they cut into slow motion so often and at times that felt unneeded, that it made the battles feel too long. It also fell into the same trap that we see in action movies, where no one, despite being trained soldiers, can aim their guns properly, or hit their targets if their lives depended on it (and yes, their lives DID depend on it.) Of course, our main character and her crew had exceedingly good luck with their aim. :S
Thankfully, the ending of the film left me intrigued and wanting to tune in for Part 2. If only the middle of the film was as strong as the start and end, it would be near perfect. Unfortunately, the thought of sitting through this film a second time is not a thought I'll be having anytime soon.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 24, 2023","By Zach Snyder‚Ä¶.ok, decent visuals but has struggles trying to determine if its a cheap Star Wars knock off with a Mix match of Viking, western, pirates, nazis genres all jumbled together ‚Ä¶.oh and a Supreme Emporer.

"Dec 24, 2023","It was entertaining, interesting and fun. Looking at some of the reviewer scores (and comments) reminded me of the Simpons episode where Homer writes scathing restaurant reviews. If you like this genre then definitely give if a watch, if not then you won't enjoy it regardless.

The acting was fabulous. The sets were very well done. Production value was high. Bonus: it was also free. Yes, the story is not particularly original, but what story is?  The good versus evil plot is an ancient one retold many times. Kudos not codemnation are in order. If you notice it was the critics who rated it so low. The audience seems to rate it at almost a 70%.  I am always suspicious of those who do not  create anything, yet judge those who do with vitriol. SMH.",POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","Is it cheesy? Definitely. Some parts are a little rough, and there's definitely a requirement for suspension of disbelief.

"Dec 24, 2023","Some characters don't really get fleshed out enough, and the pacing can be a little jumpy at times, but Rebel Moon builds an incredible universe, with complex motivations for its core cast, satisfying action sequences and does a good job of resolving its own conflict while building towards Part 2. Very enjoyable watch.",POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","Great movie, only wish we had the R-Rated version at launch. The only sad thing is it's too short. I really wish we had the uncut 3h version right away to see the full lenght in details of this movie.

A great space opera!",POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023",Very paint by numbers story that cant decide if it wants to be Star Wars or Dune.  Foreshadowing is non existant and a quick speech is all it takes to get people to join her crew.   No character development and too much slo motion.  Skip this one.  Watch it if you dont like bright colours cause there is so much brown.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","There were story elements I recognised for sure, it's a sci-fi hero movie with a pretty big nod to Seven Samurai/Magnificent Seven, and various other franchises... but so what.
The FX were well done, the fight scenes had a Riddick vibe (the whole slo-mo thing)... the score was epic, if a bit light on themes.... some of the dialog was a bit ""obvious"".
But as a world builder, leaving questions (as it should)... pretty good.
So, in the grander scheme of things, did I enjoy it? Yes

Id say a dune meets star wars with a very strong passionate leading lady. Fantastic CGI and the Characters are very interesting. I loved every pulse pounding moment. All you die hard star wars fans get into a new generation away from that trilogy. Not a rip off. A rip forward.  Rotten tomatoes doesn't do this movie justice. I loved it and I want more!,POSITIVE

"Dec 24, 2023","The movie is long, with very little character development. While visually pretty at times, they don't stay in any one place long enough for you to really explore the area. The dialogue is laughable, with one scene in particular the main character is trying to convince another person to join her team and the things she says are so bad I began laughing out loud as she spoke the lines. It is a straight up remake of the seven samurai, I'm not sure where the articles claiming it's an original story get that idea from... in seven samurai, you have japanese farmers searching for samurai to defend their village from raiders stealing their rice... in Rebel Moon, you have... space farmers.... searching for space warriors.... to defend their village from an empirial admiral stealing their wheat....",NEGATIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","What did I just watch. Hollywood directors need to go train in Japan and learn how to create good films again. The plot was boring and predictable. The acting was sub par. They really wasted the talent they had. And the main character was just horrible, just about everyone else in the film was more believable than her and had a better story arc. Very poorly executed project.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","This movie was kind of a mess. The plot was paper thin which I mean is fine for a B sci fi flick but it was so choppy. From the outset it didn't flow at all. We start on a farm where we have our hero and possibly two ""unlikely allies"" that never show up again for whatever reason but were made to seem important (yes I'm aware there's more parts but at least make it make sense). The giant exposition dumps from our main heroin were bad. Go into the ""recruitment phase"" for this little adventure and it just felt like it just jumped from one planet to the next without truly fleshing out any of the characters for real. So you didn't actually care why they were joining this crew. The abilities they had to aid in this ""rebellion"" didn't really make any sense. We had a farmer, a grifter, a wannabe anime female assassin type, a retired drunken general, and some random barbarian types because why not. If I missed anyone else it was because they were just THAT forgettable. ALL of the fight sequences save for one in the bar were awful (typical stormtrooper fodder minus the fun). The sad part is I found the background characters that had like one scene infinitely more interesting than the main cast. A lot of slow mo when it wasn't necessary. In fact in the final fight the slow motion made this big ""hero moment "" of one of the characters look like he was straight out of Team America: World police. That actually got a laugh out of me. TLDR: It was a mess, the characters sucked and if I didn't know that it was taking itself seriously I would have thought it was a parody.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","I've never written a movie review.  I had thought about writing a movie and now I think I definitely can. Just do a bunch of drugs, watch as much anime,fantasy and sci-fi as possible and maybe not sleep. You will have rebel moon. Characters from gladiator to mad max fury road. Toss in a few light sabers, spider people and hobbits(orcs wtv tf) also. I cannot believe this movie was produced without any production company or studio suing the producers or whomever.  I have seen it once and do not plan to ever again. I felt like there was a hidden prize you would win if you could guess every movie, tv show or anime they ripped off (if there is please let me know).

People didn't bother with the script at all. Later I looked at what the scriptwriters had created earlier and realized that for their level this was normal, but it's not clear how Zach got there...

This movie is loaded with great actors but due to there being such a massive cast you don't really get attached to anyone. They try to give some back story as they assemble the team but it feels very forced. I also hope you like slow motion because we sure know Zach does. ANY kind of action scene there will be a multiple slow motion cuts - while yes, these are cool and he does a great job; there are so many it just gets old. It's like being forced to eat cake at every meal; it's great at first but starts to quickly loose its appeal.

"Dec 24, 2023","While Rebel Moon borrows from a lot of Sci-Fi tropes, it really failed to deliver a compelling and riveting story. Visually, this movie is a wonder to see and it has that Warhammer 40k aesthetics to it. However the execution of the story ruins it by giving us characters with no personalities and makes us believe that they would easily band together with very little effort. It is unfortunate that this movie will heavily rely on the next chapter in order for it to be considered whole. Most movie series that are considered to be top tier have held their own with each movie. Each movie should have its own separate arc that will culminate at the conclusion, sadly for this movie, it will rely on the next installment (Scargiver) for it to be considered digestible. 

The good: visually amazing and I really love the concept

The bad: execution of the movie is lackluster, the pacing is terrible and the characters not interesting enough.

The ugly: overuse of slow motion. Not every action sequence needs a slow motion. For the love of God, Zack, stop it.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 24, 2023",Absolutely a blast. I am baffled by the disconnect between the critics and the actual people.,POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","I don't even know why people pay attention to critic reviews anymore. Yes while you get Star War vibes the concept was cool, graphics were fun and the story is dramatic yet entertaining.  What happened to just enjoying a good movie with family. Everything is oh they didn't do this or I expected that. It wasn't trash it was creative and most films nowadays aren't as original is they use to be, but that doesn't mean you can't just smile while watching. If you want to write and create a script and see if it can make a movie, go for it. So be light-hearted on the reviews lol, especially hard-core critics.",POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","Perfect amount of sci-fi and action. No corny love story, but would have enjoyed a little of chemistry or romance some type. Vibes: The chronicles of Riddick mixed with Star Wars. Chefs Kiss!",POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","Filme muito ruim, roteiro muito fraco, c√¢mera lenta o tempo todo",NEGATIVE
"Dec 24, 2023",It's beautiful. The design. The scenes. The costumes. There's little characterization for characters we are supposed to expect. The acting isn't great. The plot is very simple and I had little to no care about it. I just wished it was better. Feels like it's all been done before and done better. Beautiful but no substance.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","Boring and filled with tropes you've seen a million times before. The lead hero's planet was wiped out by the big baddie who then adopted her and she became a great warrior who will turn on him. Sound familiar? Action is horrible, slow-mo adds nothing to this film but director uses it more than lens flare in the rebooted Star Trek",NEGATIVE

"Dec 24, 2023","I liked it.  A good B movie space epic with some great action scenes.  Most of cast is great, however disappointed in treatment of Ray Fisher and Charlie Hunman's characters!! And Corey Stoll wasted.  Special mention to Anthony Hopkins.  Film owes A LOT to Star Wars and even some Doctor Who however opening scene brought to my mind Gone With The Wind and if you're seen both you'll know what  I mean.  I look forward to Part 2.",NEUTRAL

"Dec 24, 2023",This movie is basically 7 samurai but set in space. I was looking forward to this movie. But it just didn't live up to the hype. The plot armor the heroes have along with the low tier acting not even its amazing visuals can redeem this.,NEGATIVE

"Dec 24, 2023",Absolutely horrible in every sense of the word.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 24, 2023","There is no denying that the film is derivative, but I disagree with reviewers who say it is only derivative of Star Wars, Dune, or other large Sci-Fi franchises. I think it is mostly derivative of samurai films and retellings of the Seven Samurai/Magnificent Seven, set in space. If you have liked many of the retellings of that classic story,  you may enjoy this. The visuals are stunning, and although the dialogue is a little wooden, it certainly isn't more wooden than George Lucas' dialogue. I didn't particularly care for the Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron ""noble savage"" element and really wish they could have given the actor a shirt, but overall I liked the film and will watch the second half.",NEUTRAL

"Dec 24, 2023","Rarely I am compelled to review a film, but this film is awful. There have been many movies attempting to emulate Star Wars, this being with this being a terrible tribute.

So many plot holes, no character development, forced dialogues with weak monologues, poor acting (not all) , and unnecessary slow mo's .

The cinematography is nice, but everything feels forced. So many scenes are unbelievable and unnecessary and and obvious 'copy and paste' from previous versions.

I assume the next films will fill in the details, but in reality I don't want to waste Time my time with them.

Overhyped but I'm sure Ladbible will make sure it's popular.",NEGATIVE

Shallow and boring while being Visually appealing is about all I can say about it.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 23, 2023","If you are looking to watch a good movie, this ain't it! Visually can be stunning but the dialogue is terrible, acting is very wooden plus the pacing is worst that I have seen. The fact that it is compared to star wars is laughable.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 23, 2023","Though it takes some ideas from other Space Operas, this is not a bad thing. It has clear direction, paced world-building, near-perfect casting, and a plot loose enough to let the characters breathe organically. 

When the group is being recruited, there are two clich√©d scenes, which could have been more tactful. I imagine in the Director's cut that they will be. 

Following in the footsteps of Star Wars, Dune, and Foundation, Rebel Moon is a fun and exciting ride, with exposition enough to tickle the fancy of any true Science Fiction fan. 

I am excited to see where the sequels take us. I have my ticket and some popcorn at the ready!",POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2023","Come on ! This movie is not that bad. Your expectation and the hype around the movie made you think it's bad. But honestly, if try being objective, this movie is pretty good. Visually beautiful, story nothing exceptional, but good enough to make me want to see the second part. This is not the movie of the year for sure, but still better than any movie Disney has done lately ...",POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2023","It's a really good Sci Fi movie.

Redemption is always going to be a winner, and a few good people facing insurmountable odds is the stuff heroism is made of.

"Dec 23, 2023",A original stand alone adaptation off of the Star Wars saga. People will knock it for that but it has the feel and power of it without drawing you towards something else. It has great graphics and a overall powerful sense of good vs evil that empowers the mind and soul.,POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2023","Found it a good movie, I went in with low expectations because of the critic reviews but found it enjoyable.  NOT anywhere near Star Wars but a fun to watch at home.

The dialogue seems to be written by a teenager. The only saving grace is Ed Skrein.    He is the only one who is does any decent acting.    
Sofia Boutella is not believable as some sort of super warrior.    
Tragic acting by Djimon Hounsou.    He over acts and seems to force his lines.   
Don't waste your time.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 23, 2023","I wanted this movie to be good, but it's not. The first 30 minutes could have easily been cut down due it a lot of it being unnecessary, every fight scene was 80% slow motion for the sake of slow motion, and the characters are very flat. This cast is loaded and they deserved better.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 23, 2023","Just add 20 more mins and give us a proper intro, followed by a bit more depth then the super-obvious plot line - Could've really been a solid start to the new franchise. Instead, it's a solid waste of time.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 23, 2023","Actually great idea. But i do believe the DC would flesh it out more as it feels short. 2, hours is not enough for all the cool concepts expressed. That does not make it a bad film of course. I'm excited to see where the next part takes us.",POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2023",Really bad acting. It's just a bad rip off of all different movies but we no feeling. It is so predictable. Like it was written by ai after watching loads of sci-fi and then told to write a movie using all these movies.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 23, 2023","It's exactly what the director said it was: Seven Samurai in space. Or another way of putting it, Magnificent Seven meets Star Wars. It's very entertaining! Love the casting and the lead, Sofia Boutella. Think Naksu meets Rita Vrataski. Part 1 has a dystopian atmosphere and focuses mainly on recruiting rebel fighters, with some battles here and there to keep it exciting. It sets up Part 2 nicely. It's good Sci-fi!",POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2023","Utter garbage. 
Poor green screen effects, laughable dialogue delivered by D-list actors and a plot that makes little sense.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 23, 2023","This movie has more in common with his 2002 Dawn of the Dead, in that this movie just didn't die. You think it's over, but no, it keeps going. Not that the visuals weren't unimpressive, they were. However the dialogue, the story, its a 2 hour movie with 90 mins of exposition. Were they ripping off Star Trek? Star Wars? Harry Potter? Villains too evil to possibly exist, is the main bad guy a space Nazi or a space peaky blinder? Too many locations, a cat with a beak stuck on it, terrible cgi, awful unlovable characters, predictable 'twists'",NEGATIVE
"Dec 23, 2023","Great film. Little predictable, but very entertaining!",POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2023","Yes. There's plot holes, character development issues, and story beats that...seem to go nowhere. But I still REALLY enjoyed the film. Because for all of these negatives, it also did SO MUCH right. It gave us a rich, unique universe ripe for exploration. A well crafted, mysterious, competent main character that I want to keep following. Audio and Visuals that a distinctly their own, despite how many tropes and ideas were borrowed from other famous Sci-Fi stories like Dune and The Chronicles of Riddick. Everyone is quick to say this film rips off Star Wars, while seeming to forget that Star Wars was HEAVILY inspired by Flash Gordon and Dune.

I admired the objectively good set design, The stupendous score, And the sense of curiosity about where the story is going to go. And ya know what...I think the audience score on rotten tomatoes is right. 70% is COMPLETELY fair. This movie is without a doubt a 7/10. A flawed, yet intriguing first entry into a new franchise that has room to blossom into something that could last for years to come, or crumble under the weight of it's own talented, yet at times pretentious creator.",POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2023","The action and graphics were EPIC!!!. Started slow with alot of story build up, but enough beautiful scenery to keep it going. The build up for the next movie is intense and I can't wait to see the next chapter. Don't listen to the critics on this one, this movie is great!",POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2023",Show don't tell. This movie ignores this rule completely. The characters don't even talk to each other except the protagonist. A lot of scenes just strung together. It's trash tier.,NEGATIVE

"Dec 23, 2023",I just watched a great movie and after seeing the critics i had an instant deja vu... it feels like Star Wars when the prequels were released.  You simply cannot please everyone.  I loved more the prequels than the sequels and seeing the criticism of Rebel Moon it seems that these are the same fans who hated the prequels when they were released.  It's such a great movie.,POSITIVE

This is terrible and anyone involved in the creative process of it should feel great shame.",NEGATIVE

Why should we assume? Show us something that proves she's a great fighter, not just running and screaming in slow mo all the time. Yes!! Too much slow mo!!! This movie is for 12 year olds who have no experience in watching movies. Boring!!! Give us something dark, realistic, raw and intense.

"Dec 23, 2023","It was visually well made, but the story and the choice of actors were completely off.

It may well be that Charlie Hunnam is from Newcastle .. While his attempt at a Scottish accent (or whatever it was supposed to be) was embarrassingly to watch.

In general, the characters' stories lacked depth and it all seemed super shallow.

I could go on and on, but that would take forever to finish üòµ‚Äçüí´

So here's a quick summary:
10% acting
10% Story
20% slide attacks
60% slow motion effect

Do I think part 2 will be better? NO!",NEGATIVE

"Dec 23, 2023","Not very good, so much of the story was overly dramatic.  Every single line of dialog seemed forced. Characters were hastily introduced. This is what I imagine the Hallmark channel would do with a sci-fi movie, but with a decent visual effects budget.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 23, 2023","Too many voices that are willing to die on the Star Wars hill...

Like a new restaurant, it only matters if you want to go back, I definitely can't wait for part two.

"Dec 23, 2023","I see this as early days, they are world building and introducing characters to see the scene, so it's a bit slow in places and not mind blowing yet. But I can see definite potential here!
The scenery is beautiful and although it's heavily CGI enhanced it doesn't distract which is great. 
The fight scenes are fantastic as I knew they would be as Sofia Boutella excels at physical combat in most of her films. Though as others have said, there is a lot of slow motion in the fight scenes, but it's probably just to give you time to process everything that is happening as it's often quite a lot. 
Great cast, not sure about Staz Nair, maybe I'll warm to him, but everyone else was superb and delivered good or very good performances. 
Overall very entertaining though, and I look forward to more.",POSITIVE

"Dec 23, 2023","Well, when watching it's quite easy to see right off the bat why so many people are being critical of this film. It's definitely not without its flaws, and there are several. However from what I've heard, there's to be an ‚ÄòR rated' Director's Cut being released next spring, purportedly featuring an additional hour or so of extra content that's meant to fill in the majority of gaps in the character development and storyline issues that people keep complaining about.
 
I agree with many on this point, that although it's technically a movie with 2+ hour runtime, it does feel seemingly rushed through, but on the upside, I thought the pacing moved along pretty swiftly throughout, aka meaning, I didn't find myself at all getting bored. Those 2+ hours blew by, and admittedly by the time the credits were rolling, I was left feeling the desire to see more. Which isn't so bad since Part II is supposedly being released soon-ish.

So me personally, I'm eager to watch the directors cut despite an estimated runtime of 3.5 hours. I believe the upcoming extended release version will potentially add on another 1/2 star to my initial rating due to it providing a sense of completeness to whatever seemed lacking from the first edit. 

In summary, was this the absolute best sci-fi flick of the year that rivals the likes of the monolithic galaxies portrayed in Star Wars? Oh, HELL to the NO‚Ä¶but was it something that's adequately entertaining, dazzling to eyes and a fairly decent way to spend an evening passing some time? Yes. Yes, I believe it is.",NEUTRAL

It's so bad that we turned Rebel Moon on (for the third time, can't watch something this awful in one sitting) just to get some laughs in.

After spending 2+ hours with these characters, I can honestly say you will know them as well at the beginning of the movie as you do at the end. The character development is almost non-existent, and then we are asked to care when certain characters are killed -- but there is 0 emotional connection and the story is so wide-ranging you would need to make it a series to do it justice. 

Going from place to place to collect a rag-tag group of fighters for an upcoming battle, our heroine encounters one person after another who wants no part of it -- only to have their mind changed by a three-sentence speech from our protagonist. Umm...I don't think so.

After the first 30 minutes, everything is underlit, out of focus, with enough lens flare to choke JJ Abrams. Every space location is a murky, featureless unpopulated void. Every ship is an underdetailed conglomeration of boxy shapes. 

This is dull and derivative from start to finish, its limited imagination seemingly butting against a limited budget. Half of the effects look good, half look like they were rendered in 2003. 

If you really want an incomprehensible, overstuffed sci-fi epic with terrible dialog but pretty visuals, just watch Jupiter Ascending. It's better. Which is saying something.",NEGATIVE

The acting was good and the special effects were movie theater quality. The world building was well thought out as well. I know this was originally pitched as a Star Wars movie, but I think it's much better than anything lately that Disney has put out. I can't wait for part 2 to come out!",POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2023","Loved the visuals and the possibility of more world building and character development. I was only let down by less screen time of the other characters.

Also, I was hoping to see a Batman warehouse type of action but nope. Maybe on the second part?",NEUTRAL

"Dec 23, 2023","this was as much fun as star wars rise of skywalker and that s not good. the moment the movie completely lost me was the gryphon scene. i thought who is this for? i am not a child. i don t think this is cool or fantastic. it was so cliched and silly. but then before this scene there were two sexual assaults. so why should this be for children? if i want to watch a mysterious boy tame a gryphon i ll watch harry potter. imagine grand moff tarkin had tried to sexually assauly leia. gritty, right? 
we start with bar hero. next scene gryphon boy, asian jedi lady, dirty general... the scenes just happen and that s how they pick up the members of their superteam. why anyone would join her? no idea. it just happens. 
the characters all have funky accents or dialects, never wash up or change their clothes. no matter where they are. gryphon boy should put on a jacket. i know his abs are amazing, but doesn t he ever get chilly? 
there isn t really more to say about the characters in this movie. their characterization is their outfits and the weird way each individual speaks. 
i am sorry. i think this was trash and not the good kind of trash. the 13th warrior with antonio banderas is good trash. also seven samurai inspired. watch that and give it 5 stars if you must, but not this.
why just one star? because it is bad and very long and we will have to endure an even longer version... this movie wastes too much time...",NEGATIVE

Basically, this is a knockoff of ""Battle Beyond the Stars"", the 1980 Roger Corman film which was, in itself, a knockoff of both ""Star Wars"" and ""The Magnificent Seven"", set in space. There was nothing new here that hadn't been already done over 40 years ago.  Very disappointed in Zack as this was a very lazy attempt to spit shine an old doorknob.

"Dec 23, 2023","OK. Sp you can see almost from the beginning it was meant to be a star wars movie. But it's sufficiently reworked to be something different. Borrows not just from SW but Warhammer Seven Samurai Dune & others.
Took its time to spell out the story and while characters are solid some could have done with a bit more polishing. It's interesting enough to keep you watching to the end & I have a feeling pt2 will even better. 
It's a good film. Way better than anything contained the SW sequels. It concentrates on telling the story which is what is most important. I don't what film the critics watched but it wasn't this one. This is a good film.",POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2023","This is something else. It is good, maybe nit great but us very entertaining. Visuals in general are great, some CGI does look strange at times when ir comes to characters/creatures. This is the first of three so  it clearly st up characters and story so it's not expected to be action packed though it delivers accordingly. Yeah is not nothing new in terms of Ci-Fi fantasy, I didn't like the element of having a fantasy magical creature but the rest of the concept of a universe more looking like ours gives it a different touch some people might expect more futuristic aspect but that would be a Star Wars/Star Trek thing, it's obvious they wanted ro be far away from that and that is fine.",NEUTRAL

An almost painfully frequent use of slow-motion effects, as if the director wanted to say ""we couldn't think of anything, that's why we're making the film so artificially long."" Illogical situations, such as a simple farmer who has never left his home planet before, knows how to deactivate the mother world's execution device without ever seeing it.

"Dec 23, 2023","Rebel Moon is definitely a good movie. Far from perfect, but nowadays we should get our wins whenever we can.

The story is simple, perhaps a little too simple. And it doesn't dodges the typical cliches seen in this genre of movies. But we can see the potential of this world that Zack Synder has created.

Overall character performances were good and some even very good, unfortunately the performance of the main character Kora (Sophia Boutella) is not amongst them. I had hoped she had grown more as an actress, but it seems clear she will not be growing beyond what she has already shown in the past.
And it's a shame really seeing her character played perhaps by another actress like let's say Emily Blunt, would've really shined and could've perhaps been the creation of quite an important character within the sci-fi genre.
I understand why Sophia Boutella was chosen for this role, her dancing skills really come through in the action scenes. But it's her ability to show deeper levels of emotion that are lacking and for her character that's also a vital part.

Rebel Moon hasn't done anything groundbreaking or revolutionary, but it's still a solid movie. Same as the story might seem too simplistic to some, to others it seems to go over their heads. Some negative critics about it are not only unwarranted but a little petty. As if they were expecting this movie to be what Star Wars or Alien were in their beginning.
When even Star Wars and Alien can't reproduce their winning formula.

Don't go into this movie with too much expectations and will surprise you in a good way. Go into thinking it will be groundbreaking within the genre and you'll obviously be disappointed.
Rebel Moon has potential and it's a good addition to the genre, but it doesn't do anything that can't be expected from a good sci-fi movie. And that's already quite an achievement considering how little in terms of good sci-fi movies we really get.

At least Rebel Moon doesn't promise to shoot for the Moon only to fall in a few meters.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 23, 2023","Yes it is very cheesy in places but, I really enjoyed it.  I felt the first half was probably a bit slower than the rest but the ending had a far different pace.

I couldn't get past the visual effects and stylisation copied from Warhammer 40K universe.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 23, 2023","Of course it's derivative, we knew it was a gritty Star Wars meets  Seven Samurai. But the execution is in general good, the action is fun and the visuals dazzling. The plot manages to do decent world building at a brisk pace, keeping exposition to a minimum necessary, letting its derivative natures fill on the gaps for the audience. This first act is about assembling a team of interesting rogues, giving them a thin, mostly implicit backstory, and setting up the second act: their battle against unsurmountable odds to defend the little guy. The acting is ok, it lacks any memorable performances. The climatic fight scene stretches logic a bit, in true Star Wars style only the good guys have good aim and come out on top after being restrained and surrounded by enemy troops. Still it manages to be fun and exciting.",NEUTRAL

"Dec 23, 2023",Visually exciting this movie could be plucked right out of the established Starwars universe. But the story line is hollow and dull leaving you with a sense of sadness and longing for cinema that actually attempted to excite you with new and original ideas. You can easily predict each  plot point as it unfolds like a wet blanket. This is all just copy and paste much the same as the recent Star Wars franchise. As the first part of a trilogy this film attempts to build up anticipation for the subsequent films however I anticipate diminishing viewership for each subsequent part. So much squandered potential.,NEGATIVE

I watched all in Marvel universe masterpieces, and wow, can't really remember the story. General feel of suck. This one is definitively different. May be this is it's appeal. And yes it's heavy on cliche, but it's FUN. Something I did not experience for a long time now. Can't wait for part two. If they make TV show out of this, then great.

Turns out it did and it did indeed end up on the bottom of any reasonable scale. With very few exceptions the characters are one-dimensional caricatures that are impossible to connect to and the whole ""sci-fi"" part looks cheap, with space ships looking as if they have been taken out from a 1998 computer game.

What always amazes me with multi million dollar productions like this - why do they even start with scripts as bad as this? They could have given that script to anyone on the street and they could have pointed out the stupidity. Or is the stupidity intentional?

Charlie's character doesn't impact anything.

Good things about the movie.

"Dec 23, 2023",This was awful. The writing was terrible. The plot made no sense. These user reviews have to be fake. Why would riding a hippogryph tame it?

Worst movie I have seen in years,NEGATIVE

"Dec 23, 2023","Rebel Moon, hit the hype train hard but missed the destination.

**Spoiler** it's going pretty well, a superb open narrative delivered by Anthony Hopkins. It's building our empathy right up to the point a villager is saved from sexual assault.
It's from this point on that it goes on it's magnificent 7 quest that ... Well it becomes devoid of script, any indication of amount of time passing.

****

I can tell you there's a Cora a General Titus and some other people in it who don't like the status quo, but you just don't really care to know because their back story's are delivered in perhaps 2 lines of script. That's. The core problem, you just don't care about the characters,because you don't know them. 

A very personal issue is an aesthetic, what the hell were they thinking with the primary antagonists hair cut. No wonder he's more than a little narky, every single reflective element in the world tells him he looks a right plonker!

There's lots of borrowing from other sci-fi universes, like 40k, Dune, Star Wars, Firefly, John Carter but what we get served from this mixed dish is ever so slightly underwhelming. It passes a few hours, it's mildly entertaining....

Over all you're left asking

The female lead was good but not exactly my cup'o'tea, although she fit the bill. The story is there but needed a little more time spent on the backstory, it seemed worth it. The action is good. Dialog is lacking, which effects the character, humor,  depth, and some regular conversation would be nice. 
The writers on this need help. The lack of quality dialogue and character development might be attributed to the writers union stand off. But all in all it was a B- film. More Character development, back story, and dialogue and you're looking at blockbuster.",POSITIVE

"Dec 23, 2023","Nowhere near as original as The Creator, this is the most rousing sci-fi popcorn movie since Alita Battle Angel or the last Star Wars movie (and at a fraction of the cost).
I do see the negative pro reviews.  What I believe they miss is the need blockbuster movies work best by staying close to familiar archetypes and archetypal themes.  The quality has to mostly come from the commitment and dedication, in front of and behind the camera.  Nothing cheap here at all.

Certain characters get far more focus on them than others which is a bummer for an ensemble flick but it's set up more like this would be the first half hour of ""let's get the crew together"" parts of movies spread into a 2 hour film serring up the sequel which, as shown in the trailer that plays after the movie ends, all those issues will be covered in the next film it seems.  This would be a bigger issue if the next movie didn't come out in just a few short months but here it just feels like part 1 of a TV special opening up a whole new universe I'd love to see more of.

There is little point to so much of this first installment. The energy put into this production would have been better spent on a project like Firefly or Cowboy Bebop, where writing and characters stayed core to the focus.
There was room for subtly within the grand adventure, but it was reduced to obvious and overstated sentiments and violence without consequence.

"Dec 23, 2023","I watched it with low expectations, I think that worked in its favor, although it's still unsatisfactory. It's a stumbling movie that doesn't quite know how to structure the story it wants to tell, and it simply manages by ellipses and flashbacks inserted inorganically, to try to drive the entire story behind it a little. All the interactions between characters are lost, and in the end, you don't care about them. The best thing that can be said about this movie is that it doesn't make you feel like you've wasted your time, but it doesn't evoke any emotion, you feel nothing once it's over, it just ends.

"Dec 23, 2023","This was the worst movie I have seen in a long, long time. I can't remember a movie off the top of my head that was as trashy as this. The graphics look like a low budget video game, the acting was shockingly bad, and it's basically like watching a bunch of loosely woven vignettes with o my the barest hint of unifying story. If they cut out the endless, gratuitous slow motion scenes, it would have shaved about thirty minutes off the movie. It is a poor rip-off of Star Wars, and was utterly abysmal.

Vikings
Amish
Star wars
Farscape
Babylon 5
And much more. 

Realize that considering the restrictions placed on him for the movie it's better than I expected.
I look forward to the next two movies and then the director cuts for all three which I suspect considering Sniders other directors cuts will be even better.

The action is horrible don't use axes and knives if you aren't going to blood or wounds it just look like practice sessions. The guns aren't build right and the again the protagonist can barely hold it without it wobbling all over the place.

"Dec 23, 2023","It was a good movie. Great cast and action. Sure it has its faults, lots of plot armor for main characters and some inexplicable moments in general but I'd like to see more of this universe. Very much Warhammer 40k meets Star Wars. Awesome designs for ships, armor, weapons and planets. Needs to be fleshed out more but this was a good start, strong female lead, not some damsel in distress. The whole cast needs to be more expressive though, I know now they are trying to be under the radar but it would be better to see them being more active. Backstory would have been a better place to start for the main and some support characters but a fun watch nonetheless and a visual treat. I would have like to see more from Jimmy but I guess most of that was cut?
 I hope they spend more time laying out the history of this galaxy and maybe why the king was slain to put things into perspective. It seems like there was so much more that led into this situation in the film that was not expounded upon that it becomes muddled. Was the original empire good or bad? What was the struggle initially? I have a lot of questions but hopefully they can be answered in the future in film/series formats. Comic tie-ins seem lazy to me for exposition, do a book if needed.",POSITIVE

"Dec 23, 2023",A bit too much rampant plagiarism to be comfortable with. Or to forgive. Two and a half stars because it's some scifi that is not Marvel or Disney.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 23, 2023",Very entertaining üëè,POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2023",It was extremely derivative and failed to make be believe the stakes in several scenes. Also the repeated use of sexual assault as a theme is kinda creepy.,NEGATIVE

"Dec 23, 2023","I can't believe I watched this film for what felt like an eternity to see the worst parts of gladiator, a new hope, prisoner of Azkaban, and rip offs of Warhammer 40K plowed into a confused and lack luster design style that felt good until it doesn't.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 23, 2023","Okay, I flat out loved this. Yes, it ""borrows"" from so many sources and it's far too easy to pick them out but I didn't care because it was just what I was in the mood for.

Also, grabbing another man by the stick and balls in a sexual context when there is not consent is not funny or cool.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 23, 2023","A real lack of any depth given other than a brief description of who they are to a rapidly introduced group of characters.

A real shame really could have been so much more.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 23, 2023","Good movie. My only complaint is that there isn't enough character development. They assemble a team that took little convincing to join their cause and we don't learn a whole lot about them.

"Dec 23, 2023","Drama without context, not worth the calories.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 23, 2023","Good cast, interesting premise, no expenses spared with CGI and costume design, but by the end of the 2 hour run time it all collapses under the weight of a poor screenplay.  Felt like a film student project that just ripped off existing movies, and tried to cram so many things into two hours at the expense of any character or world building beyond a few lines of cheap exposition.

It started out okay, then started to feel bad and by the end I felt angry at giving up two hours of my life while at the same time I found myself laughing at how bad the last line uttered in the movie was.

I enjoyed reading reviews of people thrashing this movie more than the movie itself at least.",NEGATIVE

This is a Cowboy Star Wars movie .. like the original Star wars a New Hope had bad reviews but everyone loved the movie Don't listen to the critic's ,listen to the the audience.",POSITIVE

"Dec 23, 2023",A good science fiction beginning of a universe. Surprisingly entertaining and can't wait for the unrated version and part 2 of the story. The only thing holding it back was the amount of slow motion used in every action scene but other than that is pretty good üëç,POSITIVE

"Dec 23, 2023","Based upon the critic reviews, basically every single superhero movie with an origin story in the last 15 years should be one star.  This is how a Space Opera starts, it is exactly how it is supposed to be.  I hope to see more.",POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2023",Loves the shots in this movie!  Action was pretty epic as well.  Excited to see the next one!,POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2023","Idk what's up with the RT score being 21% from starting off at a 9%. That's kinda insane. I thought this movie was awesome. The story is a classic Seven Samurai/Knights of the round table kind of team up movie to protect the planet Veldt. Kora and Gunnar set off in search of help and it takes off from there. The pacing is a bit off in the middle of the movie and I feel like a lot of the extended cut will show what we missed out on. But the first and third acts are the strongest. The visuals were out of fucking hand. The flashback scene when Kora dives into her past was one of the best and I was just in awe of how this movie looked. Al there were establishing shots that were as epic as some in Lord of the Rings. At times it felt inspired by a Cronenberg movie with the alien and technology infused aliens. Jimmy the robot was also a great character and I can't wait to see what the extended rated R cut will show as well as Part II : The Scargiver. Also not to forget is the sets, costumes, props, vehicles were awesome. Junkie XL's score complimented the movie so well and hit just right when it needed to.. I suggest watching and deciding for yourself but I think it's a good movie with plenty of rewatch-ability.",POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2023","3/4 of this film was soooo slow and boring! The fight scene in the village, the scene against the spider and the end of the film were the best bits if you could call them that. Lucky that I gave it a two star rating. Adult version of Starwars someone called this....What a joke....Any of the Starwars franchise's is better than this! I wouldn't waste you time or money watching this movie.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 23, 2023",Absolutely Boring. Zero Action. Weak Story.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 23, 2023",I love that movie and the slow scenes. I like the action and if you like the action you won't get bored. I really love it.,POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2023","I thought it was great tbh.  Not as good as Dune, but way better than any Star Wars movie.  I'll be looing forward to part 2 dropping in 2024.",POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2023",Visually outstanding but lacked a cohesive storyline. Would love much more back story on all the main characters. I'm guessing if there is a Directors Cut everything will be fleshed out much more. Still very entertaining!!,POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2023",Watch it for yourself.,POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2023",this was one of the best movies this year! I don't know why rottentomatoes' criticism is so bad big L,POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2023","I thought it was really good. I read some reviews of people criticizing it but it was all petty. It was one of the better movies I have seen in a while, can't wait for the next part to come out.",POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2023",An absolute disaster of stolen storylines and over produced CGI.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 23, 2023","Not sure if there are a lot of AI bots bombing the reviews as they all sound the same. Also, I'm not sure why there are so many Star Wars references. There are only seven story archetypes and yes they are both following similar tropes but so does any movie about the little guy fighting the big bad.

The movie itself wasn't perfect but it was enjoyable to watch and worth recommending. The characters are interesting and the action scenes were well done. I will say it is the best sci-fi movie I've seen this year.",POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2023","I feel there was not a single original idea in this sucker punch of a film, so many old earth accents and not a decent bit of dialogue to be heard. It has a hobbit village, a princess, Conan turns up and does nothing. The greatest general of the age is found and spouts a couple of bad speeches and at one point Jar Jar is seen. Even the visuals are stolen. The bad guys and their weapons are straight out of Warhammer 40k and then the awful out of place OTT music score is trying to punch above it's weight. Another case of great trailer shame about the Film.

See if you can spot the stormtroopers who still can't hit anything and even the Emperor makes an appearance lool.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 23, 2023",Refreshing to see something from this genre not tied to Star Wars... I know it was originally supposed to be but so glad they they took it in a different direction... Definitely recommend it to people who like sci-fi movies...,POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2023","The acting was horrible, the characters are unimaginative, it's like a sci-fi knockoff of magnificent 7 remake. Such a fantastic cast but the story bored me to death had to push myself to finish the movie and not go watch something more interesting",NEGATIVE
"Dec 23, 2023","Wow, we can discuss some of Disney's questionable decisions about Star Wars...  I really wanted to like this film, but thank the maker for whoever at Lucasfilm/Disney passed on this really pedestrian movie.  They made a VERY good decision!  There's very little if anything new in this film, near zero character development.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 23, 2023","Every aspect about it is bad, there is no character development, it is a blunt copy of Star Wars, and the dialogue is trash.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 23, 2023","Star wars ripoff? Absolutely
 Worth watching? Absolutely. Some of the CGI was a little poor and some of the characters were a bit derivative (pretty standard girl boss lead knocking ppl out with stick figure arms and female Japanese character who uses swords, to name a couple). Character development definitely lacking - for example who the hell is this general and why is he so angry? No idea. But overall it was visually engaging, and had an extremely good villain along with solid action sequences.

I'm excited to see the next in the series",POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2023","A somewhat middling movie. It took a big shot and I felt it missed the net for the most part. It tries to set up an appealing universe without providing nearly enough context or information. There are a number of characters who just seem to do things not because they make sense but because the script wants them to. 

While visually pretty I feel like there was an over reliance on slow motion effects that took away from the film, among other odd visual choices. The main one that stood out to me involved a fight breaking out after a young girl is threatened with SA where there was a decent amount of unpleasantness surrounding what happens to the girl on screen to then transition to a fight scene involving axes and knives with not a single bit of blood nor wounds in sight. 

Just an odd film that felt like it had certain points on a checklist it had to hit but not much else to it.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 23, 2023","Disappointed. Awkward dialogue, poor pacing and cheesy fight sequences. No feel of direction. Mildly entertaining but it's really just another Sci-fi rebellion movie but poorly executed on almost every aspect.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 23, 2023","This is a good version of 7 Samurai... in space! It is visually stunning, there was a seed for a great universe we were introduced to is something I can't wait to learn more about, and I am more than interested in seeing how this universe expands as there are more movies, comics, books, and more introduced!",POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2023","I liked the plot,  storyline and awesome visuals, but the movie lacked character development. I am sure the R rated version will be much better,  with more background on our heroes.  The action is well filmed,  but there isn't much action onscreen to keep you alert. With that being said,  this version had missing scenes and you can tell there isn't enough meet on the bone. Looking forward to seeing the uncut version soon üòÄ",NEUTRAL
"Dec 23, 2023",This is theater quality I would be happy to pay for. Looking forward to the director's cut!!!,POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2023",It's a basic movie with subpar acting. The actors seemed to know this movie sucked. It doesn't have the edge of your seat suspense it thinks it does. The introduction of parts of the plot and character back stories is just thrown in and forced. It's not very smooth.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 23, 2023",It's barely watchable.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 23, 2023","It's Warhammer 40K meets Firefly meets SW. I dig it.  Visuals are beautiful.  Story develops and is a good first step toward something cool. Critics,  lol like the world actually cares what you say.  Usually if Critics don't like it is a good watch. Rock on Rebel Moon!",POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2023","Great movie, ignore the critics.",POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2023","I think the idea of a ""critic"" has been lost. Surely a ""critic"" should judge anm movie so the potential audience can make an educated decision on whether to watch a movie based on an expert opinion. But I'm seeing more and more disparity between ""audience"" scores and ""critic"" scores.
If the two metrics are so far apart, what is the point in the ""critic""? They're obviously completely unaware of what the audience wants and basing their opinion on some other measure of ""entertain-ability"" 
I'm starting to think that the ""critics"" are solely looking for arty-farty, deep and meaningful, artistic, socially - real world questioning films which are inherently boring, frustrating and completely missing the objective of cinema... which is to escape the real world for 90 minutes, not to be reminded of life's stuggles and leave the cinema less depressed than when we arrive.",POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2023","Amazing world creation, visual, VFX and the Seven Samurais vibe was really interesting. Therefore, the directors cut and the sequel should fill the lack of character development of the movie. Aldo, this doesnt prevent the movie from being a very competent and promising iteration. Very well settled up to the sequel",POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2023","A great film with interesting characters and world. Although similar to other films in the style of big bad comes to small town. Small town seeks help. This kept me tuned in right through and I wanted to find out more about the characters and the world they are in. I loved the art style of the film.. Although alot of reviews complained about the over use of slow motion I felt it suited the style and was used at the right moments to capture the feel. This isn't fast and furious where its action over style and depth. This is about style, depth and visuals. This is a great new film series where hopefully we see more world building.",POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2023","La pel√≠cula transmite esa esencia de ZS si te gusta su trabajo la disfrutar√°s mucho, no puedo esperar a ver como contin√∫a esta saga",POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2023","ZS is good when directly adapting a story (300 & Watchmen) yet still always has issues with pacing his movies. When it comes to world building and making his own stories though, he's really bad. 

This movie for example, took him an hour to flesh out the premise. Took 30 mins to pick up new characters without any character backgrounds or motivations, no chemistry or interactions between characters. Then all of a sudden there's the obvious and predictable betrayal and quick switch to climax. 

Then there's the always dark world. Even when the sun's up the world is still somehow dark. Also don't get me started with his addiction to slow motion which happens every ten seconds and in every flashback when there's absolutely no need for it.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 23, 2023","Well, any slower start and I would have thought this movie was about Amish Space Farmers...
Secondly, the pacing of the movie is trash.
Thirdly, the script is horrendous.

This movie sucks.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 23, 2023",This is a movie that has a lot of build-up but leads you nowhere. It's a very typical great soldier that doesn't want to fight but is forced to story. You can tell it's inspired by Stars Wars. It is a very predictable movie. This movie is not good at all.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 23, 2023","A lot of people advertised this film as a Star wars clone. Im a big sci-fi/Star Wars fan and I can see it's a very different world and storytelling. To be honest, I had a better time watching Rebel Moon: The Girl o Fire than watching the last Star Wars trilogy.",POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2023","Better than most of what Disney has put out in the last decade.  Visually superior to every thing Star Wars.  

Most of the hate this has gotten so far is unwarranted and childish to say the least.",POSITIVE

Highly recommended!",POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2023",I think it was a very good movie. Sci-do and fantasy is my jam. I know a lot of comparisons will be made but I didn't feel that way at all. I feel some people feel threatened to say films are good because they are in the same genre as other films they love. 8.5 out of 10,POSITIVE

"Dec 23, 2023","What an awful movie. Just a morass of sci-fi bs we've seen for years now. Weak plot, unimaginative action sequences, the 90 lbs lead actress is unconvincing as a ferocious fighter, every bad character is fat, ugly and slovenly and every good character is thin and handsome. And everyone is wearing too much makeup",NEGATIVE

"Dec 23, 2023","Great fun, action packed and visually fantastic...watch for yourself...those not entertained should stick to soap operas.

"Dec 23, 2023","It's nowhere near the quality of other recent space operas and its cinematography feels dated (imagine the 300, with slightly less slo-mo scenes). The characters and storyline aren't *too* terrible, but they never really pulled me in. It's an okay Friday night watch, but don't expect anything special.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 23, 2023","The critics don't know what they are talking about. Lol they hate anything that's good or different. They hate everything that we love, they don't have one unique bone in their body. I love it and can't wait for part 2!",POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2023",too much slow motion....dull...seemed like a dollar tree version of star wars.....I was stoked to watch but within 10 minutes I turned it off....went back and tried to get through it a few more times but it's just not good.....and I love science fiction movies.,NEGATIVE

"Dec 23, 2023","The only good thing about this movie was that it convinced me to sign in to RT for the first time and tell others just how bad it was. And man was it bad! All the money was spent on visual effects and costume, which were good but honestly not amazing. The story however was really awful. Instead of creating something original they decided to plagiarize from many sci-fi and fantasy sources. The dialog was also wooden and cheesy, most likely due to the weak story. At least it was free",NEGATIVE
"Dec 23, 2023","Story is a little rushed, but it didn't feel politically charged, I enjoyed the overall story, epic picture. Critics just don't like it because it was purely for entertainment.",POSITIVE

"Dec 23, 2023","The dialogue and acting can be a bit corny and forced at times but it's supposed to be like Star Wars so it fits. There's no real story arc, it seems to just be setting up the characters and world. It's not really a 5 star movie but it was good enough that I want to see the sequels. All of Zack Snyders trilogy plans get shot down before they can take off. It'd be nice to see one get off the ground. Also as a Star Wars nerd, it's nice to see a Star Wars that's not a Disney movie. To sum up it's not spectacular but I would like to see more.",POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2023","Saw it 3 Times in a row already. It's a gorgeous looking film. Loving this fresh approach to the sci-fi genre. I cannot wait for the 2nd part of the rebel moon saga and curious to see the extended cut of both films if there is to be one.  If you're a fan of avatar, blade runner, dune, firefly, Star Wars, mad max or even the matrix you will enjoy rebel moon. Highly recommend.",POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2023",The movie has great cinematography and the story is better than what some of the critics state.  Have a sneaking suspension the poor ratings is a combined effort by the mouse house/KK to bring down any Star Wars competition.  I give this movie 5 stars.,POSITIVE

"Dec 23, 2023","I enjoyed it. Visually a beautiful movie. The story was too light with so many characters. I have to believe the directors cut will flesh that out. Few characters definitely deserved it. Hard to judge when it's incomplete. So, we'll see.",POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2023",Ouf!!! Arghhh...what a terrible patchwork of so many good movies. I think there is strictly nothing original in this 2+ hour mishap.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 23, 2023","This movie packs stunning visuals and incredible fights. I think people expect a space drama with deep characters, but it is more of an epic adventure. The best way to describe it is to take 300 and combine it with Dune, add just the right amount of head nods to Star Wars and Gladiator and you have this film. It leaves me excited about the future of this franchise. Good Stuff, good stuff indeed.",POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2023","Worth a watch. Not the worst, not the best. Visual's are gorgeous. Dialogue and story are ok. Character personal interaction was sparse.",NEUTRAL

It's a shame because I really liked the idea of it. People can compare it to whatever franchise they want to, as it pulled from many. But this was just a bad film. I was rolling my eyes at dialogue, confused about characters motivations and got bored with the ridiculous amount of ""let's just make this scene look cool rather than putting any creative work into it"". 
Won't watch again and won't recommend anyone else to do so.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","Rebel Moon Part 1 A Child Of Fire Is a combination of sci-fi and fantasy with a breathtaking musical score filled with hope, power & creativity at its core. The mission of the rebel force is laid out at the beginning & each character is unique and engaging with their own capabilities and motivations meshing together as one as they collide in an epic battle lifestyle. There are also plenty of twists & turns throughout the movie to keep one at the edge of their seats! The full movie experience is in two parts, the second movie to come out April 19th, 2024. This 'part one' is an excellent introduction to a new sci-fi fantasy adventure!",POSITIVE

"Dec 22, 2023","This is so bad that theories of AI writing exist.  The language is pompous and non-communicative.  Large exposition dumps are interrupted by comic-book speech bubbles that propel the plot from action scene to action scene, which alone is a break from utter boredom.  The actors are top notch, the CGI is good for a streaming movie, the story has been lifted from the Seven Samurai which was reworked as the Magnificent Seven, but to no avail.  Both those films created tension and an interest in the Ronin or gun-fighters.  Not so here, where their cardboard nature is as real as the blue screen the actors stand in front of.  It completely lacks substance.",NEGATIVE

Longer runtime and R rating would've helped this get to a 5 for me. I can assure you (like almost all of Zack's movies), the RT rating is not reflective of his movie - definitely check this movie out if you want to be entertained! I liked it better than Star Wars ep.7, 8, and 9 - by a wide margin!",POSITIVE

"Dec 22, 2023",I really enjoyed this film. It has a good story (I can see the Star Wars in the plot) I loved the FX and the acting was top notch. Great movie. Almost feels like Warhammer 40k.,POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","Excellent costume designs with loads of small details and the gear/clothes all have amazing and realistic weathering to them. The world building is slow but giving and Critics should just shut the frell up. Never have they been right the last decade or two. Listen to the audience instead. ;)

Amazing film, characters and character-building and a solid story you feel compelled to follow. Would class the movie as a solid future Sci-Fi classic.
As a prop-maker myself i am blown away by the sheer details that they have worked on that you quite never notice. I'd like to put this movie up with space operas like: Star wars, Farscape, Firefly and Star Gate. Great drama, amazing action and great CGI in the few cases it's used (yes, all spaceship and space is CGI), but they have also used a lot of real props/places which gives it a lovely gritty and realistic look and feel.

Definitely will watch again!",POSITIVE

The characters are introduced and you get the feeling, that this movie is just a prelude to bigger stories to come. I, for myself, I'm looking forward to part 2 and hopefully a lot more parts.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 22, 2023","So disappointing, why did they not get a decent screenwriter, the story is disjointed and totally devoid of any connection with characters.  His worst film yet and I'm a fan",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","It had Great Potential but Introduce 3 Characters that did nothing in Part one i speak of General Titus, Tarak, Nemesis and they just got along for the ride because of yeah we go against the Motherland and believe some random people they never saw. First i thought they where friends with Kai which is the best Character because hes reasoning makes sense, But there not so it makes even less sense why Tarak and Nemesis would help them for only so they could fight against the Motherland its such a whimsy reason. They should have shown less characters and give them more story and reasoning. They should have cut the backstory stuff from the main character shorter so they could actually build the other characters a bit more. I really tried to like it. i liked the Twist with Kai but all in all they just wanted to Much in Part One. They just could have let Kora and the Farmer go together searching they finding Kai and he knows Kora is worth much Money so he Betrays her immediately then does two can find away to Run away (maybe the young Soldier was with them and could have been killed in the escape so they lose someone that helped them from the beginning or even the Roboter he could have changed and helped them because at the start it looked like they will play a bigger role in the first Part if not why even introduce them in the first plays if they then will be forgotten for the whole Movie?) and may find General Titus the deserter and he tells them about the other two surviving special Soldiers from he's Special Squad named Taric and Nemesis so Titus would be the reason why the other to would want to help them and then they will find the Rebels in the second part maybe just don't rush it.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","What a intriguing new universe to explore. Character builds are fresh and exciting, so much to look forward too durring the second viewing. Something that the directors great at is the little details in not just the props and sets but the actors as well. Rebel Moon has got the whole package. It's hard to find characters worth unpacking but the contrasting characters in Rebel Moon are as pleasing as the high contrasting cinematography. Don't listen to the critics on this one, they are asleep.",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","Story 0/5
Acting 0/5
Special effects 2/5
Overall:  
This is Gobots trying to be Starwars 
The story is a straightforward copy of Battle for the planets without the charm. So derivative to a level I have never witnessed.
The acting is as good as the Willow TV show! 
The special effects were passable. 
I applaud the attempt to make a new sci-fi universe, but this an example of why directors should not try to write movies or shows.   It also proves that spending the most money doesn't guarantee good quality.
I personally just didn't enjoy this, I hope you do and if you do, that's great. 
For the record, 300 is one of my favourite films, because it was basically a direct translation of the amazing work of Frank Millar.  I enjoyed the JLSC.
But this was just a big miss for me.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","59-60%‚Ä¶,Its chopped and unfinished. It would of made a good Star Wars movie. But it's good to have an alternative. It's not perfect. It has its editing flaws, and comes off with a Rogue One/Rise of Skywalker/dune vibe. It borrows from some movies, but does good with those elements. If there is a extended version I'd like to see it. Part 2 is coming soon.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 22, 2023",The movie is amazing and for all the people saying it's how it copies form other movies well anyone that heard the interviews knew that he made it to be a Star Wars film but it was too mature so he went his own way with it but he made it to be heavily inspired by Star Wars because he is. Give Star Wars nerd . Every movie I see now borrow heavily from another so I'm not understanding why everyone is bothered‚Ä¶..wait that's wrong I do know why rotten tomatoes a company bought and paid for by Disney and a site that has been proven over and over again to be completely fake and fraudulent would have a problem and I know why the critics who on here who are bought and paid for by Disney + and Amazon would have a problem with it sand if you have half a brain and keep up with what's going on around you then you will understand as well.

"Dec 22, 2023","I was so excited to see what the end of all star wars was going to be...seeing that Star Wars is my all time favorite franchises. That being said, I can understand why George Lucas rejected this. I don't know what was worse, the gratuitous ""hero"" shots all over the movie, felt like Zach stroking his own ego at every corner, or the horrible dialog and acting. I can't blame the actors for that, I blame the director for giving them the wrong direction. The music was unnecessarily ""epic"" on every kinda hero shot moment. It was queue the hero music..she's going to sneeze...!! So, Star Wars franchise killer I think not...lol BTW this was my very first ever movie review. How did I do? ;P",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","This was hands down one of the worst movies i've ever seen. Not only was it derivative but it was borderline plagiarism of some of the most beloved Sci-Fi classics as well as some other beloved media such as the Magnificent Seven. The movie boasts good visuals, and thats where the positives end. It is pretentious, poorly written and even worse acted. Even it being in the Star Wars universe (as it was originally intended) would not have saved this slop from being a blatant creatively bankrupt laughingstock of the sci-fi fantasy ""space opera"" genre. Please for the love of god, if this movie interests you, go watch Dune part 1 instead, as it boasts similar visuals without the brain rot attached.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","First off, I'm going to start by saying when professional critics rate a movie bad, majority of the time I can almost guarantee I will like it. 
Critics seem to be paid for fake reviews. 
I myself enjoyed this movie as I do for the majority of Zack's content, this kept me intrigued and invested from start to finish, beautiful visuals and good character development. 

But most of all watch and make up your own mind",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","A collection of pretty schlock. The film lacks any depth of character or the slightest homage to the hero's quest. There are better written video game stories, otherwise I would say it might work as video game. The two most sympathetic and interesting characters were left in the first act (a water girl and a droid - both would have made better protagonists than the shallow archetypes in the story). It could have been better with even an amateur writer at the helm. Story first, not spectacle. Disappointing.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 22, 2023","Irrelevant characters forming a team to fight for an irrelevant cause.
The story feels like a boring side quest in any RPG out there: (help these farmers to defend themselves against the evil).
Only the protagonist gets a little backstory. Everyone else just pops up on the screen and one cut later they are suddenly part of the squad.

Dialogues are bad. Over usage of slow mo. Most Charakters feel fake.

I don't even want to watch the 2nd part because it's so boring.",NEGATIVE

The film presents certain elements that echo familiar themes from other sci-fi classics, a nod perhaps to its unique developmental history. This aspect, far from being a drawback, adds to its charm. The journey was so immersive that I found myself feeling a tinge of sadness as it concluded. Anticipation is already building for the next instalment in this captivating series.",POSITIVE

"Dec 22, 2023",Soooo let's start one they aren't space Nazis they are just Nazis in space. The CGI starts out great first world looks awesome. But in my opinion the visuals fade very quickly after leaving. The ssssssssssssssslllllllooooooooooowwwwwwwwwww mmmmmmmooooooooo is everywhere they are farming in slow mo. Slow mo doesn't make things more important or better. Now my second huge gripe is the constant fucking exposition dumps Jesus they are nearly constant 1-2 in every arc. You can show or tell ZS does both bold move but you can't do it 9 times. Now great plot idea to build a team but for me the team is too big smaller team would help us care more about the charters so when things happen we can really feel the outcomes. Also let's talk about the leading lady looks great but I have trouble really connecting to her she feels very forced and I think maybe the directors cut can bridge this gap but why release it. The visuals are great I suggest watching it in theaters or make it as cinematic as possible. Think felt more like a what you missed catch up to a tv series very episodic continuity was an issue for me. Which brings me to pacing which wasn't very good. Maybe the directors cut can save it and really make it resonate with me for now I want to give it a 5.7/10 for the fact it's a new IP for ZS I will say a 6.2/10,NEGATIVE

"Dec 22, 2023","Rebel Moon is so desperate to be epic that it constantly trips itself up by not giving you a reason to care. Monologues with drama club level dialogue are thrown around without giving you a single reason to care about the characters. It's a masterclass in the worst kind of story telling which is ""a thing happens, then another thing happens, then another thing happens"" and all the while I just don't care about any of it because I haven't been given a reason to. Some of the actions scenes are decent but slow-mo is overused. CGI is decent but uninspired. If you have anything else to watch give it a go before you watch this absolute clunker.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 22, 2023","A pretentious piece of garbage‚Äîtwo hours of boredom in slow motion. The dialogue and the plot diverge right at the beginning of the movie, and they do not converge again until the credits. The only thing that is marginally good is the photography (at times).

"Dec 22, 2023",I was looking forward to seeing this movie and the biggest disappointment is that I have to wait 3 months to see the end.  I'm surprised at the critics reviews but I believe it's because they have to see wait 3 months to see the ending as well.  Such a long wait is silly in my opinion and makes me uninterested in seeing how it ends.,NEUTRAL
"Dec 22, 2023","I really enjoyed this. I was grabbed straight away by the fantasy elements thrown into a sci fi world. As a fan of Zack Snyders normally, and a fan of sci fi, and fantasy, it just came together with a fantastic combination of things I enjoy. 

I understand some of the ""these characters needed more development"" criticism; a lot went on and some of them in particular, their motivations were unclear, things that I'm sure the longer cut later will clear up but issues none the less. It didn't hinder my enjoyment, just some I'd have liked to see more of. 

The world building was really great and seeing this play out as the first half of a larger story; giving a little context and purposefully leaving out some elements that are due to play forward next film was interesting.

While it could have served from developing some of the characters stronger, I loved the world we saw and am so excited to see it all expand",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","This movie is an unapologetic love letter to every sci fi movie, book, and idea that came before it.
It is spectacularly beautiful, incredibly fun, and absolutely worth checking out.
As a reference point I thought Sucker Punch was unwatchable it was so bad, but I loved Watchmen (even though they changed the ending) and 300. 
I believe (as I am 54 years old) the only Star Wars movies were episodes IV and V and Rogue One, and the only worthwhile series has been Andor.
If you're like minded you'll love Rebel Moon.

The Movie is GOOD Y'aLL and worth the watch and I believe that when the RATED-R come out{whenever the heck that would be) it will be even much better.üòâ",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023",My only criticism is that you can tell a lot was held back to make the pg13. Should've just gone full on with the R rating.,POSITIVE

"Dec 22, 2023","I have never left a review on a movie but this ‚Ä¶ smdh battlefield earth vibes ‚Ä¶ and I won't even address the audio level issues.

 The music is loud and effects are loud. Dialogue is low because it's pretty pointless in listening to the acting or story.

"Dec 22, 2023","The 1st 20 or so minutes I was picking apart all the self inflicted wounds and paint by numbers BS... but then my brain shut off and I started having fun. It's very Rogue one, Riddick, Oceans 11 and D&D (Honor...thieves) in a blender. ... If your Older it's New Hope, Excalibur, Krull, , Sword and the Sorcerer, and Gloria in a blender or something like that... you get the point.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 22, 2023","The movie is incredible. So glad it didn't get picked up by Disney. Critics were bagging on it before anyone got to see it. The fact that the audience score is so much higher now that it's been released for wider viewing proves that critics should be ignored. Great visuals, strong characters, underdog story; derivative, yes, but so is everything. Glad to have some world building without it being tied to another existing franchise. We need more of this rather than perpetual spinoffs to play on nostalgia.",POSITIVE

What I've just watched is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever seen. At no point in its rambling, incoherent story was it even close to anything that could be considered a rational story line. Everyone who watched it is now dumber for having viewed it.

"Dec 22, 2023","A movie for fiction lovers.
Those who don't like fiction in its purest essence will say that they didn't like it, that they thought it was so-so, among other lame reasons. If you're reading this, don't draw conclusions from these poor people. The movie is excellent in every respect, with excellent special effects, an interesting story about an overwhelming and savage force over people incapable of defending themselves and which will have much more to come in part 2, excellent setting, among others. For lovers of star wars, star trek, lord of the rings and fans of themes involving authoritarianism, you'll give this movie a 10, for those who love fiction, you'll give it something close to that. The movie is excellent and I recommend you draw your own conclusions from it.

"Dec 22, 2023","While I'll always be thankful for Watchmen, this just came off as pretentious. I don't think that there was a single scene where I didn't say, ""Oh, I've seen that before. But the original film did it better."" Whether it was Star Wars, Riddick, Seven Samurai, Magnificent Seven and even Battle Beyond the Stars.
Nothing to see here - Move along, move along...",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","The movie is not convincing because it has issues with screenwriting and acting. Regarding screenwriting, the movie is flat without suspense. It is boring. And the actors do not have charisma. It is impossible to believe the characters they are bad actors. If we talk about clothing characters, they are cheap without creativity. To use good visual effects sometimes is not enough. This bad film looks like Solo and Rouge One. The producer should ask why the Star Wars series are better.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 22, 2023","It's not original. It's not Star Wars or any in its genre. Who really cares? Why do critics always feel the need to compare? In a predicament where it's reviewed solely on its own existence it's entertaining. None of these critics have a creative bone in their body other than pull others hard work to pieces. Enjoyable movie for me, no comparisons.",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","I really enjoyed Rebel Moon: Part One. It's visually stunning, the effects are great, and the fighting just as I like it. As many said, it's a variation of Seven Samurai story (Magnificent Seven, The Dirty Dozen‚Ä¶) in space and as a lifelong science fiction fan, this was right in my alley. I know it started as a Star Wars spinoff idea, but I felt it was more Farscape and Firefly on steroids. Just something I needed. Can't wait for Part Two.",POSITIVE

"Dec 22, 2023","This visually stunning sci-fi epic is amazing! Better than most of what Hollywoods 200 mil + movies had offered us lately. It's so impressive how wrong the critics were. A movie for you and your girl/partner will enjoy on a Friday night with food! It automatically hooks you in to the story the bad guys were great antagonist! The main character Kora was bad ass in such a believable way no Mary sue who isn't afraid of being sexy and powerful. But this movie will leave you wanting MORE! your gonna want more character backgrounds, more worlds to visit,  more aliens to see, more fights and when the 3hr DIRECTORS CUT comes out we will have more! I cannot withhold my anticipation for part 2 in April. A great watch!",POSITIVE

"Dec 22, 2023","I really don't understand how this goes through an multiple takes, editing, review process and no goes hey. This battle destroyer that is in combat, flies through space dealing with micro meteors has glass that a spear can get through. Like what... 

Or that hey the Kings is dead, but later show they can re-incarnate with memories. The trop of people dyeing and then coming back two seconds later it getting really old.

They make a big deal about getting General Titus, and how scary it will be but was 30 seconds of dialog and then like ok I will come with you. They focus more on that gryphon rifder then the General who they were foreshadowing would be a hard sell. If you going to have your characters talk about how scary he is maybe he should be the main focus of the side characters you are picking up.

Story dull, Zack synder 300 action style getting old. I really think he needs better writers around him and editors that can rain him in. Overall this was a dud for me. I don'te ven care about part 2",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","If you are doing something else, this will cover 2 hours and 15 minutes... As a movie to sit and watch, don't. It was like a fever dream of disparate tropes. It was as though the writers peeled apart Star Wars, Foundation series, Chronicles of Riddick, Anime, and half a dozen other sci-fi/fantasy titles and put it in front of great imagery. I felt nothing for the characters throughout despite liking some of the actors based on other work and the story lacked depth. The flashbacks helped with the story building, but they were inserted poorly overall. This could have been better but it would have started with the writing.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","For what is was it was really good. You can see where the context of scenes are left out because it is the PG-13 version. Extremely anticipating R-rated 3 hour movie! I can tell already from this viewing it's going to be INSANE! I got what i needed out of it, but didn't get what i wanted.. Admiral Noble is BRUTAL and Kai was fantastic! Those two were my favs! Kora and Jimmy where solid.. I really wanted more from Nemesis but i should get that from R-rated version. ALL & ALL solid movie don't believe these haters.

I made it to ACT 2. Couldn't get past that.

Visually cool.

I wanted to love it.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 22, 2023","From the press I had seen I was really excited to watch this . A dark Star Wars , Andor extra was the impression I had .
It was awful , I was embarrassed I had recommended it to my family , the first left after about 20 minutes .
It's drivel.
Magnificent 7 with absolutely no character establishment , obscene over use over slow mo for fight scenes, everything was pedestrian and predictable . By the end we were as a family predicting every next move of the ( and I use the term lightly ) plot. 
Nearly everything was stolen from other films , and then done badly . Magnificent 7, lord of the rings , Star Wars , terminator, chappy , the list goes on and on .
Even a wish Arthur Shelby to boot !! 
Black Adam had a better written and more believable script and with deeper characters too . 
 I suspect part 2 is already past the point of no return but there is absolutely no chance there is going to be a part 3. 
Directors cut ? Yeah he should be , from all future productions .",NEGATIVE

"Dec 22, 2023","I went into this, hopeful for an epic Sci-Fi experience. The character development was shallow and was overridden by the action sequences. It lacked depth for a world built with huge potential. I can't even say that archetypes were used successfully.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","Can confirm, the Rebel Moon IS made of cheese.  I wanted to like it, just like the film WANTED to have gravitas... we both failed.

"Dec 22, 2023","I admittedly only got through 3/4 of the movie an fell asleep.  I was surprised that the visuals in this weren't better considering that's what the director is known for.  It is really slow, I mean really slow (maybe the slow motion made that more apparent)  With Star Wars being iffy with their movies lately, I thought there might be a window for this, but even at their worst they are much better.  It feels like the $1 store knock off.  Some directors need someone reeling them in a bit, this is a prime example.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","Visuals, audio, actoring are really good. Plot is one of the worst clusterfucks of bad writting I have ever experienced. Don't be fooled by okayish intro. It only gets worse",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","Due to the audacious marketing that this was the NEXT Star Wars, It was automatically held up on a high pedestal. That's something that you need to allow your audience to proclaim, not your lackey marketing goblins. It took me awhile to separate myself from that and just look at it as it was. 

It was fine. It was certainly visual and it had some genre panache. At times, it felt like they threw every successful scifi franchise in an AI blender and said cook. The characters were interesting enough. I just hardly know much about any of them outside of Kora. There wasn't much character development. Sure, each of this Sci- fi fellowship can handle their own but that's not who they are to their core. When big things start happening in the story, I just shrugged. They are still strangers to me and the danger is very low stakes. All very frustrating as we have the capacity for deep story telling with the glimmer of mythology from the Princess Issa story. That's basically as deep as it gets. 

The third act definitely felt rushed and very sudden. Not in a fun a-ha, gotcha, way. Kinda like they were assessing that they needed to end and decided to end. By doing so, they put in a beat where they killed the weight of some of the important setup by the narrator at the beginning. Jist cast it aside with no consequences. Overall making the payoff a bit hollow. 

Here's hoping Pt. 2 paves the way more thoughtfully. 

All a shame.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 22, 2023","It was pitched as a star wars film and you can see that literally taking many things from it with little difference including scenes.

The characters are very one dimensional with little reason to like any of them and there are far too many, for what is a 2 part film duo I struggle to think part 2 will get you invested in any of them 

Each character is quickly glossed over and makes it feel like how the star wars sequel trilogy felt in terms of character development, non existent. Any background of the main character of which I do not even know her name is told in the form of her talking over a flashback instead of showing these events really unfold.

Slow motion is beyond egregious, sure it looks pretty but it's over used so much it makes the scenes where it's used well less impactful because I'm seeing it constantly.

It is just another mediocre film that feels like a really bad star wars rip off sadly

The villain guy is slightly compelling and I'm more interested in his story tbh

I don't think a part 2 will save the shallowness of this film.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","I could not get into It visually was stunning, but the storyline just lacked. holes in the plot and not enough background on the 
characters... very ·∏çisapointed",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023",Friggin awesome. If you like badass fight and action scenes in a much darker more grim Star Wars world then you'll love this movie. Do not let the rotten tomatoes review stop you from watching this movie. Baffles me a movie this entertaining can get such a bad review here. Very cool to see another interpretation of the Star Wars world not through the eyes of Disney.,POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","The world building was stellar and so was the visuals as well, although some of the acting and writing was subpar most of it worked fluidly I do recommend.",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","It's a promising universe. We want to see more and continue on this world. The film is a classic Snider movie with characters that play really well and, of course, beautiful Snider-style visuals.",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","Awful film, slow motion scenes every 30 seconds some shocking acting had to turn it off before Charlie hunnam came into the movie because I'd hate to see such a good actor be apart of that shambles truly awful film and directing, story was slow and boring.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023",Why such bad reviews? This was fun,POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023",I enjoyed it. It did feel like two films were compressed into one 2 hour film unfortunately. Looking forward to the second film.,NEUTRAL
"Dec 22, 2023",Really enjoyed it. Like what they did with the Han Solo character. Looking forward to the extended cut as more character development definitely needed.,POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","Rebel Moon Part One was a bit of a letdown for me. I had heard that this was originally a pitch for a Star Wars movie, but I went in with certain expectations. I was imagining a slightly grittier version of Star Wars, and instead, it was a mashup of stereotypical Sci-Fi tropes and far too much slow-motion action. 

The theming of the movie was all over the place as well. It appeared that they were trying to go with a sort of Roman-inspired theming for the main antagonists, however, it was done in a way that felt very much like several other large Sci-Fi franchises. There were also themes of Westerns and samurai/ninja theming in there as well and they didn't find a way to blend them successfully in my opinion. On the same planet, there was also a village that was of a northern European style akin to Viking culture, and they rode their animals a day ride to a town and it was essentially a futuristic mashup of a Wild West town. No two places seemed to be connected in this universe with everything having such vastly different design languages.

Aside from the failed theming of the film, I had some serious issues with pacing as well. When the protagonists were traveling, there was no time between their previous encounters and the new. They would be on the ground about to leave and then immediately in another area about to meet with the person they were looking for. There was no buildup in meeting any of the individuals they were looking for, and there was no real reason that they were making any of the stops in the first place. It wasn't revealed until nearly the end of the film why they had been picking up particular individuals, and the 'twist' in the story was seen for a long time coming. Again with the timing being so odd, nearly all of the action in this is of the Slow-Motion variety. While I don't have anything against that in itself, when you watch the same people moving very slowly for about 5 minutes in what could have been a 30-second encounter, you start to get a bit bored.

I also have some issues with the story itself, however I won't spoil that here. I'll just say that the only characters that I was truly invested in either died after being on screen for a few minutes or had a very minor role in the film. I wasn't able to find a good connection to any of the main cast as all of their characters were truly unlikable except for the farmer. Every other main character had some element to them that made them feel as though they could be disposable and that I wouldn't mind if they died in the film.

The story of Rebel Moon was a bit too much thrown in your face. The audience wasn't allowed to 'see' the story unfold as there was far too much of the story that was 'told'. A common theme in great films is to make the story 'seen, not told.' Rebel Moon failed miserably at that. 

One area that this film shines through is its effects. I thought that they looked quite good. There is a robot character that shows up quite early in the film, and it looks fantastic. It's not all good though, as many of the aliens in the film look like they took a person and altered them slightly. None of them apart from one in my opinion look rather good. They seem to be just costumed people with rubber faces. There were no unique alien ideas, again aside from one that used another person to talk for them.

Overall, if you are interested in cheesy Sci-Fi and don't mind a half-baked story then go ahead and watch this. If however you don't like the over-troped Sci-Fi and slow-motion messes, stay away it's not for you.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023",Generally I was Entertained and plan to watch Part 2 but there some parts that did not feel right. For example some dialogues felt a bit weird also it might would have helped starting this first part with a smaller main cast to flesh out characters a bit more.,NEUTRAL
"Dec 22, 2023",I wasn't too sure if I wanted to take a chance on this film...luckily I trust myself and decided to judge it by myself. The story was not what I expected..it was much better. The characters were all fantastic. The acting was really well done. The message of the story was truly inspiring. Judge the movie yourself. I am sooo looking forward to part 2 and see what happens to these amazing people. THANK YOU for entertaining me for the second or this time this entire year.,POSITIVE

"Dec 22, 2023","A bunch of stock characters gather to defeat bunch of cardboard cuts outs in order to protect a village. I've seen this movie before and I liked it better when it was called the Seven Samurai, The Magnificent Seven or Bug's Life. If there were less slow motion we might be able to squeeze in some character development, but I guess we get to wait until the three + hour director's cut is released to get any of that.",NEGATIVE

CGI was awesome apart from some scene where it felt it could be better. the character building of main character girl Kora is amazing. loved it. but other characters where short on their build up. about the team they all teamed up so quickly, i thought it would take a bit more convincing to recruit them. and their aims are so bad .they are top notch fighters arnt they. 
overall, these are just some things which i dont say are bad but could have been better to have. loved this movie, hyped to the build up. This universe is going to be epic.

"Dec 22, 2023","Bland, pointless, benign, boring, forgettable. All words that explain this movie. I respect the attempt but it ended with a jumbled mess of one liners and attempts at creating a deeper plot but missing completely. Nothing about this was unique. Multiple actors that I really enjoy and I am sad that they weren't brought to their full potential with this syfy leftover mess.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","Everything about the movie is paper thin, and it is so self-serious that it's hard to take seriously. With the non-stop slow motion and choral chanting, it wants so badly to be epic but doesn't lay the groundwork needed to feel like any of it is deserved.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 22, 2023","An action-packed, lore-rich sci-fi universe that seems both believable and real. The action scenes are highly detailed and entertaining.

"Dec 22, 2023","Well done movie. Good action, great characters, great writing. Loved it can't wait till part 2! Better than the last 6 star wars movies!",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","Honestly, I tried to come into this movie with excitement and was quickly let down. I don't get how various other reviews call this movie ""epic"" of all things cause while the movie looks pretty gorgeous, the writing and acting are absolutely atrocious. While there are a lot of elements borrowed from other sci fi films, rebel moon falls flat on its face with confusing writing and to be frank it failed to keep my attention just 35-45 minutes in. The main character is poorly written as well. I might try to give this movie another chance in the near future but for now this just ain't it.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023",Movie is solid for story and character building of a saga. Not the most creative movie but it is very well made. The cast is interesting with some bright spots and some actors clearly picked based on what they look like and not how they can portray a character(mostly the oiled up weird one).,NEUTRAL
"Dec 22, 2023",Filme muito bom n√£o vi nada que atrapalha para uma segunda parte um filme que faz vc roe as unhas gostei bastante desse filme. Parab√©ns para o diretor e os roteiristas,POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023",This is what Zak Schnider dows best,POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","Esta pelicula es justo lo que esperaba, es un espect√°culo visual, tiene mucha acci√≥n y cada minuto estas esperando ver mas y mas, el principio siento que es algo apresurado pero esto no es malo, prefiero eso a que dure una hora de introducci√≥n como otras peliculas, Zack no me fallo aqu√≠!",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","This movie is your basic rehashing of the Kurosawa movie ""seven Samurai"", but they replaced the character development with a  half explained universe of intergalactic conquest, slow motion shots straight out of 300, and fairly good use of CG that plays off of Star Wars archetypes. 

I give the actors a a lot of credit for doing so well considering the actors didn't get any help from the AI constructed drivel that they called a script. The acting and eye candy visuals are the sole reason to watch this movie.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023",Solid characters and story.   Enough of a back story to lay the ground work to be engaged but definitely wanting more.  Good start to the franchise.,POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","The film is exceptional.  Everything is there: the scenario, the soundtrack, the actors, the sound and the image, despite some slightly botched inlays.  I advise you to see it, and can't wait for the sequel.",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023",It was MEH!!!! Didn't hate it but didn't love it. No real action. The only real action was hero shots where the frame the heroine doing something but no real substance or lead up to the action. Movie was so predictable. Story felt like a watered down version of magnificent seven. I love all the actors and actresses but they can only do so much with bad direction and a shitty script.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023",Critics suck at judging movies this was a damn good one actually anticipating the second yet it is so bittersweet because you can see if Zack actually got star wars(even then it's truly now overrated the story isn't great and it's never been good other than visually being real about it) it would have been badass and great storytelling is great but I can say it's hard to watch without thinking damn we could have gotten a decent star wars trilogy outta this guy.,POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","The movie is great, the story is good, visuals are fines. Yes it looks like something we've seen before but does not ? I found here everything i loved from all the movies i liked before. Watch it without thinking about press critics.",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","So lame. Visually striking at times but it's obvious the creator just took his favorite scenes from Star Wars, LotR and some action movies and smashed them together. Tons of poor attempts at deep dramatic moments all smashed together make the movie feel shallow and weak. You can't take every deep moment from ypur favorite movies and string them all together one after the other and expect it to land as if it had a whole movies worth if buildup. Don't waste your time watching this, literally write your own star wars fan fic and it will be more entertaining.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","I had so much fun, great cast and character design, great action. And beware of the - King‚Äôs Gaze! Surprisingly, it was more emotional than I expected. ",POSITIVE

"Dec 22, 2023",The only redeeming quality of this movie is the stunning visual effects. Everything else's is trash.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","Hitch-hikers Guide to the Galaxy mixed with Total Recall (the Arnie version) vibes. Would've been an awesome 90's movie. They really needed to make ol mate put a shirt on too, I am pretty sure its cold in space. Didn't connect with any of the characters, as they didn't give us a chance or a reason to. Wanted to see more of the robot though but he literally just runs off right when it got interesting for 30 seconds. Story is muddled and is just the same old David vs Goliath trope that has been done to death especially in these space ""opera's"". Putting some lack luster actions scenes in slow mo didnt make them cool. That worked great in 300, but this was meant to be an epic space battle and it really wasnt. It needed so much more. All hype and zero substance. If it was a Star Wars saga you'd buy in for the nostalgia and familiarity but, on its own, offers little to nothing to make you want to go back for more. If your short on time just watch the previews, you get the entire story and the best bits of the action, literally. I'll still watch part 2, probably, for some closure and hope of redemption. However, it doesnt even end with a cliffhanger or hook to entice you back. Bitterly dissapointed because I wanted it to be as good as the promo team made it out to be.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","If you want to see a better movie, just watch magnificent seven or battle beyond the stars because there's not in the original idea in this movie. And all the battle scenes are in slow motion which result in terrible action sequences",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","I expected ""average"" for this movie since action flick stories have been generic and recycled a lot. While Rebel Moon isn't unique at all in terms of story-telling. It delivered a lot of curious moments and particularly great twists at the end.

Being invested on the characters of this band of misfits, I was totally surprised to find and learned some exciting little details on the backstory of every member of the group that the female main protagonist had gathered.

It seems, this movie is cooking up some appetizing world-building adventure in the future and I feel its promise. I want more. 

As for this first part, I love it. It has some flaws, but for the sake of story-telling and all its gripping moments, it was well worth my time and interest.

Looking forward to the second part.",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","Visually stunning. Not to mention entertaining as hell. Sci Fi tropes aren't bad if used correctly. Critics seemed to have missed this point, either on purpose or by lack of competence.",POSITIVE

"Dec 22, 2023","Great Visuals, couple forgettable characters, unfortunately not to memorable. Hopeful the director's cut/ part 2 is better",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","The movie had awesome visuals and cinematography. I think the purpose of this movie was to set up the universe and it did it well. However, it missed many opportunities to develop some cool characters. It was set in space, it had action, it had a nice vibe. I'm all in.",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","Fun movie to watch.  Wonderful cinematography, kinda a mix of Warhammer and Star Wars. Good plot with a few nice twists.  For me, this is an easy 5, just an entertaining, exciting, visually ""eye candy"" sci-fi story. Fun stuff.  I was entertained!

Note: If you don't like sci-fi/adventure type movies or lean too hard into this movie, you will end up agreeing with the Critics Score.",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023",Fantastic. Worth the watch. Can't wait for Pt 2.,POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023",A very interesting approach at merging multiple sci-fi movies into one. However the transitions are very awkward and gives off a very sky pirate vibe. I would have appreciated less of those slow motion takes that happen every 5 minutes in the movie. Could have helped save that time and used it towards delivering a more fulfilling ending vs. a rushed one.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","I would say it's a shot-by-shot rip-off of Star Wars, but it's missing any of the heart or humanity of Star Wars. Just exposition and battle scenes.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","Absolutely terrible. I waited for this movie because I thought the trailers and special effects looked great but it turned out to be just complete trash. The story is boring and so simple it could have been written by a child, the acting is cringey and breaking it into 2 parts makes it even worse because it makes no sense. What a disappointment, I still cant believe it has such a high fan review. Please make better SCIFI in the future because this movie kills the SCIFI industry. ITS NOT THE INDUSTRY ITS JUST THIS MOVIE THAT SUCKS MAKE MORE SCIFI!!",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","Visually not awful... but that is probably one of the only reasons why I pushed through and finished this movie. This movie was bad, they tried so hard to be iconic... but nothing about this movie was iconic. Acting was meh, dialog was meh, story was extra meh! I hope they decide not to make the other 2 after this...",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","""Rebel Moon"" dazzles with its striking visuals, offering a feast for the eyes that elevates the entire cinematic experience. The film's storyline, while rooted in a promising concept, unfortunately treads a path too familiar, leading to a sense of predictability that slightly diminishes its overall impact. Despite this, the movie's strong visual elements and engaging premise make it a worthwhile watch for fans of the genre.",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","Bad script, B tier acting and retelling the Seven Samurai in Star Wars universe with Warhammer 40k costume.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","Okay, it's a cyber-punk, visually exhausting version of Star Wars in which Avatar Korra has to defend a farming village, and to do so she gathers together a gang made up of charmless Han Solo, hippogriff-taming Native American Anakin Skywaler, the emo version of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Shazan's wizard. Anyone else? Oh yes, Xander Harris from Buffy. But anyway, you can pass the time.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","I made an account just to say that am in minute 61 and it is bad, it is really, really bad.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","Bad rehash of ""The Magnificent 7"" but worse than ""Battle Beyond The Stars."" Half the lines I have heard in other movies. The plot is so predictable you can guess who killed  the king  before 1/2 the movie is over. and I am sure they will not ""reveal"" that till   half way  through part 2.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","Honestly a lot like the first star wars movies, but with a better story an graphics ,  can't wait for part 2,  the movie start to finish is a lot of fun, action packed an they build the characters very well,  I think a lot of their back story's will come out in part 2,  but what you get on them in part 1 is enough to like an keep the pace going !",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","Watched it the family and it is good! I don't really know why it gets a lot of hate, but me and my family enjoyed it! Can't wait to see part 2!",POSITIVE

"Dec 22, 2023","Great, the special effects are on point, also, the story is interesting.",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023",It is a great movie. Story is great and so are the effects. I do wish though that we had the directors cut instead of the shorter theater cut so we have more of the story,POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","The visuals were good, but not amazing, and that for me was the only good thing about this movie. The plot is stale, the pacing terrible, the caracther work abysmal, the few plotwist badly managed or easily predictable. Leaves you with lots of loose ends that can't be justified just by the movie being a part 1. Would not recommend",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","Visually it is great, however that doesn't save it from the poor dialogue and script. Great actors for the most part, but the dialogue felt clunky throughout. Borrows from various different sci-fi genres but ultimately does not seem to be able to establish its own identify or make me care about any of the characters or the overall world setting.
Predicatble and",NEGATIVE

"Dec 22, 2023","This Ridiculous fan fiction based on Star Wars. Is a complete waste of time and ridiculous fantasy of Zach Schneider.There is no coherent plot.  And we don't follow any specific character for any length of time. And he just interjects a bunch of characters and droids and beings from other franchises such as droid's orcs, and even buckbeak from harry potter. I cannot tell if this is supposed to be serious. It is the worst thing I have ever had to watch and I can't believe I made it through to the end. Nothing about this is original interesting. Good and dit is just copyright infringement and mimicry in the most poor form. I have ever seen in my entire f****** life.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023",Basically a sci fi version of Seven Samurai and The Magnificent Seven. I know this is part one of two but I feel Rebel Moon would've worked much better as a series rather than a two part movie. A Child of Fire felt so rushed IMO. Characters weren't fleshed out enough and there was way too much exposition that I felt would've worked better in a series. But that's just me. The visuals are fun to watch but honestly that's about it. I'll be curious how I feel after I watch The Scargiver.,NEUTRAL
"Dec 22, 2023","The movie felt like it missed huge plot developments,  it felt rushed at the wrong point.  Visually well done.  Editing felt like they made it so they could release a director cut next year.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","Cringe characters.  Opening scene with Saturn like planet ""painted"" onto a backdrop.  Not sure if even the visuals were up to par on this one.  It felt low budget - but probably cost a fortune to make.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","The first 15 minutes are fine. The rest of the movie never really earns the scenes it tries to pull off. Too much happens too fast, and the pacing quickly becomes a disjointed rush, and it puts a lot on the viewers to bridge the gaps. All things considered, this probably should have been a 4 parter. It's enough to want what the vision for the film was, and despite its short comings I am still looking forward to part 2.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 22, 2023","This website is terrible. People need to stop using it as a source to see if something is good or not.

This film on the other hand is rather bloody good. I honestly don't really have many complaints, only the main one is that it shied away from the blood too much. It's a 15, why did it do this?",POSITIVE

"Dec 22, 2023","This move is excellent! Too bad that ""This was supposed to be part of Star Wars"" narrative is out there since does only damage by Star Wars fans. Visuals here are epic. Even better than any of the recent Star Wars movies. Editing could have been done better, but as far as I understand this cut is missing huge chunk of the movie. It must be accounted for that when watching it. Can't wait for director's cut!",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023",Great fkn movie!! Great story line!! Visually stunning!!,POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023",Beautiful and stunning imagery as usual! It's an introduction story so I wasn't expecting them to just dive right in but the way it was told was brilliant. Each character their own arc I really enjoyed. Will rewatch many times.,POSITIVE

"Dec 22, 2023","If you're here to watch an original, new franchise set in space then don't bother watching. The vast majority of this movie's world-building is almost one-to-one plagiarism of Dune",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","As always with Zack Snyder's films, Rebel Moon is visually stunning with great action-packed scenes and music. 

The only negative thing I could find with the film was the 2nd Act. You can definitely tell there was many scenes cut from it. There will be a director cut later on that I'm sure will fix this problem. Cutting these scenes made seem like what was a great story to a straightforward story.",POSITIVE

"Dec 22, 2023","Well, add ""Rebel Moon"" to the LONG list of disappointing movies of the 2020's.
I have no idea why it wasn't billed as what it is. It is 100% ""Battle Beyond the Stars""... or ""7 samurai in space"". 
It suffers from TME ( Too much exposition), while at the same time snipping interesting stories immediately. 
The costume design ranges from amazing, to as bad as ""Farscape"" and despite the wonderful cast, manages to delivery lame ass dialogue.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023",Looked great. Actings good enough. Story is okay. The movie was so very dull. Just one big intro for the second movie I'd guess which is a shame because I won't tune in for it,NEGATIVE

"Dec 22, 2023","Artistic, Engaging and entertaining. I like the concept for the world they are building and it is a solid foundation.

"Dec 22, 2023","Zack had me from the opening credits! Yes, finally, a proper science fiction movie. It's been so long. Let me say this, visually this film was amazing. But it's as if Zack made Gumbo from several films of the past but he never learned how to make a roux. There is not enough flavor to this film. Not enough soul. It's very hard to stay interested. It took me four times to be able to finish the film. Visually a delight, but overall another disappointment.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 22, 2023","Rebel moon is a blend of Warhammer 40k imperials and the Magnificent seven (the Chris Pratt one). The design is great, and so are the visuals. The story and motivations though, is a mess. After 2 hours and 14 minutes, nothing has been accomplished and we are pretty much back where the movie started. 

If you want to enjoy this, try not to think to hard about anything. Otherwise you will probably turn it off after less than 20 minutes. 

Still hoping the second part can save this world, but my hopes are low.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 22, 2023",Decent but the editing felt as if they have completely skipped important plot details.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","Completely raw thoughts as I watch. Premise is 7 Samurai + Dune / Star Wars. The village and villagers are as naive and ignorant as the ones in 7 Samurai. The Motherworld army / space nazis (actually more like space soviets) are ruthless as the Empire's / First Order's troopers. Replace the protagonists of Star Wars with 7 Samurai, replace 1/2 the plot of Star Wars with 7 Samurai (Instead of a death star and farm boy becoming a jedi, it's farmers and ""outcasts"" vs space warmongers. Ngl i also see some references to like Clash of the Titans, when Tarak (Tarzan duh; side note: dude looks like he could pull off as Tarzan) was riding the bennu similary to how Perseus was riding Pegasus. Dunno why this movie also gives me Warhammer vibes; probably the outfits and weapons. Also gives me Bungie games vibes, especially D2; from how some of the lore is presented, some of the cg scenes (kinda feels like game cutscenes or sortta like cg from Tron; but that's fair enough considering tech advances and budget), some of the movements and skills. Tbh I'm fine with slo-mo scenes in films, I feel like there were some moments where it's unecessary or a little too much. Love the twist with Kai (side note: rewatch 7 samurai if there was ever a betrayal like this). Last battle between Kora and Noble reminds me of Rogue One. The scene when all 6 of them were side-by-side was for sure a call back to ZSJL / JL ending where the 6 were together. Noble definitly got Darth Vader treatment at the end (2nd chance at life by his master) can't wait to see the threat he'll become next. Scoring is great overall. For context 7 samurai was like 3 and 1/2 hours long so this film would ofc feel incomplete without it's part 2 since the premise is pretty much 7 samurai. Overall, i'd say it was a good film. If the cut / R+ version is better when it releases I'll revisit scoring.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 22, 2023","the movie is a spectacle for sure.  There is a bit too much feeling of a montage through the middle of the movie, and it would benefit from some more development of the main cast, perhaps cutting out one or two and saving them for the sequel.

"Dec 22, 2023","Beautiful imagery and a story that makes you hunger for more! Not sure why the special ""critics"" don't like it!",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023",Amazing action sequences and the sound was incredible. Loved the artistic use of images while world building and the slow motion shots to create a sense of intensity. Also the weapons held a major upgrade of lethality over star wars blasters. The laser projectiles and sound emitted from them was fantastic.,POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","An absolute epic movie, I loved every second of it. It has everything you could ask for in a movie. Zack Snyders has brought us another masterpieceüî•üíú I am looking forward to Part 2 üíú",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","Pros - Good visuals, good fights, acting is good, music is okay.
Cons - no character buildup, bad editing, fights are very short, not a gripping story. 

But will definitely watch part 2.",POSITIVE

"Dec 22, 2023",This was a 135 minute unskippable cutscene,NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","The movie had potential. I think my main issue is the fact that the characters still fall victim to Zack's tendency of portraying people as regal, kinda mechanic, macho, rigid characters. It makes it difficult to sympathize with any, and makes the bad acting more glaring. The bad dialogues didn't help either. I think if a better writer had polished the script a bit, we might have had much better movie. All the same, I'll watch anything Zack puts out,  because his aesthetics are 2nd to none. 2.5/5",NEGATIVE

"Dec 22, 2023","Not as bad as the ""professional"" critics say. I'd say if your into sci-fi it's worth giving a chance. I'd have rated it higher but some scenes really needed a bit more dialog. Be aware the cast is heavy in the c list category.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 22, 2023","Solid action, interesting cast, believable acting and way more fun than StarWars! Would recommend.",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","This is exactly what you get if you wanted a grim dark star wars in the same vein as chronicles of riddick.
Acting and visuals are okay though it feels like half the movie is a slow motion action scene.
I had high hopes for a space opera like mass effect but this fell short. Did have a few good moments but honestly felt like someone had written a teenage fantasy novel and decided to market it as a sci-fi.
Worth a watch if you have a spare few hours but hardly stacks up to some of the other recent sci-fi movies or shows currently out there. Let's hope the second part packs more of a punch.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","Exposition, back story, orange, slow motion.
Exposition, back story, orange, slow motion.
Expo... You get the idea.

It's a decent popcorn movie to pass time, with the pace of a series. Though, maybe that's the slow motion talking...  because it's just way too over done. Every action scene is 50-60% slo-mo.

Many scenes feel like they were born from a ""wouldn't it be cool if"" conversation between college freshmen. Just didn't stick with me.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023",Kind of nice to look at but extremely boring and derivative of better sci-fi epics. Characters are cardboard and get no development. The bad guys are the same space Nazis you've seen a million times.,NEGATIVE

"Dec 22, 2023",Can't wait for the next one,POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","Rebel Moon is a terrible movie that copies from better movies and ruins them. The movie is full of Star Wars references, but they are lame and boring. It is about a girl who fights an evil empire with a laser sword, a half-vampire prince who is a rip-off of Blade, a spider queen who is a match up of Queen of the Damned and Charlotte's Web, a Nazi who is a rip-off of Schindler's List, and a robot who is a rip-off of Bicentennial Man. Not to mention the highlight was the action sequence from a rip-off Mulan meets Asajj Ventress. It  is also full of starships that look weird rip-off MCU. The movie's aesthetics and sounds are also rip-off of Dune, but they are dull and annoying. Wish I can have those 2hrs back.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 22, 2023","I love the Science Fiction and Fantasy genres and expected this to tick alot of boxes for me but boy this definitely didn't feel like a Cinematic experience.

The writing? Lazy. Characters are all two dimensional and every ""twist"" is super predictable. Dont get me wrong it has moments that have genuinely intrigued to see how they will play out in the second installment but those moments account for approximately 5 percent of the movie. Oh and some of the effects? Would have easily been at home in the early 2000's had to remind myself during one particular scene that I was not in fact watching an Anime show 

Sadly the whole film feels incredibly rushed and what could have been great became a predictable poorly written piece of mediocrity",NEGATIVE

"Dec 22, 2023",Great story building and beautiful shots. It was a bit too short though... I feel like this should have been a 5-8 episode series instead and give each character recruitment a full arc and story.,POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023",It was good but it a old school Star Wars day like late 90s Star Wars it was enjoyable this was a few scenes that was rush but some of cgi and VFX were not good but only like for 2 scenes but I give it a rating 7.3/10,NEUTRAL
"Dec 22, 2023",This felt more like watching a video game of the characters back stories . If you enjoy watching spacecrafts takeoff and land you will love this flick . And don't get me started on the overuse of random slowmotion . Oh and did I mention the strange gazing between characters it's like they are hiding a funny side joke .,NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","Its called ""part one"" and thats what it is plus some. Beautiful world building, great action scene. Well designed characters and Lore. The downside for most a believe is simply expecting to see the big climax of story but this is the build. ""Part one"" so watch it with this in mind just like Dune part one. This is the world builder. In saying that im very excited to see the R18 directors cut that will flesh the world out even more and really show the devastation of battle scenes. Its a good time.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 22, 2023","Enjoyed this film quite a bit. I really gravitated towards the main character. I thought Boutella was excellent. The film could've been much longer and delved into the other characters a bit more, but I still loved the universe, the story, the film score by junkieXL as well as the action scenes. That is really given us something to get excited about as a film series",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","I think there is a persecution of Snider, because every film he makes, critics say a lot of bad things about it, but his films are good.",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023",Some of the choreography in the action scenes was great. Sophia Boutella gets the job done. But the dialogue was cheesy and too much of the storytelling was in the form of exposition.,NEGATIVE

"Dec 22, 2023","It was kind of fresh to have a new universe to enjoy, like if you are a bit tired of the superhero genre. It was fun and some really good visuals. Alot of entertainment, wich was nice and it felt like almost to short, that fast.. 
Also nice pacing. And liked the way it evolved.",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","I love the first installment of this movie, I thought that each character brought something unique and vital in order to fully round out the crew. The universe is awesome, and I just want to know more about it!! Can't wait for part two.",POSITIVE

Visually stunning! 
From the start, had me tugging at my heart strings especially over Jimmy the robot.

Can't wait to see what's next in part two. 
Well done.",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","Utter incompetence at every level.
Writing,producing, directing, and acting. Cheap and dreary looking despite its cost. Whole scenes and characters stolen from other, better movies. Actors who seem like they would rather be anywhere else.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 22, 2023",Comparisons to Star Wars are a bit lazy. The movie is more low key and aimed at the streaming audience that will have more patience than legacy media. The story landed really well for me and reminded me more of classic video games like Homeworld than anything else. I hope they make more stories in this world.,POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","Feels like a bad star wars film. This could've been so good... but it's not. I want to love the characters, but there's no depth provided. There's also CG moments that take you out of it. They probably should've broken this into more parts so they had more time to develop the characters.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","Visually amazing and good acting across the board. Simple prototypes and a great start, escapism and engaging film. It feels unkind to judge this movie so harshly, but I'm hopeful there will be more regardless of the critic views.",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","The visuals were mostly on the amazing side (with some really bad CGI thrown in at random and lens flare for some reason) but dear lord, the plot and characters were terrible. The dialogue was just flat and unmotivated. It read like a DnD group starting an adventure without actually role-playing their character's motivations for joining. No one really resisted joining. 

There was no real connection with the side characters. We never really saw too much of their living situations or even personality from any of them so I felt no connection to anyone involved. The music was telling me to feel awed by a line delivery or a speech but the audience has no real reason to care.  It was disappointing to be TOLD things and not shown them. You want to tell me the general is a tactical genius? Okay, but he didn't do any thing to warrant that description.  Exposition dump on Kora's back-story? You tell me she's a badass and her flashbacks sometimes reflect that but she has stormtrooper aim. 

Also, we were shown the dreadnaught can fire bomb a planet from orbit. It seems supremely silly for farmers to fight it. Maybe they should have been looking for a whole fleet of pirates to take on the warhammer 40k ship.

I felt genuinely bad for Tarak though. No one thought to give him a shirt all movie. He went from desert planet to the cold of space. No shirt.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","Enjoyed very much, thank you.",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","This movie was a really fun ride! The universe feels lived in and the action scenes are cool. Yes I turned my brain off and I enjoyed a movie. Lots of loose ends, they make introduce every character as if they we're super important and don't do much with them after but there's 2 more movies and now I can't wait to watch them.",POSITIVE

What else did it ripoff...I saw a Space Battleship Yamato, a starship troops brain bug, some furiosa eye makeup, lightsabers, a droid with feelings, necromonger armor, a borg queen, a nazi officer, a nice guy who sells them out, Thanos on some astral plane.  Truely amazing, almost devoid of any orginality and not even a wink to the audience acknowledging it.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 22, 2023","It was pretty good, if a bit derivative.",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023",Very enjoyable Sci-Fi rollercoaster ride.  I am very impressed with Zack's directing skills the talented actors.,POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","this movie was pretty awesome‚Ä¶remember this is only part one, i would highly recommend to judge yourself as we live in an age today where noone is satisfied the same anymore and everyone want you to believe their opinions, and everyone wants to compare the success and bad parts of any movie to another movie they watched when they were 10. everything was better when you were 10 you were a child. Rebel Moon has Stat Wars ascetics, yes, but its not star wars and uses action scenes and tries to tell a story.. even though you might not know every characters backstories on this film remember its only part one‚Ä¶this movie has a huge cast, they do quick intro and as the movie progress we find out more about the main characters past and how she is linked to army conquering the galaxy. to give much spoilers, take everything everyone says with a grain of salt and judge it yourself, some people are quick to say Zack Synder lost his way. This movie doesnt get 5 stars in my book cuz for me the pacing is slow but it shows potential for part 2‚Ä¶again if we are comparing this to Star Wars not every Star Wars movie was mind blowing‚Ä¶. people like SW episode 5 more than episode 4 and 6.. some like the new trilogy some hate it, most despite the disney ones‚Ä¶some like it‚Ä¶and we all still think as a whole SW is amazing. Give Rebel Moon a chance and judge yourself.",POSITIVE

"Dec 22, 2023",I genuinely loved this movie. It's the Sci-Fi space opera that I have been waiting for. Definitely gives off Star Wars vibes and I love it even if the out of touch critics do not.,POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023",Rebel Moon looked great and when it took its time had great writing. The first act is paced very well and focuses on world building while the third act feels very rushed. There is a directors cut coming that will hopefully fix some of the pacing issues and add to some of the side characters. The main villian of this film was excellent in his role.,NEUTRAL
"Dec 22, 2023",Honestly I think the reviews are kind of harsh. I thought it was entertaining and I look forward to watching the 2nd one.,POSITIVE

"Dec 22, 2023",Sooo not good. Dialogue not great. Muddled character motivations. So not good.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","Visually it's like the Heavy Metal magazine come to life. Looking forward to the directors cut because this trimmed version feels half baked. Not nearly as bad as everyone is saying but also not his best work. A+ for effort and creating something ""new"" I.E. derivative of other things we've seen before but at least he's trying.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","Just boring. I think Zack is great at visual aspects but when it comes to story aspects, he sucks. Just let other writers create decent stories for hi,. WatchMen was great because the original story had been already great and Zack added visual depth to it. He cannot write. That's the obvious fact at this moment. I mean, you remember how bad the script for Batman v Superman, right?",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","I really enjoyed this part one of the Rebel Moon Saga. The critics have been way too harsh. This movie has some amazing visuals, yes it lacks a form of character building and feels a little incomplete, but it's part one and there is a director's cut that awaits. I did however really like being in this Universe and I can see the audience scoring rising much hire in the next week.  This movie reminded me of 300 in space and I really enjoyed it for that. It sure did fly by which means I was having a good time so I'm gonna give it a score that rates my experience. Give us Scargiver Please!",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","It's fun. I love Zack Snyder's movies, but I honestly expected much much more. The story felt too superficial, I couldn't connect with it. Still a fun movie.",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","2-hour character presentation, with uninteresting characters and plot that is only a prelude to the second part. With a lot of elements taken from other movies.
With good cinematography and cool special effects that still cannot save a terrible script.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023",Just finished and  I loved it. The world building was so engaging.  It gave so much context into what was happening. The characters were fully developed. This was so much more movie than the sw prequels.,POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023",Not a perfect movie but a good  start to a new franchise. I think it would have worked better as a series and had more character development. The recruiting seemed a bit rushed and unrealistic. I give it 3/5 for effort. Will certainly be watching Part 2.,NEUTRAL
"Dec 22, 2023","""Rebel Moon"" astounds with its breathtaking visuals, unveiling a mesmerizing new universe. Boasting an exceptional cast delivering stellar performances, it diverges from conventional space sagas. Its thought-provoking species and gripping storyline leave audiences eagerly anticipating the next installment.The critics are wrong. A must see!",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","I love Zack Snyder's flair and directing style. The acting is great, the cast is great, I was engrossed through out the whole movie. I love that each character has their own motive to join.",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","Perhaps the critics would prefer the Disney renditions of the Marvel Universe (which are generally not even worth watching any more), but the low ratings for this movie are nonsensical. Rebel Moon is not perfect, but it is pretty damn good and so much better than most everything in the theaters since Dune.",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","Awesome Visually, first 20 minutes were great‚Ä¶ characters weren‚Äôt developed at all. It felt like you took a 10 hour movie and cut it down to 2 1/2‚Ä¶ leaving a jumbled mess. ",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","Some cool bits. Some visual set pieces like the planets were very nice. The plot is straighter than a Roman road with any slight deviations telegraphed from miles away.

"Dec 22, 2023","This movie is .... Good.  Not great. Not perfect. But it's off to a 'good' start. I will watch Part 2.

"Dec 22, 2023","Zack Snider is like a music video director and I will explain.

He is not in the service of the story. What he does, is try to create ""cinematic moments but,,, he can't ""mix"" his attempts at continus ""cinematic moments"" in the editing room as none of them match each other in tones, colors or ambiences.
It worked great in ""300"" as he only had 1 storyline to tell, but as soon as you add a second one,, it becomes harder.    

 

If you watch a K-pop or rap music video and you have people dancing to it, most of the time, these people can't dance pretty well so, they make cuts (like in a fight scene where people can't really fight) to present them in their best light and here is where it bogs down.

The lighting for all these scenes, never has any continuity as the scene's lighting is reset to re-give the best light for the next cut of that scene. There is no shadow game to emphasize the story telling and what you are getting is a ""picture"" that moves instead of a scene.
If you look carefully at the different angles of camera happening in the same scene, you will notice that the shadows are not in the same place on the actors and the sets behind them as the scene goes on.  

Now, if you take that ""Moving picture"" and use a volume screen, green screen or CGI,, the lighting (that is already not working) is really not working in the completed scene as the entire lighting isn't matching and that give you that feeling of coldness which is now the trademark of Snider. 

 

That blue or red/orange hue that he is known for, isn't a signature skill. It's what happens when you desaturate, reduce exposure and crank the contrast up in your video editing software to hide imperfections in your footage.

Speaking of color grading in this movie, it's all over the place. You will notice that we jump from an orange hue in one scene, to a blue hue, then to a classic cinematic hue in an other without any reasons for it. 
In movie making, the use of these hues are there to emphasize the mood of a scene or a story line. It could be also used to differentiate locations but,,,,,, in this movie, the changes are done for no apparent reasons and sometimes in the same fucking scene. 

This is why besides the script and the acting, this movie is unwatchable. There is no redeeming qualities to it.

If you take other Snider movies, they all had redeeming quality. 
In 300, the script was garbage but the visuals saved the movie (Cinematic moments)
In Man of Steel, the script wasn't great but the visuals (until the final fight scene) saved the movie plus, it's fucking Superman. (Cinematic moments)
In the Watchmen, the script saved the movie as the acting was atrocious. 

Not in this movie. Nothing can save it.",NEGATIVE

""Nah, pretty sure pointless action will do as long as we make it look cool. The dialogue can be super contrived with a plot that is meh.""

""Should we a least make the action scenes somewhat believable within the sci-fi realm of our own creation?""

""Nah.""

""So we basically assume the audience is super dumb and won't care?""

""Exactly.""",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","Visually stunning, mild story pacing issues but overall made me feel like I was watching Warhammer 40K Star Wars and that was fine. All of the tech and species of aliens and cultures definitely have me hoping there's an extended universe or franchise that comes.",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","A fresh take on a group of rebels taking on the forces of an empire. Awesome visual FX, score, and sound editing. The film is a beautiful masterpiece and I can't wait to see Part Two.",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","They slow mo'd the slow mo. This was just bad. As a sci fi fanatic I wanted to enjoy this film oh so much. It was an immediate disappointment. It was then hilarious to make fun of until well, it wasn't.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","Rebel Moon cuts a critical path through an immense, lived-in universe with history and drops plenty of inside references to events, people, and places just beyond our current horizons to tantalize viewers for the future, all while delivering a cohesive narrative that is incredibly fun to watch.",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","Overall I enjoyed it.  It's rare we get new IP's in general let alone a new space epic with hints of Dune and Warhammer 40k as inspiration.  The only thing I wish was improved is character development.  We really don't have a good idea of who the ""heroes"" are.  I honestly didn't even know most of their names until the end of the film.  Looks like more character insights will come in part 2 based off the trailer.  Looking forward to it.",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","This movie is old school fun meets new school technology.  Don't listen to the critics. It's clearly a ""part one"" which should excite viewers for the second part rather than feel it is far too open-ended as some reviews suggest. The story is not the best ever written‚Ä¶ but let's not pretend some of our favorite cultural films have been the best of the best. Rebel Moon is worth your time.",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","What in the world did I just watch? This movie is soulless, cold, and utterly shallow. Am I supposed to care about any of these characters? The pacing is a mess, there's almost no meaningful character development, and the visual effects look very cheap and unfinished. I've played video games with more realistic visual effects. This movie is so obviously a cheap knock off. It's no wonder Disney passed on this.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","Critics are crazy! That movie was awesome! Style to spare, cool characters, incredible effects and design. Just flat out cool!",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","I loved this movie!  While many people are complaining and calling this a Star Wars rip off, I would have to disagree. I loved all the nods to other films and the little snippets here and there from other films such as Star Wars, Dune, Harry Potter and probably so many more. I honestly look forward to watching it again and seeing what other pieces have been so obviously loved by the writers that they put these things into this film. They have taken things that have been done before just like any other writer and film maker and spun it into something of their own while creating something new and mesmerizing. I would of liked to of seen a little more characterization and build up to the extra characters that were being recruited in the film, as I dont feel much level of attachment to them. I felt more attachment to the spider lady with her little speech about the mines and what has been done to her. I felt more
 for her than a recruited good guy. But overall I really liked this Film. A little bit of the cgi looked goofy in a few spots ,particularly a flying animal scene. But I can overlook that. I am very happy to see more SciFI/ Fantasy being made. I look forward to the next installment.",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023",Great adaptation of previous films. For sure Elements of magnificent 7 but with its own take. Part one is a great lore building for the 2nd part. Can't wait for the sequel.,POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023",Actually really good I wonder those credited reviewers what where they on ? Lol I was expecting it to be bad with their fake reviews but nope it was really good considering that it's part 1.  Compaired to some other movies  that they gave 90 to 100 this is much better ü§≠ oh yea don't forget to check those who rated it 2  stars and rated only this movie I bet those are the critics üòÇ or bots,POSITIVE

"Dec 22, 2023","Although we all know there's a r rated cut coming. The film definitely felt fast paced in the 2nd act. It felt like it was just ships landing in different worlds and recruiting people after people without getting to know them. And the lens that was used in movie did annoyed me. But these two issues didn't affect how much I enjoyed this movie! Looking forward to part 2, this movie leaves you wanting more!",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","The combat/action is really well done with the injury's looking real like nobles broken arm at the end looked amazing the barn fight scene looked great not being R is what ruined it a bit.‚Ä®The characters are great but they just don't interact very often especially when they have created the team so more in part two I hope.‚Ä®Noble was a scene stealer every time I saw him In a shot I just got exited such a good villain and the way they brought him back was cool I do have a lot of questions about that scene though.

Character Development there is non at all now I know it's only a part one but there has to be some to make the journey worth it.‚Ä®The dialogue is not very good is written very clunky and just not very good it comes of as a mouth full every time there is a interaction now I understand that he's trying to communicate a lot in one movie but that is still no excuse

Overall 
7.5/10",NEUTRAL
"Dec 22, 2023","Let's start off by saying that for a new IP it is incredible. The world building was exceptional and it kept me wanting to know more. Next comes the visuals, I cannot believe both this and the sequel cost around 166M combined. It makes me wonder where all the other high budget movies have been spending their money because they don't come nowhere near Rebel Moons quality. Action sequences are top notch as well, although it did feel like the slow Mo was used a tiny bit too liberally. The character exposition was ok just not great which is what took half a star from me. I feel like the extended version will fix a lot of the pacing and character exposition just like BvSUE did. 

Like many have said already, ignore the critics. If you are a fan of Star Wars, mass effect, just space operas in general, you owe it to yourself to give this movie a shot. You can decide if you like it or not after but at least give it a chance.",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","The movie just happens. It's not even fun bad. Go to planet,""hey come help us"", no, yes, no, ok fine I'll go, end scene, next planet.

It's bad, like bad bad. Not fun, acting is terrible, and the dialogue is just some random words thrown together.

"Dec 22, 2023","It was good, you can definitely see the bones of a star wars script, add a dash of magnificent 7 with a warhammer 40k coat of paint and overall you get a pretty good movie. Characters could have been more developed but that's my only criticism.",NEUTRAL

"Dec 22, 2023",Great start to a series. What is obvious is the visual appeal. What isn't obvious is mystery in every character and how the backstory of each changes the narrative with every detail revealed. Love it.,POSITIVE

"Dec 22, 2023",It's amazing. I love this movie,POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023",Rebel Moon Part One: A Child of Fire was gorgeous. It gave me that Grand Space Opera feel that I've been craving for a very long time. This feels like Seven Samurai and Star Wars in all the best ways and I cannot wait for Part Two: The Scargiver! I NEED the extended cut because I want to know more of this stunning new universe. This has the potential to become an absolute juggernaut of a franchise and if 'A Child of Fire' is the first step I'm with it every step of the way. My one gripe is I wish I was able to see this on the big screen. 4 out of 5 stars for me. For the Rebellion.,POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023",A Seven Samurai worthy reimagination more than a StarWars wannabe. A complete universe worth to see! Can't wait for what's coming!,POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","Filled with obvious sci-fi tropes from multiple franchises and does not build upon them. Uneven acting, strange use of camera angles and out of focus filming, and the now overused 'mary sue' where the main character is a perfect and undefeated female with no development or depth. The overarching story is basically Blazing Saddles in the Star Wars universe with strong Warhammer 40k themes and overtones.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","I love Zach's style, it wasn't a masterpiece but the movie flowed well and was very entertaining. A lot of parallels to the Warhammer 40K universe which sold me on the movie right away. I thought it was definitely good enough for a part one leaving plenty of room for the part to be improved upon. Simple answer I enjoyed the film.",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","A fantastic start of a new space sci-fi universe. While it does have slight pacing issues in the middle of the movie, the action, spectacle and word building are all worthy of immersing yourself in this new universe.",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023",Characters are undeveloped and the lead actress is terrible. This movie had such great potential. An incredible misfire.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023",6 Star Movie no doubt. Love the character build up only thing I didn't like is killing my man Jaxs.,POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","Predictable with interesting visuals. It's not bad but it's not great. The pep talks were basic and uninspired. The assembly of fighters was just as you'd expect with no surprises. Visually, this sci-fi world is fairly interesting. The plot & dialogue, however, seem very typical and flat. I wasn't a fan of the action scenes. There was a lot of slow motion that got old pretty quickly.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 22, 2023","This was an interesting story and had its moments. I must say the visuals was amazing in this movie.  No dark-spots and all the fighting was crystal clear. I could actually see the fight scenes. But, with that said the world building felt rushed but I understand why because it doesn't have any other lore to go off of so they had to cram all the back stories together in this movie! I would have liked to see  a character with some type of special abilities. They have the  capability to fly from galaxy to galaxy but nobody have any special abilities is wild to me. It wasn't anything special about the villain of the movie he actually fell pretty easily to 5 bandits which we only got to see one fight at the end which is a total bummer!!! Why go look for people to team up with and you only showcase the main character fight scenes!! It was pointless of having us go through the back story of the others for them to only showcase the main character at the end!! It was also obvious that the thief was going to double cross them nobody had suspicions of him wasn't logical at all.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 22, 2023","It was a Frankenstein's moster of franchises, mythologies, and genres. It was a spoof that took itself to seriously and yet entertaining. I am not a fan of most of the stylistic choices made but I will be watching part two when it comes out.",NEUTRAL

"Dec 22, 2023",Great characters; I wish we had more time with them. The worlds explored were interesting and stunning; can't wait to see more. I like the direction of the story. Only one complaint: some scenes could've benefited more without a long duration of slow motion. I would definitely recommend this to others.,POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023","I really wanted to like this. I love scifi and space operas inparticular, but blah. It could have subverted some expectations, but instead gave viewers exactly what they thought was going to happen. I've seen this story before and seen it better executed.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 19, 2023",Here goes again the UNREALISTIC review of rotten tomatoes critics!,POSITIVE
"Dec 19, 2023","meh.
Not goodd not terrible.
Meh.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 19, 2023",Very violent and intense sci-fi film in the mold of Blade Runner. Outstanding lead performance by Sofia Boutella.,POSITIVE
"Dec 19, 2023",TRASH! Dont waste your time.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 19, 2023",I don't know what these critics are even talking about. They wouldn't know a good movie if it went across their face.. It's an excellent film and I can't wait to see the second part of it,POSITIVE
"Dec 19, 2023",Brilliant. One of the greatest scifi epics ever made. Takes a lot from starwars and dune and every 90s fantasy and scifi and mixes it all together to create something that looks familiar but feels fresh! Cant wait for the next one!!,POSITIVE
"Dec 19, 2023","Action style in this movie is awesome, highly recommended.",POSITIVE
"Dec 19, 2023","When Star Wars first aired back in the 70s it was panned by critics only to become one of the most loved movie franchises of all time. 

History repeats in Rebel Moon, with artsy fartsy critic lining up on mass to show just how out of of touch they are with the audience.
 
Rebel moon Part one is spectacular space fantasy that creates unique universe and sows the seeds of what can become a spectacular space fantasy series.

The movie pays lashings of homage to fan fiction. If you you are sci-fi geek, you will enjoy this sci-fi franchise.",POSITIVE
"Dec 19, 2023","Fantastic movie. Don't no, why so bad ranking",POSITIVE
"Dec 19, 2023","Great movie to a new universe. Was it perfect, depends who you ask I guess. I enjoyed it and can't wait for more. RT is unreliable at getting fair reviews. Clearly paid off.",POSITIVE
"Dec 19, 2023",Its not so bad. In fact its a good entertainment,POSITIVE
"Dec 19, 2023",No where near as bad as the critics score makes you think. Just feels rushed and unfinished. The 3 hour version will probably be a lot better.,POSITIVE
"Dec 19, 2023","Almost no story, action was okay. You will forget it as soon as you have finished watching it.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 19, 2023",Please see this movie for yourself. It‚Äôs shot well the action is good and I want to know what happens next. Of course with all Zack Snyder‚Äôs movies the visual story is stunning!!,NEUTRAL
"Dec 19, 2023",Let's say you gave the original Star Wars 9 out of 10. You'd give movie 1 out of 10. Ridiculous plot. Underdevoped characters. And the sin repeated by every action movie in the last five years: A 110 lb female model who can beat up every guy in Cleveland.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 19, 2023",Has some fun moments but bogged down by Snyderisms.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 19, 2023",Got to see this movie again. Absolute masterpiece. Loved it,POSITIVE
"Dec 19, 2023","Visually stunning, the world building is intense and fun. I wish we learnt a bit more about each member of the crew though. Ed Skrein stole the show for me! An amazing villain with such a slime and evil presence. It's a must see for Sci-fi fans into the aesthetic of Warhammer and Star Wars.",POSITIVE
"Dec 19, 2023","this movie is bad, just bad",NEGATIVE
"Dec 19, 2023","Totally fun! Every thing you would/should want in a sci/fi crazy adventure! The Justice League was formed by the end of the first half, without any of them having super powers. Good time!!",POSITIVE
"Dec 19, 2023","Very good, it's what I was hoping for, I'm looking forward to the next part",POSITIVE
"Dec 19, 2023","The reason why I didn't give it one star is because it was over two hours, long,! Also, I have a CGI hangover, and am confused why filmmakers think this would bail them out, in place of a good story line! I watched the whole thing, I'm sure, unlike many other people who probably didn't get through the whole two hours plus.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 19, 2023","Awesome! That's all, can't wait for Part Two and the Director's Cuts.",POSITIVE
"Dec 19, 2023","The music was top notch, but the film only started strong for me. The rest of it felt extremely choppy due to pacing issues and I feel only the director's cut can fix that. I'd say watch it if you're interested.

Saw it at TIFF",NEUTRAL
"Dec 19, 2023","The story felt ripped off, this was obviously a rip kid star wars but no one hid that, but the use of slow motion was obscene in this. While it was visually beautiful. It was boring and there was a lot of things that weren't explained. I gave this a shot bc I love Charlie hunnam but this was just a no. And the fact that they justify that they have a directors cut that's much better. Like dude. You shouldn't need a directors cut to be your saving grace. It was understandable for JL bc what happened, but you had basically green flags to do whatever you wanted with this movie. So that's very irritating. People didn't like this movie and you think they're gonna sit through a 5hour version.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 18, 2023","This was the best movie of 2023. Can't wait for the second part. The Egyptian theatre was perfect for this movie and got packed with people this past Friday, üíØ on my rating. Another master piece!!",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2023","Love this movie! Amazing set, characters, costumes and actors! Lovely design, story and cinematography.",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2023","Enjoyed the overall story, the worlds are beautiful, characters and costumes all looked great. The action was average, the camera was blurry at times, not sure why, the characters needed more screen time to reveal their motivations for joining Kora. But overall it was an enjoyable experience, I'll be waiting impatiently for part 2.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 18, 2023","A space opera made epic, a world building so masive that you can espect anything froms this universe, this part one is an exelent introdution, that shurely will blow up with the second part and the director's cut.",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2023","Boring as hell, prefer to watch star wars than this.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 18, 2023",I can't remember a movie with such a bad story line in it.,NEGATIVE

"Dec 18, 2023","Maybe it suffered from poor editing since the storyline jumped around too much, making it difficult to follow.

"Dec 18, 2023",I have seen all the movies of the year and this is by far the one I liked the most of all of them.,POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2023","The movie was a disappointment, with a disjointed and sloppy plot that seemed like a random assortment of stolen sci-fi tropes.

"Dec 18, 2023","Promised much, delivered almost nothing, pretty visuals don't equal narrative",NEGATIVE
"Dec 18, 2023","The movie is an absolute blast. There is so much world-building, with a visual feast. I am excited to see where this story leads.",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2023","I was lucky to catch a preview screening. I expected to see a copy of Star Wars. But what I saw wasn't Star Wars. It was much bigger. The director created a living world from scratch. We feel its enormity, we meet a multitude of characters, each of whom has their own story and role in this galaxy. This is no longer the sterile and colorful sci-fi that Disney gives us, but a full-fledged cosmic dark fantasy. A production that exceeds the expectations of modern audiences and gives something more.
Visually, musically, acted, narratively... In every respect, Rebel Moon shines and I have no doubt that for many of you it will be the best production of this year, if not the decade. This film simply must be watched.
Maybe during the first viewing you will be a bit overwhelmed by the pace at which the story is presented, but during the second viewing, when you know what this production is about, you will appreciate this film even more. Really, watch this before someone will spoil you this masterpiece ;)",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2023","good special effects, bad story.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 18, 2023","If you like to watch pretty pictures then this is the show for you. If you like substance, good story telling and emotional connections - watch something else. This is yet another show that doesn't know how to write believable female characters as well. I give it one star for the CGI and one star for the effort. Hard pass.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 18, 2023",So much fun to watch. It was full of cool characters that I can't wait to watch in part 2,POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2023","Great epic movie! Love the action and drama! Characters have an arc and it has zero super hero weight! Everyone needed each other to fight the Imperium. There's love and hope and bad ass scenes where you feel like Lord of the Rings panoramic sequence, with a sci-fi fantasy feel to it. Love the vast array of characters with lots of great dialogue!!",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2023","The visuals are amazing, but the plot is not something new, about gathering rebels, fighting the empire, betrayal, greed, etc. and some have commented without being objective, they have shown their hatred for a person (Gunn)",NEGATIVE
"Dec 18, 2023","P√©sima nada encaja, son mil historias sueltas solo √∫tiles para dormir",NEGATIVE
"Dec 18, 2023",Espectacular la magia de zack es imparable.  Es una pel√≠cula no apta para sensibles y malos criticones.  100 puntos para esta obra de arte!!,POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2023",Amazing movie with amazing visuals and original ideas.,POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2023",Abysmal. Disjointed and sloppy. Feels like a patchwork of stolen scifi tropes thrown together. Action sequences were lackluster. This is nothing special. The audience score will settle somewhere in the 60s when all is said and done.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 18, 2023","Bonito, por√©m extremamente gen√©rico, raso e sem enredo suficiente para justificar a pr√≥pria exist√™ncia",NEGATIVE
"Dec 18, 2023","Rebel Moon es simplemente Zack¬°¬°¬°. De la misma manera que unos lo odian sin ver sus peliculas o buscando el mas minimo error, otros lo adoramos por seguir su vision y sus instintos, por hacernos sentir el cine como pocos y eso lo hace merecedor de nuestra confianza y respeto.",POSITIVE
"Dec 17, 2023",Esta mamada no es cine.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 17, 2023","The film has amazing visual !! 

Excellent characters, gorgeous stunt sequences.

but storytelling is difficult to say it is the best, we have to prepare for the director's cut.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 17, 2023","Such a good movie, you can always tell if it's going to be good based off RT. If they score it low, it will probably be good. Too much hate for Zac.",POSITIVE
"Dec 17, 2023","Zach Snyder's Star Wars, (coughs) I mean Rebel Moon, this is a good sci-fi film, it's got elements of genre blending, elements of a Viking/ Norse epic, a Western, Seven Samurai, the Magnificent Seven, and Zacks version of Star Wars. This isn't the same thing as Star Wars it has a different vibe. It is a quality Sci-fi film with a good mature story, it has an epic score. Two times I could picture Darth Vader coming into the next scene based upon the audio design. The visuals are great. The story is great. I took a road trip to the Bay Theater to see this in theaters and I'm glad I did. I really liked it. I want to see the R rated version. It feels like some important elements of the story could be expanded upon. There are hints that a sex scene may have been cut. Overall, I like the tone, the visual style and the audio design. I wish it was available in a larger theater. The small theater / screen didn't show it in the size and scale I would have preferred to see. This needs to be shown on the larger screens to a mass audience. This is a solid franchise starter. It's a quality movie. I wish it was available in more theaters and on larger screens as it deserves. This should have been a wider release. I am glad I took the road trip to see it in theaters. I can wait to see the full R rated version of the film.",POSITIVE
"Dec 17, 2023",Just saw it at tiff and man what a cliffhanger! Part 2 can't come soon enough.,POSITIVE
"Dec 17, 2023","Its a shame as I wanted Synder to knock it out of the park. But its a mess. While the visuals are striking, the story telling lacks much to be desired.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 17, 2023","A m√≠ en particular me ha gustado mucho, espero que se haga la segunda parte, no entiendo algunas cr√≠ticas. Cuando ves algo de Zack ya sabes lo que ves, no puedes esperar que sea El padrino.",POSITIVE
"Dec 17, 2023","Lamentablemente esta no es la pelicular que va a revivir la carrera del director, totalmente carente de originalidad busca ser un evento masivo como lo fueron las obras a las cuales intenta imitar de manera torpe y poco interesante, es un Frankenstein que no logra encontrar su propia esencia y lo poco rescatable son sus efectos especiales, por momento da tomas hermosas que acaban asfixiadas entre un mal guion y una primicia hueca.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 17, 2023","This movie was everything i wanted it to be. From the visuals, to the performances and the score, this film is a just a small drop of water in a vast ocean. It leaves you wanting more of this fantastical new universe. Can't wait for the extended cut and it's Continuation in the spring.",POSITIVE
"Dec 17, 2023",Great visuals and a lot of heart. The characters have depth. The movie is over two hours but the movie is fast pace. A must see for sci fi fans,POSITIVE

"Dec 17, 2023","Fue tan aburrida que honestamente me qued√© dormido en el primer acto. Las secuencias de acci√≥n horriblemente ejecutadas, el gui√≥n muy forzado y p√©sima direcci√≥n. Al finalizar la pel√≠cula la sientes vac√≠a.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 17, 2023","So fun, epic and masterful! It has all of Snyders style and creativity and is just so enjoyable to experience . Can't wait for Part 2!",POSITIVE
"Dec 17, 2023",Rebel Moon is a fun wild ride and an exceptional sci-fi fantasy movie. I just wish this were the R-Rated version because I feel there is so much movie to be told. I can't wait for Part 2 to be released.,POSITIVE

"Dec 17, 2023",Was lucky enough to see it in theaters. loved every minute of it! bring on part 2!,POSITIVE
"Dec 17, 2023","I adore Sofia Boutella and that's a good thing because she is in this movie. And I honestly think she did as much as she could to save the movie, but you can't do anything with no writing and no story. And of course all the other stuff people have talked about, being derivative etc. I love you Sofia but it's a bad movie.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 17, 2023","What some people don't seem to understand is that this isn't one of the Star Wars movies,just understand that it's set in the Armyverse,the same universe as Army of the Dead and Army of Thieves that came out in 2021.",POSITIVE

"Dec 17, 2023",Girl boss movie again and again and again and again and again . .................,NEGATIVE
"Dec 17, 2023","It's as if the creative minds behind it decided to combine the artistic prowess of a snail with the audacity of a cardboard box. Yes, my friend, you heard me right. The bar for originality was set so low that it could practically be used as a limbo stick by a toddler. Those characters, oh boy, they were about as memorable as a forgotten tweet in a sea of mundane social media posts. I mean, seriously, they failed to leave even the faintest imprint on the viewers consciousness. It's astounding how something so lackluster managed to find its way onto the screen. We deserve depth, complexity, and narratives that leave us in awe, not just a shiny facade that crumbles upon closer inspection.",NEGATIVE

I came out in love with this new world they built in this movie, epic visuals , really fast pace but overall epic movie.",POSITIVE
"Dec 16, 2023","What a Masterpiece! Visually stunning, action-packed, and keeps you on the edge of your seat.

"Dec 16, 2023","This is just objectively bad. 
The tired slo-mo actions notwithstanding, the highly derivative plot drags and the characters are mostly shallow, under-developed archetypes you'd more expect from a bored teenager in class rather than an experienced filmmaker. There's a reason why this never became part of the Star Wars franchise and this is the same reason you should give Rebel Moon a hard pass.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 16, 2023","The critics' reviews Stink fishy! 
In any case, critics' reviews have never been as significant as audience reviews!",POSITIVE
"Dec 16, 2023",It is a whole new universe! Very magical and cinematic with lots of homages to classics! Can't wait for the extended R version but this was so enjoyable and a great setup for part 2. Watch it!,POSITIVE
"Dec 16, 2023","This movie is epic, big scale , bug character lore, awesome world building, out of the world VFX and cinematography.
Can't wait for Part 2",POSITIVE
"Dec 16, 2023","Movie was visually stunning, action-packed, great acting, score, etc. Only thing was that I had some favorite characters in here that didn't have enough screentime in this 2hr cut. Definitely need that extra hour of the director's cut that's to flesh out their narratives too, so can't wait for that!",POSITIVE
"Dec 16, 2023","Watched this movie with my friends at 70mm screening without any knowledge of what it is about and this movie surprised me,
The visuals, the character lore, score all top notch, it was really fast paced but I found out they will release longer R rated version soon.

Definitely recommend this movie to everyone who wants to watch big scale space opera with mindblowing visuals and new story.",POSITIVE

Loved it! beautiful visual, great story, probably too complex for some people, but don't let that fool you!",POSITIVE
"Dec 16, 2023","This movie was amazing. I can't wait for the R-Rated version. You can definitely tell more of the story's world building arc was left on the cutting room floor, but I can't wait to enjoy more of this world. Sofia Boutella is an action movie star.",POSITIVE
"Dec 16, 2023","This movie is beautiful, story is solid but lack character arc or development but that will be fixed in longer cut that has 1 hour of extra footage.

Sofia really shined as lead, all characters look important for the story and contribute to the plot, minor pacing issues will be fixed in the longer cut later.
Overall really impressed with this movie even though I have watched star wars but this looked fresh and different. I can't wait for Longer R rated Director's Cut and not to forget Part 2.",POSITIVE

"Dec 16, 2023","The first part of Rebel Moon is great & it can still be improved, I have faith that Zack will give us more movies like this. He doesn't deserve that bad score that the supposed film critics gave him",POSITIVE
"Dec 16, 2023",Its nice.. its good.. its can be more good,POSITIVE
"Dec 16, 2023",Perhaps it was badly edited? It jumped around so much and I didn't care about the characters. Can't knock the ambition though,NEGATIVE

The visuals and action was superb as usual. 
Thank you ZACK.",POSITIVE
"Dec 16, 2023","Meh. Visually stunning, but otherwise there really wasn't anything special about this, it didn't click with me emotionally at all. Sucks that the ratings are gonna be full of hardcore synder fanboys trying to make a point by spamming good reviews and people that are gonna review bomb it because they don't like the guy. It's a shame, usually Zack Synder hits it out of the park with epics that have a large cast, like his cut of Justice League, 300, and Watchmen. Better than Army of the Dead though, and maybe Part 2 will save it.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 16, 2023","Wow..this is such a epic movie, visually a masterpiece..can't wait for part 2 ü§©",POSITIVE

"Dec 16, 2023","An epic sci fi universe in the making, is off to a strong start with the part 1 of rebel moon.

"Dec 16, 2023","Absolute cinema, had a great time with it.",POSITIVE
"Dec 16, 2023","Derivative as it is beautiful, Rebel Moon is an amalgamation of the worst tropes in sci-fi. This would have fared better if it didn't so desperately want to be a launching pad for ""the best new Sci-Fi IP"". One of Snyder's worst.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 16, 2023",I've never made an rotten tomatoes account but this movie is so painfully bad I had to. All the Zach fan boys love this because flashy lights with a bad filter over it will get dumb people to give 5 starts to anything. Please for the love of God stop letting Zach into the studio,NEGATIVE
"Dec 16, 2023",A visual spectacle as expected that manages to combine it's influences (Kurosawa &  Lucas primarily) into a stew that feels old but tastes new. Very curious to see where it goes. Should've just released the full version though as it leaves you wanting more (and not just in the ways that it should),POSITIVE
"Dec 16, 2023","IT'S AMAZING. 9/10 
THE MUSIC, THE VISUALS, EVERYTHING IS JUST AMAZING. CRITICS GOT IT ALL WRONG.",POSITIVE
"Dec 16, 2023","Most of the critics are spot on - so unbelievably boring. It feels like a two hour trailer, just a collection of different scenes that don't flow from one to the next, without a single interesting character or story beat in sight.  The Star Wars references are a little too on the nose, but that would be fine if you even cared 10% about the characters or the world.

The main villain was pretty decent though. The only time I was somewhat interested is when he was on screen.",NEGATIVE

The movie looks and sounds amazing a true work of art yet again from synder if this was a one and done; then I would be furious with how this movies ends.

"Dec 16, 2023","I seen this at the London BFI IMAX at the premiere. I largely enjoyed this movie. It was filled with great action scenes, diverse characters, great world building and when you peel away the skin there is a huge universe to dissect in terms of themes and mythology.

There are going to be two cuts of this movie, one is a more family oriented movie and the longer cut in Zack's words is crazy and brutal. But even the family friendly version has several mature themes in it than the run of the mill marvel movie for example, it respects what it is and doesn't hold back.

The performances by every actor is top notch, the visuals and music is amazing and the set pieces are wonderful.

I've rated this ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è",POSITIVE

Seriously, you allow a whole cantina to hear you want to go against the imperials and immediately trust the first person to tell you they have a ship? Fucking stupid... And you take out a whole platoon of guys meant to keep your village in line... Do they not ever need to check in? No one is getting updates from them?

What do i think of rebel moon ? 

The film itself ranging from visuals spectacle to its world building it was phenomenal. Zack knows what he's doing from the ground up personally for me it's already ten times better than star wars content for the past 20 years. This should be watch on the biggest screen and on imax for sure how good the visuals is. And for the story and characters all set well and done. Every character is a definite show stealer especially Kora and Kai both of them are badassess. The side characters also did and serve their purpose to the story while i have small gripes i would say that the story should be more fleshed out and they could just add up around 20 minutes more to the film so that it can breathe and seen more characters clild shine throughout. 

All and all Rebel moon is by far one of the best action films in 2023. Don't forget to check it out.",POSITIVE
