"Apr 8, 2024","Der Film leidet vorallem unter seinen katastrophalen Vorgänger. Dennoch hat der Film viele Logiklücken und erinnert teils an ein Videospiel wo man verschieden Side-Quest erfüllen muss. Rey ist in diesen Film dann entgültig zu einer Mary Sue geworden und die wohl mächtigste Person die jemals in Star Wars gelebt hat. Palpatines Rückkehr ist unlogisch und irgendwie ist auch die Armarda von ihm auch komplett unrealistisch.

Der Film ist halt einfach ein spaßiger Trashfilm der viele Logiklücken hat.",NEUTRAL
"Apr 6, 2024","Disney lost me in the Star Wars franchise with this movie. Too many inconsistent and character motivations, force abilities, and implausible choices. Felt like new force abilities were being created out of nowhere to try and wow us. Problem is those abilities are unsustainably overpowered and ruin future storytelling. Would love to see  stories written as if each character were the main character of their own story. That is a high bar, though I believe you're very capable of it Disney!",NEGATIVE
"Apr 4, 2024","While Last Jedi did more damage to the story, this movie comes out as the overall worst movie of the saga by a panic to over correct. Characters act out of character, whole plotlines come to an end abruptly and without any fan fare. Whole other plotlines are just retconned out. If anything, it retroactively makes the last jedi and the entire trilogy worse knowing that nothing led anywhere. Had they had the guts to stick with it, they could have smartly tied things together and even make us look at last jedi in a new and appreciative context. The final movie in the trilogy does away with any setup from the previous films to bring back palpatine, which cheapens the original 6 films, to try and get butts in the seat. Disney views this franchise as a cash cow, and they quickly realized that poor quality and writing doesn't equal lots of tickets",NEGATIVE
"Mar 28, 2024","Visually stunning, action-packed, absurd, convoluted, shallow drivel. Flashy without substance. Amounts to bird droppings on the tombstone of Star Wars, which died with TLJ.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 25, 2024","At its core, Episode IX is an acceptable film. However, it's incredibly underwhelming for the last installment of the Skywalker Saga",NEGATIVE
"Mar 21, 2024","As a generic Sci Fi film, The Rise of Skywalker works fine, but unfortunately, it is the concluding chapter of the 8 previous Star Wars films, in this case, this movie fails in almost every possible way to give the saga a satisfying ending. Yes, the movie does not bore you, it is action packed and moves at a relatively fast narrative speed, but there are absolutely nothing that makes the previous films special left in this film, it is terribly hallow. Characters that have enormous potentials like Finn and Poe does not get any attention in the film, and the main character Rey which trilogy spends two movie portraying got to be one of the most disappointing main character in any Star Wars Media, Daisy Ridley is a good actress and did the best she could with what she was given, but that does not change the fact that what she was given was a Mary Sue character who barley have any character development in any of the movies. Now to the antagonist, bringing Palpatine back shows that the producer does not want to spend any time on portraying a new character, but the reveal is not only poorly written(since the film never explained how he returned), bring Palpatine back basically means all the work that the characters did in the previous six films are worth nothing, cause according to the movie:""Somehow, Palpatine returned"". The ending of this movie is also terribly written, until now, 5 years later, I still does not understand why Rey was able to defeat Palpatine just because she got another lightsaber. Oh did I forgot to mention, there are no ending fight scenes in this movie, just a mary sue character reflecting lighting. Overall, if episode 8 is a movie that divided the franchise, episode 9 united the franchise once again, because of how disappointing it is.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 15, 2024","""Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker attempts to tie up the saga's loose ends with epic scale and nostalgia, but falls short of delivering a perfect conclusion. The saga's end boasts impressive visual effects and thrilling action sequences, though its pace and convoluted plot leave little room for total closure. With strong performances from Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver, Episode IX closes on a relatively strong note, though leaving viewers with more questions than answers.",POSITIVE
"Mar 13, 2024","It tried to repair the damage from episode 8 but ended up becoming overdone and childish. It assumes the audience will accept just about anything it throws their way, including the ridiculous reveal in the opening crawl. It's a fun movie, I guess, especially for young children, but it is not a good movie by any means. A disappointing end to a disappointing trilogy. I blame episode 8 for setting it up for failure.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 5, 2024","It was Terrible! not visually but the story was straight up taken out of a trashcan, nothing makes sense, they straight up forgot a LOT of lor and Rey is a Palpatine! NOT A Skywalker!",NEGATIVE
"Mar 3, 2024","Some meme worthy scenes redeemed it from being unwatchable. But it is still pretty abhorrently peeved together, balanced try too hard of a movie. It felt a slap in the face if you look for depth in Star Wars stories in the new era, because it gave you the ending stage Naruto storyline, and little to none emotions, just cheap twists and thrills. Shame on you, SW franchise",NEGATIVE
"Feb 29, 2024","Ugh this was a forgettable awful wrap to a forgettable awful trillogy. Big issues I had with it was in character development, lazy writing (palpatine died...), mcguffins (really a dagger that aligns perfectly with the wreckage of a deathstar.. that has a thing that comes out of the handle that points to the exact spot... contrived garbage that is so unbelievable it pulls you out of the film. Cheap laughs at the expense of degrading characters. It is flashy, but all the glitz cant hide the flaws. Garbage film making",NEGATIVE
"Feb 19, 2024","When you finish watching this as the finale to the sequel trilogy, you really realise that the writers had no idea what they wanted to do with the film series. Such a shame they ruined the Star Wars reputation after the revenge of the sith masterpiece",NEGATIVE
"Feb 19, 2024",Absolutely loved this movie. A perfect way to wrap up the saga with great conclusions for the major characters.,POSITIVE
"Feb 13, 2024","""Somehow Palpatine returned"" yeah... As someone who is a (pre-2009) Trekkie at heart and just a sci-fi lover in general, it kind of hurts my heart to see how a fellow Sci-Fi giant, will all the potential in the galaxy, fall so short of how it could grow and expand. The actors are fine, the franchise and the IPs involved are very loved. But it is the story writing that hurts this film the most and is the biggest thorn in the sequel trilogy (in my humble but widely shared opinion). This film hurts cannon and lore, and messes with loved and established characters. 
I hope the higher-ups at Lucas Film and Disney take more heart to what the fans are talking about, and to have more respect for the original source material.",NEGATIVE

"Feb 2, 2024","Very nice watch, not as happy with the plot as i would imagine. Just too many things did not make no sense, or werent mentioned. Imagined Ben to have better ending....",NEUTRAL
"Jan 26, 2024","The twist ending not only comes out of nowhere and doesn't land, but partly ruins the plot of the original trilogy, which is a huge disservice to fans. Rey continues to be a one-dimensional Mary Sue, and Finn and Rose are almost sidelined completely and their romance from the previous movie forgotten. There is little cohesion at all with the events of the previous film thanks to corporate interference and the changing of directors. The cinematography is great as us usual, but beyond the visual spectacle, this is a mess of a film.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 22, 2024","The story is just dumb.   Makes no sense, full of coincidences, and has no connection to the prior film.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 18, 2024",okay this movie takes the cake  I love how this is the final movie of star wars it is epic how much I love it and the return of palptine and the return of the classic star destroyers it is a blast watching the movie but sad that they had to include carrier fishers death in the movie,POSITIVE
"Jan 14, 2024","Not a good movie on any level. Convoluted plot, betrayal of the lore, poor acting, betrayal even of the trilogy it's a part of. Some good special effects, but not worth watching. Stupid plot twist... which is that... Palpatine is still alive. Rey's resolution is meaningless. Who's to say she won't just end up like Luke?
The movie can also function as a giant middle finger to Carrie Fischer. Total disrespect not only to the character of Leia, but also to the human being who portrayed her, as well as to anyone who ever appreciated her art.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 12, 2024","The second movie in the row to break pre-established Lore on what is and isn't possible in the setting, terrible payout, bad reused Gillian, unsatisfactory stakes due to people somehow appearing out of nowhere when there travel time would not allow. Ramps up the bad guy power creep with no build up, or reasoning that makes logical sense.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 11, 2024",I have a rather large bone to pick with the new Star Wars movies and their lack of representation. This movie just felt boring and they essentially ditched Finn as a character. Also what's up with the random kiss at the end  between the two women that we know nothing about? I love to see LGBTQ+ characters but not if they're just there to check off a diversity box and  we don't even know their names!,NEGATIVE
"Jan 10, 2024","The whole point in making movies is to challenge the audience, create something unexpected and original. SW: TROS does not do this. This film grabs at the cringiest ideas of the fan base to appease people who have no grasp on what good writing is. It's hard to fathom that this movie exists in the same franchise as SW: TESB. And what's worse is that it leaves ""that thing Finn wanted to tell Rey"" as unanswered. The film also leaves the identity of Lando's daughter for the viewer to read on other media. As the ""conclusion"" of the Skywalker series, everything should have been answered in this installment. 

Largest points of awful writing (spoilers):
Snoke's origins.
Rey's origins. (Inconsistency)
Luke catching the lightsaber (inconsistency)
Hux being a spy.
Force Healing (too convenient, lazy writing, & creates plot holes throughout the entire franchise).
Kylo fixing his helmet (inconsistency) made his design look dumb. Should have just had more copies of the helmet.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 19, 2023","Terrible movie. Don't get me wrong, good action scenes, good acting and lots of plot twists. But that doesn't make a good Star Wars movie. A Star Wars movie has to be special and creative, and this movie lacks all creativity and specialness. I hate what this franchise has become and I hate how there was a director change midway through the series because now the trilogy is all over the place. I wish the makers of these movies knew how to read an audience and actually make a good movie.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 16, 2023","The Rise of Skywalker makes haste through what barely constitutes as a script. When it comes to tone, characters and story this is really just any rushed out action/space adventure, and the only thing that makes it Star Wars is the useage of familiar names and locations. In all honesty, this is barely watchable.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 16, 2023","I loved this movie. As a culmination of the Skywalker saga with Palpatine returning as the villain I was very happy. Brilliant performances from Ian McDiarmid, Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver.",POSITIVE
"Nov 28, 2023",Palpatine is my fave Star Wars character - but even he is butchered in this.,NEGATIVE
"Nov 28, 2023","Better, but the writing is still pretty bad.",NEGATIVE
"Nov 28, 2023","The final chapter in the Star Wars sequel trilogy, The Rise Of Skywalker sees J.J. Abrams back on directing duties since The Force Awakens as the story of new characters Rey, Finn, Poe and Kylo Ren draws to a close in typically epic fashion.

With the mixed reaction second chapter The Last Jedi prompted back in 2017, there seemed to be a conscious effort by Disney to regroup somewhat, especially after the disappointing reception of Solo: A Star Wars Story the following year. The Rise Of Skywalker had to be either universally beloved or, at the very least, satisfying as an ending to most Star Wars fans to make this regrouping worthwhile. From its opening text crawl, this sequel already appears to make a conscious jump past The Last Jedi and back onto more familiar territory with the reintroduction of Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) and Rey's plot focusing even more on her origins.

""The dead speak!"", we are told, moments before Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) travels solo to The Emperor's lair, an old-school mad scientist lab complete with half-finished Supreme Leader Snoke clones in water tanks (lol), screaming lightning (I'm not kidding) and big magnifying glasses everywhere (still not kidding). Palpatine is every bit as over-the-top as you'd expect and the overall tone here is reminiscent of old horror B-movies, which certainly could have been apt seeing as the likes of horror giants Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing were once a big part of this franchise. Unfortunately, the Palpatine scenes are where all this begins and ends, and all that remains is the nagging feeling that these tonal shifts and this apparently random reviving of Emperor Palpatine might not actually work.

""Somehow the Emperor's back!"", Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) exclaims at one point in the movie, with the word ""somehow"" doing a heck of a lot of heavy lifting here. And this is a good way to understand what's... off about this movie: somehow most of The Last Jedi isn't so important now, somehow Rose isn't a main character anymore, somehow Lando Calrissian's back and he has the entire world on speed-dial, somehow Force healing is a big thing all of a sudden, somehow The Emperor is ALL the Siths, somehow Rey has mastered every power by running in the woods, and so on.

Not that the film never explains anything but there is a lot it, indeed, doesn't explain and, in fact, the overall pacing of this installment feels extremely rushed and J.J. Abrams' erratic, perhaps more Star Trek-friendly, direction is mostly to blame for this. 

Fortunately, after a frankly clunky first act, we are given a solid second act that's genuinely entertaining and should keep the attention of even the grumpiest Star Wars fan. Rey wrestles with the good and the bad within her as Kylo Ren closes in, C3P0 (Anthony Daniels doing great work, as usual) becomes key to the Resistance's success, Poe reveals his darker past and there are some fun action sequences along the way. Fair homage is paid to the late Carrie Fisher and there are some enjoyable enough, if gimmicky cameos here and there. Sadly, brand new characters like Richard E. Grant's Allegiant General Pryde and Naomi Ackie's Jannah aren't given much to work with and the likes of Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) and Maz (Lupita Nyong'o) are criminally cast aside, as if there was never any plan for them.

The softening of The Last Jedi's bolder ideas hurts this movie which, too often, feels like a cowardly retreat into safer territory, actual drama be damned. There are elements explored here that do work, admittedly: the closing of Kylo Ren's character arc is mostly effective and it's rewarding to see Ben Solo being himself, even for a brief moment, while Poe and Finn collaborating as the new leaders of the Resistance makes sense. There are also some good ideas in there like Rey potentially killing Chewbacca by mistake or C3P0 tragically losing his memory to save his friends' lives but the film refuses to actually go there and undoes all this within minutes, perhaps for fear of offending a single die-hard fan who might tweet negatively about all of this or for fear of instilling real emotions into the movie.

Truthfully, this feels like a film based on an older script that was reworked much later on with lots of unclear ideas thrown in and shadows of better prior ideas still visible, but only just. The writing as a whole, by the way, is rather weak especially when it comes to the dialog, but we've seen this many times before in the Star Wars franchise so it's almost to be expected at this point. Though it's never all that welcome.

This is a fast-paced movie that does everything you'd expect in a Star Wars film, Ewoks even pop up briefly, but it doesn't so much feel like the end of an epic trilogy as it does the final breath of a rebooted franchise that was not carefully worked-out from the beginning and can't wait to end once and for all. Some of it is fan-service, some of it is almost stream of consciousness, none of it feels quite right but, at the very least, it's never dull. 

Missed opportunity, this was.",NEGATIVE
"Nov 26, 2023",its funny really. the user score is opposite to the critic score. even when pretty much everyone agree this is a bad movie. and it is. but just because you hated last jedi and the critics loved it and now when the critics hate it you upvote this trash? lol. its really shows that star wars fans are man-babies. just because last jedi is bad does not make this one good. in fact. i would say as someone who only like force awakens that both this one and last jedi are bad. who is worse? this one probably. last jedi at least had some balls to its script. this one? ray is the granddoughter of palpatine? wtf? thats makes the star wars universe incredibly small. in huge galaxy its only the story of 2 families? lol. but yes there is some good one and that is rouge one. rouge one was pretty much the best star wars movie since revenge of the sith.,NEGATIVE

"Nov 2, 2023","I almost walked out of this movie. I've wonder why we have not seen any interviews with JJ Abrams since this movie. Maybe someone can point me in the right direction, I'd love to know some behind-the-scene details on how this movie got to this level of awful.",NEGATIVE
"Nov 2, 2023","Star Wars comes to an epic and satisfying
conclusion in The Rise of Skywalker

"Oct 31, 2023","In my honest opinion, this film does justice to the Star Wars trope of the final instalment being the best. Driver is great in his role.

"Oct 15, 2023","Although episode 9 is more entertaining than the mess of episode 8, it is not so far from competing with the previous one mentioned for who is the worst in the saga.

If the previous one took away the development of the characters, in this one apart from that it also did it with the canon, how to revive Palpatine, that Rey without training is more powerful than the Jedi masters themselves, that she can now heal wounds with the force , that ghosts can touch things and use force and much more.

And not even the fanservice is well done, since only the voices of the ancient Jedi appear but not in ghosts, that Palpatine goes from starring in one of the best Star Wars deaths in episode 6 to the most pathetic and meaningless of the Saga , or that it was the ghost of Han Solo that convinced Kylo to turn to the light side, when it would be more logical for it to be Anakin...

And well, despite that I give him a star, because there was only ONE who did his job well, the great John Williams...",NEGATIVE
"Oct 15, 2023",This movie spat on the legacy of George Lucas and made the Anakin's sacrifice pointless. The only thing this movie succeeded at was being a complete disgrace from top to bottom.,NEGATIVE

"Oct 15, 2023",I was quite deeply upset with the Last Jedi it just wasn't a Star Wars movie and basically blatantly disregarded so much of the previous films. Rise of Skywalker fixed every mistake that was made in Last Jedi and has the perfect ending to the saga with just enough of a cliffhanger to keep the Star Wars universe open to new movies. I absolutely love the creative direction of JJ Abrams and obviously the entire cast are incredible actors!,POSITIVE
"Oct 13, 2023","Easily the weakest film in the ""Star Wars"" saga so far. Abrams and company seemingly tried to make something that would temper the anger felt by some fans over ""The Last Jedi"" but trying to appease so many conflicting encampments while also closing out three whole trilogies (and introducing a major twist) means that there's no time to explain anything or let any emotional moments really land. Honestly I do not understand why they didn't delay this movie to put the work in that the screenplay clearly needed . . . I mean the answer is money but still.",NEGATIVE

if people ever discover why the story about ""ahsoka"" has postively forced me to break down in tears with controlled uncontrollable tremors in my stomach, they will how ever soon shortly find out why, they'll understand why ahsoka has been the absolute only best female jedi bounty hunter.  in fact, during battlefront 2, the storyline depicted that 1, of her near demeanorship descibed in graphics, had been murdered during battle...

i stopped playing battlefront 2 at that point which was about at the 75% mark of the total role play game... yet, it was indeed a replay about her [ahsoka] yet she was brought back to life [resurrected] after that murder after during 1 large ground battle that i really believed that if i had played the game more efficiently, and especially at THAT point, i could had prevented that murder against occuring.

Episode 6 was the perfect ending to the Skywalker saga, Anakin bringing true balance to the force in the perfect conclusion so there's no need to watch episodes 7, 8 and 9 and watch beloved characters drastically change their personalities off screen. Mark Hamill stated it best when he said that he felt he wasn't playing Luke he had to pretend it was a different character that he named Jake Skywalker. There's nothing that brings me more anger and rage than this movie, just thinking about it boils my blood, but if you like hearing a character yell REY repeatedly, ""they fly now…yeah they fly now"", seeing major liberties taken with the force to make you feel like you're in Hogwarts, and space horses then this movie is for  you.",NEGATIVE
"Sep 9, 2023","Takes an upper hand against episode 7 and 8. Even though the rise of Skywalker is disgraceful at the end when Rey says she is a Skywalker, the movie still has some good elements. Such as, pretty well storyline, using Lando in a correct way,  good end fighting scene, the chemistry we've been waiting for with Rey and Ren, seeing Ren be more badass in the movie, etc. I didn't like how they had to rewrite C3POs memory when the dagger didn't even say anything that important…",NEGATIVE

The effects were great, and the Sith troopers were awesome, but I don't really like the ending scene where she decides she is a Skywalker, that was weird.

"Sep 3, 2023","It's one thing when someone has no idea how to finish a series and makes a rushed and ham fisted effort to conclude it.

It is, however, an entirely different thing when a movie undermines ever single past instalment of the franchise, renders a hero's sacrifice meaningless, ruins a villains redemption and rewrites ever single piece of canon about its own universe, some of which were established or confirmed within the same trilogy, to deus ex machina it's way out of the corner it backed itself into. This movie makes every previous Star Wars movie worse by its very existence because it has completely undermined all of them. 

Anyone who says this is a good movie turned their brain off sometime between sitting down to watch it and the opening title screen. The story has more holes in it than the Nevada desert and is so clumsy it is a threat to its own health and safety. The supporting characters have been ground into fine dust and scattered about the scenery to just exist and fill the background. Any interesting ideas the previous two movies had have been dragged out back and shot. The main characters have been turned into 2D shapes with no depth or nuance. It's sanitized, watered down and sanded into a perfect sphere to avoid any sharp edges.

"Aug 29, 2023","After the polarizing Last Jedi, the goal of The Rise of Skywalker is basically to retcon the previous film and turn the trilogy back into the popcorn, family-friendly thriller ride The Force Awakens was. The problem is, Abrams doesn't do anyone any favors, including detractors of The Last Jedi, as most elements are poorly done and rushed; as the final installment of a trilogy, nothing really gets proper closure. In the end, its not a bad movie because it was very badly made; the movie is entertaining enough on the surface. The real issues are that the script, the characters arcs, and all closure are rushed, lack continuity when paired with the other movies, and ends up being incredibly dissatisfying on every level.",NEGATIVE

"Aug 27, 2023","Terrible Overall and easily the worst of the franchise. The main issue that kills this is the terrible pacing. This movie never commits to ideas and is more concerned with throwing more and more nonsensical, incoherent, going against canon nonsense at you at a rapid rate. While the fast pacing worked for Force Awakens, it does the exact opposite here. From Rey being a Palpatine, Luke knowing she was a Palpatine and trained her anyway, Lando getting the whole galaxy together in a few hours, horses, Rey kissing Kylo, Saving Kylo, Giving Kylo a lightsaber telepathically, Finn never telling Rey what he wanted to say, The Wayfinder matching the destroyed Death Star II ruins in a very specfic spot, Millions of Sith, Chewies Fakeout, The Emperor just being back out of nowhere, none of it makes any sense. And as stylish, slick, nostalgic, and well produced production wise this is, it starts to slowly collapse under its own weight of incoherent ideas to the point this movie somehow becomes boring by the second half with no suspense. The editing isn't good either. While we say focused on the same group of characters after the first 20 minutes it follows them with just an illogical flow of ideas and telling of events that doesn't flow at all. The music is about the best thing. It's good but not up to par with the rest of the franchise mainly because of the inconsistent tone and inconsistent scenes. The cinematography is not good despite having all the production value. The CGI is decent but used in over the top, oversaturated ways especailly at the end, and the production value is used for nonsensical scenes. The acting is just ok. These are good performances but there weighed down by decisons and motivations that make no sense a lot of times and every so often espeically Poe they have to give long plot exposes to explain this mess as best they can. The Emperor should'nt have been here and feels so out of place. This never commits to ideas, ignores canon, and ignores things like Rose which was set up from the last film as being pivital. Skip this even though its the last one. It's a mess.",NEGATIVE

It makes 0 sense… it was for her protection?? Who were the Knights of Ren?? They played no role as alluded to in Episode 7 TFA.

So sad that Kylo Ren was having a time of redemption- but its like not talked about. I don't know, so many wrong. Otherwise, its visually beautiful.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 3, 2023","The creative treatment was fantastic with this trilogy. But as a lifelong fan who was 5 when I first saw Return of the Jedi and then watched the originals my entire life, I'm just so offended by what they did. First, Luke is not a quitter. Second, bringing back the Emperor (revealed in the 1st minute so nothing to spoil) -- after Darth Vader gave his life to save Luke's and bring balance to the force -- is so unbelievably offensive to me I don't know where to begin. Because it's as if it was all meaningless according to this movie. And we all know that's simply not true. LUKE is The Chosen One, and Princess Leia doesn't fly. She strangles Jabba the Hut's with chains, and if she suddenly learned the force then maybe you should explain to us how that happened. Anyhow, there was so much potential with these movies and Rogue One was the only one that got it right. So for this fan, Return of the Jedi will always be the true ending (I'm not a book or comic book guy, just the movies). And unfortunately, that invalidates this entire trilogy for me lol. But if you like it, that's cool. But Luke was our GenX god and this argument is my final battle.",NEGATIVE

"Jun 30, 2023","When I walked out of the cinema and I had a huge, stupid smile on my face as I enjoyed myself a lot from start to finish. This Star Wars movie had everything and was as entertaining as return of the Jedi. It's a shame as the more questions you ask the more confusing and annoying it becomes  as things don't really make a whole lot of sense. That could be due to the last Jedi messing things up. This easily could of been two movies by just how rushed it all felt. I like Rey but I don't believe she should of been a palpatine, but I certainly liked the idea of them flipping it and her turning to the dark side (oh well)  The emperor was at his most menacing in this movie then ever seen before, even if bringing him back undone Luke and Anakin's story a little. This film is best when you switch off and enjoy the nostalgia and the epic moments it does have to offer. Visually the best Star Wars and also some brilliant acting. There's things we'd of all liked to see but this is what we got and it still doesn't touch the OT but it is easily the most entertaining of the 3

"Jun 18, 2023","7/10
""Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker"" é o último capítulo da trilogia sequencial de Star Wars e, infelizmente, apresenta uma nota mediana devido a um roteiro mal executado. No entanto, é importante destacar os personagens cativantes e o potencial que a história tinha para se tornar algo grandioso.

Começando pelos aspectos positivos, os personagens de ""The Rise of Skywalker"" são indiscutivelmente um dos pontos mais fortes do filme. Rey, Finn, Poe e Kylo Ren continuam a ser figuras fascinantes e bem desenvolvidas, com performances sólidas dos atores que os interpretam. Suas jornadas pessoais e conflitos internos são explorados de maneira satisfatória, adicionando camadas emocionais e complexidade à narrativa.
No entanto, o roteiro de ""The Rise of Skywalker"" é o maior obstáculo para o sucesso do filme. A trama é repleta de reviravoltas apressadas e soluções convenientes que não se sustentam sob um exame mais criterioso. A falta de coesão e lógica interna enfraquece a história como um todo, deixando os espectadores com uma sensação de desconexão e frustração.",NEUTRAL

The heart of this last Star Wars  trilogy was the characters of Ray and Kilo.  This movie is filled with so many random side quests that the main characters feel lost.  They even introduce a ""new"" villain The Emperor instead of just going with the obvious: Kilo is the villain.  His story of redemption ( or the lack of redemption) would have made a great film.

The character arcs a non existent, to bring back Palpatine because they were unable to build up anything over the last two movies is just giving up and to make up for everything they present everything in a hilarious number.
SPOILER:
Instead of one Death Star we now have an infinite number out of nowhere, instead of a rebel fleet we now have a infinite number of random ships who just happen to arrive at the right time because it is written in the script and Palpatine is now all the sith and Rey is all the Jedi and that is an original quote.

"Jun 17, 2023","This film was definitely… something. It felt really rushed and the plot is dumb. It's as if a kid was playing with Star Wars toys and they made this entire thing up. Also, Palpatine's return is unoriginal and it wasn't needed. Come on Disney you couldn't have come up with anything better? Approaching the finale, it didn't feel very impactful to me. I could definitely tell that Disney was trying to make the finale like an ""Avengers: Endgame"" moment when the Citizens' Fleet showed up. Clearly it was meant to be impactful but they couldn't pull off what Endgame did. Overall, this film felt rushed, stupid, and a disgrace to Star Wars. The sequel trilogy could've been something more but it simply doesn't live up to the other trilogies.",NEGATIVE

"Jun 15, 2023","So much missed potential. Too many rushed (but critical) scenes, then a useless waste of screen time spent a race of musical aliens to remind the audience about positivity, and the celebration of ""good""?!?? Yuck. Plus, there's just too many convoluted plot threads that don't add up, UNLESS...you happened to go to the theater with the novelization in your pocket.
Stuff happens that only makes sense. The viewer would need a pause button to sit there & fill in all the blanks, but there's no time because of the smash cut editing and pointless action. I feel awful for Finn's character (who is clearly sidelined here). Poe is downgraded to a silly sidekick as well. I'm not one of those fans who thinks they can write a better movie. I absolutely can't. But hey that's not my job. Disney has endless funding/resources and it was THEIR duty to end this 40 year saga with some integrity. And it's disheartening for the regular people (like myself) who love Star Wars to watch as this movie disregards the tremendous possibilities that the Skywalker saga presented. Wow, this film could've had some emotional heft to it. Abrams could've gut punched us with an emotionally explosive conclusion, but instead, it feels like Kathleen Kennedy was breathing down his neck, the whole time to NOT make the last Jedi, and bring the whole thing in under two hours and 30 minutes. There are LOTS of movies with a 3-hour run time, and this one could've easily used another 30 minutes of character development, smoother editing, and an epically emotional final act. If you think I'm wrong, sit down and watch Andor. That has  a perfect mixture of powerful acting, character development, special effects, and star wars vibes .",NEGATIVE
"Jun 14, 2023","Break-neck pacing, too much happening at once with the plot or things happening too fast. A lot of things did not make sense because they are not developed. The movie (like the previous ones) fails to explain what was going on; how everything reached to this point and what motivates anyone to do anything here. (Other than to defeat the bad guys). It is difficult to get emotionally invested in most of the characters because there is so little development or substance to them. I think the only real protagonist you could follow and be interested in was Adam Driver's character. Another saving grace is Ian McDiarmid's performance is as great as ever.  And it is great to see Billy Dee Williams reprise the role of Lando. This movie would have been better if they cut it down and perhaps treated it as a contained adventure without all the bloated extras. The main battle is over the top, illogical and actually just a shoe-horn to get Palpatine back in. Glad this series is over as it was becoming less enjoyable as time went on.",NEGATIVE

I did not like the absurd absence of any sort of character development (except for kylo ren wich is the only remotely well written character in the triology), i did not like the settings, wich felt cheap (90% of the movies since Disney acquired the franchise are in deserts, landscapes, remote villages, wich are not that fitting imo), and lastly the finale was just a copycat of avengers endgame. I feel like the writers just took the insane amount of story telling potential this franchise had with (jedis, siths, mandalorians, criminal undergrounds, imperials, futuristic societies) and straignt up threw it in the toilet and flushed it, in favour of a decent low cost movie (for their standards of course) wich makes good profits.

"May 27, 2023",What a terrible ending of a trilogy. It is obvious that nothing was planned and the audience is supposed to just suckle the blue milk. Rian discarded JJs ideas in the last movie and here JJ takes back control. The entire trilogy feels like 2 kids fighting over a toy in a sandbox. This movie is just fetch quest after fetch quest. Stuff just happens with no explanation. JJ must have really like Avengers Endgame because it's the same ending.,NEGATIVE

"May 24, 2023",This movie couldn't have been good. TLJ left the trilogy with nowhere to go and thats what happens when there is no plan and you let a self centered hack write the middle. Considering all this I can't imagine fixing the trilogy without having Rey wake up and the whole movie was a bad dream and then moving forward with the real one. So what did they do? A ridiculous mcguffin hunt that makes no sense to a 10 year old. An ancient artifact that points the way using a fallen star destroyer? A part of the death star that fell to a planet it wasn't orbiting and remained intact? A secret planet you can only get to with one of two wayfinders made for no real reason? Lando remaining on a planet for 20 years looking for a McGuffin without success only to have it found the same day the newbies show up? Just skip this dumpster fire.,NEGATIVE

There's little to no growth for the main characters, and it doesn't feel like they have any chemistry in their relationships with eachother. Truly, just no real depth to them and it makes it hard as an audience member to connect with the film. Visually, it's stunning, but that only takes you so far. The film feels like like putting make-up on a pig and then saying it's beautiful. There is not a single person that I've talked to online or in person that genuinely liked this film, yet there's a relatively high audience score, which make it seem like there was an attempt by Disney to skew the narrative in their favor, which works against them in reality.",NEGATIVE
"May 7, 2023",Disney has absolutely destroyed Star Wars.  What an absolute tragedy.,NEGATIVE
"May 6, 2023","Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is a disappointing and underwhelming conclusion to the Skywalker saga. From the very beginning, the film feels rushed and disjointed, as if the filmmakers were trying to cram in as much fan service as possible without regard for storytelling or character development.

One of the biggest issues with the film is its reliance on convenience and contrivance to move the plot forward. Characters appear and disappear at random, and events unfold without any real explanation or context. This makes it difficult to become invested in the story or care about the characters, as everything feels arbitrary and meaningless.

Another problem with The Rise of Skywalker is its lack of emotional weight. The film tries to tug at the heartstrings with various callbacks and nostalgic moments, but these feel hollow and forced. There's no real sense of consequence or stakes, as the film seems more interested in checking off boxes and hitting familiar beats than telling a compelling and meaningful story.

Perhaps the biggest disappointment of all is how the film handles its characters. Many of the established characters are given short shrift, with little to no development or payoff for their arcs. New characters are introduced without much explanation or backstory, leaving the audience to wonder why they should care about them at all.

Overall, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is a forgettable and unsatisfying conclusion to the Skywalker saga. It fails to deliver on its promise of a compelling story and emotional resonance, instead relying on cheap gimmicks and nostalgia to try and win over audiences. Fans of the franchise deserve better than this lackluster effort.",NEGATIVE

I love Daisy Ridley but her character Rey hasn't earned anything in these past 3 movies.  Her managing advance force powers by accident is ridiculous. Finn was just trying to get Rey's attention through the entire movie. That was his character arc. They wasted Finn again and John Boyega's time! Oh by the end of this movie their is no Skywalker it's just Rey taking the name for herself. This is Star Wars at it's weakest and worse.,NEGATIVE

"Apr 20, 2023","The Rise of Skywalker was an absolute disaster. The plot was convoluted and lacked any coherence, making it impossible to follow. The characters felt shallow and underdeveloped, making it hard to care about what was happening to them.

The pacing was frenetic and disorienting, with scenes jumping from one location to the next without any clear reason or purpose. The special effects were impressive, but they couldn't save this poorly written mess of a film.

The dialogue was cringe-worthy, with cheesy one-liners and forced attempts at humor falling flat. The ending felt rushed and unsatisfying, leaving me with a feeling of disappointment and regret for having wasted my time watching this train wreck of a movie.

""The Rise of Skywalker"" was a massive letdown and a disgrace to the beloved Star Wars franchise. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this film at all costs. (Still better than Last Jedi though).",NEGATIVE

"Apr 17, 2023",This entire sequel trilogy is the worst thing that has ever happened to Star Wars .. it managed to tear apart and ruin one of the greatest franchises of all time.,NEGATIVE
"Apr 17, 2023","I give this movie 3/5 stars for its spectacle, its nostalgia, and its humor. It is a film that tries to wrap up the Star Wars saga with a bang, while also paying tribute to the legacy of the franchise. The film also features some impressive visuals, exciting action sequences, and witty dialogue. The film also showcases some great performances from its cast, especially Daisy Ridley as Rey, Adam Driver as Kylo Ren, and Ian McDiarmid as Palpatine. The film also delivers some emotional moments and satisfying resolutions for some of the characters.

However, I also think that some aspects of the film are disappointing, such as the plot, the characters, and the music. The film sometimes feels rushed and messy, especially in its pacing and structure. The film also struggles to develop some of its characters and make them compelling and consistent. The film also lacks some of the originality and creativity that made Star Wars so captivating. The film also alienates some fans with its controversial choices and changes that undermine or contradict the previous films. The film also fails to answer some of the questions and mysteries that were set up by The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi.

"Apr 15, 2023","I appreciate all the actors for playing their parts and no disrespect to them. As an avid sw fan, this movie isn't getting accurately reviewed and deserves a lower score. I understand some people like these new movies, but not 86% of sw fandom. The original didn't make these movies or intended to make them, nor did the original's apprentice. All three are well funded fan films with ""subverted expectation"" dilemmas in story development.

Luckily it has been redeemed but this was not only a bad Star Wars movie it was just a terrible movie in general. No one had the courage to continue with plot points that were set up because some of the fandom whined so hard about The Last Jedi. Well this is what you end up with. Honestly maybe we deserved it.,NEGATIVE

"Apr 10, 2023","I had no idea what what was happening the entire time. Jumping place to place and bringing back villains never mentioned in previous movies for no reason. The movie concluded with the most powerful man in the galaxy and beyond being killed when the main character picks up two lightsabers instead of one reflecting force lighting back into Palpatine's face. That isn't how lightsabers work at all. They even have the gaul to bot these reviews with the same ""loved Rey and Kylo"" and ""great ending to the franchise"" comments to boost the score. This film was a narrative nightmare with no direction that threw away the plot of the previous films leading to a disjointed mess that just gives the main characters what they need to rush though the story as fast as possible. It's not worth watching for first time viewers just pretend it ended in the last movie with the death of Smoke. Even with that movies flaws it's a masterpiece in comparison to this tragedy.",NEGATIVE

"Apr 8, 2023","This is a casual fans' fever dream. The visuals, sound design, and score are spectacular. The fan service is everywhere, and everyone's favorite villain returns. JJ Abrams may not know how to make a Star Wars movie, but he knows tricks of the trade to keep any non-critical eye happy. However, this is not the case for the dedicated fan. There are many plot holes in this movie, with the two major ones being force healing and resurrecting an actual sith after the prophecy of the chosen one was supposedly fulfilled. On top of this it undoes the few good things the last Jedi did right. The last Jedi was not a good movie, but it was at the very least unique. If the ideas it introduced had been properly built upon, this movie could have been good. However, this entire movies' purpose is to retcon every single thing about the previous entry. The last Jedi set up that reys' parents were nobody. That's gone. The last Jedi set up that Kylo ren would be the main villain of this one. Gone. The last movie set up that nobody was willing to help the resistance. Gone. Then the cherry on top, the characters are STILL not interesting, after 3 whole movies. 
Some other issues that I don't care to elaborate on:
1. Plot contrivances
2. Minor dialogue issues
3. Essential things introduced in the last movie

Hinted at many consequences for our hero (accidentally killing a major hero, potentially turning to the dark side, being unable to kill the antagonist for fear he would occupy her body, to name a few), none of which paid off or had any consequences in the least; completely invalidated the sacrifice Vader made to bring balance to the force in ROTJ simply because the creative team ADMITTEDLY had no plan going in; forced a cringeworthy kiss between the impossibly unchallenged hero and the psychotic galactic serial murderer, only to satisfy a select few theorists; completed Finn's arc as an utterly wasted character; gave us an impossibly poorly thought-out McGuffin that baffles my mind to this day (they had to stand RIGHT there for it to make sense??? How did they know what the Death Star debris would look like before it was even destroyed???); and arguably worst of all, introduced both an army of baddies that couldn't have possibly existed AND an army of good-guy helpers who took 10 minutes to assemble and have been suspiciously absent up until this point in the entire saga, just because they needed a big battle. To hell with actually writing a story that makes sense, right?

Everyone, Disney thinks we are all stupid, and they have forgotten how to tell stories. It's time to stop paying them. It's the only way they will learn a lesson and start hiring talented storytellers again.",NEGATIVE

Acting, is ok it could have been a lot better. CGI, is perfect no doubt about it. Villain, this is another reason why I liked the movie because it brought back Sidious and what's really interesting is why did the villains still exist even when Palpatine died in the explosion in Epi VI and this movie answers that question. Writing, I think that the writing was ok-good it could have been better. Story/Plot, it was ok and interesting. Casting is good-great. Characters, I think that the characters are great mostly because of the voices in Ray's head. Adventure, I think that the adventure was good like most Star Wars projects because we good threw and explore the galaxy and in this episode we traveled to the land of the Sith. Mystery, mystery is good because I always wondered what happens next especially in a movie like this bringing back the best of villains. Ending, in my opinion the ending was good but it does bring me to think No. 1 did Palpatine take over Ray's body? No. 2 did Palpatine die?

Kathleen Kennedy should be fired. If The Last Jedi was an insult to Star Wars fans, the ""Rise of Skywalker"" is like being shot in the head.

This movie offers nothing of value to the Star Wars universe, is full of plot holes and bad writing, and actually UNDOES the entire finale of Ep.6 by magically bringing back Sidious as villan. 

It was later revealed that Disney had no plan while making the sequel trilogy for any of the questions posed during the Force Awakens and that is not only disgraceful to Star Wars and it's fans but unforgiveable.

"Mar 14, 2023","Esta película estuvo mejor que la octava entrega y la verdad me gusto bastante el final que le dieron a la saga, aunque genero algunas dudas. La verdad tuve que ver toda la saga antes de ver esta última entrega y tuve que descifrar muchas cosas basándome en lo que se vio en las películas anteriores y así entender mucho de lo que parecía carecer de sentido. Además, encontré una explicación sobre porque Rei es una Mary Sue (alerta de Spoiler). La película revela que ella es nieta de Palpatine y creo que eso justifica porque ella tiene tanto potencial, ya que al ver todas las películas varias veces, empecé a notar que al parecer Palpatine era calculador y él pudo deducir de cierta manera mucho de lo que iba a suceder en la saga como si él hubiera planeado todo desde el principio y claramente el paso todo este tiempo en el planeta de los Sith mientras que el Palpatine de la sexta película no era nada más que un clon. Todo lo que se vio en la saga fue parte del gran plan de Palpatine y esta película revela eso de forma implícita. Incluso ya predecía de algún modo (en caso de emergencia) que si Rei no iba a tomar el mando, al menos ella terminaría lo que Palpatine quiso desde un principio y era la paz en la galaxia (como declaro en el episodio 3) y al parecer para conseguirlo, tanto los jedis, como los Sith y hasta el linaje de Skywalker tenían que morir y al final se cumplió ese objetivo. No por nada, Palpatine era el más grande Lord de los Sith porque su plan era perfecto, él era muy poderoso, lo cual lo hizo un Sith perfecto y no sería raro que esa perfección la haya heredado su nieta, ya que en el mundo real los nietos pueden heredar muchas características de sus abuelos, incluyendo la personalidad. En fin, creo que la saga termino bien, aunque quedaron algunas incógnitas que ojalá sean respondidas en las próximas entregas de la saga. Mi calificación para esta película es un 9/10.",POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2023",Anyone who says they liked this movie is lying to themselves. You thought the prequels were cringe...oh boy just you wait,NEGATIVE
"Mar 10, 2023",Terrible. Tried to fix a lot of the mess of The Last Jedi but the film was a convoluted mess. For the love of God Disney can you ruin Star Wars anymore?,NEGATIVE
"Mar 9, 2023","Well, apparently, studios disapproved the previous episode, so they chose to destroy it again and rebuilt it with plot holes, implausibilities, incoherences, and cheap plot twist. At the end, we have a unconsistent deformed trilogy, for (forever) very young kids only. Does it worth it? I don't know. 
Yet the pictures are beautiful",NEGATIVE
"Mar 9, 2023",I honestly really like this one. The action was cool and it had some nostalgic moments. I can defintly see the flaws. But its a guilty pleasure for me.,NEUTRAL
"Mar 7, 2023",Not Star Wars. Not even good enough to qualifiy it as a cringie fan fiction legend.,NEGATIVE
"Mar 7, 2023","This one manages to be worse than the episode VII, as the license owner continues to try to transfer the brand equity to the new characters while killing the original ones. This trilogy should not exist.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 6, 2023","As the final installment of the new Star Wars trilogy and the conclusion of the Skywalker saga, The Rise of Skywalker had a lot of expectations to meet. While it was a visually stunning and action-packed film, it struggled to balance its many plot threads and deliver a satisfying conclusion.

One of the strengths of the film was its cast, with Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, and John Boyega all delivering strong performances. The chemistry between the actors was also evident, providing an emotional anchor for the film. Additionally, the film's special effects and cinematography were top-notch, providing breathtaking visuals and exciting action sequences.

However, the film's plot felt overstuffed and rushed. There were multiple storylines and character arcs to follow, and the film struggled to give each one the attention it deserved. As a result, many plot points felt rushed or underdeveloped, and it was difficult to fully invest in the film's story.

The Rise of Skywalker also relied heavily on nostalgia and fan service, often at the expense of character development and plot logic. While some moments may have been enjoyable for longtime fans, they did little to advance the story or provide a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy.

In terms of direction, J.J. Abrams returned to helm the film after directing The Force Awakens, and while he was able to recapture the excitement of the franchise, the film suffered from a lack of cohesion and a clear vision. It felt like Abrams was trying to please everyone, resulting in a film that tried to do too much and ultimately fell short.

The film's score, composed by John Williams, was a highlight, as expected. The iconic Star Wars themes and motifs were used effectively, adding to the emotional weight of the film's key moments.

Overall, Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker was a flawed but enjoyable film. While it may not have been the satisfying conclusion that fans were hoping for, it was still an exciting and visually stunning adventure in the Star Wars universe.",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2023","This was ok, but enough already. This was a good conclusion to this gargantuan series of films that simply MUST put in every single easter egg from all the other films into it, and then some. Rey amd company join forces, and then go all over the place to discover how to get to Darth Sidious's lair and kill him once and for all. Rey and Kylo Ren still dont have the best relationship, and many many droids are seen. A fun watch, but I was glad when it was over.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 1, 2023","A frustratingly mediocre conclusion to the Skywalker saga. Poorly written, mostly concerned with fan service and undoing everything the previous movie set up. Bringing back the Emperor is the Star Wars equivalent of ‘jumping the shark'. Shame we will never see ‘Duel of the Fates'. As much as I love the Original Trilogy, Star Wars as a brand has become overrated.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 28, 2023","I wouldnt say I HATED this, but it's the type of thing you're glad to see done with (I'm not bothering with the Mandolirian at all). Rey finds out more about who she is, Ben finds out more about who HE is, and everyone gets ready for the battle that will essentially be a do or a die for the rebel fleet. Old characters come and go, the dumb humor that seems to have taken hold and refuses to let go is well, still there, and in the end, well, you're glad to see it's done.",NEUTRAL

"Feb 25, 2023",Dreadfully bad.  Like a bad marvel comics movie.  The plot doesn't even make sense.  The pacing was awful.   I can't say just how disappointed I am on this one.   Pretty sure lots of fake reviews (Disney bots) on this one.,NEGATIVE
"Feb 24, 2023","Ruins the entire franchise of Star Wars.  Star Wars was my love and life growing up, but I have grown distaste of it since the creation of the Sequels.

"Feb 21, 2023","A truly horrendous example of filmmaking.  Not only is it poorly written and directed, it effectively ruins one of the most important moments of the original trilogy where PALPATINE DIES (AND WE ALL SAW IT HAPPEN).  JJ Abrams is a small minded hack and a cultural vandal.  He will never be forgiven for ruining the most treasured film franchise of all time.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 20, 2023",Loved it. Critics and self proclaimed Star Wars experts got it wrong. This is a fun movie. Plot holes? Yes. Still enjoyed it as a popcorn classic nonetheless,POSITIVE
"Feb 17, 2023","My least favorite of the sequels, but I love them all. Billy Dee Williams returning as Lando is something to be treasured for a lifetime and Ian McDiarmid returning as Emperor Palpatine is a sight to behold! Great film!",POSITIVE
"Feb 14, 2023",The ending moment was the best part. That ending part was very nice in my opinion :),NEUTRAL
"Feb 13, 2023","JJ Abrams ensures the sequel trilogy was the worst of the 3 trilogies by essentially reconning half of what was added in The Last Jedi, almost like he wanted to sabotage what it added to the Star Wars story out of spite, while simultaneously characteristically thinking adding a huge battle scene with no story makes a good movie. TLJ was controversial but at least told a story and got creative. JJ Abrams took a hammer to it.

I just watched it 10 minutes ago and I couldn't even tell you what it's about (except for destroying the Empire [excuse me, ""The Final Order"", because apparently he even had to rename it again to make sure TLJ had no impact on the canon]), again, and some big battle scene that made no sense at the end and was full of bad writing. Even the characters seemed to have trouble getting on board with half the things in Abrams' contribution to the story.

The only thing that saved it is the Star Wars universe and continuity canon and story. That alone made it entertaining and a movie a Star Wars fan should obviously watch. But, as many diehard fans have, prepare to be outraged with the complete lack of respect to the SW universe and ROTS' predecessor, The Last Jedi, while simultaneously being hands down the worst title out of the 9 movies.

If you're going to take a hatchet to the last director's work because you don't like what they added to the canon and universe, at least be ready to do better. ROTS doesn't even get off the starting blocks.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 12, 2023","My fandom of Star Wars was inherited from my late uncle. I say this because it means that anything Star Wars reminds me of him and almost always makes he happy. This film did not have that affect. If I had to guess, not a single individual person actually cared about the finished product. This movie feels closer to living in Tsarist Russia than living in the world of Star Wars. Stay away and pray for the future.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 12, 2023",Absolutely loved the third trilogy and this one was perfect. Seeing the heroes of my childhood return was so emotional and I totally recommend these films.,POSITIVE
"Feb 9, 2023",A little lame with some very stupid plot points that don't make any sense but you could say that about the prequel‘s so meh very meh there's nothing really else to say except for kylo Ren was great but I really think Finn and Rey would be great together to be honest I kind of feel bad for Rose 5/10,NEGATIVE
"Feb 9, 2023","To be honest with you, I've seen this film twice, and I still don't quite understand anything about this universe. Star Wars to me, is just over the top world building that just confuses everybody. It's not something easy to take in and to understand he literally have to be glued to a television and write down in a logbook in order to keep up. This movie just completely did the same thing to me and threw me off, confused me, and then seen the world implode with the public completely demolishing this film, made my head spin multiple times. It's not a terrible movie but it's definitely something I've never revisited again",NEGATIVE
"Feb 7, 2023",Worst movie made and all of this due to J.J. Abrams terrible writing and story telling. He just killed the spirit of Star wars...,NEGATIVE

"Feb 1, 2023","I am a huge Star Wars fan and I have to say, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  It was obviously rushed, poorly written, poorly conceived, regurgitated material, that lacked any of the spark that George Lucas created.  Disney really needs to take Star Wars is an uncharted direction and allow the creatives to execute their own vision.  This was like watching bad anime that I would prefer didn't exist in the continuity.  The fact that the sequel trilogies didn't even have a solid arc mapped out prior to filming shows that this entire IP is being mismanaged and it needs to be saved for the fandom.",NEGATIVE

"Jan 29, 2023","This is absolute garbage. My living room couch would make a better Executive Producer than Kathleen Kennedy. I am convinced you could write a better film by cramming dialogue into a baby, and then having it projectile vomit across the room. I saw this in cinema, and it was a waste of $30 and the better part of three hours. Three hours that could have been spent doing something better, more wholesome, and healthier for the brain, like eating a 10-course meal made entirely of asbestos. The writers have such a severe lack of intelligence that I'm surprised they have the brainpower to breathe. This film is one of the biggest affronts to the entirety of cinema history I have ever seen, right up there with Jar Jar Binks and the Eragon movie.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 29, 2023","bad, movie retconed the origonals and prequels. when anakin killed the emporor in the origonals he brought balance to the force and the fact that the emporor is still alive ruins the point of the first 6 movies along with the fact that all matirials are recicled over and over agian. however this brought a satisfing and spectacular end to the carrer of who ever wrote this crap!",NEGATIVE

It really leaves you with an empty feeling.",NEGATIVE

"Jan 24, 2023","""Somehow Palpatine has returned.""

In the aftermath of TLJ they had their hands full trying to fix all of the problems the second movie in this series had introduced, and while there are a few good moments, overall they failed. The previous movie left things in such a mess that in an attempt to make this one better they went too deeply into the well of nostalgia and ended up creating some of the worst moments in Star Wars.

I'm a huge Star Wars fan, but the Disney era hasn't been good for star Wars movies. Go watch The Mandalorian, or Andor and skip this.",NEGATIVE

It had so much potential… I really wanted to like it…
It has some great ideas and visuals. Secret dead sith world with cool army, a reborn Palpatine, but it does virtually nothing with them, does nothing to justify or earn them, and makes no sense lore wise at all, and doesn't even try to explain them at all.

"Jan 18, 2023","Palpatine died in Episode 6. Darth Vader, during his redemptive arc, killed him by throwing him down a reactor shaft. Even if Palpatine survived the fall, the Death Star blew up, which would've killed him. Bringing him back undermines the redemptive arc for Darth Vader. Besides that, the movie doesn't feel as epic as it should for a finale. It doesn't have any phenomenal battles or remarkable lightsaber fights. Furthermore, Rey, Poe, and Finn aren't given enough backstory. Rey is a palpatine, but this concept is never explored, and the movie doesn't say much about Finn or Poe. This whole trilogy by Disney was a massive disappointment.",NEGATIVE

Should have went with George's original plan for the sequels.

Why not have the First Order based out of the cloning planet in this case, I wonder?; (4) The compass thingy.

"Nov 1, 2022","I don't know how J.J. Abrams managed to go from a great movie like The Force Awakens to a disaster like Rise of Skywalker. This atrocity breaks every already established rules of Star Wars by adding any power that the plot requires. A good movie has a protagonist that has flaws. And in the third movie featuring Rey, she seems to lack any flaw at all. There are absolutely no stakes in this movie. The villain was completely unoriginal. It seems that the writers seemed to have forgotten that the Emperor died in Return of the Jedi. And the addition of a love story that makes as much sense as Count Dooku and Jar Jar Binks. This movie is lucky that Solo exists because it is the only thing that saves it from being the worst Star Wars movie. I would rather watch the Star Wars Holiday Special and three Ewok spin offs consecutively.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 28, 2022","I was surprised at how bad this movie was. JJ Abrams usually has great tastes when it comes to sci-fi, but his charm just wasn't there. The entire movie was a rushed hodge podge of fan service, featuring no original score, a cringeworthy opening crawl, and no feeling whatsoever. Palpatine was really boring in this movie, which I would never say about his performance in the other movies. The ending, where Poe says ""There's too many of them"" and Lando saying ""But there are more of us"" was just TRYING TO AVENGERS ENDGAME SO HARD. But this movie is nowhere near as good as Endgame. Hell, in my opinion, it's not even nearly as good as the other Star Wars movies (yes, that includes the prequels and the Last Jedi). This movie just killed my interest in the franchise that I hold very close to my heart. It was so tiring, none of the characters were likable, and was clearly an example of Disney having a tight deadline on everything. If this movie had more time in the oven, it could've been something special. But it's not.",NEGATIVE

"Oct 23, 2022",The Rise of Skywalker perfectly concluded this Legendary Skywalker Saga of Star Wars. The twist of palpatine is one of the best in SW. Rey being Palpatine's descendant makes much more sense considering her raw powers. This movie tributed the saga and legacy characters perfectly. Stunning work by JJ Abrams.

The conclusion makes no sense if you are a 48 year old gamer man living in their mum's basement but to someone who likes the franchise and can accept it for what it is. The VFX are stunning and Palpatine is awesome either way. My only quarrel is inventing a fourth (Tatooine, Genosis, Jakku) desert planet. JUST PICK ONE! The colour palette is extremely recognisable, a blue grey dominating the film. Kylo Ren is menacing, however I do think Kelly Marie Tran's Rose Tico was sidelined substantially in this instalment, undoing all of the Last Jedi.

"Oct 17, 2022","Made a RT account just to give it 1 star. Messy way to end the trilogy, they obviously didn't plan out the whole trilogy together, they just tried to throw in a bunch of fan service to make a big ending.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 16, 2022","The movie delivered on a conclusion, all right--It just didn't deliver on much else.

To its credit, this film had some bold ideas, but they weren't very good, and too much of the movie felt like the studio was trying to clean up after the terrible Last Jedi. The movie as a whole feels lazy, and while the ending has the finality of what someone would expect from the conclusion of a decades-old franchise, it doesn't feel earned. After the first act, the plot feels predictable and boring, the character development is almost nonexistent (THREE major characters have fake-out deaths or conclusions that are then retconned within minutes), and the script is borderline amateur. 

While the cast is still great, they really had their work cut out for them on this one.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 16, 2022","This is another pretty decent CGI filled Star Wars films, with some impressive landscapes, quirky characters/creatures (including Babu Frik( and some good dialogue.

"Oct 15, 2022",Star wars was a magnificent franchise but now the saga has ended but with an amazing conclusion. Although the final duel didn't left any memorable sensation for the franchise as a finale,POSITIVE
"Oct 14, 2022","The dysfunction of the sequel trilogy is on full display with The Rise of Skywalker. I wonder what JJ Abrams and Rian Johnson's relationship is like, because according to these films, they absolutely despise each other. From the line, ""A Jedi's weapon deserves more respect"" to the minimization of Rose, to the following interaction, ""We need to pull some Holdo maneuvers""... ""Come on. That move is one in a million"", Abrams is purposefully jabbing at The Last Jedi the whole film.

Take away those feelings of division, and this film is still not very good. It was nice to see the three heroes on a journey together (though that probably should have happened in Episode VII). There are some truly stunning visual sequences (though not as good as Episode VIII).

Unfortunately, since the stakes keep getting raised every film (Death Star, bigger Death Star, fleet of Death Stars, etc.) my investment level is very low. When Finn says, ""We take the war to them!"", I stopped and wondered ""who exactly is ""them""?

A disappointing end to a retcon mess of a trilogy, it's frustrating to think about the potential of what could have been.

Best Character: Poe
Best Scene: Passing the lightsaber from Rey to Kylo (though I don't love the implications with force manipulation, the scene is pretty cool)
Best Quote: ""In the event I don't make it back, I want you to know you've been a real friend, R2. My best one, in fact."" - C3PO",NEGATIVE
"Oct 12, 2022","As a lifelong fan of Star Wars, it is sad to see what the franchise has become. The film tries to please as many people as possible and as a result it feels soulless as if it were created on an assembly line. While all films lie somewhere on the spectrum between art and commodity, this feels so removed from any passion that so many feel for the franchise that it feels like a nauseating roller coaster you never think about again once you get off of it. Disney has discovered they can throw near anything out the masses and rake in a billion dollars that their desire to tell compelling stories is gone.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 8, 2022",This movie is devoid of any story. It is one big noisy music video with little or no plot. Doesn't help that you have a main villain that is like a raging twit throughout and a heroine that is so OP it is a pointless character. This is worse than the Ep 1-3 and second worst SW movie of all time after the idiotic Last Jedi where people can breathe in space with no consequences,NEGATIVE
"Oct 6, 2022","The plot was a complete mess, and after about 40 minutes, I started to think that maybe I had missed a movie in this series because I had absolutely no understanding what was happening! And even when the movie ended (finally), I was still confused about what the point of it was. You had to see it to believe it, but everyone in this movie possessed superpowers that could rival Superman's, and they were all on the move, looking for artefacts and heading somewhere. The upcoming films better be a bit different or even take some inspiration from the old films as there was nothing really wrong with them.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 5, 2022","It's hard to get my feelings on this movie at times and the movie's narrative is a bit McGuffiny and messy, The Rise of Skywalker is still a brilliant movie with fabolous performances, a great portrayal of Palpatine, epic action, solid humor and shocking moments that make this the perfect conclusion to the 42 years old Skywalker Saga. (enter false)",NEGATIVE

"Oct 5, 2022",Plot is kinda weird. Bringing palpatine back was a terrible idea. A couple dumb moments in the plot and some dumb characters. Entertaining but not satisfying,NEGATIVE
"Oct 4, 2022","I will openly acknowledge that this film is considerably more entertaining and considerably less insulting (both as a Star Wars fan and as a human that believes in decency) than The Last Jedi, and unlike that horrible film, I can see myself maybe revisiting this movie from time to time - I mean, we're talking maybe once or twice a decade, but it's not alongside TLJ in my: ""I genuinely hope I never have to go through that again"" list of films.  Having said that, The Rise of Skywalker is a very, very, very dumb film, overblown in every conceivable way, and chock-full of contrivances that come from absolutely nowhere to allow the plot to progress (at a clip that was likely set solely so nobody in the audience can stop and think about how stupid it all is).  However, considering that EVERY plot thread from The Force Awakens was severed and made irrelevant in The Last Jedi, it's clear that the writers were forced to come up with something to completely rewrite this now completely broken trilogy.  I will also give the movie that it actually does have some good action sequences - something that was, somehow, almost entirely missing from its two predecessors, and both the cinematography and Art Design are better than in the previous entry as well.  The music is solid and the VFX (which I actually helped with -- not as an artist but as someone who actually helped fix a problem with a render farm!  No, seriously!!) are generally very solid as well.  The acting is kinda flat, but at this point it was clear that the morale of those involved with this trilogy had plummeted, so I don't discredit the Actors or the Director.  And in terms of things that this movie genuinely does right, it does allow the three main characters to be together for much of the movie (which is good as they have a unified charisma when together), the movie doesn't have the morally repugnant lessons that its predecessor had, and while I hated the finale from a story perspective, I do appreciate what it actually tried to do; like, serious points for trying.  They also had a moment I genuinely loved where Chewbacca breaks down and cries when Leia dies (her actress passed away before filming, so this isn't a spoiler), as characters grieving the losses of those that they, and the audience, loved was something also sorely missing from this film's predecessor.  The biggest flaw, really, beyond the almost insultingly contrived plot, is that the reintroduction of Palpatine as the main villain only acts to negate (almost entirely) the struggles of the main heroes in the original Trilogy.  It's odd, as simply having this be a different villain would've made this a lot better.  Overall, The Rise of Skywalker has fireworks, has energy, has charisma and has brain-damage - it tries and utterly fails, but I actually felt like the film wanted me to be happy, and so, truthfully, I cannot bring myself to hate it, despite how bad it ultimately is.",NEGATIVE
"Sep 30, 2022","Unlike the Force Awakens or Last Jedi, it is boring and the story is lame. This title doesn't even deserve the name ‘Star Wars' to be in its title. Such a sad way to end a great franchise. Absolute shit show…4/10",NEGATIVE

The failed attempt to make meaningful dialogue out of the few Carrie Fisher scenes leftover from earlier movies are a slap in the face to a great actress.  Director JJ Abrahams seems more intent on making a collection of catchy scenes than of building a compelling story.  It even rips off The Goonies at one point (the knife map).

"Sep 17, 2022","The Rise of Skywalker manages to undo the most important character arc of the original trilogy for the sake of having a bad guy that people recognize. Canon is destroyed, interesting characters (like Finn) are sidelined and wasted and we're left with an incohesive and relatively unmemorable mess. As the capper of the ""Sequel Trilogy"" fans of the franchise will actually long for the Prequels. 

If you're a Star Wars fan that hasn't seen this, you'd do best to avoid it and watch Clone Wars, Rebels, or Mandalorian instead.",NEGATIVE
"Sep 15, 2022","The first film was a microwaved leftover of the original trilogy, the second was an embarrassing attempt to subvert expectations at all costs. This final film was just a desperate last attempt to recover something lost along the way. It was just a bitter disappointment at the end of an awful, disjointed trilogy.

Don't get me wrong, as always a star wars film is a visual spectacle. In that regard alone this film succeeded. In all other ways, including the atrocious PR from disney before and after the films release, treating disgruntled long-term fans and critics like perpetrators of hate crimes, the movie failed utterly. Every plot twist and reveal seemed horribly contrived. Every attempt at humor was forced. Even the action scenes came across as though the showrunners treated it like some kind of obligation somehow. In the end though, don't know what I find more worthy of contempt. This film's bizarre, lackluster script or the fans of the film with their heads in the sand. Save yourself the trouble and avoid the online community, its a toxic wasteland. The film is not much better.",NEGATIVE
"Sep 14, 2022","With the disaster that was its predecessor, the odds were stacked against this film. It does an okay job at trying to salvaging this trilogy, but ultimately the whole story feels chaotic, ill-thought and rushed. As well as bouncing around all over the place, I feel it missed opportunities to give long-time fans some payoff - Hayden Christensen should have had a cameo in this film. It's a suitably disappointing conclusion to a forgettable trilogy.",NEUTRAL
"Sep 13, 2022",A very hollow ending. The characters didn't have any trouble with anything they just happened to stumble upon every they needed. The whole trilogy didn't even have a plan from the beginning. It feels like you can see the director Jj Abrams fighting with the director of the last movie (the last Jedi directed by Ryan Johnson) on screen. And in the end the person with no training is able to beat emporer Palpatine at the most powerful he has ever been without even trying just deflecting his lightning back at him which Palpatine knows hurts him so he should have stopped when it started. Also the Anakin is the one supposed to bring balance to the force yet this character if you can call her that has not had any training and brings balance to the force.,NEGATIVE

"Sep 10, 2022","It's acceptable... The prequels are worse than this but comparing the films doesn't make this a good movie it's still a mess. Somehow a character that we HAVEN'T seen in years & hasn't been mentioned or hinted at returns as the main villain of the movie with no explanation other than ""Somehow Palpatine has returned"". I also hate how the force is used in this movie as basically plot magic I don't mind if the force is used in new ways we haven't seen before but using the force to just explain every question in the movie is frustrating. The only thing that works in this film for me is Kylo Ren except for his redemption it felt super lazy & generic to me & the fact that Rey beat him many times before this film so it makes me not find him as much of a threat when he is up against Rey.",NEGATIVE

It is completely devoid of soul rehashing character arcs already completed to bring back a long obsolete character that died meaningfully and that we were done with. It is riddled with constant plot holes and half of the films run time is a fetch quest filled with padding and complications that amount to nothing. This film is a complete failure of all imagination. It fails at every opportunity to come up with anything new. I assume children who haven't seen the originals, who are unable  to understand the references will leave this movie confused and unimpressed by how underwhelming the film is. You could have 1000 nostalgic feel good moments but it could never be a good story. Instead of continuing the story that was set up with the last jedi they decided to make a nostalgic omage to star wars. And the worst part is the retconing of luke skywalker who died meaningfully saving the rebellion. Luke's sacrifice was meant to be showing the galaxy the legendary warrior version of luke, the hero, despite the fact that that version of Luke didnt really exist. That didnt matter because he played the part anyway buying time for the rebellion to escape and create a legend that will inspire hope for generations. But what does this film do? It undermines all of that by having Luke catch the lightsaber and saying that all of his previous conclusions were wrong. All because some dipshits who don't understand story telling didnt want good ol Luke skywalker to die this way because I dont know apparently Luke is supposed to be fucking imortal or something. The rise of skywalker is by far the most disgusting, unimaginative and pathetic piece of cinema I have ever had the displeasure of witnessing",NEGATIVE

"Aug 22, 2022","It's pretty much one of the worst Star Wars movies. I gave it one full star instead of half a star only because the movie is technically good (sound, visual effects etc.). The movie fails to provide sensible character motivations and comprehensible pacing. The worst offense is how it breaks the lore of previous films. Anakin's sacrifice and redemption didn't mean anything. The struggles of the rebellion were for nothing and an old baddie is shoehorned in because Star Wars is afraid to do anything different.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 22, 2022","No direction, character development, and senseless plots.  Granted, there was no direction, or point in the last one to come up with a way to continue it, the idea made no sense, and destroyed the points of the originals.  They should have outlined a story before starting the sequels.  The Empire had countless people suddenly to run each Star Destroyer?  Everyone is wishy-washy on what side they are on?",NEGATIVE
"Aug 22, 2022",Does not even deserve half a star. Absolute garbage that completely retcons the prophecy of the chosen one.

"Aug 21, 2022","It's very hard to get behind this movie. I disagree with the very way that they set out to make it honestly. They felt the need to wrap up the trilogy, as well as every other episode in the series, while at the same time catering to the people who hated all of the changes from The Last Jedi. Within that context, they probably did make the best movie they could. But that's just way too much to try to cram into one movie, and I feel it's unnecessary in the first place. The only good thing I can say about it really, is that it does bring everything to a conclusion. Nothing is really left unanswered, even if it was answered in a terribly clunky way. Really, it's just painful to watch this trilogy at all, knowing how it ends, and how much better it could have been.

Without a Dave Filoni or a Favreau breathing life into it, Rise comes across as incredibly boring and contrived in narrative. While seeing it once on the big screen might trick you into thinking it's epic, rewatches and stripping back the visual appeal betray poorly written characters, abysmal dialogue even compared to George Lucas scripts, and-- most sinful-- a Star Wars movie that isn't very much fun at all.

If you're going to essentially rewrite one of, if not THE, best trilogies of all time, at least make it make sense.  But, no... Disney had other ideas.  A Palpatine bringing balance to The Force?  Kylo Ren murdering his father, only to be turned to the Light by said Palpatine?  And then to top it off, the return of THE Palpatine because, well... clones?  I've seen and heard better storytelling from my 6-year old niece.  This trilogy made a mockery of the originals and even the prequels (it was that bad) and spat in the face of George Lucas, Mark Hammill and even Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher.

I wish that Babu could free my memory from this disgrace of a trilogy, as he did with C3PO. The only part of this entire trilogy I found entertaining is when Kylo Ren died. BB8 is technologically impaired, and it is unable to even open simple doorways or passages. The insignificant droid had to be carried up a small hill to survive.

Poe gets an unoriginal and dull back story, Finn is their too. I think Rey is a good character, but the sudden romance that was never built up was pointless and was there really no better ideas than to make her a Palpitine.

"Nov 22, 2020","I've been a Star Wars fan since I was a kid and this movie, The Rise of Skywalker, was a mess. Never have I been so unbelievably frustrated while watching a movie in the theater. I honestly don't know where to begin. First off, this easily could have been made into two or three fairly decent films, but unfortunately, this movie was rushed from beginning to end, important plot revelations were sloppily thrown into the script without any setup from the previous two films in the trilogy, the sheer amount of retcons shoved down the audience's throat to appease those who disliked The Last Jedi (which I also didn't enjoy) were mind boggling, and I'm not even going to talk about the insulting amount of in-your-face fan service moments which, despite their efforts, did not make me care in the slightest about what was going on. I felt nothing. There were a few redeeming qualities: for example, the visual effects were stunning and the acting was pretty good, there were a few jokes here and there that brought a chuckle out of me, but overall, the Rise of Skywalker was so forgettable that it's honestly hard to write this review right now and I watched it like a month ago.",NEGATIVE
"Nov 22, 2020","They should have called it ""Star Wars: The Rise of Deus Ex Machina"".  There is a single redeeming quality to this movie- well, maybe two.  The first is the line ""Poe Dameron, spice runner, runner of spice.""  The second is that the yellow lightsaber is cool.  But everything else is so inconceivably horrendous that you just HAVE to wonder why JJ Abrams would do this to us.  The Force Awakens was a sign of the death of Star Wars movies, and this is the final nail in the coffin.",NEGATIVE

The directors are cowards!",NEUTRAL
"Nov 17, 2020","This movie just like the rest of the new ones didn't make any sense whatsoever. I truly understand now when Daisy Ridley said in an interview that the writers had no idea who was going to be the ""Big Bad"" in the last episode, since they killed off Snoke in the previous movie. Palpatine coming back made zero sense, since there wasn't any buildup in the previous movies whatsoever, and him being beaten by a Mary Sue character that didn't have any character development at all. She acquired all her Jedi powers and mastering the lightsaber in such a short time with any shortcomings unlike the previous main characters, so Palpatine being defeated so easily is just ridiculous. Sad that the writers didn't know what they were doing at all and turned an interesting character like Rey into one of the worst ever made.",NEGATIVE
"Nov 16, 2020","I grew up with the originals and have to say, I don't get what the critics have a problem with. This was a really fun, exciting, and satisfying Star Wars film.

A grande verdade é que faltou a coragem que o George Lucas teve com as Prequels, de tentar algo novo, os filmes podem não ser grandes coisas ( embora considere o Vingança dos Sith o melhor Star Wars ) mas tinham personalidade e a historia não tropeçava e tinham continuidade, enquanto essa nova trilogia não tem sequencia e não teve planejamento, George Lucas escreveu as 2 Trilogias antes de fazer o filme, algo que claramente não foi feito nesses filmes que toda hora variavam os diretores e roteiristas, mostrando que a Disney fez a compra de Star Wars pensando em vender brinquedos e ampliar seu parque em Orlando ( nenhum problema nisso, mas faz algo bem feito pelo menos ).",NEGATIVE

Absolutely nonsensical plot from beginning to end, as if the script was a 2nd grade writing project.  Every character was wasted because JJ and Chris Terrio had no interest in taking on the challenge.  At least The Last Jedi dared to be a film with a coherent story.

"Jun 10, 2020","I don't think this movie is as bad as some people says. It was definitely the best theater experience compared to the rest of the trilogy, although when you think about it the plot makes no sense at all. Palpatine returning and getting killed the way he is killed is a terrible idea, not only because undermines the whole OT and Anakin's redemption but also because it makes him look like a dumb idiot who can't stop shooting lightning until half of his face is melted. The protagonists dynamic between each other is decent, although individually the characters are not compelling at all. Rey is not a memorable hero, Poe is the same character as in TFA and Finn is just... there, yelling and playing with space horses. As inclusive as this movies are supposed to be, the writers are too cowards to romantically pair the only two characters that have some sort of chemistry in the whole trilogy, Finn and Poe. Instead, they find a female romantic interest for BOTH of them. Kylo and Rey kissing in the end is as funny as dumb, he was literally Hitler a few hours before that but hey, he is good now! The whole wayfinder search was boring as hell and ultimately pointless as Kylo just smashes the damn thing, the attempt to put Leia in the movie by using unused footage from TFA is passable at best and the whole concept behind the Palpatine's fleet is just awful. The fact that the ships don't know which way is up still irritates me, and I don't understand why did they think that making them all capable of destroying entire planets was a good thing. Even with all these terrible mistakes, there are some aspects of the movie that are decent. The music is good as always, the visuals are stunning, the movie in general is pretty entertaining and the lightsaber duel, even though is nowhere as good as the ones in the prequels, is decent. Oh, and Babu Frik is incredibly cute.",NEGATIVE

Like the Prequels or The Room we like watching bad movies to make fun of them, but to my absolute amazement it wasn't even fun to laugh at. It was so incredibly boring that I just found myself dosing off with nothing to say. The only fun we had was yelling ""REY!!!"" every time Finn did. The whole thing is just so empty. I remember watching TLJ and hating the part where Luke drinks the milk. I remember just like ""ew, gross"" but now I'm like ""At least that scene makes me FEEL SOMETHING"" TROS makes me feel nothing. It's such an empty shell of a movie that I might as well be a toddler staring at a spinning mobile and some flashing lights.

From the start of this film, it should be glaringly obvious to the viewer that there was no conversation as to how the sequels should be laid out before they were made.

The Rise of Skywalker is the peak of this trend, as the film itself seems to be a desperate search for some kind of conclusive end to the sequel trilogy and Star Wars as a whole. But given how lack luster, ham fisted and tone deaf this grand finale was from start to end, for me at least, the saga ends on Endor.",NEGATIVE

Not only did they reverse all the feats of the original trilogy characters, but it also proved useless and nonsensical to the rest of the subpar sequel trilogy. The editing of the movie gave it a ridiculously fast pace. The entire movie attempts to catch up for lost time from TLJ. A lot of time is spent reversing a lot of the strange decisions made in TLJ too, which could have been a refreshing change for the sequel trilogy-- but the change was pulled off so lazily. The reinsertion of Palpatine was just a bad decision on the writing team's part. It makes little to no sense in the pre-sequel canon. Overall the sequel trilogy proves to be completely detached from the rest of the Skywalker story line, and this final nail in the coffin just solidified my disdain for the trilogy.

While not as critically or deep like The Last Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back. The Rise of Skywalker truly captured the Star Wars spirit and you can tell by how much of a fan JJ Abrams is for the Star Wars universe! Daisy Ridley's journey as Rey finally gets the well deserved ending she struggled for throughout the films. Adam Driver's performance as Kylo Ren again was one of the best on screen and without any words can sell his character's performance. C-3PO having a larger role was great too and the new alien characters were fantastic! Lando's return was amazing. Mark Hamill killed it as a force ghost and the use of Carrie Fisher was bittersweet as the final chance we will see Princess Leia again. John Boyega as Finn is a bit underdeveloped, but still glad to see. The ending is as epic and reminiscent of the celebration at the end of the Return of the Jedi. Rey's final scene was truly earned and I am so glad of her new name that she worked so hard for!",POSITIVE
"May 20, 2020","Well, I'm finally writing a review, because I didn't care to see Rise of Skywalker in theaters. Anything that followed the storyline of The Last Jedi was going to be garbage anyway, but aside from that, RoS suffers from lack of continuity to the previous trilogies. Like TLJ, there are so many things that happen in RoS where it's like ""Well why didn't this character do that move in ""Episode whatever"" to avoid this problem or defeat that enemy?"" And there are way too many coincidences as well. Getting into specifics would just take too long here. I'm not saying the Original Trilogy doesn't have flaws, and the Prequel Trilogy is loaded with cringey moments (but can largely be fixed with good editing), but at least the PT maintained decent continuity and honored the OT. The entire Sequel Trilogy was a jumbled up mess of rehashes, breaking continuity, and disgracing the original characters that made Star Wars so popular in the first place. And bringing the Emperor back to life? That's just bad, desperate writing. The one good thing about RoS is finally seeing some interaction between Rey, Finn, and Poe all together. But it's far too late for it to mean anything now. That really should have begun in The Force Awakens. TFA started off okay (despite doing the A New Hope storyline rip-off), but as soon as they broke continuity by having Rey go from nothing to a super force goddess in the space of a couple days in TFA, I knew the ST was in serious trouble. And then TLJ was far worse than anything I could have imagined. RoS wasn't as bad as TLJ, but it was pathetic and sad to watch. Nothing against the actors or production crew, but the writing of the entire ST is garbage. I guess they were in a rush to try and make money fast rather than give more polishing to pre-production to create something truly great, make tons more money off of it, and have fans be excited for more. Now Star Wars is nothing to get excited about, well, the new Star Wars anyway. It's the biggest cinematic failure in history. But the old Star Wars is still wonderful after 40 years! But Disney is so rich, they probably don't care.",NEGATIVE
"May 20, 2020","The Rise of Skywalker was a mindless cash grab, going against not only The Last Jedi but against the whole of the Saga previously. Multiple continuity and lore errors, a nonsensical plot and an ending that did not spark any genuine emotion. Just a representation of the lifeless corpse that is the Sequel Trilogy",NEGATIVE
"May 19, 2020","FIVE STAR EXCELLENT !!! 
A film which should unite the fans base after the last film split it in two , a fast paced film which brings a touching sense of nostalgia  to the true  star wars fans . The Best Film in the trilogy for sure.",POSITIVE
"May 19, 2020","I finally bit the bullet and watched it on Disney+. It was so much worse than I feared and my expectations were already low. Quite possibly this is the most creatively barren film ever to appear on movie screens in wide release. It is one thing to play it safe with the most expensive film franchise acquisition in the history of cinema, but it is quite another to wilfully reduce it to a theme park ride without even attempting to fool the audience into believing that they are actually witnessing a story unfolding on a screen",NEGATIVE
"May 19, 2020","Another embarrassment. The Last Jedi was worse, but my hopes for the trilogy to be redeemed by this movie was crushed. Terrible movie.",NEGATIVE
"May 15, 2020","Rise of Skywalker serves up heavy doses of fan service which ultimately fall flat because they lack the emotional resonance of the films they reference. The film jumps quickly from one jaw-dropping visual to the next, hoping the audience won't notice it is taking moments it has not earned--not logically, not emotionally. 

To cite just a couple of many possible examples: Rey's overcome of the villain? It didn't require a hero's journey to overcome a flaw, just a second lightsaber. Finn, Poe, and Rey embracing at the end? We must believe there is an intense bond there because there was witty banter in the first act and, hey, they look like they might be crying.

In the end, Rise of Skywalker is cotton candy--a powerful sensory stimulation, but not filling.",NEGATIVE
"May 15, 2020",Great film! Made up for the last one and saves the trilogy!,POSITIVE
"May 15, 2020",Awful. A poor end to a struggling trilogy,NEGATIVE
"May 15, 2020","Ugh. That nearly sums up my reaction to this film. The only reason it gets a full star is because the 8th was worse. That is this movie's only saving grace. I know that a lot of the bad story, character development and premises can be tracked back to the previous shit show but that doesn't mean this movie didn't suck. It was a chore to watch. I literally just wanted to keep skipping ahead because I didn't care what was happening. It is not an engaging or entertaining movie. I won't rewatch even a minute of it on Youtube or while sitting down to marathon Star Wars. It is that bad. Save your money and/or time and rewatch the good Star Wars movies...UGH!",NEGATIVE
"May 15, 2020","Spoiler Alert:


At the end of the movie, when rei kills palpatine, Jar Jar Binks should have come from the shadows behind the throne ""Yousa thought he was da sif lord, but noo, ita was meesa"" and proceed to butcher rei.  kylo, instead of getting out of the hole, slinks back down after seeing the horrific sight.  rebels lose, set up for next movie w/ Jar Jar Binks as main villian.  Ende",NEGATIVE
"May 15, 2020",Its flashy and fun to watch but by the end its too convoluted with plot holes. Too many things are vaguely unexplained or not at all. So many things feel un earned due to lazy writing.,NEGATIVE
"May 14, 2020","I was pleasantly surprised at how well the Rise of Skywalker handled Leah and her part in the saga despite Carrie Fisher  passing away over a year before principal photography began on the movie.  I am glad they built scenes around footage they had previously filmed of her in character and were able to complete her story that way.  The movie did seem to jump and fly at times too quickly and in a seemingly random way but after having seen it twice the movie did a very good job of tying up lose ends and carrying the observer through the entire saga to its conclusion.  

I did not like ""The last Jedi"" at first but after going back and watching it probably about 3 times my attitude has changed and I do like it.   I love the way Luke shows up towards the end to stand up (even if he was a type of telepathic holographic form) against the 1st Order and allow the Rebel Alliance to escape certain destruction at the hands of the Empire.  I loved the way Yoda showed up and worked  Luke through the problems he had with handling the Force and how his fears were probably the one thing most effective in holding him back from his potential.   The conflict and yet connection between Kylo and Rey was very interesting and I knew it would play a big part in the ""Rise of Skywalker"" as it did.

This is also what Luke had to convey to Rey as he appeared to her in ""Rise of Skywalker"" that she had to turn lose of her fears.  She had to realize that she was NOT alone.  Every Jedi that ever lived was alive in her now.  She had much more power and capability than she ever imagined.  She WAS up to the challenge.

If you like Star Wars as I do,   If you liked all of the first three and at least tolerated the prequil trilogy of Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones, and Revenge of the Syth,  and if you had any appreciation at all for The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi I believe you will appreciate this film.   It is not perfect but it does a GREAT job of wrapping things up.

One of my favorite things about this film is that they made a part for one of the greatest musical composer, conductors, and score writers in history John Williams in the movie.  There is a little shot of John Williams as a repair tech working on a set that included an artifact drawn from every film he has scored and that has been nominated for an academy award.  This included Jaws, Star Wars, Schindler's List, Home Alone, The Patriot, Fiddler on the Roof, Memoirs of a Geisha, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Saving Private Ryan,   It was a real treat to see him in the movie now as an Actor even though the above referenced music covers a period of over 60 years and his age is over 90 years old.

This movie gets two thumbs up from me.  I enjoyed it and would recommend it to any Star Wars fan.",POSITIVE
"May 14, 2020",1st it must be said it was impossible to delivery a quality ending after TLJ. As expected ROS failed to close out the Skywalker trilogy in an enjoyable way after a promising start with TFA. This movie had potential but ultimately found itself catch in-between trying to walk back some of the more questionable decisions from episode 8 while at the same time advancing the current story. That level of ambition was far too much for a 2.5hr film. In the end it didn't do enough to retcon episode 8 and didn't leave enough screen time to tell a competent story. Which was the worst case scenario.,NEGATIVE
"May 14, 2020","The whole movie feels like it's riding off of past movie themes instead of creating something new. When it does attempt to create something new, it dumps the information into the movie without any past explanation of evidence of it existing before this movie. Even with that in mind, the movie still has amazing action sequences and effects that fill the movie with eye pleasing scenes.",NEGATIVE
"May 14, 2020","Watched it 3 times hoping that somehow, somewhere I would find some redeeming quality in this movie...but it doesn't exist.  This movie is terrible, but I guess it is a fitting end to the dumpster fire that was the trilogy headed by Kathleen Kennedy, Rian Johnson, and J.J. Abrams - for that reason alone I give it a half star.  Otherwise, it deserves no star.",NEGATIVE
"May 14, 2020",Decent movie considering it had to wipe out all the sh*t of the Last Jedi!,NEUTRAL
"May 14, 2020",A visual and narrative trainwreck. This film was the feature-length cinematic equivalent of losing my religion.,NEGATIVE
"May 13, 2020","This movie ruins Star Wars. Luckily I can look past this trilogy and watch the original 6 films in peace; however, this film implements TRASH writing and GARBAGE storytelling to convey what seems like a 16 year old's fan fiction brought to life with millions of Disney dollars. Palpatine's return after Ep 6 fundamentally destroys nearly 30 years of Star Wars character development and story. To enjoy this movie is a SIN

First, let's get the positives away. Star Wars Episode 9: The Rise of Skywalker looks really beautiful. The VFX's are amazing.
And the score. The score is also amazing. But what would you expect with John Williams.
And then nothing else makes sense. Sure there is some good moments thrown in here and there, but there are not many of them.

"Apr 17, 2020","This feels like a major step back from the previous film, one devoid of creativity or passion",NEGATIVE
"Apr 17, 2020",When I saw this movie I had to really think about how I felt about it. It's not bad but it could've been way better. Characters could've been explained better and the story could've been explained better. The plot is really messy and the acting is okay. The humor is toned down a lot compared to the Last Jedi but overall I think this was a disappointing conclusion to the Skywalker Saga. This trilogy could have been way better than it was and it is really disappointing the decisions that were made. So it's fine but could have been a lot better,NEUTRAL

"Apr 16, 2020","If I could give 0 stars, I would. Since I was a kid, I have LOVED star wars; from a New Hope to Revenge of the Sith. The newest trilogy, while it is visually sufficient (it's a star wars movie) the story line literally regurgitated the original (ep 4-6) with one exception: Palpatine. Of course, I'm talking about ""legends"" star wars (since I don't recognize the new star wars, its cannon) where Palps had hundreds of clones; plus, Ben Solo wasn't evil, his older brother Jacen Solo was (complicated story). This movie leaves more questions than answers and was a complete waste of time to actual star wars fans. It's just a travesty, over used cash grab and I regret watching this film.",NEGATIVE
"Apr 16, 2020",Star Wars 9 é o melhor filme de todos os tempos,POSITIVE
"Apr 15, 2020","So I've seen and read numerous reviews by raging nerds, who deny themselves fun because whatever star wars lore they bought into. Please, do not let those reviews spoil YOUR fun with the movie - sure there are some minor plot-holes here, but let's be frank : who the hell cares, if you can't hyper-space skip in milennium falcon. Since the nerd culture is now mainstream, it seems there's easily milions of people who care for such bs. And yes I too was raised watching original Star Wars on VHS and yes I too despise the prequels. That said, I utterly enjoyed watching and rewatching the new trilogy, including this one which made so many ""critics"" salty. See the glass half full, take the zen approach is my advice here. The light side will help you overlook some minor lore-heresies (pointed out by sith possesed youtubers) and just give in to the spectacle. That's it, now go and watch it.",POSITIVE
"Apr 15, 2020","This did justice to the series. I was entertained, with the action, characters, and storyline all pretty well done.",POSITIVE
"Apr 15, 2020",I thought the story was good but should have been great considering this was the end of the legendary Skywalker arc. Or is it? Hmmm the way it ended leaves you hoping for a whole new Skywalker arc. The acting was average which diminished the quality of the film also by the end I really thought Finn and the other cat were annoying. Thankfully Daisy Ridley saved the movie!,POSITIVE
"Apr 15, 2020","Rian was right. Don't make films for fans. If you want to enjoy star wars, rewatch the prequels. JJ had a tall order; it's not that he failed; he never really had a chance to succeed. Disney was single handily the best and the worst thing to happen To the franchise.",NEGATIVE

I am so happy with the direction that the franchise has gone. Episode 1, 2, and 3, yeah I get it, a little cheesy. Still loved each movie. Episodes 7, 8, and 9, ABSOLUTELY loved what J.J. did!!! Thank You sir! Would love a Rey Skywalker solo movie........",POSITIVE
"Apr 15, 2020",I'd rather have spent the time doing something else. It hard to keep watching a series that didn't go anyway but most of all it was even fun to watch. Was the 2nd best of new trilogy but of all the movies it'd be 8th out of 9 of the rest of Full series,NEGATIVE

"Apr 14, 2020","J. J. Abrams has failed. With a poorly-paced, oddly-written (the dialogue is comparable to that of the Prequels), ailing film, the Skywalker saga is over. Protagonists are unlikable. Palpatine has (somehow) managed to bore me. I am quite convinced the initial script simply read ""Insert deus ex machina here"". The film does feel like a preschooler playing with his older brother's Star Wars toys. Character arcs are nonexistent. Individuals once cunning, such as Mr. Sheeve, are now moustache-twirling knuckleheads incompetent past belief. Half of the film revolves around our cast of ""protagonists"" working off the information of an imperial defector to find the Palpaplanet. There are far too few redeeming qualities. Unlike most Abrams films, ROS is anything but visually pleasing. Random and unnecessary references are shoved in unnaturally. The Knights of Ren are dumber than B1 Battle Droids. Lando magically show up on some desert planet at the perfect time. Overall, this is the petty conclusion to a great series.",NEGATIVE
"Apr 14, 2020","J.J. Abrams is a genius! Fantastic ending to an impossibly difficult multifaceted story. Great fun. Wonderfully acted. Incredibly cool visuals that J.J. Abrams is known for.

"Apr 14, 2020",This movie totally sucked. Didn't captivate me in the slightest bit.

I won't spoil the rest but you see where I'm going with this. The resurrection of what seemed like a completely destroyed Death Star form Ep. 6 was a flimsy choice at best. The film ties up loose strings such as snoke but, I didn't find them satisfying. All and all I'd rather watch Ep. 1 with a plot that is leading somewhere.",NEGATIVE

"Feb 18, 2020","Spoiler warning, they kiss, then Kylo dies right after, such a disappointment for a fan like me",NEGATIVE
"Feb 18, 2020","Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an extremely fast, messy, and overwhelming movie that loads all of its plot points into a shotgun and fires them directly into the eyes of its audience. However, the movie isn't actually the worst thing ever. It's certainly better than ""The Phantom Menace"" and ""Attack of the Clones,"" despite what some die-hard fans might say. But then again, ""better than garbage"" isn't exactly high praise either. It has some funny quips, some cool (if exhausting) action scenes, and a whole lot of lightsaber fights. But unfortunately, it simply fails to tell a compelling story in a way that is both narratively comprehensible and actually engaging to the audience. It is basically a Transformers movie with a Star Wars coat of paint. As Kylo Ren once said ""Let the past die, kill it if you have to."" And Disney has certainly followed that advice with this one.",NEGATIVE

Overall the way it ended was amazing it came around full circle to episode 4 and tied into the first episode.,POSITIVE
"Feb 17, 2020",awesome storyline and action.,POSITIVE
"Feb 4, 2020","Amazing. I'm obsessed. I'm a Star Wars fan and love alll the trilogies. The only people who don't like this movie haven't liked any of this new trilogy. If you enjoyed TFA you'll love this one. Way beyond my expectations!! I think the second time you see it gets even better and allows you to process what's happening more clearly. The acting, score, special effects are phenomenal, as usual. The nostalgic moments. The characters are fun. But the epic light saber fights, depth, connection, complexity, and chemistry between Rey and Kylo Ren's characters and their force bond really make the movie. I obviously have critiques, but given that the entire story wasn't thought out before the 3 movies were made makes it difficult for a super coherent seamless plot line (and villain). And after TLJ, with what JJ Abrams had to work with, I just accepted the whole Palpatine bit. To be fair, Palpatine really is the epitome of the dark side and the most terrifying sith we're all very familiar with, that's haunted both the previous trilogies so I just accepted that it would be a cool way to end the last of the Skywalker movies. My biggest critique is the very end. All the force ghosts should have been behind her. He had all the siths with him. The force ghosts should have appeared with their light sabers behind her. That would have been the ultimate hell yes!!!!! moment of the movie. Palpatine should have screamed in fear seeing them all and it would have felt like an epic justified ending with them all killing him together with her. That would have given more closure to this Skywalker saga for me, knowing that Anakin and Luke got to be part of that final take down of someone they already destroyed. Also wouldn't have minded kylo living and appearing next to Rey on Luke's planet, with Luke and Leia looking at both of them proud and at peace. And Ben and Rey standing with the moons. That would have left it more open ended as far as their future, their kids, more movies IDK GUYS lol. I loved it though so much. I don't ever write reviews but I just loved it haha.",POSITIVE

I'm not unhappy with this movie in any major way, it's just that I was not excited either. No part of it truly felt surprising, and despite some engaging moments the whole movie felt too much like an obligatory tie-up of loose ends, like the movie had a checklist and was just ticking them off one by one without much enthusiasm.

I think of myself as a huge Star Wars fan, so I support them in ALMOST every decision they make. When I was watching the movie, however, I would be lying if I said I wasn't resting my head on my hand half the time. Rey had such raw strength, and such skill with her staff, that she had become an excellent Jedi (even without the amount of Jedi training she could've gone through), but if you've seen the movie, then you know that she was able to kill the Emperor in the end, with Kylo Ren's help. This troubled me, mostly because it destroys the prophesy that Anakin Skywalker was the Chosen One, the one to bring balance to the force. But if Palpatine survived, does that mean that Rey is the Chosen One?? After seeing lots of the Colin Trevorrow leaks in his ""Duel of the Fates"" script, I feel that the movie could have gone a lot better if taken in a different direction. Of course, this is just my opinion.",NEGATIVE

"Jan 26, 2020",Xbox theater is awesome.  really enjoyed Star Wars,POSITIVE
"Jan 26, 2020",This movie felt like a salvage mission making up for the last one.  like they're trying to undo some of the mistakes made and I think they did pretty decent job with that being said the damage cannot be fully restored and the franchise Canon has suffered for it.  It was a good watch though.,NEUTRAL

"Jan 26, 2020",Loved it!  Great ending to another great trilogy,POSITIVE
"Jan 26, 2020","A final conclusion to a long-lasting series, this felt completely rushed and horribly executed. As a person who was a huge fan of the Force Awakens and The Last Jedi this film feels completely out of place character and story-wise. The introduction of the main plot twist alone opened a gateway to many plot holes, while all development established in previous films was thrown out the door for 'cool action scenes'. The pacing of the film itself made the movie feel like it was running a marathon and I couldn't register anything until my second viewing. The one positive I have for the film is the amazing soundtrack, visual effects and chemistry each actor share with each other to execute their scenes together. I would recommend this film to casual viewers of the series or as something to run in the background while doing something else.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 22, 2020",A great ending to the saga.,POSITIVE

"Jan 22, 2020",You just know that it’s going to be okay. You just don’t know how. Edge of the seat the whole way. Still amazed at how bad shots the white armored storm troopers are. Can’t those guys hit anybody?  Great escapism and in the end (I saw the 1st one when it first came out) it’s a fitting conclusion.,POSITIVE
"Jan 22, 2020",Loved it. Me thinks we will be seeing more of some of these new characters.,POSITIVE
"Jan 22, 2020",It's a Star Wars movie! They're always fun to watch. I do want to see a director's cut of the film. #Disney would be VERY smart to give JJ's initial cut of the movie to fans.,POSITIVE

"Jan 22, 2020",Great way to end the series!,POSITIVE
"Jan 22, 2020",For 42 years we have wondered how the story would end... and the answer is with an obvious path to a completely new series! All your favorites make an appearance either integral to the script or as cameos. It is Star Wars - what's not to love and enjoy?,POSITIVE
"Jan 22, 2020","A big dissapointment. Had the opportunity to connect the dots to previous unexplained prequel films while keeping an intricate story and completley dropped the ball. I was very dissapointed that they didnt bother to pay homage to the Skywalker legacy by explaining the master plan and how we got to this point. Another is for some reason SPOILER Rey and Kylo Ren create a dynamic that gives the emperor power. Who is Snoke exactly still never was explained. Why was Anakin concieved by the force? or who did so? and for what part in Palpatines ultimate plan? answering these questions with small aid from the books would have made for an amazing story that would have left us all satisfied. This never happened although fun at times the story is a mess, the characters have no genuine aid to the story or part to play. The saddest part was the lack of any true link to the Jedi of the past it felt rushed and it felt thrown together. ",NEGATIVE

"Jan 22, 2020",AMAZING everything was phenomenal,POSITIVE
"Jan 22, 2020","Unfortunately, the movie understandably had to spend a fair amount of it’s time fixing the damage done in The Last Jedi. Shows us glimpses of what the trilogy could have been if Rian Johnson hadn’t been involved.",POSITIVE
"Jan 22, 2020","A full Five Stars! A MUST SEE for any serious Star Wars fan!

"Jan 22, 2020",Great movie!! So fun. This will be one of my all time favorite Star Wars movie,POSITIVE
"Jan 22, 2020","I loved the interaction between Poe and Finn - a really good bromance. The scenes with Leia were well done and seamless.

"Jan 11, 2020","It was fair. Rather underwhelming for the conclusion of a trilogy. And despite the fact that it was non-stop plot for the entire 2.5 hour runtime, it still felt like it dragged on towards the mid-point of the movie.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 11, 2020","Classic Star Wars. Just what you would expect, and the ending was decent.",POSITIVE
"Jan 11, 2020",Finally a good Star Wars in this trilogy. There may have been some elements that could have fixed the major issues with ‘The last Jedi' as we were utterly bombarded with new characters and plot points. However all said and done it had the laser sword fights and the scenery to make add this to my top 3 Star Wars films of all time.,POSITIVE
"Jan 11, 2020",Loved this version to close the series. Seemed like there was some rushed writing but it came together nicely. ,POSITIVE

"Jan 7, 2020","SPOILER REVIEW
After learning that The Rise of Skywalker was a ""splat"" on rotten tomatoes, I was devastated and had extremely low expectations walking into the theatre. But by the end of the movie I was skeptical of the critics' interpretation… This movie was awesome! While I would have appreciated less CGI, the character development was excellent. Per the Disney standard, the movie's writers wove the new trilogy into the original trilogy intricately and fascinatingly. Leia's back story – however brief – enhanced her character and made us fall in love with her all over again. I also loved that the Rey and Ben learned to use their force connection intentionally, which allowed for one of the best transitions of the entire series when Rey holds Leia's lightsaber behind her back, and it appears in Ben's hand so he can take down the Knights of Ren. I didn't know it before The Rise of Skywalker, but the concept of the Sith home planet Exegol was missing from the series and truly demonstrated a balance in the force. We've seen Jedi temples, the Jedi counsel on Coruscant, and a sacred Jedi library tree thing on the island where Luke lived in exile. Why not a Sith equivalent? I was not so impressed by the expansive fleet of star-destroyers – all with planet-killing capabilities no less. While impressive, it was also a bit far-fetched. I appreciated the drama, but it strayed from the monstrous yet refined vibe of the original empire. The struggle between Palpatine and his GRANDAUGHTER (wow!!!!!) made me confident in the film again. A battle of wills between the spirits of all of the Sith and all of the Jedi is the perfect climactic point for the final installation in this trilogy of trilogies. The poetic final scene, when Rey buries Luke and Leia's lightsabers on Tatooine, is an unforgettable moment of nostalgia, and it seems fitting that Rey has a bright yellow lightsaber; a new Kyber Crystal for a new age of the Jedi.",POSITIVE

"Jan 7, 2020","A horrible conclusion to the Disney star wars trilogy. It spends so much time retconing things from the last jedi that they don't cohesively tie together at all. It's filled with plot holes, pointless emotionless character deaths, characters who serve no purpose other then selling merchandise and terrible humor. It spends so much time looking back on the older films that it does a horrible job of standing on its own. What should be an epic conclusion to a three movie narrative feels like an improvised disaster.",NEGATIVE

"Jan 6, 2020","After my first time watching The Rise of Skywalker, I had prequel-level hatred for the film. It was such a massive disappointment. Now that I’ve seen it a second time, I found some minor enjoyment, so if there’s less vitriol in this review, it’s merely because I gave it a second shot, and was able to anticipate all the awful things so they wouldn’t be as annoying. I think the first thing that jumped to my mind when watching this film is that it felt like someone at the studio spent way too much time on Twitter/Reddit pages that were full of Last Jedi haters. Between the way they almost completely wrote Rose out of the film, to the way they changed Rey’s history, it was such an over-correction that you could almost watch this movie right after The Force Awakens and pretend The Last Jedi never existed. While I’m underwhelmed by The Last Jedi, and have some major problems with its story structure, this certainly wasn’t what I wanted them to do in follow-up. The biggest problem with The Rise of Skywalker is its script. This is a horribly-written film, and even when the dialogue works, what is happening on screen makes almost zero sense. But not all the blame can be placed at the feet of these writers (although whoever decided to hire the guy who wrote Batman v Superman and Justice League to work with J.J. Abrams on this movie should be fired.) The problems with this film didn’t start here, they actually started more than 10 years ago. A decade ago, as Disney began plans to create a new sequel trilogy they did not have the foresight to hire one writing team to plan out the entire trilogy. Instead they decided to make one movie and then hand the reins off to someone new for each subsequent film. For all their faults, the prequels at least have a consistent story arc, but this trilogy is a mess of mixed messages and disjointed theming. It’s infuriating how poorly these 3 movies hold together as a single narrative. I appreciate some of the action sequences in this film, and I think Adam Driver elevates every scene he’s in because he’s a truly great actor. There are also some excellent moments with C3PO that reminded me of the original trilogy. While I don’t like the ever-expanding power of the Force that seems to be nearly limitless now, I did like the way they used it a few times with Rey and Kylo’s continued Forcetime conversations. That’s about where the good stuff ends. I’ve heard several people talk about how much this film felt rushed, but I couldn’t help feeling that it was rushing to nowhere. The movie is like a scavenger hunt where they seek out one MacGuffin after the next, and then they arrive at the climax through a completely different way so everything before that was pointless. The Rise of Skywalker has some enjoyable elements, but it’s definitely the worst film of the sequels, and has convinced me that the Original Trilogy is probably all the Star Wars I need.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 6, 2020","They tried to wrap it all up and just failed to do it with the same humor and any originality.  The plot doesnt hold up, especially where they bring back the Emperor.  There are a couple of scenes where you might think youre watching a Harry Potter movie.  They need to seriously edit this movie, then run it again.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 6, 2020",Classical Star Wars at its best.,POSITIVE
"Jan 6, 2020","Took my eight year old grandson and he was mesmerized as was I great story line and effects, liked the people portrayed and the good over evil not enough of that would see it again",POSITIVE
"Jan 6, 2020",I thought it was an excellent movie well put together answering all the unknown questions and tying everything together.,POSITIVE
"Jan 6, 2020","This movie was such a waste of potential. The Last Jedi set up an excellent optimistic ending that could have rallied laymen and laywomen to the Resistance. Instead of continuing on that plot thread, Rise of Skywalker spends more time trying to undo The Last Jedi than build its own plot. 

Half the movie is spent trying to track down an object that turns out to not be necessary anyway. 

Huge character development moments are thrown out, then abandoned as quickly as the next scene.

Characters make choices that are contrary to their own desires or motivations up to that point. 

There are so many problems with this movie, I couldn't list them all. I literally lost count.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 6, 2020","This movie exceeded my expectations! I am a die hard Star Wars fan and I had watched my favorite youtubers talk about the movie for the past year or so and I went in expecting it to suck, but it was really good. There are a few plot issues in the movie, probably from all the editing that George Lucas had to do to save it, but it is very entertaining overall.",POSITIVE

"Jan 6, 2020","Terrible Star Wars movie. While the music was absolutely gorgeous, there were a couple sad moments, and a couple funny moments most of the movie was just a mess. A nonsensical plot, new stuff added for the hell of it, and old characters brought back because the new ones suck. It was more fun to make fun of than it was to actually watch hopefully they scrap J.J. Abrams with someone who can write a coherent plot.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 6, 2020",This movie was an emotional rollercoaster!,POSITIVE
"Jan 6, 2020","Wow !!!  Loved every second of it. The reviews did not do it justice. Number one, it's a movie. Lighten up already.  Number two, the CGI was incredible. Number three, who saw Kilo Ren turning coming ??? I sure didn't. WOW !!!  Loved this movie.",POSITIVE
"Jan 6, 2020",It's was not great but not horrible. There was some easy prediction of what was happening next. But still enjoyable to a point and an end to an era of storyline.,NEUTRAL

"Jan 6, 2020",felt like it paid homage to George Lucas . I love the droids and the characters were funny and more of them.,POSITIVE
"Jan 6, 2020",I'm not sure what movie the critics watched. This was the best of the new trilogy by far. I felt like Star Wars 8 worked harder than a sith at destroying The Star Wars universe. Lucky for us Abrams and his genius Team brought order to the galaxy. Thanks for making a show worthy of 40 years of devotion.,POSITIVE
"Jan 6, 2020","Forget the critics. This is the fun, campy adventure we have all come to love from this franchise.",POSITIVE
"Jan 6, 2020",The male leads are have no charisma. The movie was too long. The movie was too loud.,NEGATIVE

"Jan 6, 2020","I loved it. The special effects were awesome. The storyline was great, and the ending was perfect!",POSITIVE
"Jan 6, 2020",Meh!  This whole new trilogy has been unoriginal and full of missed opportunities. None of the characters were well developed. Dont make any more movies until you have an interesting plot please.,NEGATIVE
"Jan 6, 2020",The movie was awesome from beginning to end!! A awesome addition to series!,POSITIVE
"Jan 6, 2020",it was okay. it definitely felt rushed and incomplete. Last Jedi had a good message that they kind of abandoned in this one. You can see they gave up with all the drama behind the camera and just decided to go for the fan service instead.,NEUTRAL
"Jan 6, 2020",The movie had the unenviable task of wrapping up an iconic series that spanned generations. While it won't win best picture Oscar it was a worthy final chapter and the average non die-hard fan should be content with how it wraps up. ,NEUTRAL
"Jan 6, 2020",Spoiler!! Disliked that kiss.,POSITIVE

"Jan 6, 2020","the best thing about it was that after all it was Star Wars.  However, the acting was poor and the story felt contrived. I almost felt like I watching a 1950’s B movie science fiction thriller.  But, it was Star Wars.",NEUTRAL
"Jan 6, 2020",I LOVED it. Cried through most of it. So dang emotional and triumphant,POSITIVE

"Jan 6, 2020",Pleasantly surprised at how this epic adventure has come together.,POSITIVE
"Jan 6, 2020","It was a very full and fun experience, despite some retcons and a bit of playing fast and loose with rules at times. Definitely a spectacle though, would watch again if nothing else to see the ships as shown in the trailer again.",POSITIVE

"Jan 6, 2020",A rehash of old plots that made the film very predictable.,NEGATIVE

"Jan 5, 2020",I thoroughly enjoyed it. A great final chapter to the Skywalker saga.,POSITIVE
"Jan 5, 2020",the story doesn’t make sense,NEGATIVE
"Jan 5, 2020",Pretty good. Did its best to salvage the horror that was Last Jedi. Finn and the wanna be Han Solo guy (whatever his name is) are both still non-characters for the most part which is a shame but you can only pack so many fixes into one film.,NEUTRAL
"Jan 5, 2020","If you consider the almost impossible task that JJ Abrams faced on how to close out this epic saga that spanned over 30 years, he did a really great job! I personally liked the movie a lot. My one complaint (spoiler-alert) is when Rey asked for past Jedi knights to ""be with me"", when she heard all the voices speaking to her they should've flashed pictures of everyone that was talking. It would've been nice to see all of the former greats one last time (except for young & teenage Anikan).",POSITIVE
"Jan 5, 2020","Not exactly what I expected, but alot of good stuff in there. could have used a 4th movie though.",POSITIVE

"Jan 5, 2020",Wrapped up the whole thing. But left it open for more.,POSITIVE
"Jan 5, 2020","It was ok.  Some really cliche parts, like the end.  And the middle.  And the reveal.  Mostly entertaining.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 5, 2020",The issues people have with this movie stem from issues with the last Jedi. If the last Jedi were a better movie this one would be received better. That’s the only reason it feels out of place or that things don’t connect. ,NEUTRAL
"Jan 5, 2020",Loved everything about it!!!,POSITIVE
"Jan 5, 2020",Great story and end!,POSITIVE
"Jan 5, 2020",Best Star Wars since the first three. It’s a great ending,POSITIVE
"Jan 5, 2020","Love it!! It’s a wonderful movie like all the ones before. But, it was sad to see Leía. Ready eyes. Just a reminder she’s really gone. Luke and Leia are the true stars of why I keep watching these movies. Ray had big shoes to fill in and she did it wonderfully.",POSITIVE
"Jan 5, 2020","It’s Star Wars meets Harry Potter. New powers for Jedi, living and dead abound. The emperor returns ala Voldemort. Disney’s commercial fingerprints are all over this thing. Carrie Fisher in a major role is kind of creepy. On the plus side Rey is a good choice for the new Jedi and the main characters are all pretty good.",NEUTRAL
"Jan 5, 2020",Love it I have waited for 44 years to watch all 9 episodes,POSITIVE
"Jan 5, 2020","Boring, emotionless mess. It displays the poor planning on Disney's part.",NEGATIVE

"Jan 5, 2020","J.J. Abrams did what he could to salvage the mess that was Star Wars: The Last Jedi. As a die hard star wars fan and expanded universe nut, I would have taken the film in a couple different directions but it was an overall good film. Poe and Finn are still worthless characters with no arc or purpose, but i'll take what I can get.",NEUTRAL
"Jan 5, 2020",Not the best but def not the worst,POSITIVE
"Jan 5, 2020",Great action sad ending,POSITIVE
"Jan 5, 2020",Nice ending to the saga.,POSITIVE
"Jan 5, 2020",Great wrap up to the end of an era.,POSITIVE
"Jan 5, 2020",Oh look convenient new force powers followed by nostalgia and more nostalgia oh and here's some humor. I'm not sure what I was looking for but it wasn't this... I am conveniced that this movie was just a third installment of series of money grabbing movies.,NEUTRAL
"Jan 5, 2020",This movie does not explore Star Wars law. It does not extend the Star Wars mythology. It's not a Star Wars movie. Far too many coincidences and messy / rushed scenes to even be a compelling or fun movie. What a wast of talented actors and a great composer.,NEGATIVE
"Jan 5, 2020",A truly excellent film. I admit I can see why the critics don’t like it and why the public generally do. A rather satisfying end to a 42-year-old story! Glad I saw it at the cinema and I really enjoyed it,POSITIVE

"Jan 5, 2020","Weak transitions, impossible physics, too many character loose ends tied up too quickly and an unnecessarily long final battle with a gazillion too many spaceships.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 5, 2020",Good movie but odd pacing. Wrapped up some loose ends and left others. A Star Wars fan must see.,NEUTRAL

"Jan 5, 2020","Was good, loved the cringey kiss",POSITIVE
"Jan 5, 2020",The story is basically a remake of ROTJ. Not much new other than Disney trying to unravel the storyline of the first 6 movies done under George Lucas.,NEUTRAL
"Jan 5, 2020","Great way to end the Skywalker saga. there were some nice twists too. Some you saw coming, others that you might not have. The very end has a nice surprise that hints at where they might go next. Sure there moments that they borrowed from other movies in the series, but I feel it was more of a homage than being lazy or unoriginal. Enjoyed the movie and excited to see where they go next.",POSITIVE

"Jan 5, 2020","It's not a terrible movie, but it's certainly not the way to end a story. Way too much focus on fan service and not enough attention on making a good story. ",NEUTRAL
"Jan 5, 2020",The movie fixed many of the issues with episode 8 but at the same time makes me sad that even with the long play time so much of the story had to be rushed to fix problems caused by the previous film.,POSITIVE
"Jan 5, 2020",it was a good movie just not sure if it was good enough to be the last one,NEUTRAL
"Jan 5, 2020","Amazing movie! My entire family loved it! The best ""new"" Star Wars ever made (notice I said ""new"" because nothing beats the original three Star Wars movies). I highly recommend seeing this in the theater for the special effects!",POSITIVE
"Jan 5, 2020","I loved that it was so like mind blowing .. I was bamboozled the whole time like dammmmmmmnnnnn! So good, I just didnt like that you know who died because I wouldve loved to see a happy ending with him and Rey.",POSITIVE

"Jan 5, 2020",sound  seats could be better.,NEUTRAL
"Jan 5, 2020","The Rise of Skywalker is a solid Star Wars movie with plenty of action, great character moments, and some truly great moments for the franchise.  While this film was probably my least favorite of the three Sequel films, it is still extremely solid in my opinion.

That being said, it has some major flaws.  I think not releasing the 3 hour version to the public meant that a lot of important details were lost, and thus made for some extremely confusing points during the film, which basically means the viewer is unexpectedly dragged along for the ride instead of knowing exactly what's going on.  I'd consider myself a Star Wars fanatic, and even after watching it and reading dozens of articles...I'm still confused about everything that happened.  I also think the ending is a bit overdone ~ we could have had said epic battle at the end the same way with fewer ships.

I'd highly recommend watching this film, and even recommend watching it twice.",POSITIVE
"Jan 5, 2020",Great special effects and some surprises. I gave 4 stars only because the ending satisfies but not much more.,POSITIVE
"Jan 5, 2020","Absolutely amazing! Great plot, great acting and great storyline. The first really good Star Wars in decades! Some twists and turns, but worth every minute! LOVED it!",POSITIVE

"Jan 5, 2020",Finn never got to tell Rey he loved her.,POSITIVE
"Jan 4, 2020",This wasn’t a Star Wars movie. This sequel saga has stained the beautiful universe George Lucas created. Shame on Disney and shame on the directors for producing this atrocity. ,NEGATIVE

"Jan 4, 2020","No clear story line, very jumbled... Sttii, it’s Star Wars.",NEUTRAL
"Jan 4, 2020","A good ending to this trilogy. How does one end not only a trilogy, but a nine part saga. It's a daunting task, but Rise of Skywalker is able to achieve it. It gives us closure in Rey and Kylo's story, but also leads itself to new characters who are sure to make appearances in television. The fight on the waves alone is worth the price of admission. Do yourself a favor and see it in Dolby.",POSITIVE
"Jan 4, 2020","Star Wars fans will love it!  So many references to the classics, and finally bringing together the close of the saga.  I hate that it’s over, but there is so much more to explore in the Star Wars universe that I’m sure there will be no shortage of spinoffs.  Disclaimer:  I’m a huge fan and I don’t know if it even “could have been” anything less than excellent.",POSITIVE
"Jan 4, 2020",It was better than the last Jedi as a movie. But the last half hour or so just felt like JJ trying to make up for previous films mistakes. It’s honestly probably fault of fandom. People are always so mad when a serious ends with a bunch of unanswered questions. Well this movie simultaneously tries answer every question you’ve had for 8 movies and still ask a bunch more that will never be answered.,NEGATIVE
"Jan 4, 2020","This movie is terrible!!! The plot has more than a few major holes. Absolutley no memorable dialogue. The way this movie abused the ""force"" essentially kills the ""force"" for any future movies. I felt nothing for any of the characters and have no desire to see them in future stories. The actors and actresses acted well in my opinion but the story and direction was awful. This franchise is dead... Very sad...",NEGATIVE

"Jan 4, 2020",Satisfying conclusion to the trilogy,POSITIVE
"Jan 4, 2020",Fun to watch but the plot was nonsensical and the stakes were non-existent. The attempt at humor was so bad it was actually funny and a lot of the things that happened it the movie was so stupid it was funny.,NEGATIVE

"Jan 4, 2020","good ending to a franchise, tried to fit a lot into the last one and it got a little muddy, but entertaining overall.",POSITIVE
"Jan 4, 2020",In my opinion I thought the movie was definitely one of the best of the entire series.  Story line was carried out well and special effects were good also.  my only issue was that the scaling of the fleet was all wrong.  Not a major issue but was something that we definitely noticed and made mention of afterwards.,POSITIVE
"Jan 4, 2020",Loved everything about it.. Perfect ending to. Divine saga 👏👏👏👏❤️❤️❤️❤️,POSITIVE
"Jan 4, 2020","As the end of the saga, this movie and trilogy as a whole makes meaningless the character growth and sacrifice of the first six movies. I can't, in good conscience, endorse art that builds it's commercial success by devaluing other works of art upon which it is supposed to stand. Anakin is now a meaningless character. Luke is irrelevant. Han undos all his character growth in the OT. 

Props to Adam driver for having the only interesting character in the new trilogy and this film.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 4, 2020","The way JJ put this movie together could've been done by any Star Wars fan that's been watching since the original trilogy. Unlike Rian Johnson with TLJ, JJ seemed scared to do anything that might be unexpected or disliked by fans. This movie was ridiculously predictable. I saw everything coming a mile away. Anyway while I love Star Wars and the movie is a good Star Wars movie it's just disappointing that it was so predictable and nothing unexpected happened to make it really as epic as it could've and should've been.",NEUTRAL
"Jan 4, 2020","This movie ties together the entire Star Wars Saga. I dont know if this was Georges vision of how the story would end, up I liked the way everything was tied up.

"Jan 4, 2020",Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker concludes the third part of the saga with a really fast paced story which can get you lost and disconnected with the characters and overall story.,NEGATIVE
"Jan 4, 2020","If you are a causal fan of the series you’ll love this movie. If you are die hard you will find a lot not to like about it. It felt like a rehash of Episode 6 and not as good either. It wasn’t bad it was just, meh. It’s right in line with FA and TLJ, not bad just meh.",NEUTRAL

"Jan 4, 2020",Appropriately redeems much of what was ruined in the first two movies of this trilogy. This one is actually a Star Wars movie and not the complete pile of trash that was The Last Jedi. Why these critics are so out of touch with these last two movies is beyond me.,POSITIVE
"Jan 4, 2020","Easily the best of the trilogy. I fumed over having to watch 2 adverts for it prior to it actually starting, but after 10 mins in I was all smiles. Until Leia! RIP Carrie Fisher 😔 

Good job, JJ",POSITIVE

"Jan 4, 2020","The movie overall is good. Not to drawn out on the drama, enough sense of humor and special effects were good. Fast pace on dialogue, and loved that they had General Lea Organa a lot in this final Star Wars movie.",POSITIVE
"Jan 4, 2020","Totally disappointed.. I see how JJ Abrams would copy over some of the original styles that Lucas used throughout the series, I even enjoy the historical element he adds to most of his work(ruins of empire ships in key locations from the past), but the character arrangement and acting were sorely lacking, no... it just sucked. Poor chemistry and unconvincing acting in many ridiculous/unbelievable situations.  I was not drawn-in, I did not wonder what happens next, I did not hope for another movie like it. This is a foreign way to be in regards to Star Wars movies. Lucas always ""took you on a wild ride"" emotionally AND through action scenarios. This movie only gets a 2nd star because it (I think) closed-out the series with the information conveyed in this movie. However, it's just pitiful when you can get cameos from all 2 dead characters and still have Carrie Fisher in this one for half the movie and STILL manage an extremely lack-luster movie. I was actually F%()! BORED for 75% of this almost 3 hour movie. WTH Disney??",NEGATIVE

"Jan 4, 2020","Movie felt rushed, like they needed to cram every opportunity to say goodbye to he older movies, e.g., blowing up the planet felt cheap and quick no buildup, no reason to have done that other than it was done before.  They didn't know what to do with Chewbacca.  What's with horses on a star destroyer?! Seriously?  That's a threat?  Only highlight was Palpatine.",NEGATIVE

"Jan 4, 2020","Rise of the Skywalker never gives you any time to digest what is happening on screen. It felt like it was just pushing along to get to the finish line. Trying to clean up the mess of the Last Jedi. Disney really messed up this franchise. The Force Awakens was on the right path, but quickly ruined.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 4, 2020","It’s Good movie bt not a great one, had some good elements bt the film isn’t 100% perfect bt very fun movie",NEUTRAL
"Jan 4, 2020","What a complete mess of a film that had lots of opportunities to be fantastic. The plot somehow manages to be incredibly overcomplicated and unbelievably dumb at the same time, which echoes screenwriter Chris Terrio's previous attempt at a blockbuster, Batman V Superman. Performances are fine, everyone was doing their best with what they were given. Visuals are great, certain scenes have some unbelievable art design. Cinematography leaves much to be desired following The Last Jedi. If you're a big follower of Star Wars lore and canon I really think this will leave you really grasping at straws trying to piece together how the sequel trilogy makes sense within the Star Wars universe after this one. But after all that, it's not a film without it's fun. There are numerous scenes that are exciting and fun, it just struggles to combine those scenes into a coherent whole. I know I sounded like I completely ragged on the film and I have, but I mean there are plenty of not-so-great Star Wars films.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 4, 2020",Too long and drawn out.,NEGATIVE
"Jan 4, 2020","Good movie, too many parallels to Episode 6.",POSITIVE
"Jan 3, 2020",I thought daisy Ridley and Kylo ren really carries the show. Their intensity was fearsome. FX were Normal Star Wars - good. But the story of those two was unexpected yet satisfying.,POSITIVE
"Jan 3, 2020",I love the Star Wars movies. I have watched them all several times. I enjoyed the new characters and seeing some of the old ones in this one. I liked that they solved some mysteries. I wish they didnt film in so much darkness/gray.,POSITIVE

"Jan 3, 2020","It was good...a little bit like too much cotton candy at times, overall sweet for no reason....but enjoyed it from start to finish.

"Jan 3, 2020","A disappointing end that plays it too safe. You can sense that Disney's corporate panic mode is fully operation after the commercial failures of Solo and The Last Jedi (which, disclaimer, I thought weren't nearly as bad as they were received). This film attempts to do too much plot-wise in the time that it has, losing focus of key themes and arcs that were begun in The Last Jedi, and leaving many scenes confusing and at times absurd.",NEGATIVE

"Jan 3, 2020","This movie did exactly what it promised: it ended the franchise (for now). It was a very safe Star Wars movie. I think they could have taken a few more risks and there were things I wish they had done differently, but overall it was okay. If you're looking for a grand masterpiece, this isn't it. It's a good movie to put on for a couple of hours and watch the end of the Skywalker saga.

"Jan 3, 2020",Deeply disappointing following Episode VIII.,NEGATIVE

"Jan 3, 2020","Star Wars 9 (9 reasons why I hated it...)

1. DISNEY’S FORCE - All of a sudden the Force can teleport necklaces & Sith-trackers and anything that hits the floor while imagining you’re in the same room as someone across the galaxy Disney’s Force also allows ghost jedis to catch lightsabers but their new force does not allow teleporting across a violent sea current (hmm add zero consistency too) it allows to heal dead people and read people’s minds except your own suppressed memories that of being related to the most powerful Sith ever. The inconsistency of “Disney’s Force” is really the only consistency, and unbelievable fiction at best... I prefer believable consistent fiction with rules. I mean some of the worst fictional movies had more consistency: Jason & Michael Myers had more consistency within their fictional stories compared to how badly Disney has screwed-up my favorite childhood movie franchise. 
2. SITH WAYFINDER - Seriously?! Do bad guys in any movie ever leave a tracking device to find them? No because it’s stupid baseless-fiction. 
3. ENEMY/ALLIES - I counted at least 4 different times when characters went from enemies to immediate allies, by trusting each other within 1 spoken sentence. Maybe since Disney knew how badly Episode 8 was received by their diehard fans, then they rewrote Episode 9 on the fly. However, while doing so they tried shoving too much in, too quickly...there could have been 3 different movies made from this 1 very over-saturated / sometimes complicated storyline (I was able to follow it, but that’s only because I know more about these storylines than the average person, and apparently Disney too). 
4. RISE OF SKYWALKER - Ben Solo’s last name was Solo and Rey’s was Palpatine. So who actually rose as Skywalker??  I guess the writers ran out of time to explain clearly, but apparently Rey can just rename herself whatever she wants and just stole Luke’s last name at the very end...Keep in mind she is not related to Luke or “Leia Organa” at all and Ben was Luke’s nephew. So really the subtitle is as useless as this movie plot. 
5. LEIA A JEDI MASTER? - Besides Leia flying around in space in Ep-8 like Mary Popins (with no respirator) and the occasional “I can hear Luke calling me” moments from past movies. She has never been shown as a Jedi or ever had serious reference made to her being a Jedi until this movie as Rey’s “Jedi-Master”?! What another writing joke! I would’ve loved to have seen Leia develop as a Jedi in Ep-7. Yoda even eluded to that within Ep-6 which was the perfect set up for The Force Awakens (or even in Ep-8, Last Jedi) ...but “The Last Jedi” was Rey within Ep-8 so how could anyone remaining still be a Jedi unless Disney changed their minds because of all the backlash, and then rewrote 9? (Mystery solved)...Which they apparently did because with this new storyline written (Ep-9) now makes Ep-8 have “2 Last Jedis” left (Leia & Rey), not 1 “last jedi”...Like I said earlier this storyline was rushed / crammed into this new garbage movie, when it could have been built up within previous storylines or spread out as multiple movies. But missed opportunities from Disney’s failure in Episode 8 made them obviously u-turn in Ep-9 which is why everything but the kitchen sink was included into this terrible poorly written debacle of inconsistency.
6. ALL THE SITH IN ME - Come on! Palpatine comes back from the dead and has all the dead Sith Lords inside of him...Disney writing fail #100
7. ALL THE JEDI IN ME - Same as above but all the dead Jedi are inside Rey...Come on! Disney writing fail #101
8. THE LAST ORDER - A fleet of Star Destroyers are reborn from the ashes of an evil fairytale world, which no one can find (unless you have a handy dandy Sith Way-finder). This world seemingly has no resources or supplies but yeah there are mysteriously 100 times the fleet of the already huge First Order fleet. Totally makes sense Disney, and thanks for another of your over-exaggerated plot-lines because there apparently weren’t enough already over the top fiction ruler-breaker exaggerations within this pile of trash.
9. FORCE HEALING PROPERTIES - You clearly stole this from the recently written Baby Yoda character within the last aired episode (8) of the Mandalorian. Which only happened 2 days before Ep-9’s release date. PLEASE DO NOT ruin Yoda’s character too...John Favaro is a brilliant writer so I hope you’ll leave him in charge of The Mandalorian or I’ll have to jump off that ship soon too. I could go on but I’ve got a headache from these examples above. Bottom line...This is not my Star Wars, it’s Disney’s total pile of rule breaking fictional garbage!",NEGATIVE

"Jan 3, 2020",I loved the entire movie!,POSITIVE
"Jan 3, 2020",I didn’t hate but also didn’t live how they end it.,NEGATIVE
"Jan 3, 2020","It was the best one of this trilogy, but did not wrap everything up well. While in the theatre, it's fantastic, but after you come out and the excitement wears off, you are left with a lot of questions. It was visually stunning and overall entertaining, but there were many plot points left open and things unanswered. It was decent enough though. If you are okay with not needing to know everything, I would recommend it.",NEUTRAL
"Jan 3, 2020","Theyve been pretty bad, but this one was pretty good.",POSITIVE
"Jan 3, 2020","Star Wars was my first cinematic love, but this movie was—to quote a more satisfactory Disney sequel—""Trash!"".

The Rise of Skywalker was beautiful, pandering nonsense. The visuals were glorious, I will give it that; Lucas & co. have truly mastered the special effects. However, the story was nonsensical and the characters were one-dimensional (despite having no excuse to be, since this was the third 2+-hour-long movie in their tale). 

Without spoiling anything, the plot seemed to have been cut to the point that it was illogical, with rapid transitions and lack of clear motivations for many of the characters. At some points it became clear that events happened SOLELY for the purpose of advancing the plot or creating tension and not because anyone in their right mind would actually do those things. Despite being nearly a cookie-cutter copy of the original plots, it somehow seemed unplanned. 

There also seemed to be no room for breath, as every second had to be ACTION-PACKED. It made for a chaotic and, ultimately, boring movie experience, as one's sympathetics cannot possibly remain at 100% for 2.5 hours. It is the variation in tone, mood, and energy that keeps the audience engaged throughout a long epic like this, and I found that the variation was either limited or nonexistent throughout.

Regarding character development, I think the team got in over their heads with all of the new people that they wanted to feature in a relatively short period. Kylo Ren/Ben had the biggest transformation in the movie, but the rapidity with which he changed was baffling (""and now I'm a good guy!""). His struggle with the change was there, but felt brief and shallow. That is still better than Rey, though, from whom I saw NO growth. She remained as impulsive and non-cooperative as always throughout the movie (both very anti-Jedi behavioral traits), but somehow still came out ahead.

Perhaps the most bothersome part of this movie was the callbacks. Now, I get that you need to have shout-outs for the fans—especially fans as devoted as the lovers of Star Wars are—but the fan service in this movie was more like a bludgeoning, stopping only *just* short of stopping and winking at the camera. (Actually, come to think of it, that might've been preferable, since it would've implied a bit of self-awareness. As it was, the Star Wars team just seemed to be stroking the egos of the fans they knew they could count on to support their merchandise Empire.) It was insulting to think that the people who have loved these movies for 30+ years wouldn't recognize more subtle signs that yes, this was the same series. Honestly, I think less overt sucking up would've kept people coming back for more (think reruns of ""Arrested Development""); I felt like I'd had enough Star Wars for a while at the end of this film, though. Maybe that was the point?",NEGATIVE

This should have delivered the types of thrills and emotions that the first Death Star trench run or the Hoth battle in Empire, it didn't reach that level.

"Jan 3, 2020","A decent ending to the sequel trilogy.  Thankfully retcons most of the terrible choices of TLJ.  I found myself enjoying most of the story, but often it just reminded me how good the sequel trilogy could have been had it been properly planned and executed.  The story feels rushed and there are a lot of unresolved plot elements, but overall it tells a good story.  It's not the best Star Wars movie ever, but it's definitely not the worst.  If you hated TLJ, you'll probably like TROS.  If you liked TLJ, then don't bother seeing TROS.",POSITIVE
"Jan 3, 2020","It was good, but not remarkable...",POSITIVE
"Jan 3, 2020",Started out a little empty. I was concerned but then it turned into classic Star Wars. Nice job of wrapping everything up and getting one last look at all the core characters throughout the saga. Some really good moments and worth watching. I’ll watch it again.,POSITIVE

"Jan 3, 2020","Given the decisive mess that the Last Jedi was, I went into ROS having given up all hope for Disney's Star Wars trilogy. Given that ROS was a failed entry in the Star Wars saga. Predictable and non ambitions, filled with forced fan service to paper over the glaring cracks in the narrative. If this was a one off stand alone Sci-fi film it would be perfectly serviceable. But as the last ever film in a Star Wars trilogy, it does nothing short of falling flat on it's face.",NEGATIVE

"Jan 2, 2020","Great movie, great ending, albeit unneeded. My only complaint is that Anakin ghost should have made an appearance. Other than that great from beginning to end. ",POSITIVE
"Jan 2, 2020","The problem with Rise of Skywalker is how much time it had to spend undoing the damage from Last Jedi. With nearly half the movie spent retconning away all of Riann Johnson's changes to the story line, what was left was little more than a bad ""MacGuffin Chase"" movie. The sort that says, ""Go here to find item A, which will lead to item B, and so on."" They add a ticking clock of 24 hours, and then ignore it within a few minutes, because there's no way that Rey went to four different planets, waited for C3P0 to get brain-fried, raided a Star Destroyer, sailed miles across a harsh ocean, climbed for hours through wreckage, fought a battle, burned a metal ship to the ground, and then confronted --BAD GUY SPOILER--.  All of those were shown to take hours of time, yet somehow, that, along with travelling all the way to the Unknown Reaches takes under 24 hours, the deadline set at the start of the movie?

Ugh. 

In the end, the movie would have been lower rated if it hadn't been Star Wars. Unfairly, the movie gets to leverage 40 years of nostalgia, and it does so by cranking the heart-breaking scenes with the original actors as hard as possible. At best the movie earns it's ""C-"" rating. At worst, it survives only by leveraging the feelings we all have for the original trilogy, right down to Chewie finally getting the medal he was denied in New Hope. 

Star Wars deserved a better send-off.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 2, 2020",Saw the first one in 77 and every one thereafter. Absolutely wonderful conclusion. Could not ask for anything more.  Lump in throat and tear in eye at the conclusion scene.,POSITIVE

"Jan 2, 2020","Action good, liked how the film brought the characters together. Still waiting for Po and Finn to kiss. Loved development of Rey and Ben. Nice tribute to Luke and Lea.",POSITIVE
"Jan 2, 2020","It spends so much time and energy trying to ghost TLJ that it ends up trying to fit two movies into one. Ultimately running with a disjointed, unsatisfying and predictable plot and storyline. It has moments of fun and whimsy but they are rare as this additions crumbles under the weight of the director screaming “Nany nany boo boo” at his predecessor.",NEUTRAL
"Jan 2, 2020","Well, I guess I now know that anything the critic like (The Last Jedi) I'll dislike, and anything the critics dislike (Rise of Skywalker) I'll like.  So, the lower the critics rating, the more likely I go!!
Rise of Skywalker was a fun movie.   While it certainly had some plot holes, the movie was fun and engaging enough to easily overlook them.  Great Special Effects, lots of fun and exciting scenes.   Movie focused on just a few characters, so they had time for real character development and to get to know them.
Still don't quite understand the end (SPOILERS) and why Rey can kill **bad guy** and not be sucked into the evil as **bad guy** said she would if she killed him.  BUT, that ok..... it was fun ride to get to that part.
Great fun movie for the whole family, with lots of fun scenes to laugh about on the drive home .... so a great family night out.",POSITIVE

"Jan 2, 2020",Definitely not what I was hoping it would be. Not worth seeing in the theater. Wish I would have saved my money and waited until it was released on Disney Plus. Movie pretty much consisted of finding one major item to end a war. ,NEGATIVE
"Jan 2, 2020","For the casual Star Wars fan, it was a fun ride to the end.  While the hardcore and the ""critics"" may not like the ""easy answers"" and loose ends, most of us continue to enjoy the unparalleled effects and action and the timeless stories of the Star Wars universe.  I understand the massive task that JJ Abrams had in trying to tie the previous 8 movies together and provide all of the answers for a sprawling saga and, all things considered, he and his team managed this herculean task reasonably well. I am comfortable with the permanent additions to the character list as well and REALLY enjoyed the return of some of the greats!  The 3D was well executed technically but I felt it really offered minimal additional benefit.  Not sure it was worth the extra s.  Still a great movie - see it any way you can!",POSITIVE

"Jan 2, 2020",wow that is epic. I loved the movie.,POSITIVE
"Jan 2, 2020","The special effects were over the top & spectacular as usual, and the story line tied in all the way to the very end of the trilogy/series.",POSITIVE
"Jan 2, 2020",The familyrelationships was unclear with Rey. Why was she a Jedi? Some voids in the film story action also..,POSITIVE
"Jan 2, 2020","Very good ending to the story I grew up with.  Could I pick it apart and analyze the little things and inconsistencies, the unexplained, etc. yes...but its STAR WARS!!  Go see it, enjoy it, and stop fussing over the little things.  When I go a Star Wars movie, I go to be entertained and to escape to a galaxy far, far away...I was only 3 when A New Hope came out in 1977, so the story has been a HUGE part of my childhood and adulthood.  The Rise Of Skywalker was a very good and fitting end to a huge part of my life.  MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU!",POSITIVE
"Jan 2, 2020",An outstanding final to the new trilogy and Skywalker storyline. A must see.  Best of the new trilogy.,POSITIVE
"Jan 2, 2020","Haters gonna hate, but it was a good movie. Satisfying conclusion to the saga.",POSITIVE
"Jan 2, 2020","I was a child of the original Star Wars movies, and grew up with Han, Luke, Leia, Chewie and the gang. Like many, I wasnt thrilled with the new direction of my heroes lives. I even threatened to boycott this final installment. Well, I got over myself and went. What I can say is that after all the stuff they managed to screw up in the previous two movies, this one ends the only way that it could have, to satisfy longtime original Star Wars fans like me. A sound finish to the story of our heroes.
Go see it! Watch for the little things.",POSITIVE
"Jan 2, 2020",I really enjoyed the movie!  Would Lins to see it again!  It was great seeing Carrie Fisher & the other characters from the other Star Wars movies.,POSITIVE
"Jan 2, 2020","The characters and story line were good throughout.  I rate this a ""must see"" because it's a fitting end to the 9 movie Star Wars series.  None of the defects of The Last Jedi which was a terrible movie, and better than The Force Awakens. It might be the 4th best Star Wars, right behind the original trilogy.",POSITIVE

"Jan 2, 2020",So many inconsistencies created for convenience or to pander to audience or create false drama.  Really disappointing.,NEGATIVE

"Jan 2, 2020","Non-stop action from front to back. Considering the circumstances JJ Abrams had going into making this film, I can't think of too many ways to have done it better. Characters finally have development, the story finally has an arc and resolution.",POSITIVE
"Jan 2, 2020",Better than most of the series,POSITIVE
"Jan 2, 2020",This was a great way to end this series of Star Wars movies. It addressed a lot of open issues and tied them up nicely. We have closure.,POSITIVE
"Jan 2, 2020","This movie is excellent and a perfect finale for the Star Wars saga. It provides closure for all the story arcs and provides adequate set up for any future movies.It is difficult to believe that anyone dissing the movie is a real Star Wars fan.

"Jan 2, 2020","Fully enjoyable, would have been better if not painted into a corner by the abysmal Ep 8.",POSITIVE
"Jan 2, 2020",Absolutely garbage filmmaking. Felt like a boring sci-fi film with flashy visuals. Star Wars is dead and Abrams has buried it. I came out of the theater feeling numb.,NEGATIVE
"Jan 2, 2020",A fitting way to end the series.,POSITIVE
"Jan 2, 2020","What the heck did I just watch?! What a crappy way to end the Skywalker saga by basically making everything that the original characters did, be for nothing 🤦🏻‍♂️😡😤 and what a crappy way to make Anakins and Luke’s sacrifice be for nothing, by bringing back Palpathine 😤😡🤦🏻‍♂️ anything would’ve been better than bringing back Palpathine and negating everything that the original characters fought and died for.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 2, 2020","I liked it a lot. It ties up all the loose ends from the past star wars movies. The acting was very well done. Is rey a nobody or was she a sith? grandaughter of the emperor. I grew up watching the star war movies and for me this was a natural conclusion to the series. It introduces a new heroine. I loved how(spoiler alert) princess leia aka carrie fisher , harrison ford and mark hamil all reprised their roles in the final movie.",POSITIVE

"Jan 2, 2020","Nice movie with really good story, saga comes to an end",POSITIVE
"Jan 2, 2020","Excitement and adventure. Even though a Jedi does not crave these things, we got them anyway. It's a fun trip through some amazing imagery with some neat twists, turns, character moments and reveals, even if the overall plot is thin and has lots of jagged contrivances. This is scifi/fantasy looking its best.",NEUTRAL
"Jan 2, 2020",Excited to see how they continued Leia and brought back in Luke and Han Solo.,POSITIVE

"Jan 2, 2020",fantastic movie as the last installment of star wars!,POSITIVE
"Jan 2, 2020","Not a bad movie, but it seemed like they were trying to fit too much of everything into the movie.  Seems like if they had a choice between plot element 'A' and plot element 'B', they chose both.",NEUTRAL
"Jan 2, 2020","I did not like last movie and was expecting the same with this one but, as a Star Wars fan I had to go see it,  I really liked it.  If you are a Star Wars fan the movie actually wraps everything up and I think ends the series, no need to make anymore.",NEUTRAL

"Jan 2, 2020",Best Star Wars movie to date. Loved it!!,POSITIVE
"Jan 2, 2020","Good movie that was better than the Last Jedi.  It could have been better but there was limited continuity in the previous two movies of the continuity.  The first movie led you one way, then the second movie completely led you in a different way.  Then this movie had to fix the issues from the second movie.  If Disney plans to do another trilogy they should plan ahead and coordinate all the movies with other trilogy.  Or just make single independent movies.",NEUTRAL
"Jan 2, 2020","wow, that was terrible, predictable, and cheesy",NEGATIVE

"Jan 1, 2020",Don't believe the negative bs posted on here. It's a really good film and satisfying and to the Skywalker saga. I hate the aggregate score is less than Jumanji 2. I mean wtf? This is why I gave it a 10. Compared to all the Star Wars films this is a solid 8.,POSITIVE
"Jan 1, 2020","Entire movie seemed to be a continuous chase scene. Series of contrived, illogical dilemmas. Kylo Ren was the only character whose outcome was worth caring about. Rehash of old plot twists.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 1, 2020",Way better than The Last Jedi. Did not break Star Wars with craziness and did a lot to undo the damage done by Rian Johnson's terrible movie.,NEUTRAL

"Jan 1, 2020",the story was nice and it had a good ending to it,POSITIVE
"Jan 1, 2020","Creative, good storyline and characters. However, it seemed a bit drawn-out - while the storyline is good, the execution of said storyline was a bit slow, only to reach a rather mediocre ending. 

Not a big Star Wars fan but it is an awesome universe and has some of the most interesting and creative worlds and characters. It just does not entertain me the same way as other sci-fi epics. This movie sits on one of the lower rungs of the Star Wars franchise movie ladder in my opinion.

It is definitely worth a watch though.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 1, 2020",Much better than the last one. Tied ends together we'll.,POSITIVE
"Jan 1, 2020",It is how I feel the the Skywalker saga should end! Well done and #carrieonforever,POSITIVE

"Jan 1, 2020","Excellent movie! Easily as good as the original trilogy. After seeing the reviews I went into the theater ready to be disappointed, but it was fantastic! I have NO IDEA why anyone doesn’t like it. It is exactly everything I love about Star Wars movies from the action, humor, drama standpoint as well as the feeling that permeates the movie. J.J. Abrams has delivered on every level, and I left the theater overjoyed with the accomplishment. Go see this movie!",POSITIVE
"Jan 1, 2020",Excellent culmination of the previous story lines.  Eagerly anticipating the continuing Skywalker adventures.,POSITIVE
"Jan 1, 2020",Best one of the three.,POSITIVE
"Jan 1, 2020","I genuinely don’t know what I just watched. The plot is completely incoherent, and the characters make no sense. Some cool action scenes and a few fun light saber dules, but not much more here than that.",NEGATIVE

"Jan 1, 2020",A bunch of action scenes with nothing holding it together. It's like watching 5 year olds playing with action figures going through the motions in an extremly scetchy story. They used Star Wars characters and did nothing interesting with them. Worst Disney Star Wars. How does a studio with all the resources make such crap? It was important to end on a high notem The movie is amateur and a complete failure.,NEGATIVE
"Jan 1, 2020",The dialogue was a little over dramatic.,NEUTRAL
"Jan 1, 2020","JJ Abhrams showed why he was brought into the Star Wars franchise. The cast and the movie were excellent.  A great ending to a wonderful series. Epic finale that handled love, forgiveness, and destiny in a wonderful manner with enough Easter eggs to make a fan squeal.",POSITIVE

"Jan 1, 2020",Did not like casting of Kylo Ren,POSITIVE
"Jan 1, 2020","I was so disappointed with this movie. I absolutely love love love everything Star Wars, especially the Force Awakens and (to only a slightly lesser degree) the Last Jedi. This movie was possibly the worst Star Wars movie I’ve seen, just beneath Solo and Phantom Menace. I think it had two main problems (among others): it didn’t have heart (very little in the way of camaraderie/friendship/family bickering/playful teasing that I loved from the original trilogy and that they mostly kept in the last two movies), and it had too many moments that felt non-Star Wars (call me a Star Wars purist, because I strongly disliked the movie’s opening 5 minutes that sets the stage for the whole film, plus many other little moments that introduced seemingly new powers and dynamics never seen in a Star Wars film before). It largely felt like it lacked joy and thrill, which Star Wars films usually have in spades. Kind of a bummer. I was so looking forward to seeing this film. You should still see it (if you love Star Wars like me), but there’s a good chance it will disappoint you.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 1, 2020",Very well directed and the special effects were awesome.,POSITIVE
"Jan 1, 2020",Worth seeing to finish out the series. Way to many previews though.,POSITIVE
"Jan 1, 2020",I liked it ending where it all began.  Sad to see it end and wishing it would live on.,POSITIVE
"Jan 1, 2020","The first 30 minutes was an exercise in plot line jumping whiplash. The movie effectively re-wrote the Jedi and Sith as gods rather than mystics. Plot holes were everywhere and character development took unsatisfying turns from episodes 8 and 9. Unfortunately, I feel that this movie has the potential to make Disney question whether they should be rolling out a full universe of movies a la the Marvel Universe.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 1, 2020","Great way to bring an end to the saga, loved it!",POSITIVE
"Jan 1, 2020","the pacing was terrible,  too many potholes. it also destroys Anakins story. this whole trilogy was trash.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 1, 2020","A wonderful conclusion to the series, and a beautiful and respectful goodbye to Carrie Fisher and her most memorable role. Everyone was saying it was bad, awful and not respectful of the stories legacy. I disagree. Surprises and revelations that make it a great conclusion. Or is this a new beginning? Watch it and make your own conclusion.",POSITIVE
"Jan 1, 2020",Episode 9 was great. Dark and fun. Some questions unanswered. Don’t read or listen to the pretentious critics. This was a great ending to the entire series and leaves it at great place to start anew. Go see it,POSITIVE
"Jan 1, 2020",See it on 4DX. Great ride!,POSITIVE
"Jan 1, 2020",Loved the whole movie!!! ACTION PACKED!!!!,POSITIVE
"Jan 1, 2020","I would like to have given a better review - were we not re-hashing the now-established Kylo-Rey psychic connection tropes we've replayed through the previous two movies. This stated, I think JJ did a remarkable job salvaging the franchise as best as possible owing to the treatment in Last Jedi. Kennedy/Johnson may claim Last Jedi was only playing 'red herrings', but the previous film certainly didn't read that way. Some jeopardy/action scenes didn't appear to serve much purpose, but the surprise power sets do fit with some lore from the expanded universe. This stated, there is deus ex machina that goes unexplained, and isn't merely suspension of disbelief - but flies in the face of object permanence in the SW universe, so whatever.",NEUTRAL
"Jan 1, 2020","Loved the action, story line and the ending",POSITIVE
"Jan 1, 2020",A lot packed into 2 hours.  Jedi can heal now?  Lol,NEUTRAL

"Jan 1, 2020","Just go see it and make a judgment for your self. Is it a good movie Im not a movie critic to decide what is good and what is not. Did I enjoy it, yes! Was it a good end to the star wars sky walker theme in my opinion yes.",NEUTRAL

"Jan 1, 2020",I loved this movie. If you're a Star Wars fan it is a must see!,POSITIVE
"Jan 1, 2020",Great action. My favorite Star Wars in a long time!,POSITIVE
"Jan 1, 2020",The only reason that it wasn't a 1 star was because the visual effects were great. At least someone knew how to do their job right. The acting was completely sub-par. Finn and Poe were trying to channel the slap-stick comedy that makes Marvel great but it all falls flat because this isn't the MCU. The dialogue seems forced. The lightsaber scenes were horribly executed. If you took away the elegant graceful lightsabers and replaced them with medical axes or swords it would've fit better. I thought all of the Force Skyping was hilarious. Especially during one of Rey's Force Skype calls she gives Kylo (or Ben idk who he is at this point) a lightsaber. This movie is far better to watch wasted as a comedic parody movie of Star Wars than as part of the original Star Wars Universe. Hopefully this is the last big screen Star Wars movie that Disney tries to butcher because they obviously can't get it right. Perhaps they need to stick to Disney+ Star Wars until they can figure out how to make a Star Wars movie script.,NEGATIVE
"Jan 1, 2020",Loved it! Not a dull moment! Would see it again to catch what I missed.,POSITIVE
"Jan 1, 2020",disliked that Finn didn't tell him secret.,POSITIVE

"Dec 30, 2019","This should have been mixed with the second movie in order to show more important details   The second moviie was pretty non productive(the last Jedi) was really bad) .  Thist film was saved barely ,  but the sequences were not explained thourly which could have been done in 2 movies.  the writing in the second movie sucked and your people should have taken a q from game of thrones which wasn’t even a movie   By the by Ben should have been a knockout for the fans Rey was the bright light and her relationships were the best part of the movies",NEUTRAL

"Dec 30, 2019",SUPER SHITY FILM OF THE DISNEY,NEGATIVE
"Dec 30, 2019","What a bunch of nonsense! The narrative is bloated and rushed, but the script managed to be mired by incredibly lazy writing at the same time. The only redeeming quality is all the metaphorical middle fingers this film extends to its miserable predecessor: TLJ. Unfortunately this film is far from able to claim the high ground over TLJ in terms of story quality or respect for the established Star Wars lore, which was unfathomable to me before seeing TROS. Plain to see that this was the result of Lucasfilm having no coherent vision for the overarching story from the very beginning of the sequel trilogy. This ending cements my feeling that none of the sequel films belong as a continuation of episodes 1-6. These new films are just stapled on to the end of ROTJ for the cash grab; there was no apparent sense of obligation on the part of Lucasfilm to provide Star Wars fans with so much as a competent story, let alone an interesting one. Way to bungle the incredible potential of this universe. Not only did you screw up your own stories at nearly every turn, you attempted to retroactively undo all the achievements of our beloved heroes in the OT... especially with the revival of Palpatine in this film, which was just bafflingly stupid. Fortunately I can choose to ignore this hot mess of a trilogy and revert back to a time where the saga ended (beautifully) on Endor. I will never patronize any new Star Wars content ever again.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 30, 2019","Was a fun movie great action.  Even my wife wants to go see it again.  I only would have liked to see more of the original cast wrapping things up, but take that away and the movie still holds its own.",POSITIVE
"Dec 30, 2019",Fantastic finale to this trilogy.,POSITIVE
"Dec 30, 2019",It was awesome!  Did not care too much about the ending though.  Everything has to be politically correct - that is the message at the end of the movie.  :(,NEUTRAL
"Dec 30, 2019","Definitely the best of the new trilogy. I thought TFA was boring and repetitive and TLJ was a terrible mess. This moving is slightly hampered by having to work with what those first two gave it, but it's what they should've been to begin with. A pinch of nostalgia, good action, plot makes sense in universe, and it's overall very enjoyable.",POSITIVE
"Dec 30, 2019","Perhaps the worst Star Wars movie I’ve seen. First 3/4 was plausible but in their efforts to close out the movie (and perhaps to close out the Skywalker saga), they rushed things and put up implausible scenes. The dreamscape with Hans, extended narrative with Luke, two simultaneous scenes going on with Ray and Kylo, Kylo giving up his life force to Ray then dying, Kylo and Ray kissing, etc. These sort of scenes are aren’t consistent with past episodes and all because the movie was being rushed. Felt like the last episodes of GOT. Abrams got lazy. ",NEGATIVE
"Dec 30, 2019","The movie is fun popcorn fare - a very pleasant way to whittle away a couple of spare hours.  check your brains at the door, and put away all that nonsense that Yoda, Ben, The Emperor and Vader taught us about The Force in the original 6 films. 

For me it was a great date film. Hopefully it'll be memorable for you too.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 30, 2019",Another great Star Wars movie. The fight scenes and special effects were spectacular!!,POSITIVE
"Dec 30, 2019",Loved seeing the actors from the original Star Wars!,POSITIVE
"Dec 30, 2019","Too many writers over the last 3-4 movies and 
they are dropping story lines that others started. Not enough humor. Too many events/ activities that are not believable. Overall a big disappointment",NEGATIVE
"Dec 30, 2019",An amazing culmination to over 40 years of fandom!!,POSITIVE
"Dec 30, 2019",I loved the story line and the action,POSITIVE
"Dec 30, 2019","A polished, hollow dud. This film is devoid of any soul and is packed with endless fan service and nostalgia. Plot holes throughout, two main characters die and immediately come back to life, lots of pc nonsense. It actually makes Brian Johnson's movie look good.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 30, 2019",A good effort by JJ to rectify the train wreck that RJ caused.,POSITIVE
"Dec 30, 2019",It left me feeling a little like the story of Rea was incomplete. It was a little to tidy an ending.,POSITIVE
"Dec 30, 2019","Whiny fanboys get over it - its actually really good. You can't pick and choose parts to analyze - the whole series has things tat don't make sense. Its Star Wars - come on.
Personally, I really enjoyed and thought it was great how it wrapped up a whole lot of questions and made it interesting. Great job!",POSITIVE
"Dec 30, 2019","Great movie, good actors, good story, good effects but the 'surprise' element was not there. Almost predictable",NEUTRAL
"Dec 30, 2019",Nice story to tie in the other movies,POSITIVE
"Dec 30, 2019",Doesn't seem to make much sense. Rey is a Mary Sue and can do anything she wants. This pointless trilogy ruins the franchise in my opinion. Pretty lame overall,NEGATIVE
"Dec 30, 2019",A Must See Film. Non-Stop Action and brings a Great End to the Star Wars Saga.,POSITIVE
"Dec 30, 2019",If you dont hold biased opinions about how your Star Wars should have ended. Youll actually enjoy this.,POSITIVE
"Dec 30, 2019",So wonderful and exciting! Can’t wait to see it again!!,POSITIVE
"Dec 30, 2019",quite possibly the worst movie of the entire 3 part trilogy. lazy and loud filmmaking with an unintelligible plot that traffics in nostalgia just to win points with racist fans who can't handle their beloved franchise from changing and evolving with times.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 30, 2019","Great special effects and some talented actors but completely falls flat in terms of story and narrative. I cant believe Disney really couldn't put a coherent story together with hundreds of books, comics and George Lucas own ideas at their disposal.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 30, 2019","Felt good, JJ Abrams did a nice job of wrapping up the Skywalker saga.",POSITIVE
"Dec 30, 2019","I’m a big Otaku to Star Wars!!! Nerdy Alert !!! Great Movie The ending was a bit rushed, but the actions are awesome well executed!!! It’s a 100% movie regardless how it ended. Might be difficult for others who didn’t follow from previous episodes",POSITIVE

"Dec 30, 2019",Great movie but super long,POSITIVE

"Dec 30, 2019",Amazing movie! This move is a MUST SEE!!,POSITIVE
"Dec 30, 2019",Amazing! You have to really understand the fights scenes to see where the story line reads! If you don’t rewatch ALL the movies! There linked where you least expect them and it very well told!,POSITIVE
"Dec 30, 2019","As a long time Star Wars fan, this was a surprisingly great and fun ending to the saga. Though the last movie was a bit shaky (I personally didn't like it very much), this movie wrapped everything up nicely for the series. Nit-picking it will likely bring to light flaws (I can think of a few off the top of my head). But if you can go in without a negative predisposition towards the series, you will likely have a great time! The actors and actresses did a great job as well (they got a lot of hate for the material they were given rather than their actual acting ability), with some emotional and exciting moments fully carried on their shoulders. Overall, I will definitely be looking forward to seeing a marathon of the entire 9-movie saga at some point in the future, with this one as a great end to the series.",POSITIVE
"Dec 30, 2019",Loved it. Better than the previous movies. It had that Star Wars feel that the other movies were missing.,POSITIVE
"Dec 30, 2019",Amazing movie!!! loved every part of it,POSITIVE

"Dec 30, 2019",Wish that Yoda and Obi Wan had been somehow included.,POSITIVE
"Dec 30, 2019","So not only the Sith can come back from the dead but Carrie Fisher thought the evil power of the Mouse can too?
So anyone can become a Jedi with the on line speed course ? If only Obi Wan knew he wouldnt have had to train for 25 FKen years
I mean to become a Sith the only entry requirement is to either kill your father or 30 or 40 kids no wonder the Jedi lowered the entry requirements. 
And No one has an issue with Princess Leia causing her sons death?
And to be honest who wouldnt join the Sith? The Jedi club house is a leaky tree and old books and the Sith have an underground lair with giant statues, Tesla coil lighting, and clone technology ? Where do I sign up as long as the first to die is the Mouse.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 30, 2019","Absolutely epic from start to finish. If you’re a Star Wars fan, this is a must see.",POSITIVE
"Dec 30, 2019","Very good - lots of callbacks, and epic moments. Kind of threw out some previous moments and didn't deliver on other moments. Solid conclusion though but not a masterpiece.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 30, 2019","I liked it. Funny, lots of action and god plot.",POSITIVE
"Dec 30, 2019","I feel like a 42 year journey has ended, I am an original Star Wars fan. Was there on opening day, May 25, 1977 as a young 16 year old boy actually saw the original Star Wars twice that day, before it was renamed A New Hope. Rise of Skywalker hit all the high water marks that a good Star Wars movie should, J.J. Abrams did good to the story. Many nods and tributes to the past. There will always be haters no matter what but to those of us who have been along for the ride since the beginning we have been there for every twist and turn, we enjoyed the shock that Vader was Luke's father, snickered when we found out that Luke and Lea were siblings and that they had kissed. We the original Star Wars fans have been given a gift of closure to the saga. Thank you Disney and J.J.",POSITIVE
"Dec 30, 2019","Yes, it is great and I will see it again. But so many questions unanswered. Can't go into them without spoiling the movie.",POSITIVE
"Dec 30, 2019",It’s Star Wars folks. Quit being snobs.,POSITIVE
"Dec 30, 2019","Overall solid Star Wars movie with great Cinematics, familiar characters and a masterful score. The film's plot was a but dicey at times and the story of the Trilogy as a whole lacked direction. For a true Star Wars fan this film is welcome entertainment.",POSITIVE
"Dec 30, 2019",An enjoyable homage conclusion and trip through franchise lore.  Certainly much better than the abomination that is Last Jedi.  I would and will see it again.,NEUTRAL
"Dec 30, 2019",Poor writing.  The middle was great but not enough to overcome the start and end.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 30, 2019",Liked the story line. Music and CGI. Fighting on spaceships would require some sort of advanced suits to be realistic.,POSITIVE

"Dec 30, 2019",I love all Star Wars movies. This was good but at times...slow moving.,NEUTRAL
"Dec 30, 2019",Need to know the story.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 30, 2019",Some will like it others will dislike it. As far as entertainment value. It’s great. As far are being nit picky with the storyline and the characters. You will be disappointed as some characters will inevitably die. The end of a great saga.,POSITIVE
"Dec 30, 2019","Although the film moved at break-neck speed the entire time, it was still fantastic. As the films did in the past, it relied heaving on nostalgia and although it was the final chapter, it certainly left a ton open for the future with Rey, Finn, and Poe.",POSITIVE
"Dec 30, 2019",Loved it! Can’t wait to watch it again,POSITIVE
"Dec 30, 2019",By far the best of the most recent trilogy! No cringe-worthy corny moments and definitely wrapped up the saga well. Not perfect cinema but a definite must-see.,POSITIVE
"Dec 30, 2019",Good ending to the saga,POSITIVE
"Dec 30, 2019","The movie was very good. Definitely kept with the Star Wars line, my only issue is that it is Rise of Skywalker so I wish they wouldve used Kylo as the rise of Skywalker as he truly is a Skywalker. Otherwise overall it was great!",POSITIVE
"Dec 30, 2019","Fantastic movie!  Great acting, directing, storyline and special effects!  I loved how it tied so much of the past Star Wars movies in!",POSITIVE
"Dec 30, 2019",Great movie.  Typical Star Wars.  Love all the special effects and crazy characters.,POSITIVE
"Dec 30, 2019",Talked to much and not a lot of action. Would have liked for all the past Jedi to be with Ray when fighting with the emperor.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 30, 2019","Spoilers-Good story but not one character died unless so minor or bad guy. Kylo Ben dying sold it better. When Leia died and Chewbacca got upset was best scene.  A couple of  Poe's scenes should have been reshot... closer to the acting on DisneyJr. I like the actor, and most scenes were great, but... 
Still very enjoyable and I'd like to see it again.",POSITIVE

This movie did not disappoint",POSITIVE
"Dec 30, 2019",Despite what the nerds say it was quite excellent and I already knew most of the movie going in. There are no slow parts. I would have had the force ghost of Ben at the end as well. Just Luke and Leia made it a little cheesy. ,POSITIVE
"Dec 30, 2019","Amazing conclusion to this culture changing franchise. Well directed with all the action, character development, humor, and drama of the original three movies.",POSITIVE
"Dec 30, 2019","I thought it was a pretty good bookend to the Skywalker series. I thought it was quite a bit better than the previous episode. Possibly a little too convenient in the final battle. But, there's only so many battles you can do. Of course, we need to understand that nothing is going to compete with the original trilogy.",POSITIVE
"Dec 30, 2019","I know a lot of people weren’t happy with this movie.  Some parts felt a little rushed, but really this is a case of not being able to make everyone happy with an ending.  If you separate it from the impossible expectations it was a really good movie.  Entertaining throughout, good writing, a lot of fun.  I’d definitely recommend it.",POSITIVE
"Dec 30, 2019",Excitement all around. What an amazing tribute to Carrie Fisher.,POSITIVE
"Dec 30, 2019",Everything!!! Perfect ending!!!!,POSITIVE
"Dec 30, 2019","Poor story line too much in special effects. Political messaging, can't we just have something entertaining? Don't mind women as super heros  but all Rey did was tell her companions they didn't understand and would go off doing her own thing while the guys looked like idiots asking what do we do  what do we do. At least in the first movies each character has strengths and weaknesses they worked through and together. Oh yes at the end was mentioned or worked into storyline or  just dropped it in 'they need to work together'. Like a novel ...by page.. you need to say this and page...you need this. Poor writing I hope this is that last Star Wars they make. It's the last we'll see.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 30, 2019",It's a no all around! Please stop making them and don't be tempted by how Star Wars X may sound!,NEGATIVE
"Dec 30, 2019",worked on the Skywalker saga instead of trying to set up next saga,POSITIVE
"Dec 30, 2019",I watched Star Wars in 1977 when I was 11 and have watched all the movies since. Introduce my children to Star Wars early on.  My son and I have seen them all. This movie was one of the best. Had great action and tied in elements and characters from the first movies. Loved the prodigal son theme and redemptive aspect of the movie.,POSITIVE
"Dec 30, 2019","Not a good Star Wars movie. Not a good movie movie (JJ was better in ep. 7, somehow). It’s amazing that the same studio that is bringing us good Star Wars (Mandalorian) is also bringing us this awful tripe. Such a by-the-committee, check-off-all-the-boxes fan service that it comes off as saccharine.   The WORST example of what is wrong with Disney owning these properties. Kitchen sink moviemaking at its finest. 👎",NEGATIVE
"Dec 30, 2019","I enjoyed the whole movie, but Daisy Ridley's  performance as Rey steals the show! She did excellent!",POSITIVE

"Dec 30, 2019","Some action, bright colors, and nostalgia tries to cover up a turd.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 30, 2019","Very solid film to end the last trilogy of Star Wars trilogies. Much better than the last one, nothing super weird liking milking an alien for gross-looking milk. Some great cameos, and good job working in previously shot footage for Leia. Go see it!",POSITIVE
"Dec 29, 2019","The best of the final trilogy, which is a low bar.",POSITIVE
"Dec 29, 2019",Middle of the movie dragged on.,NEUTRAL
"Dec 29, 2019",An almost perfect conclusion. So many loose ends were tied up and there were some extremely satisfying scenes. Special effects were incredible and the Easter eggs littered throughout the movie with some key symbolism at just the right moments showed how much love and care was poured into finessing it. Well done to all involved.,POSITIVE
"Dec 29, 2019","I thought it was a great end to the story, considering RJ killed off my childhood hero in The Last Jedi.",POSITIVE
"Dec 29, 2019","I thought that it was inconsistent to the other movies in the series. I wanted a lot less of Palpatine and more on the other characters. They did a good job with Carrie  Fisher. I thought it was always her on screen-no CGI.
I saw the original episode 4 three times at the theater way back when. I haven't seen any of the others more than once at the theater. I won't go back for this one.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 29, 2019",Breathtaking so much fun!! Loved the story loved the  effects.  Best one yet!,POSITIVE
"Dec 29, 2019",A pretty good movie. It's main flaws were clearly due to having to throw it together very quickly after the previous director was fired. But even in spite of that the movie was a lot of fun. (And they brought Lando back!),POSITIVE
"Dec 29, 2019",I loved it. Wrapped it all up.,POSITIVE

No implications of anything romantic. Also, what was Fin going to tell Ray? “I love you or I love Poe!” Either way it wouldn’t have added or taken away from story anyways. As for the final battle scene, Lando Might as well have said, “on your left” at the end. And all the Sith live in me, vs all the Jedi live in me. Dumb. Last comment on JJ Abrams. JJ. You 👏 don’t 👏 understand 👏 how 👏 lightsaber 👏 battles 👏 work 👏, on an emotional level. Looks cool though.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 29, 2019",An excellent movie and service. It was better than i thought it would be!,POSITIVE
"Dec 29, 2019","just like Episode 7 felt lime a remake of episode 4, Rise of Skywalker felt like a.remake of Return of the Jedi.  Although the story line was good, I felt like there were too many predictable scenes.  Also I think the Star Wars saga shouldn't be about the Skywalkers rather an Asteroid Droid, his Protocol Protocol Droid companion and their Human friends",NEUTRAL

"Dec 29, 2019","I loved the mix of the old and the new.  I loved the honoring of Carrie Fischer.  Some of the plot lines and actions were predictable, but I was surprised at the lack of clicheness of some of the familiar.  Loved Finn feeling the force.  Loved that Rey was not a Skywalker, but chose to be a Skywalker.  Some good storytelling.  Awesome cinematography and CGI.  Loved the intro of some of the new characters.  Much better than the last two.",POSITIVE
"Dec 29, 2019",Great story with great effects!!,POSITIVE
"Dec 29, 2019","The movie was OK but everything felt rushed. It’s unfortunate because the movie had too much to do: fix the debacle from the last film & try & wrap up the saga. Unfortunately, it’s not something I can recommend even though I’m a huge fan of the series.  Too many plot holes, too many new characters that did nothing to advance the story while others (Rose?) were left to languish, and not enough exposition to make the end battle feel epic.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 29, 2019","Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker is a very satisfying end to the saga. It is very intense, visually stunning, and the actors did an excellent job. Do not turn to the dark side. See this movie!",POSITIVE

"Dec 29, 2019","I'd like to start out by saying this movie is the opposite of ""the last jedi"", meaning critics hate it, fans love it, and a mix from those In between. For fans (or just people who liked the original movies) the return of old characters should be fun to see, if not just nostalgia factor alone. For critics looking at everything the first 2 acts are too fast, never stopping to catch a breath nor allowing you too (though it finds its footing in the third act and delivers a satisfying climax). Also it answers all the questions from the 2 previous installments but neglects to resolve ones brought up in itself, which would be okay if we could have another film to wrap it up but THIS IS THE LAST! the final issue ive seen brought up is lack of originality, which is valid however nearly all the star wars films consist of the characters traveling across planets in search of something, where they are confronted by the villian, then a climax involving a big spaceship battle where evil is defeated. Spoiler alert: i thought the palpatine thing didn't explain enough and sort of ruined Darth Vader's sacrifice in the 6th film and the whole thing with Kylo renn saving Rey just re-used that completely. So in the end why did i still rate this 8 stars after all the criticism? Well because many of the faults i honestly didn't see until writing this review, and in the end star wars has one of the biggest fanbases ever! To make the last film fan devoted is a great way to go out, and for casual viewers, if you aren't looking for fault you will have a good time. I reccomend this movie even with its faults because it is a genuinely good movie that deserves a watch for anyone who has seen the others, just not a stand alone.",POSITIVE
"Dec 29, 2019","Im a huge Star Wars fan. It has been a part of my family since episode one. I was disappointed in the wrap up. Very predictable. Also had more rude language than I expected.

"Dec 29, 2019","I've seen this movie before...oh yeah, it was called Star Wars: Episode 6.  All that work, time, and effort and you couldn't write an original story?!  Entertained, I was.  Impressed, I was not.  So many plot holes, so many obvious plot twists coming 1000 light-years away.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 29, 2019","Stunning visuals, fan service and Daisy Ridley's great performance wasn't enough to make up for the lack of soul in the entire 2.5 hour epic.  Again, as with most JJ movies, too much action sequences and not enough time to allow us to really attach  ourselves to the characters.  After 3 movies I still don't really care about Poe and Fin.  The dialogue was also dreadful at times which didn't help.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 29, 2019",Great fun! Don't listen to critics.,POSITIVE
"Dec 29, 2019","It was full of a lot of obvious fan service. It felt cringey at points because it was so obvious. They through everything back in from all the other movies except tauntauns... I get it, I'm watching starwars geez. I just wanted something original but based in the starwars universe.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 29, 2019",IMAX 2D Experience is visually and sonically SparkTacular! The large format and thunderous sound contributes to the massiveness of the conclusion to the trilogy.,POSITIVE

"Dec 28, 2019","Thought that they did a very good job of ending the saga.  Felt the storyline with Kylo / Ben could have been different, but understand.  All in all exceeded my expectations on how I thought it would be tied up.",POSITIVE
"Dec 28, 2019","Pretty good special effects, not much plot or character development.  Or acting.  Like most sequels, it tried to ride on the coattails of past successes, and failed.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 28, 2019","Spoilers -- The movie had some nice scenes but the overall movie was so filled with plot holes and contrived moments to basically make it silly.  Take how the Sith have managed to build 10,000 Star Destroyers in secret each equipped with a Weapons of Mass Destruction able to destroy a planet.  What you say?  So why build a HUGE death star or star killer base when you can build a ship that moves in and blows up the world within seconds.  Makes all the prior movies a joke utter joke.  And how do you build 10,000 Star destroyers and man them in secret?  And to top it off they have 10,000 ships ready to launch but how convienent they can't launch without a control tower controlling them all due to ""blah blah blah"".  So the Sith are so stupid as to leave all 10,000 ships sitting vulnerable for 24 hours when a spy is known to be in the ranks rather than launch them at least into space where they would be well protected with shields and such?  Amazing.  I could go on and on and on with the plot holes.  But overall it's a sad finish to what should have been a grand finale.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 28, 2019","See this movie and go back and watch Force Awakens and Last Jedi, they will make a lot more sense. And then go see this again! Lots of great moments for the beloved cast. Poe and Fin share great moments. New characters add to the story. Some of the Carey Fisher moments felt forced, but they had to work with what they had. Rey was always destined to carry the Jedi forward. In the end, a great end to a device trilogy. I love this franchise. My kids love these stories.",POSITIVE

"Dec 28, 2019","Great movie, a good way to end the Lucasfilm series. I don't go to the movies much because, being hearing-impaired, I miss a lot of dialogue. This movie, however, had enough action that I was able to follow along and figure out the plot.",POSITIVE
"Dec 28, 2019",Good ending to all of it.,POSITIVE
"Dec 28, 2019",The writing seemed rather lazy throughout most of the movie and seemed to rely a lot on nostalgia to tug at the heartstrings of true Star Wars fans.  With that being said I completely bought into the nostalgia gimmick hook line and sinker and absolutely loved it.,POSITIVE

"Dec 27, 2019",It was good. Not sure it puts the saga to rest,NEUTRAL
"Dec 27, 2019","Best part of the movie is the actors, they do the absolute most with what they’re given, and the moments where Kylo/Rey/Finn/Poe just build emotionally are some of the best in the film. Unfortunately, they weren’t given much to work with. The plot was overstuffed and many of the crucial plot/world building points were just completely under-explored or not explained. Similarly, the reveals/twists don’t feel earned and what the story is trying to tell is unclear. The pacing was insane and many of the other technical filmmaking aspects, though not awful, weren’t nearly as good as the two previous films. In the big picture, it feels like this film, and the trilogy as a whole, really suffered from lack of cohesive vision, from a plot perspective and from a thematic/storytelling one. It’s impossible to not contrast this with Avengers Endgame & the MCU, which has its own flaws, but has always had the ability to tell individual stories that were unified in the collective vision. The movie had too much weight/importance to not see if for yourself, but be warned, it’ll likely disappoint you.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 27, 2019","The best in the series! Excellent effects, graphics and story line. Definitely worth watching in extreme xd in the big screen. Looking forward to owning this on blue ray.",POSITIVE

"Dec 27, 2019",What ya exoect after 8 movies in this series. But a few character interactions that made no sense to the story ad it had developed so one star down.,POSITIVE
"Dec 27, 2019","The plot crammed far too much into itself at once leaving no time for the audience to react. Every character's arcs were undermined to make room for unnecessary action sequences. The character arcs were all closed in ways that reaches of lazy writing. Rey's whole story revolved around her need for belonging and a family. This movie left her just as alone as ever by having her take the name of a dead bloodline. The Last Jedi focused heavily on Poe's leadership ability and how by the end he was ready to be in command. In this movie however he is barely shown in a leadership position at all. When Poe finally is promoted to general, he immediately declares that he is incapable of managing alone and appoints Finn as his co-general. Finn has never shown any interest in being a leader, but throughout this movie shows possible force sensitivity which is never actually explored by the plot. Kylo/Ben's redemption is rushed but adds meaning and emotion to this otherwise forgettable film. His immediate death just shows how uncreative and lazy the writers were with the characters. All in all, this movie is forgettable. There is no time is the poorly paced action to emotionally connect to the characters and the ending leaves you with nothing.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 27, 2019","Best of the sequel trilogy, you have to see to judge for yourself",POSITIVE
"Dec 27, 2019","Incredible. JJ Abrams fixed the screwup that was the Last Jedi, and then some. He canonized a bunch of Legends stuff, brought back old faces (Wedge!), and fixed the Last Jedi's broken theme. There, the theme was, ""Let the past die. Kill it if you have to."" Here, it was, ""The past will pass away, but it is the burden of the new generation to rise up, pick up the mantle, respect what has come before, and live up to it."" Excellent message for an increasingly disrespectful and selfish generation. (And I am a millennial, thank you, just one that sees value in respecting those who have come before.)",POSITIVE

"Dec 27, 2019","I mean, its Star Wars, of course its going to be epic. But I think with all of the story lines needing to wrapped up we kind of get a diluted finish to the Skywalker saga.

They can do things with film now that Lucas couldn't do 40 + years ago. the storyline is good, the loose ends are tied up, even if there's a leap of faith here and there in the final chspter of the Skywalkers.

"Dec 26, 2019","A hodge podge trying to bring in everything that the studio “thinks” fans would like to see. I have been a star wars fan my entire life and this was a large disappointment to me. The movie was poorly planned out and a majority of the new items brought up such as the “homeworld” of the sith, is not accurate. The title crawl was very poorly written, a sixth grader could have written it better than the idiots at Disney who ruined George Lucas’ legacy.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 26, 2019","Great end to a wonderful saga. Of course its not perfect and suffers from a lack of story advancement in the preceding episode, but still gratifying and a lot of fun.  Not sure what movie the critics saw, and dont listen to those YouTubers who are simply hating on Disney and wanted this movie to fail.",POSITIVE
"Dec 26, 2019","The beginning of the movie and the way the characters were tied into their destiny what's a bit clunky and that could possibly have been due to Carrie's untimely death. However my biggest criticism is that the big reveal for Rey became quite anticlimactic with the evidence provided before the reveal. however, from the moment of the reveal to the end of the movie there was a far more classic Star Wars feel that brought joy and sadness and hope in the vein of George Lucas and was an absolutely fitting way to end this saga.",POSITIVE

"Dec 26, 2019","Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi ruined the franchise. The RoS should have ignored TLJ and started with handing Luke his light saber. Since they didn't ignore it, JJ Abrams spent his time trying to fix the problems in an awkward way. This led to the movie feeling contrived, lacking great story telling, and constant jokes dissolved needed tension. The movie had no heart.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 26, 2019","I really like it. I think its a bit rush and contradicts a lot, but its good in its own way",POSITIVE
"Dec 26, 2019","Tried to go in the movie with as much of an open mind that I could. Dunno how much I was affected by the negative reviews, I surely didn't get my hopes up. The movie could only impress me from that point on, and at that, it failed.

***SPOILERS BELOW***

Unfortunately most of it was literally laughable. Dunno where to start, so I'll just wing it.

Leia had two and a half lines, it was obvious that they had no footage of Fisher left and the scenes were brutally forced in there. We see her train Ray which hands Leia the saber not feeling up to the task yet, stating she's tired with all of it. The scene attempted to be dramatic, displaying the despair of Ray, her fear of the dark side lingering in the back of her mind. Giving up her saber to her master (Leia) is portrayed as a big gesture, the symbol of her not been ready. Fast forward 3 minutes, the Millenium Falcon with the rest of our heroes arrive with a clue for the next quest. Leia literally just hands the saber back stating she's ready. Guys... It's been 3 minutes. 3 damn minutes. You can't even boil an egg that fast. Bullets have left guns slower than that.

Next fail. At some point they go on a plant and find one of Poe's old friends. She probably had a name, I referred to her as the Gold Ranger. If you've seen the movie, you know who I'm talking about. It's a character with zero backstory, the only cool thing about her is the gold ranger suit she never takes off. Oh yeah, Poe and the gold ranger had sexual tension for like the 7 seconds they appear on the screen together overall. It's hinted that Poe ends up with the gold ranger, but who can really tell without any proper screen time devoted to them. Dunno if it was an esteemed actress behind that helmet or an extra, surely loved the power rangers cross-over as a fan of the franchise though. It's morphin time!

Next. Star Destroyers. An endless fleet of them, a spectacular thing to watch. Each and single one of them equipped with the unbelievable power of a Deathstar. Just one of them could obliterate an entire planet in seconds. Their weakness? They all operated using a single GPS device. One GPS for the whole fleet, not per ship... Let's state that in different words. Imagine a hundred or a thousand of them, the exact number doesn't really matter. They could only travel all together, since only one was carrying the guiding system and the rest were essentially followers. Dunno about you, but I find the number of them a bit excessive to destroy one planet or even a solar system. I can almost imagine how the conversation went.
Engineer: -""Boss, we have the power to destroy endless planets all at once. I say fk it, let's buy one GPS and travel all together"".
Boss: -""You're hired"".

Star destroyers again. X-wings were messing up Star Destroyers by the bucket but they were just too many for them to handle before reinforcements arrived. Come on guys... Y U DO US LIKE DAT. In the previous movies they could barely scratch them, now they fell like flies. GTFO of here. I guess Palpatine cheaped out and used tin foil to make them. A fleet of tin foil ships guided by a single GPS. Tough times to be a Palpatine nowadays, money ain't what it used to be. Oh and let's not forget that only a couple of them seemed to actually be manned.

How can I leave out the two brave Generals of the Resistance. Its leaders Finn and Poe took over from Leia when she passed. Only fitting for them to carry that responsibility. Except... They kind of didn't. Final battle? Finn was on the main star destroyer (the one with the GPS) trying to bring it down and Poe was flying bravely in an x-wing, shooting down the tin foil Star Destroyers. So the two Generals, the brains behind the attack, were on the field fighting. None was in the command ship co-ordinating, both were fighting. You can definitely argue that each was in charge of air/ground, this point is up to you to decide how much it bothers you. I do expect a resistance General to be behind the scenes looking at the big picture and coordinating the attack like Leia though, therefore it bothered me.

I can mention plenty of more examples like this, the story was a massive sieve leaking all over the place. Let's focus on the couple of things that I genuinely enjoyed now. Ray used force lightning (by accident). It was obvious to me that Chewie was on another ship since the same exact thing happened on the 7th movie (yeah, not much originality to be found here). But when she used force lightning, I got hyped. The second enjoyable moment and the stand out highlight of the film for me, was when Palpatine absorbed the force out of Ben and Ray. He then used his force lightning on every ship above, like a MASSIVE EMP essentially. When I saw him use it to that extent, I massively nerded out. It is well known in the SW universe, Palpatine was the strongest force lightning user and we never saw its raw power in the previous movies. Pure nergasm... and then the movie went downhill again. Ben saved Ray, they kissed, he died. Pure cringe. Also why nobody can use the force to climb anything in this movie? Hmmm.

To sum up, it seems like the ending of this trilogy, unashamedly deficated on the legacy episodes 1-6 built. Ray somehow is the strongest Jedi ever existed, holding back Palpatine's extremely juiced up lightning single handedly, healing at will, all that without even training properly. Imagine that. Luke? Nah. Anakin aka the chosen one? Meh, who's that? Kenobi was probably a subspecies if you compare the power levels. Dunno why they felt the need to degrade the old trilogies so much, but they 100% did. They just spawned grandkids of the original cast and made them overpowered with no logical explanation. Thanks Disney for ruining this franchise for me.

Let's all get excited now for Star Wars: Episode 10, starring Tar Tar Bings, grandkid of Jar Jar.

P.S.: Carrie Fisher deserved a better send off",NEGATIVE
"Dec 26, 2019",great action and awesome storyline as usual but too many little smart comments and really... people riding horses in space ontop of a spaceship? can we get somewhat real here?,NEGATIVE
"Dec 26, 2019","Meh.  The plot was super, super thin.  They spent tens of millions on special effects but only 2.99 on a script.  Felt very rushed.  Provided more questions than answers.  It's very sad what's happened to the entire Star Wars franchise.  I truly hope this is the last one, but profits will ensure they come up with some other lukewarm garbage to push on us.

"Dec 26, 2019","I wasn’t alive to watch the original trilogy, but this is my generations Empire Strikes Back. A perfect way to end a saga.",POSITIVE
"Dec 26, 2019","It doesn't do everything because that's just impossible, but what it does, it does mostly right. The expectations this film faced not just to finish the saga but to also fix the mistakes of the last jedi were impossible to satisfy fully but if you look at this movie with a bit of distance you will very quickly realize this is a fun and entertaining story with mostly well written characters and some very emotional scenes. The music and landscapes provide a great addition to the exciting story.",POSITIVE
"Dec 26, 2019",Fight scenes and the movie in general was a bit long on my opinion but it was really good overall!!,POSITIVE
"Dec 26, 2019","Good conclusion to the Skywalker Saga. Better paced than the Last Jedi. Defiantly has a different feel than any of the other movies. Once you see it, youll know what I mean.",POSITIVE
"Dec 26, 2019",Too predictable! Good movie but not great,POSITIVE
"Dec 26, 2019","First, I found the previous installment, The Last Jedi, to be one of the worst movies ever. The bad taste that movie left behind has been hard to get rid of. The Rise of Skywalker was not offensive like that movie. Whether it is the Star War movies or Pirates of the Caribbean, Disney just can't help themselves. They eventually bog down the story in the name of producing messaging. Whether they think they're doing social messaging or advertising for their theme parks, it destroys movies.  Until the final fight scene, this was a good movie. The end left you wondering how certain things happened, where did the power come from, like the events just happen out of nowhere. This is JJ Abrams story telling problems. He creates a nice looking movie, but never fully develops how things happen. They just do. Unlike The Last Jedi, I'm glad I saw this movie at the theaters, but have no desire to see it again.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 26, 2019",Solid way to land the franchise,POSITIVE
"Dec 26, 2019",I grew up with Star Wars so I get it. The last one was terrible “the last Jedi” but this one was much better. I understand the negatives but if you go back and watch the originals they have some plot holes as well. I actually had a few moments that were pretty emotional for me. Such a huge part of my childhood. ThanksJJ for doing your best to fix RJ’ s mess. ,POSITIVE
"Dec 26, 2019","This would not work as a stand alone movie. The payoff at the end is great if you've bought into the story and trilogy. Otherwise, the plot of the movie will seem crowded and rushed.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 26, 2019","very confusing, felt rushed, a lot of plot holes.. the emperor returning was stupid. visually great but the story was badly written",NEGATIVE
"Dec 26, 2019",Great way to end the Skywalker saga.,POSITIVE
"Dec 26, 2019","A fitting end to the Star Wars saga.  All the ""loose ends"" from the previous 8 movies were satisfyingly ""tied up"" (although some new ""ends"" arose, which may never be dealt with).

The movie fittingly, and respectfully, gave tribute to Carrie Fisher through the scenes that were filmed before her death.  BRAVO!

The ""new"" guy-in-the-Chewie-suit did an EXCELLENT job ""giving life"" to Our Favorite Wookie.  What a shame we won't see him in any more Episodes.

Summary: 42 years after the debut of Star Wars, the saga has come to an end.  This episode has PLENTY of swash, boom!, and such to satisfy any Star Wars Fan.  There are plenty of ""Time To Cheer"" scenes, as well as a few Real Tear-jerker scenes (some are Unexpected - make sure you pack a lot of ""Kleenex""!), and there are enough Things That Quickly Go By that you may want to schedule a few viewings so you can Catch Them All, OR, wait for the DVD release so you can ""leisurely"" peruse the movie ""at your own pace"".",POSITIVE
"Dec 25, 2019",Great finale to incredible series!,POSITIVE
"Dec 25, 2019",Could not guess what was going to happen next. Just Terrific!,POSITIVE
"Dec 25, 2019","This is my first review and I just got out from watching Episode 9. I really feel like I have to say this, and I am saying this with the thought that to its core RoS was a great movie. From start to end the movie was engaging and fun watching. But from an actual fan of the franchise, and its deeper lore I have to say there were so many plot holes in this film. 

Granted I do know that when Disney purchased the rights to the franchise a lot of the lore was retconed. But ill try and stay on the things that arent. The romantic scene between Rey and Kylo was possibly the most cringy thing I have watched in a movie in a long time. When it happened there was a guy behind me that audibly said ""ugh"". Nothing more than a tragic friendship should have come from that relationship.

Rey's yellow lightsaber. Each color of a saber signifies a different specialty of that Jedi. Not only was the Temple that house the crystals to MAKE lightsabers destroyed in Rogue One, yellow is the color for the Jedi Temple guard. Did she find a crystal? Did she make one? If she made one it would be red.

The extremely disappointing missed opportunity to introduce the Grey Order. Rey Is NOT a Skywalker and personally shouldn't just have given herself that name. If anything she should have kept the name Palpatine and made a point that her name does not signify who she is as a person.

I could keep going but I want to make a point and say that the movie was a pleasure to watch, but leaving the theater and thinking about it as a whole was extremely disappointing.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 25, 2019",Back to the original theme of good vs evil,POSITIVE
"Dec 25, 2019",The movie was fantastic. There were so many nods to every movie and old cannon.,POSITIVE
"Dec 25, 2019","This may be one the of the most ridiculous Star Wars movies. I would have preferred the movie stick to the trajectory set by The Last Jedi, but there is a lot of fun to be had.  The best moments are the Kylo/Rey scenes.  I look forward to seeing it again",NEUTRAL

"Dec 25, 2019","It was good to see Palpatine brought back, and good to see Kylo Ren go back to the light side. I can't put my fingers on the exact thing, but I enjoyed this movie more than it's 5 predecessors (since SW7 came back).",POSITIVE
"Dec 25, 2019","If you enjoy narrative whiplash, uninspiring scores, unending contradictions to established lore, and hollow cookie cutter characters - Then this is the two-hour-thirty-odd-minute-excuse-of-a-film for you.

If you don't enjoy narrative whiplash, uninspiring scores, unending contradictions to established lore, and hollow cookie cutter characters- Then this is not for you. Save your ten bucks and your popcorn money. Find somewhere showing the Phantom Menace, pay them for a ticket to that, and go watch it instead - Because at least TPM has a final fight sequence that is wholly satisfying to witness.

The Rise of Skywalker only does one thing right, and it's how respectful it is to Carrie Fisher and Princess Leia. 

The Rise of Skywalker is worse than bad, it's nothing. It's a void that envelops any emotion you might feel and crushes it to nothing. The only joy I felt was when I could finally stand from my seat and leave.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 25, 2019",The movie was great and cover all the mysteries of the force awakens and reversed a lot of the stuff that Rian Johnson did in the last Jedi. Also was really well done for the fans. The true diehard fans! Now just bring Boba Fett back out of the pit,POSITIVE

"Dec 24, 2019","Just saw it with my sons (13 & 9) and they thought it was the best one of the series. For reference they have watched all Star Wars movies, cartoons, and shows hundreds of times so these are not casual viewers...lol. Personally I’ve seen all the movies, some of the cartoons, and currently watching the Mandalorian. I thought the movie was a fitting ending for this series of movies. The action was great and I enjoyed all the personal moments each of the main characters got. I for one will missing hanging out with these characters but look forward to whatever comes next.

If you go in without any other Star Wars knowledge or background then you’ll like it, but if your a die-hard Star Wars fan then there might be some things you don’t like.

"Dec 24, 2019",Star Wars movies are always the best.  They are never a disappointment.,POSITIVE

"Dec 24, 2019",good ending to the most recent trilogy but should have done more to tie in the two previous trilogies.,NEUTRAL
"Dec 24, 2019","Could have been better.  Needed to see more of ""Luke"" in the movie and perhaps Obi-wan and Yoda.  After all,  They were the main stars of the Saga.  I guess that's what happens when Disney gets involved and minimized George Lucas' role.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 24, 2019","Genuinely epic. I enjoyed it immensely. There were a few moments that I felt that, as a film, Abrams missed an opportunity or two. But all around, big movie in the best way.",POSITIVE

"Dec 24, 2019","Loved the direction they went with in this film! Really a great conclusion to the Saga and the final chapter in the book of Skywalker, it really fills in the holes that The Last Jedi failed to do and really regained this trilogy’s credibility. Definitely recommend, a must see!",POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2019","Great ride, a solid end to the trilogy, a nice message about being who you choose to be regardless of where you come from and a nice, even fun goodbye to a series that some of us have ridden alongside our entire lives. BIG visuals, epic stakes and, sure, a few contrivances, but nothing that felt outside the universe. People complained when Force Awakens as too much like what came before and others derided Last Jedi for departing from that in some ways. You cant please everyone. Do yourself a favor and dont insist on being victimized by a freaking movie. Kick back and enjoy! Whatever Star Wars moments you love from childhood are still out there and you might get more here. You wont feel cheated or like something is wrong- but maybe something will be missing when its over. Its Star Wars! Its done! But it will always be with us like a blue-tinged memory and the movie does a great job of reminding us that our past can support us, but letting it make your decisions for you (like how you feel about this movie) is the path to the Dark Side.",POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2019",If you hated Last Jedi you will love this. Just the right amount of new stuff and nostalgia. I only had one fault with it and it's the big twist in the movie. you'll see what i'm talking about when you see it.,NEUTRAL
"Dec 24, 2019","An attempt was made to fix the multiple issues created by the last movie. The amount of ""Deux ex machina"" moments is staggering. I guess if some of the ideas were developed between 2 movies it may even worked. The Last Jedi wasted the opportunity to do so",NEGATIVE

"Dec 24, 2019","Fast paced, exhilarating, and fun. In my opinion what a Star Wars movie should be. I was hoping for a little more oopmh to tie up the saga, but it didn't take away from my overall enjoyment of the film. I've enjoyed the previous two films (for the most part), but couldn't stop thinking that I wished the rest of the trilogy was more like the Rise of Skywalker.",POSITIVE

"Dec 24, 2019","The movie was better than its predecessor although it brought new questions that should have been answered in the film instead of disney saying ""get the extended edition book in March to get those answers"" the only real complaining that besides the questions is the lack of a particular character these movies are based around. Especially after those scenes were filmed but removed in the final cut.. it makes up for the last jedi but leaves 2 new big questions unanswered..",NEUTRAL
"Dec 24, 2019",The critics are idiots and are not in touch with reality,POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2019","Long time Star Wars fan but hated this movie. Weak story line that progressed though ""coincidences"" vs natural unfolding of events. Writers used too much verbal telling of the plot through actors vs showing the plot or letting the plot play out in the movie. Several times entire story lines were simply told/summed up in several lines. Zero chemistry among the actors with fairly poor acting - exception Daisy Ridley who unfortunately had no one to play off. Honorable mention to Adam Driver but it is hard to take him seriously in the role they gave him. Rested on the same literary technique/joke structure at least 6-7 times which caused the comedic relief to seem forced and as if watching a movie a 6th grader wrote. When all of the above is combined, you walk away feeling the writers/directors/producers must assume we are all so stupid we could not possibly watch a movie and comprehend any plot more complicated than a Disney cartoon. Just another rushed Hollywood movie for the sake of making as much quick cash as possible. 
Best part of the movie - Original cast cameos.",NEGATIVE

If you didn't like TLJ then you will like this better. There are  call backs and fan service just as you would expect for this final film of the saga. Even after seeing it twice TROS doesn't feel like a movie to end the saga. This movie shows us what episode 8 could have been. You'll love Kylo and Rey these characters have gotten better with each film. I give it a 7/10. If you like it, cool. If you don't, that's okay. Like the prequels you may have to give it time.

At least this one did not spit on the face of fans. Mild improvement. Best movie of the new trilogy. Worse than all of the prequels and Orig Trig",NEGATIVE
"Dec 23, 2019","It was an overall great movie!! There was lots of symbolism from the other movies so it would definitely help if you have watched the other movies! But this movie was an emotional roller coaster and I would definitely watch that movie 10,000 more times!",POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2019","Great story, as it follows along with the past movies from the series. Must watch if you are a fan, and even a recommendation for non-fans of the series as it has great action.",POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2019","With a couple of minor issues, a very good effort to fix the mistakes by Rian Johnson in The Last Jedi. Good ending to a 42 year old saga.",POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2019",To predictable and frankly there was no story or connection made with any of the characters.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 23, 2019","Everything in Star Wars rhymes. Ben Solo's story rhymes with Anakin's, and we've known that for a long time. The end is the last stanza in the same, long poem.

"Dec 23, 2019","Thought it was a lot better than the last movie. For the most part it was well written but there were a few scenes that seemed like the actors were overacting. I felt like it was a nice end to the saga, just wish we got to see more of Rey, Finn, and Poe.",POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2019",Overuse of heteronormative/patriarchal tropes but otherwise it was a fabulous flick.,POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2019","A very rushed Star Wars movie that does not connect with the previous movies.  However, it's still a fun ride with memorable characters and a good ending.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 23, 2019","Somehow forgets the storyline of the previous movies while still using the same characters. Last Jedi had about 5 rebels remaining; ignored. First Order dominant force in the galaxy; not good enough - Palpatine has built a whole new fleet (Ewoks apparently deal to remaining First Order destroyers at end by throwing sticks at them). Red Imperial Guard make a good fight of it; Palpatine's Imperial Guard falls down like dominos. Jedi suddenly have magical sith-like powers with which they can bring people back to life. Palpatine after clinging to power for a kabillion years decides Rey should kill him and assume power. Leia can only speak in monosyllables or cryptic sphinx-like sentences; film insists upon pushing and pushing this.Palpatine suddenly has magical super-sith lightning with which he can destroy ships. Rebels ride hairy horses on a destroyer for no reason. Han is a force ghost? Destroyers' fate rests upon one poorly protected air control tower which can be shifted to one poorly controlled destroyer tower (alright, that fits the universe ok).",NEGATIVE

"Dec 23, 2019","After the ""critically acclaimed"" Last Jedi I was really turned off to the franchise. However I feel the Rise of Skywalker does a good job as a sequel to the Force Awakens.   I enjoyed the film thoroughly  despite the negative bad reviews from the ""critics"".  There was no ""subverted expectations"" in this one. Go see it now!",POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2019",Personally thought it was the best and made sense of a lot of questions from other movies.,POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2019",The plot is rushed. Not a movie that will satisfy hard core fans,NEGATIVE
"Dec 23, 2019","Great and fun movie... nice end to the series.  The negative reviews are just nonsense.  Its Star Wars... not Citizen Kane or Schindlers List, people!  Plot holes and silliness are all part of the Star Wars universe.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Driver was incredible!  Jake Cannavale Is an absolute putz for dogging the movie.... especially since his acting in The Mandalorian was just laughable.  Boom.",POSITIVE

"Dec 23, 2019",great movie.. it leaves questions on what will happen next.. I hope the story continues..,POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2019",This movie had so many opportunities to use great characters in the Star Wars universe but it didnt. It really lacked in the excitement department. I dont know who okays the scripts but they need to be fired and bring someone with a vision and some imagination in. Its time to move on.,NEUTRAL
"Dec 23, 2019",I enjoyed this movie. Even the audience was cheering.,POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2019",It was really good and we loved it. The story was really good and suspenseful.,POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2019","I would give this movie a much more of a fair rating, but seeing as the audience score is being bloated with very unfitted five stars, have to give it this to bring this down a wee bit.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 23, 2019",Must watch even if your not a fan of Starwars. Its entertaining.,POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2019",If you don't nitpick the movie and just take it for what it is it's a great movie.,POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2019","We absolutely loved it. Weve been fans since episode one and out of all 6 of the new movies, this was by far the best. It was right up there with episode 5 and 6. Loved the full circle and loved the Easter eggs. We want to see it again!!!",POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2019",Watch the #RiseofSkywalker AKA hey we kill somebody don't worry about it we got other s*** going on,NEGATIVE
"Dec 23, 2019",Great story. I am a lifelong Star Wars fan. Maybe one too many light saber fights. Other characters not needed (Rose for one).,POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2019",Fun and entertaining. A perfect ending to the Skywalker saga.,POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2019","The journey to find the thing they need, to find the place where the other thing they need, to find the other place they need to go was so convenient that it was laughable. They fall into a pit where they find the first thing they need and boom, new force powers that no other Jedi in canon has ever used is nor simple for little miss Rey. Oh and look, here is the thing we need. Yay. Now at the new place they needed to go to find the other thing they need to find the other place they need to go and, yay, they just happen to stand in the only place on the planet where the special blade lines up with the wreckage of the thing perfectly. Oh cool, force healing a stomach wound also seems to heal and erase old scars, woot woot. Must have been running low on the make-up budget. Now lets talk about Palpatine, So he came back from death, has the power to use force lightning against hundreds of ships at once but goes down because Rey used two Lightsabers to stop his lightning. It gets worse the longer I think about it. At least it is over.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 23, 2019",Went to see it after seeing fan reviews and seeing that critics seem not to like it. And you know what it’s not half bad. The movie certainly isn’t the best Star Wars movie out there but there was a lot of none sense to have to tie up for the steaming garbage that was the last Star Wars. I’d recommend it. It’s a bit rushed but if you’re a true fan you’ll pick up what gets laid down.,NEUTRAL
"Dec 23, 2019","it was great!  Story was well done, good twists, lot of emotion and amazing cinematography.  Love it...and so glad not really the end!",POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2019",Amazing!! Didnt know I would need a box of Kleenex.,POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2019","Easily the best of the new trilogy and probably on equal footing with ROTJ within the overall saga. If you hated TLJ like I did, then you'll probably be satisfied with this outing. Rey earns her power, Kylo is a surprisingly interesting antagonist, Poe and Finn are fine, and the original cast are treated with respect (with the possible exception of 3PO, but in a tongue and cheek kind of way). I even liked the Emperor and thought it made sense how he could still be a player 42 years later. My 13 year-old daughter also enjoyed after hating TLJ and not really liking TFA. All is forgiven in my book.",POSITIVE

"Dec 23, 2019",Continues the trend of fun that New Hope had rather than anything profound.,POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2019","The opening 45 min went a bit slow with a lot of head scratching moments as the characters lines felt rushed and unauthentic. But then the movie turned and the pace picked up, the actors quit talking over each other, and the storyline became more clear. They leave one glaring loose end that should have been tied up, but overall not the worst Star Wars movie by a long shot.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 23, 2019","Loved this one, best out of the three. Great movie!!",POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2019","Exciting , Action Packed, Great Story",POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2019",It was definitely better than the last Star Wars movie. It has a sad but good ending that tied things up nicely.,POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2019",I loved it and thought it was a great finish for fans of this epic space odyssey.,POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2019",Loved how every story line was wrapped up. Loved how much Leai was shown-wasnt expecting her to be in so much.  Loved Han Solo returning even though it was just 1 scene.,POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2019",Things got out of hand at the end but it was entertaining.,POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2019",Video games have better plots. It’s a complete relentless adhd disaster. The twists make no sense.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 23, 2019",We enjoyed it but the pace of the movie felt rushed like they were trying to cram in as much as they could.,POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2019",Screw the critics.  This is a fun movie and puts a nice bow on the whole thing.,POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2019","haters gonna hate. this was a great movie and a fitting ending to the saga. equal parts funny, moving, and poignant it was just what Star Wars has always been, at its best.",POSITIVE

"Dec 23, 2019",Typical Disney finish - but still entertaining.,NEUTRAL
"Dec 23, 2019",Awesome movie!!! Loved it! Near perfect ending to the Skywalker saga. The movie felt a bit fast. Hard to digest the movie as it has so much content. Very emotional movie. Awesome visual effects! Wished Darth Vader was seen in the movie (somehow).,POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2019",I loved it. Way better than what people were saying. I think it closed some chapters and opened some new ones.,POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2019",It was a strong ending!! Loved seeing the old characters! Hans!!! I will miss the movies. May the force be with you’,POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2019",Epic and entertaining. Great acting by Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver.  What a story over 40 years.  Thanks Mr.  Lucas.,POSITIVE

"Dec 23, 2019",Far from greatness but a fitting ending packed with plenty of surprises,NEUTRAL
"Dec 23, 2019",Enjoyed all the references to all the previous movies which help to tie the story all together. Satisfying ending to the saga as well. It was painfully obvious in the casting that Abrams has preferred actors he likes working with and seemed to fill in the gaps with as many of his friends as possible. Effects were good. Lots of lightsaber fights. The fight stunt choreographer did a great job.,NEUTRAL
"Dec 23, 2019",Great way to end the trilogy !,POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2019",Wow. An absolutely stunning film. A little short and in need of more explanation within the film. But this film wears the space adventure name well. It was an absolute joy to watch it. Any fan of the series could cry while watching it. I will gladly watch this movie again in theaters. I’ve seen it twice now. Can’t wait for it to be released so I can watch it at home.,POSITIVE

"Dec 22, 2019","I enjoyed the action, the story plot but I feel that there was so many things that never properly got answered.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 22, 2019","A satisfying thrill ride, full of twists from start to finish, culminating in a finish which was 42 years in the making. Inevitably, there are some lose ends which don't quite get tied up, but it's ultimately a satisfying conclusion to one of the greatest series ever filmed.

It's not perfect, but nothing is. As with any relationship, don't ruin what you have by wishing for what could be. Go out, watch, and enjoy.",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2019",definitely the better movie out of the trilogy. they all suck but this one suck the least.,POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2019",I loved the movie.    Great movie that took elements of all the chapters and had a great finish.,POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2019",I loved it. I think it was a fitting end to 40+ years of an Epic story.,POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2019","I liked it! Sure, it wasn't perfect, but nothing ever is. I think JJ did just about as good as he could have given the mess that TLJ left him. I just wish it was longer and didn't feel like a race to the finish. I think it should have been around 30 minutes longer to expand on certain things. Overall, it was a fun (very fast) ride and left me feeling much more satisfied than TLJ did.",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2019",Would have tweaked the ending a little bit but over all great movie,POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2019",It was just a fun movie to watch.,POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2019",I honestly didn't think the movie was as bad as some critics say. There were parts I enjoyed and then the many parts I thought were not good. I did feel the movie had to much cramped in it. This movie needed to be split into 2 parts. for a star wars movie the ending battle was lackluster.,NEUTRAL
"Dec 22, 2019","Outstanding movie, we can't wait to see it again! JJ Abrams deserves a ton of credit for making a fantastic StarWars movie.",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2019","I really liked how the saga ended and I enjoyed the movie from the beginning to the end. It moved me, I laughed (love you C3PO) and loved the return of many iconics characters. Although some things left unexplained, in general I think it's a great ending.",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2019",I can't say that I did not like it but I do wish it had come with a warning with how much how flashing light scenes there were. It had been a minute since the last time I watched a star wars film and forgot about that so it made it hard to enjoy. All imma say is the ending was the best part!!,NEUTRAL
"Dec 22, 2019",This movie was Traaaashhhh! The leaks were right. This played like a bad fan fiction.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2019","After hearing mediocre reviews and no spoilers I went in skeptical. To my surprise, it was TRULY enjoyable and a fitting end to the Skywalker Saga.",POSITIVE

"Dec 22, 2019",Liked that the movie had connections from both animated series. Enjoyed the movie the entire time.,NEUTRAL
"Dec 22, 2019","It was the best movie I have ever seen. Everything about it was top notch. Always have faith in JJ Abrams because of the amazing film work he does. The whole cast and crew killed it. I was crying the whole second half and after the movie because of how the movie made me feel... happiness, pure joy, and sadness about it being over. Loved it! Can't wait to see it again and again...and again",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2019",A few things in life are so incredibly good as TRSW.,POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2019",It was very awesome and ended very well.,POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2019","JJ saved the day, barely! I was about to give up on this franchise when R. Johnson nearly destroyed the franchise I know and loved. I'm glad I didn't.",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2019",Fun conclusion! Doesnt measure up to being picked apart so dont. Go in like a kid and walk out as happy as you were when you were 8.,POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2019","Is it perfect? No it is not. There are some definite problems. But overall I got my monies worth and felt satisfied with the ending of this saga.  Did JJ and Company kowtow to the fans, yes they did.  Is that so wrong though?",POSITIVE

"Dec 22, 2019",Loved it. Great ending to a fantastic story!,POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2019","A great finale to the Star Wars saga. I was very happy how this movie redeemed itself from the last one, the last one was a total disappointment! The Kylie and Rey relationship was well played and K was overall impressed. Thanks for making this movie right Disney! ",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2019",This movie had very bad pacing issues,NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2019",awesome story truly wonderful,POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2019","A really disappointing way to end a 40+ year story. Still trying to figure out where a Skywalker rose at any point, aside from Ben Solo's 3 minute redemption scenes that should have happened much earlier in the movie. I'll never be okay with the ending or the fact that JJ has killed Han, Leia, and their son. Really wish I could unsee this film because it ruined the entire saga for me.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2019","Amazing - I felt like I did 42 years ago seeing the very first one!  A little hokey of course as expected and some of the plot mechanics were a bit forced, but it rang every bell, and left me with a tear in my eye.",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2019","I first saw Star Wars in the movie theater with a new Hope episode four and I thought that was the best movie I have ever seen until I witnessed the showing and revealing  of the rise of Skywalker. This movie totally blew me away it was a complete roller coaster ride of highs and goodbyes that sealed the deal for me.  This movie is an introductory movie.  And, to that end this Star Wars movie is absolutely a perfect match.  Thanks to JJ Abrams for making and directing a wonderful film for all to enjoy including future generations of Jedis.",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2019","Given the impossible task this film had to accomplish, it did a very good job of finishing the 9-part story and taking us on a fun and touching ride. I'm grateful for being able to share this story with my children, as I did with my parents.",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2019","I did not mind many of the scenes. However, thematically it to me is dissatisfying. There was someone who had an extremely minor role in the movie when they should have had a major role in the final outcome of the movie.",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2019",It was so good. I value the movies for what they are. I dont read reviews before seeing and appreciate the storyline. I have friends thAt criticize every detail and Im not one of those fans. This move was action packed and closed out the trilogy well imo.,POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2019","Top notch star wars story on paper, flawed execution on screen — but still solid",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2019","This is a special effects masterpiece!! You are doing yourself a disservice if you don't watch it in IMAX 3D at some point. Otherwise, it's a Star Wars flick. If you like Star Wars, you will like this.",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2019","It did the Star Wars well enough. There were lightsabers and star ships surely, but it lacked the heart that I had hoped to see. The Last Jedi took some big swings that many audience members found worrisome. This movie opted to try and correct those steps but created a literal Frankensteins monster out of a character with no right and no need to be here. The message that was being built in The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi was the idea that it wasnt some royal bloodline filled with midichlorians that allowed one to use this energy field that surrounds us and penetrates us, that binds the galaxy together. The sequel trilogy was aiming for an egalitarian message that the force was in all of us. Rey came from nothing, Finn had a sense, the slave boy moved his broom and dreamed those same dreams Luke had all those years ago possibly looking at the same stars of Tantooine, albeit lightheaded farther away. The Rise off Skywalker undid all of that work. The sci-fi opera is still here. Passions are strong, aliens are unique, worlds are explored. This is still a Star Wars, and maybe thats enough. However, if there is one word to describe my feeling leaving the theater it would be unsatiated. I have a craving for more Star Wars, but unfortunately this will be it for quite some time in the big screen.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2019",Im a SW fan. This wAs the best of the new trilogy. BUT......Below the the original and Rogue One. FightMe,POSITIVE

"Dec 22, 2019",LOVED this movie. As a lifelong Star Wars fan I thought this was a perfect ending to the saga. The only thing in 2019 I enjoyed more than this film was being at the panel at Celebration Chicago when JJ dropped the trailer and title.,POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2019",Absolutely great storyline and visual effects. They did a great job! Loved it!,POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2019",I loved that they wrapped up many stories. I did not think Ben had to die.,POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2019",It was kinda cheesey. There was no Jar Jar Binks,NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2019","Star Wars movies draw intense emotions from people with some approving and others disparaging.  This episode in the Skywalker saga was neither the best, nor the worst of the IX (IMO).  Wrapping up and ending a 40+ year saga and satisfying all must be incredibly exhausting.  Avengers: EndGame had that task earlier this year with more movies and less time.  While I think RoS was a good series finale, it wasn't quite as good as EndGame's saga ending episode.",POSITIVE

"Dec 22, 2019","Little choppy at times, but overall a fun ride to close out the saga.",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2019","While the story does hurt the ending of the Return of the Jedi some, overall I really liked the movie.  I like Rey and Kylos character development the best, but the movie included great stuff about Finn and Poe as well. It was emotional, funny and exciting throughout.",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2019","I've watched all the Star Wars movies with anticipation.  This one was a bit of a disappointment.  Abrams tried to pack too much content into this last movie.  His job was to wrap up plot lines from the past 8 movies.  He introduces new characters, new plot lines, new plot holes and discontinuity.  It feels like a high speed shallow rush through what should have been a rich journey wrapping up an epic story.  Entertaining, but empty.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2019",Nostalgia...fried up all the loose ends.,POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2019",Critics aren’t worth a single pen they wield. They were all wrong. This was an epic and fitting end to the Skywalker saga. I will be buying that one as soon as it is released. Loved it.,POSITIVE

"Dec 22, 2019",Great movie. Lots of nostalgia. Definitely a must see for a true Star Wars fan!!,POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2019","Following my disappointment with TLJ, I walked into TROS with low expectations. While there were certainly things I liked about this movie, there were so many aspects about this film that didn’t work for me. The film certainly looked great but sadly the film suffered from messy story telling that failed to expand these characters in a way that felt engaging which I feel was the biggest problem with this new trilogy. I don’t get the sense that there was singular plan or vision of where to go with this story and unfortunately what this trilogy ended up amounting to in the end was a bunch of fan fiction that felt nonsensical the more I thought about it. I don’t hate or like this film but this is Star Wars and I expect more and better. ",NEUTRAL

"Dec 22, 2019","Eager to answer its fans' many questions, The Rise of Skywalker sets a frantic pace not seen before in 42 years of Star Wars films. The result is a slightly cramped, but fulfilling end to this beloved story.

The cinematography, visuals, and design somehow manage to exceed the earlier entries of the trilogy, The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi, even though they were both visual powerhouses.

The music and sound design rise to deliver both nostalgia and emotion on a whole new level that I did not think that I would get a movie that could have phoned it in to be ""good enough"". 

Excellent performances by new and returning characters work well to stabilize the chaotic action they are undertaking throughout the film. Even though I've spent two (fairly long) movies watching the newer characters, their plights remained intriguing and not overly predictable. A few characters were under utilized by the script, but the story is not majorly hampered by this. 

Despite the rush, this film does something that two previous trilogy-ending Star Wars films, Return of the Jedi and Revenge of the Sith, could not. And that is provide a grandiose ending worthy of the brand.",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2019","It was a pretty entertaining film, had flaws and felt pretty rushed, and I don't know if I would consider it the ending of the skywalker saga but it was good but could've been better.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 22, 2019",Excellent way to end the saga!!! Cameos by the original team was expertly infused into the culminating story line. I like they ending as it leaves the door open for new stories so all around and excellent job and a must see,POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2019","I liked a lot about The Last Jedi when I first saw it, but have soured on it a bit since reconsidering some of the choices that Rian Johnson made regarding how he handled some plot points that had been established in The Force Awakens. I feel that The Rise of Skywalker course corrects things to a certain degree and was definitely made to be a fan-pleasing final chapter to the Skywalker saga. With many emotional callbacks to the previous films and the inclusion of the late Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia in much more than just a brief cameo, I felt The Rise of Skywalker was a fitting ending to an adventure that some of us have been on for the last 42 years. The Last Jedi was for the critics. This one's for the fans.",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2019","JJ tried his best, I understand there’s a lot of pressure to write the final Skywalker movie, but it was ultimately a huge mess. It was really rushed and there was too much going on to fully follow what was happening. They ignored essentially everything that happened in The Last Jedi, and it was sort of like JJ was trying to fix whatever happened in TLJ to please audiences. It came out messy. Overall, TFA and TLJ were well constructed movies with a lot of wow factor, but the movie was predictable and at some parts boring. The only scenes I really enjoyed were the ones with Mando and Kylo Ren. Despite the limited amount of lines, Adam Driver is incredible and tries his best to do justice to the at times embarrassing dialogue JJ gave him. I wish he was treated better. As well as Kelly Marie Tran’s character. Too much attention on Poe and Finn’s force sensitivity that no one really cares about and is dull story telling. ",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2019","Phenomenal. This movie hits every emotional feel you could possibly imagine. Opposite of the previous Rian Johnson film, this movie moves at a rapid pace that had me smiling throughout. I have some minor story gripes throughout, but overall, this was a fantastic finally to something that has been extremely important to me for the last 30+ years.",POSITIVE

"Dec 20, 2019","The plot was Inconceivably played too safe and the movie felt like it was two or three movies smashed into one. The actors played their part to their own abilities, this movie was just a horrible ending to a fantastic franchise.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 20, 2019","I honestly don't think it had a chance after the last Jedi. The story was left in such shambles that it seamed impossible for them to fix it. The Mary Sue problem is real, the palpatine connection is a horrible stretch, the cinematography is close up and fast frame the entire moving leading it to overwhelm ones senses. The biggest problem is the seemingly endless resources of the empire. They've lost time and time again and they always just come back bigger Like nothing happened.  It did have some positives including, cool new settings, decent aerial battle scenes, and kylo ren and Finn were good characters.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 20, 2019","My 11 year old son and myself, a 36 year dad, went to the opening night of Star Wars ""The Rise of Skywalker"" at our local IMAX theater.  We thought the movie was bad.  We love Rey and Kylo. It was great to see the other wonderful characters. The film was visually excellent. Rise of Skywalker had good action scenes. However, our consensus ranks The Rise of Skywalker second to worst in the lovable Star Wars franchise.  My son described the story telling as weird and boring, leaving him with no other words to describe the movies review. I felt the story was oddly paced, predictable, and overlooked major plots with no explanation or rationale. My son was really disappointed and felt like it was a pointless movie. He shoveled a lot of snow and did extra chores to earn opening night in IMAX. However, The Rise of Skywalker appeared to be a film written, directed and produced, hastily. If the Star Wars saga has officially come to an end, then I think the movies objective was to cram, stitch, and cover the minimal amount of cohesive story telling.  I'd like to acknowledge and thank the multiple hundreds of skilled people it took to create these Star Wars films.  They did excellent work and this film should not be reflective On them, rather to the few atop whom had the chance to deliver a great story and make a great movie.  Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker fell extremely short of movie expectations as it pertains to the end of this once in a lifetime, generational saga.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 20, 2019","It was a fun, convoluted, fast paced good time. Star Wars movies don't need to be serious Cinema all the time, sometimes they just need to be fun and give the fans what the want.",POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019","I run 22 groups about Star Wars and throw a massive Star Wars convention in Nashville Tennessee check out The Imperial Commissary! 
This was by far the best of the new movies I will watch it numerous times in the movie theater do not listen to the bad reviews from haters that wouldn't know a wookie from an ewok! This is Star Wars this is the dream we have all lives since we were kids this is what we love this is what we wanted and I am so thankful this is the outcome!  JJ Abrams is not only a phenomenal director he is a huge Star Wars fan and really gets Star Wars!  Go watch it it's only 15 bucks and it will immerse you in memories and nostalgia!  I can't wait to see what they do next and I can't wait to go back and watch it again and again and again!  
Thank you Disney, thank you JJ, thank you George! - IC",POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019",Wrapped things up pretty well. Story line is peaked and there is plenty of meat for new tales to come. The movie experience is not unlike a roller coaster. Which is the whole point really.,POSITIVE

"Dec 20, 2019","Is a really bad movie, i thought rei was iron man in last part, so sad to watched this movie, new helmet to kylo ren, disney try to sell a new helmet 2.0 .",NEGATIVE
"Dec 20, 2019","This is not a perfect movie, and I don't like numerical scores but I might feel a little more mixed on this than the star would let on, because I do have a couple issues with the movie. Let me be clear though, I think this film is extremely unique, I think for me it was extremely thrilling and at times very compelling, and I think that I am gonna be thinking about it for a while. It is because of this, especially how much I will be thinking about it, that I think it is an ""Absolute Must See!"" as the 5 star rating suggests. I will try and justify my thought process and give my impressions without any spoilers below. 

Perhaps I should start with what I think were issues for me, because I will be praising this movie a lot and I am a Star Wars fan, so I could understand one thinking I would be inclined to like whatever has Star Wars on it (even though I quite dislike Solo and the prequels and I don't care for Rogue One or The Mandalorian). I thought the pacing for the first 10 minutes or so was detrimental to the film, to me it felt like I either wanted or needed to soak in a moment or info more a couple seconds after it had past. I thought that the incorporation of footage from Carrie Fischer's takes on The Force Awakens due to her death was very admirable but at times it felt narratively and cinematically off kilter or awkward, especially how a couple lines of dialogue were used. There were a couple minor characters whose roles I found to be kinda hollow, odd, or unsatisfying in their portrayals in this film. I also think that this film is very inside baseball at times, in a way which I would suspect could be alienating to a casual moviegoer who may not be as intimately or immediately familiar with moments, events, and characters of this saga. This didn't hinder my experience but it could hinder yours. This last bit I wouldn't consider a problem for myself either but I would consider this a very understandable problem for viewers to have. It has a very different sort of narrative style from the previous two films and also a unique visual style comparatively. The arc dense nature of the other Sequel Trilogy films isn't exactly present in my opinion, whereas previous films played 4-5 arcs with very clear at once on screen and usually had a bit of a more intimate focus on characters, exploration, plot, and action are juxtaposed for an adventure feel on which a thematic climax of the arcs of two characters (mainly) takes place. This shift could likely throw some viewers off as it may not gel with the rest of the trilogy to them or it may not be what they wanted out of this sequel or a SW movie per se, but for me I search for the focus within the movie and don't prefer to place an expectation of what that ""should"" be on it.

Now, let me talk about why I think this film is a must see. This film is one of the most intricate and nuanced conclusions of a trilogy or saga I have seen, and the ways that they are able to achieve these nuances are so subtle and fascinating. Musical themes, cues, and textures weave in and out, old themes are recontextualized and the music so accurately captures the interweaving of the many MANY elements of the movie. Scenes or lines are evoked or come back from previous Sequel Trilogy and Original Trilogy films in ways which range from subtle to direct, short to long, and small but enjoyable to extremely significant. The imagery has a similar effect and this film is one of the most symbolically charged and dense films I have seen. By god even the physical acting of characters, without lines, are clear evocations of things from before at times. However, despite all of this evocation it is almost never a mere repetition, a mere recreation of memory. The ideas which are called back almost always are developed and given some new insight or greater significance. I want to go back and watch the previous Sequel Trilogy films just to have a new interpretation of the various moments of those to play with, my watch of these other movies has been inescapably enhanced and deepened by this movie. This...  is something that is perhaps not unprecendented by cinema, but extremely rare and I think on the scale and intensity with which this film goes for it, it is unprecedented. That is something I am gonna wanna think about and talk about for ages, comparing frames, scenes, music, lines of dialogue, facial expressions, and so on across this film and the others and drawing out what they add to each other.

I think beyond this, it is also an extremely auteur film, an extremely ""fan"" film, and a huge blockbuster all in one. There is a lot of themeing and ideas at work that are played with and explored which make this film meaty to chew on, I'm still thinking about how delightfully powerful one minor backstory line is on a conceptual level and what it says about the world around me as a small example. It is a film which most definitely has a message (one very coherent and consistent with what has been the main messages of the previous films in this trilogy and saga, such as ""The belonging you seek is not behind you, it is ahead"" and ""This is how we win, not by fighting what we hate but by saving what we love"" to give a couple examples). Cinematically, I think this the visual and kinetic language this film employs, with deep camera focus, extremely vibrant and saturated colors, strong contrast between light and darkness, a keen eye for composition, and lovely quick and smooth oners, are very much the personal voice of the director (JJ Abrams) and very much support the tone and style of story which this film is going for. The craft was given a lot of care in this movie. This makes it feel like an auteur film. Narratively, it is also a film only this combo of writers (JJ and Terrio) could dream up. It's a love letter to everything before, an incredibly fast and unstoppable freight train, a powerful emotional rollercoaster which takes you high, low, upside down, and sideways, and it is not afraid to lean into aspects of SW which make it unique but also campy (surreal designs, silly humor, intricate plotting and worldbuilding, soap-y aspects to emotions and relationships magnified to cosmic scales). These aspects make it very much a ""fan"" film. It is also loaded to the brim with spectacle and bombast, the action is so big and so intense and the film refuses to stop trying to get you to have fun except in a handful of the most solemn and most heartbreaking moments. This film is designed to surprise and delight and keep audiences just barely up with it, still amazed by what has come before but also wondering what may come next. For me it succeeded. This makes it very much a blockbuster film. This combination (auteur, blockbuster, ""fan"" film) is very unique, and again while perhaps not unprecedented definitely hard to come by.

At the end of the day, I just like this as well. I have fun. I like the characters. I like their growth. The themes and ideas touch me. The direction is so evocative and singular. The score is so beautiful and smart. The humor is so charming. The designs are so cool. The visuals are so beautiful.

I know a lot of people have a lot of different opinions, many would disagree with what I said here or many would have other praises or criticisms I didn't touch on. I didn't touch on all of mine. That's okay. What I think I wanted to communicate is why I think this is a movie that is worth seeing for almost everyone. Then, after making up their mind about it, I hope they will share their views. I think this is a movie that a lot of people should give some thought too and anyone who like it would benefit from giving quite a bit of thought to perhaps, and I would benefit from hearing the perspectives of anyone who has thought about it, enjoy or no, agree or disagree with my views. This film will cause a lot of strong reactions I think and that speaks to something. I saw bravo JJ, bravo Terrio, bravo to all cast and crew. No one could have expected what this film would be after leaving The Last Jedi and hearing of who was writing and directing.",POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019","Although not the best Star Wars MOVIE, it is the best of the last three movies.  Won't give anything away but it completed a journey that I started in 1977 at the Astor plaza I New York as a 15 year old.  Thanks so very much J J Abrams.",POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019",Just what we Star Wars fan were looking for. ,POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019","StarWars, The Rise of Skywalker, is what happens when you give a nine-year-old a video mix board with preloaded clips from the last 8 StarWars movies, 20 mins after they have downed a gallon of red bull and four giant pixie sticks, all of which is edited by a guy who just found out he's going to get fired from his job writing Hallmark Christmas movies.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 20, 2019","Help us Baby Yoda, you're our only hope. The Rise of Skywalker is like a fat kid with the keys to a candy store. Everything looks shiny and wonderful to begin with, but after 20 minutes you're not swallowing it. You're choking on the reality that this is going to make you sick. For weeks. 
The script it terrible. The pacing is frantic yet boring at the same time. The characters are still two-dimensional. And no one really dies now – just our hope. 
There are a few good moments (the arrival of the larger ""people's"" fleet, the ocean light sabre battle and Chewie's anguish), but they're lost among dull dancing kite-loving aliens, long boring speeches, a mindless McGuffin quest, and giddy up, space horsies. (Give an Oscar to that angry horse that tells BB8 to bugger off. Best acting in the film.) 
Rey's big parental reveal lacks any emotional intensity. Palpatine's first appearance has no build up and hence no impact. Wedge appears for two seconds. R2D2 gets less time than some robotic hair dryer who adds zero – ZERO – to the movie. And the porgs are back. Not spit roasted either.
Hux is an embarrassing afterthought. Lando is underused.  What on Endor were the ewoks even in the film? And the Knights of Ren – space goths with nothing to do – skulk around and look scary but miss the chance several times to kill the good guys. Nice that they have staves but no guns. Must come in handy at the baton twirling competitions.
Amazingly, the two new female characters (who are really cool) get next-to-no screen time, despite Kathleen Kennedy's push that the ""Force is female"". Did someone say ""Captain Phasma""?
They're brushed aside for complete dullard characters like bearded pilot Snap Wexley and that Hobbit bloke – you know the one. Nope? They and the giant alien sea cucumber in the background of the Falcon have the appeal of those giant waving air sock men you see outside used car lots.
When Wexley dies by being shot out the sky and crashing into a star destroyer, I cheered. A Canto Bight donkey died somewhere for me thinking that, but hey, it'll stop them ever appearing again.
Worse, the film seems to be a poor knock-off of Twilight. Rey is Bella Swan, but instead of being fought over by a vampire and a werewolf, her affections are torn between a Sith and stormtrooper. Awww. And just like Twilight, the pasty-faced white dude wins; remarkable, considering that he's responsible for the death of tens of thousands of people.
Oh, and did Finn ever tell Rey what he wanted to say? Maybe, can you use the Force to get us out of this disaster? 
Sniffy ""mainstream"" reviewers claim that The Rise of Skywalker panders to fans, but then again, missing the great irony that isn't that what big franchises (and indeed, movies) rely on. We buy the tickets, they don't. 
And as fans, Disney has a major headache in convincing us to keep buying those tickets moving forward.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 20, 2019",very good film highly recommend ,POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019","It feels a little rush, but the movie is nothing but awesome. It's fun, entertaining and action packed. 
Late Carrie Fisher's scenes are great and respectful of her legacy and character.
Ridley, Boyega and Driver (mostly Driver) bring the best of their character to the screen with their performance. 
 It's a roller coaster ride with tons of emotions. Not perfect, but the best of the Secuel Trilogy",POSITIVE

"Dec 20, 2019","This movie is flawed. It's true that JJ Abrams was too afraid to take risks like Rian Johnson. The movie feels more like fan fiction than an actual Star Wars film. The movie started with a lot of exposition and that is rare in a Star Wars movie. The movie was also colluded. Despite the obvious flaws, I still really enjoyed the film. The cinematography was phenomenal and the acting was great. I think that it's a flawed yet amazing conclusion to the saga. I'm surprised by how much footage of Carrie Fisher they had and I loved how they used it. I see what issues the critics had with the film but I think that it deserves more than 60%. It's a good movie, not great.",POSITIVE

"Dec 20, 2019",I absolutely loved this movie. I don't know what these critics were talking about i felt like it closed up the sequels really great. It wasn't the perfect ending but you will still love it. I loved and cant wait for this to come out on Disney+. That's how great i think this movie is. Do i think its the best star wars movie? No but it is up there my person favorite is Empire Strikes Back not gonna be topped but it is probably my 4th favorite. But Yes go see this movie as soon as you can it is that good.,POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019","It could had been longer, the ""final fight"" scenes specificly. Anyway, that's the end of my favourite saga that I wanted to have.",POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019",Star Wars: The Click Farms strike back. That's the only way a film like this can score above 60% in reviews. Not judging from  a star wars fan point of view but from a filmgoers point of view. If the plot is terrible (which is) and the script is bad (which totally is) then what's left for the audience? Moreover it's pure copy/paste from the Empire strikes back! Bad film making 101 guys. Sorry.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 20, 2019","The movie was not only bland and boring, but it ruined the legacy of the earlier triologies. This includes the sequel triology, which could have ended in a unique way if the directors and writers followed the new themes established in TLJ.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 20, 2019",Wow just wow that movie was incredible and a fantastic end to the new trilogy,POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019","Visually stunning. Gorgeous scores. Strong cast. 

""Jam-packed"" is code for rushed writing and storylines. The movie tries to play on your nostalgia for the original trilogy at every turn.

"Dec 20, 2019","I loved it!!  Star Wars is to the point where it needs to be made for the fans, not the critics.  Yes, they tried to pack a lot into this movie, but they did it in order to make sure the fans would see a final Skywalker movie that they loved.  I though they accomplished this.  Nice job!!",POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019","The material for the two movies and the first act runs too fast, but I was delighted with the rest. Applause for the actors, because it is also their merit that this film is so credible.",POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019","Great movie! Had me hooked 10 minutes in and smiling ear to ear when I left the theater. While I like The Last Jedi now, it took me multiple viewings and a better understanding of the Star Wars Canon outside of the movies to get there. The Rise of Skywalker delivered in one viewing with no outside help. Everything was tied up neatly. The reason for Rey's almost instant mastery of The Force is handled well. The Kylo Ren arc is very satisfying as is the Kylo and Rey connection arc. Star Wars felt like an epic struggle between good and evil again. A fantastic ending to an amazing story that hasn't always been executed well. I loved it.",POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019","Despite being disappointed after watching TLJ, I still had faith in JJ Abrams and i went to the cinema yesterday, aaaand... it was awesome I must say!

You must have open mind to this movie and you have too look beyond the things that heppend, not just stay with what you are seeing. Its a beautiful story with action everywhere, the story is solid, the references are in every corner, the humor its perfect. I'm a fan who didn't like episode 1 and 2 or the last jedi, but I still see them and enjoy them, because I'm a star wars fan and well ... it's star wars. Great job JJ!",POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019","It's the worst patchwork of a movie I have seen in a long time. The narrative impasse, they tried to write them out of can be seen in every scene. This results in an unnecessary quantity of bland characters, loosely connected, thrown into an over-the-top CGI spectacle, relying too much on the copy-and-paste function of Disney's 3D-animation studios, that tries to push us through the galaxy high-paced enough to never question how much it spits on the legacy it should honor and refresh.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 20, 2019","A terrible ending to the Skywalker Saga. To be honest, you cannot really call it a Skywalker Saga after experiencing this movie. A jumbled mess of a story that is rushed from beginning to end. Course correction from TLJ is obvious, while straying away from everything you love about the saga. For me personally, the Skywalker Saga ended with Return of the Jedi. What a pointless new trilogy that gained nothing from its presence!",NEGATIVE

"Dec 20, 2019","Honestly as a die hard Star Wars fan I liked it. I think the critic reviews are pretty harsh. It's not without flaws though. I think like everyone is saying, it's a lot for a single movie. JJ was trying to fit his version of the last Jedi into it as well as make a conclusion. All honesty I like almost the entire movie, the only part I really didn't like was the end. It wasn't the worst ending imaginable but for a lot of Star Wars fans it might not be satisfying. Also there was some ex machina stuff going on in this film, so for casual Star Wars fans you may not mind it. BUT. If you're really into the lore of Star Wars or really into the powers behind Star Wars, this movie may frustrate you quite a bit. There's many times where I felt like Han Solo saying ""That isn't how the force works?!?!?"". For people who are into the lore though, there are also little nuggets of special things that'll catch your eye in a good way too. All in All, the movie is not as bad as people are making it out to seem. In my opinion the ending kind of sucked in some aspects, but in others it didn't. So I would definitely recommend to Star Wars fans.  Also just one last note. They did justice to our Princess in a beautiful way.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 20, 2019",Absolutely phenomenal. JJ resurrected the shortcomings of TLJ in fantastic ways. Great end to the saga!,POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019","I very nearly didn't buy tickets after that dumpster fire The Last Jedi. I have seen every Star Wars film in the cinema since the first film in 1977/78 at the Odeon in Swansea, I'm glad I changed my mind, this film was excellent.",POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019","The critics got this one wrong, as they did with The Last Jedi. JJ executed a wonderful ending.",POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019",I loved it! It left me feeling very satisfied. It fit in perfectly with the other films.,POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019","I will say there may have been two things i would have added but overall, it is an easy 5 star rating. There were no slow areas in the movie. For all the haters, just enjoy it and if you go into the movie with a bad attitude stay home and write your own masterpiece in your parents basement. Loved it!",POSITIVE

"Dec 20, 2019","Weirdly fast pacing and exposition in the first act, but it slows down and gets far better in the second and third acts. Rey and Kylo's relationship is awesome. I personally enjoyed it quite a bit, and this is coming from someone who's not a huge Star Wars fan.",POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019","If I could take all the disappointment, sorrow and pain I've ever felt in my life and show it in some way it would be this movie. It literally broke my heart and hopes and dreams. Star Wars ended with Return of the Jedi and that's what I will live by. Just stop it Disney its disgusting.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 20, 2019",Great ending to the Skywalker story! Wish JJ would have done all 3 movies in the trilogy sequel. Think the sequel trilogy would have been more cohesive if he just made all 3. Glad he came back to finish this Star Wars saga! Great fantastic wonderful movie! ,POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019","Great way to end the saga and JJ Abrams did a great job working around the disaster of the Last Jedi and the death of Carrie Fisher. Don't believe the critics, this is already one of my favorite star wars movies. The only reason I don't give it a full 5 stars is that it still doesn't quite match A New Hope or The Empire Strikes Back as the pacing seems a little rushed but this is by far the best movie of the sequel trilogy, no doubt!",POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019","ROSW was a compelling, engaging, and well told story. It is already one of my favorite Star Wars movies and is, by far, the best movie of the final three episodes. I could quibble with a few aspects, but my overall reaction was “Wow! I want to see this again!”",POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019","This movie in my opinion was a solid closure in the new trilogy. It hit slot of nostolgic feels  of long time fans with adding in few new things here and there. Critics give this a harsh rating. Worth the watch. The lightsaber duels are great, while some stroy pieces like the knights of ren are lack luster and kinda pointless. They could have used move action than what they got to make then seem more pronounced and relavent. .",POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019",A genuinely disappointing and laughable finale to this awful trilogy.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 20, 2019","This movie does a very good job at cleaning up the majority of a mess that the last film left behind. It's funny, you might cry, and the payoff , ""I am your father,"" styled moment will bring a smile to your face. No doubt that this will be another audience score with a huge confliction with ""Professional"" critics. Those guys don't know what they want with anything anymore, as seen with many movies with huge differences in scores, showing the mainstream does not enjoy the same things they seem to like.",POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019",It was amazing. A perfect ending to the Skywalker saga.,POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019","Terrific end to a beautiful trilogy. Not perfect, but a great time, full of tribute to the original trilogy.",POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019","Absolutely loved this one.. they are awesome surprises and loose ends tied up with appropriate aspects of the other trilogies, especially the good old episodes 4-6. I like that the movie doesn’t take itself overly seriously and includes the quirky humor of great Star Wars movies past while being a high action thriller ",POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019",Don't let the reviews get you down. This movie isn't the greatest star wars but it is not the worst and the fact is it was entertaning. I'm glad I saw the movie and well defend watch it at home when it is released.,POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019","A few things could have definitely been done differently, however its flaws do not come close to ruining the movie-very satisfied.",POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019",A fun wild ride with a fantastic end to the Skywalker saga.,POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019","I actually really liked it. Although very dense, I felt like it helped clean up some of the mess from the Last Jedi. All those who wrote, ""this movie could have been a trilogy in itself"" were right, I think.",POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019",The force is strong in this one!,POSITIVE

"Dec 20, 2019","This movie is frickin awesome. Definitely the best of not only the Disney Star Wars but, the whole saga. Love what they did with Ben. Ending will blow your mind",POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019","TL:DR - A bloated mess of a movie, it was pretty bad even if you don't care about star wars. Even as pure entertainment, it fell flat and was offensively loud and too bright; a sensory overload that gave me a headache.

I award the movie 1 star, for meeting it's deadline and crossing the finish line, even if it's a horrible trainwreck

Writing:
- bad screenplay

- very bad dialogue

- bad, nonsensical story

- very bad pacing (way too fast)

- very bad structure (what even was the A or B story? Who was the main character? It was just a convoluted mess)

- too many jokes that took away from the drama and/or just weren't funny.

- characters just have abilities that are completely unearned and nonsensical in the universe

- a moment that was supposed to be dramatic centerpiece, but just made half of the theater laugh

- an unearned and cheesy ending

Direction:
- bad editing

- baffling shot choices

- nauseating rack focuses and zoom ins

- no framing/staging to speak of

- lighting/ movement / photography so nauseating that I had to look at the ceiling tiles multiple times to rest my eyes

All in all I feel very bad for George Lucas, Disney betrayed his vision for what Star Wars was, and has made the most bland and forgettable trilogy of movies  in the 21st century.

It's okay though, episodes 1-6 will always exist as prime examples of an auteur bringing his imagination and incredible storytelling and filmmaking skill to a blockbuster form, totally independent from corporate overlords in Hollywood such as Disney, who made this travesty of a trilogy. My heart is heavy for George Lucas, and the backstabbers at Disney who lied to him and betrayed him will get their commupance.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 20, 2019","makes me hate The Last Jedi  even more..  -what  a waste of time, this  movie is  good  and its  a shame it has to stand on its own.",POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019","Adam Driver ripped my heart out and Daisy did what she had to do. Fun in parts, did a decent job of wrapping up a lot loose ends.",POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019","So much to unpack in this movie, but after Last Jedi there was much to be fixed. The result is a movie that's crammed full of story but it's worth the result. Probably my 2nd favorite behind Empire and just barely ahead of ROTJ.",POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019",George Lucas was telling the truth!!! Comes together in all the best Star Wars ways!,POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019","This Star Wars movie was simply beautiful and amazing and felt like a Star Wars adventure at its best. It was a beautiful and fitting Goodbye to our original family/friends/childhood gang and the Skywalker era as a whole. BUT Do yourself one huge favor and do not listen to the critics or reviewers, neither the professional journalist type nor the way over saturated Internet/YouTube varieties. For one thing, They can't enjoy movies as they are meant to be enjoyed and for another they may or may not understand any of how Star Wars works and why it's beautiful that way. Sass it a perfect movie in all aspects? No because they do not exist. Was it a great movie, especially a great Star Wars movie? 100% yes to both of those as it has everything you would want in a Star Wars movie plus a lot more. It also may be the most emotional and satisfying Star Wars film so far. Also if you are reading this and haven't seen Rise of Skywalker yet get off this site and do not come back....it's rotten in here and someone should burn it down",POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019","Saw the very first showing, and even though I read all the spoilers online, I was very pleasantly surprised. Critics are out of their minds, it's the best film of the New Trilogy and a great ending to the saga.",POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019",Do not spend money to see this movie. It is a disaster. What a sad and pathetic ending to what was one of the greatest stories ever told. Disney has really dropped the ball over the past few years with everything except the MCU. Shame.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 20, 2019","Great action and really awesome force abilities. The movie had a really dark but uplifting feel to it and I loved that. I will say some parts are predictable, and it did seem rushed. ",POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019",Great completion to the Star Wars Skywalker story. ,POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019",A movie for the star wars fans that closes all episode 8 loop holes and makes reference to all previous movies and stories. Fan and non fans must see the movie. Critics that want to see a drama movie or something deep this is not their movie and must Go see something else.,POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019","I just walked out of the theater and this movie is now my favorite of the sequel trilogy. I was concerned at first since every review I saw seemed to hate this movie. I for one loved it, it has some minor flaws and writing issues but overall it wraps up the story in an emotional and satisfying way. All in all, go into this movie with an open mind and come out with your own interpretation.",POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019",Best of the new trilogy. Feels the the originals...,POSITIVE

"Dec 20, 2019","Woo hoo! fan service is what we wanted, enjoy! When I read the pro critics did not like it, I knew it was going to be good!",POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019",I'll give it 2 stars since I gave The Last Jedi 1. This is a step above Rian Johnson's work but obviously not by a lot. I could tell JJ was definitely frustrated by how Rian ruined some of his storylines as evidenced by some of the (spoilers) in the film. This film was a mess. I feel like as fans we deserved better than this. The visuals & effects are top notch but at this point they should be. It's the story that was lacking & I can't believe they tried to drag Palpatine back for this. Disney could've been great but this proves sometimes corporations can do more harm than good,NEGATIVE
"Dec 20, 2019","This movie... oh this movie... If you geek out over lore and want to know the history behind the universe, this movie will intrigue you. Although rushed, this was a satisfying ending to the saga. The ending was Disney-fied and dropped the rating from 4 stars. ",NEUTRAL
"Dec 20, 2019",This is by far my favorite Star Wars film. It makes up for many of the faults left in the story line by the Last Jedi and weaves a truly thrilling and suspenseful end to the Skywalker storyline. If you like Star Wars at all (even if you absolutely hated the Last Jedi) you need to go see this movie in the theaters.,POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019",Omg this is bad...... and I love star wars. Watch the video clips on YouTube. Don’t waste your money or time on this. It has no flow in plot and then makes random large jumps that make no sense in the plot. Or more specificity are just a cheap cop out for plot.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 20, 2019",It was entertaining through and through. It was definitely safe and heavy with nostalgia. And wasn’t really taking any risks. Other than Rey’s backstory. THAT was very interesting and very well done. Overall I enjoyed it a lot. A satisfying end to a great saga. ,NEUTRAL
"Dec 20, 2019",“I...am all the Jedi!” Is literally the same as “I....am Ironman!” Yeah this doesn’t end the Sage well at all! Save the money and move on. Disappointment. ,NEGATIVE
"Dec 20, 2019","Does this movie have flaws? YES! Did I still enjoy the hell outta it? SHIT YES! It's all about nostalgia and sending off the old guard! Goodbye Carrie. We will miss you, Space Mom!",NEUTRAL

"Dec 20, 2019","Overall decent and entertaining. Although, it seemed rushed in places. Unfortunately, this is what happens when there are no story developments in the previous film.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 20, 2019","It is funny and entertaining, but a little confuse and messy, frenetic, lack of more dialogues, characters development and explanations about important events, many plot holes. It is a acceptable ending, but not a brilliant movie, not excellent, it is just good. Empire Strikes Back stills the best.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 20, 2019","My kids and I had a lot of fun watching this film. Is it perfect? No; few movies are. But it has a lot of heart, endearing characters and it looks beautiful (it was fantastic in 3D). Given that there was no real plan for this trilogy when they made The Force Awakens, the writers deserve a lot of credit for tying things together so well. All the performances were top notch. They also make wonderful use of the limited footage they had of Carrie Fisher. I'm sure that, like The Last Jedi, this movie will get a lot of criticism. But, I feel sure that the characters of Rey, Finn and Poe will endure; in large part to this film.",POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019",The worst movie of the saga.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 20, 2019","I loved it. As a kid back in the 80's, didn't read reviews before watching a film and decided not to this time. To go in pure and true to my own feelings. The trilogy makes perfect sense and made me kinda like a TLJ . Thank you to all involved.",POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019",Story was too long and convoluted.. No real imagination. The ending was way too predictable. Halfway through I couldn't wait for it to end.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 20, 2019",our worst fears have been realized,NEGATIVE
"Dec 20, 2019","Everything involving Palpatine is just retcons within retcons within retcons. I can't tell what's more insulting, that Snoke was just his remote controlled puppet body, that he's a cyborg zombie or that he just turns out to be Rey's grandaddy out of nowhere.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 20, 2019",It was not perfect. But it was by far the best of this trilogy. It abandoned everything the last jedi stood for and it brought Star Wars back to what it should be.,POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019","Star Wars Review Time! (No Spoilers)
Rise of Skywalker midnight screening complete. This film only demonstrates the disorganisation of Disney as they attempt to backpedal after The Last Jedi. Not only is the film unoriginal, but I'd go so far as to call it bland fan fiction. The plot holes are so obvious it literally hurts to watch. Star Wars is about the Skywalker bloodline, and more importantly the prophecy of Anakin Skywalker bringing balance to the force. The conclusion of the ""Skywalker Saga"" solidifies itself as anything but the story of the Skywalkers, but rather the story of a girl who got everything and didn't have to work for it. Poor writing, poor character development, and a story completely laden with ""progressive politics"" undeniably indicates that the core plot of Star Wars has been crushed under Disney. I forecast potential layoffs at Disney/Lucasfilm over this 3rd failed outing (The Last Jedi and Solo being 1 and 2 respectively). If you don't watch Star Wars for the story, then enjoy. But if you're a fan who's read into the lore, then I'm sorry, you won't be pleased. I suggest you save your money and make a statement to Disney that you won't accept this level of quality.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 20, 2019","Messy to say the least. A total lack of respect to Rian Johnson and anyone who appreciates nice story telling. In here they destroyed the Skywalkers, Rey and specially Ben Solo who is still theb",NEGATIVE

best movie. EVER.",POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019","Best of the new trilogy. Epic, great lightsaber duels and a great Kylo/Ben Solo. The only shame is that this is the last one",POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019","Great action sequences, added some elements of the expanded universe.
Although I liked Episode 8 with everything and the controversial of his decisions, Rian Jonson pretended to disrespect him with what was stated in the previous movie and that causes the return of JJ Abrams to have to fix all those plot holes that his predecessor left causing that the film dedicates a third of the film with a lot of exposure and for the second act there is not much time left to develop its own story.

With everything and that closes some of the doubts although forced and that affects in his narrative, I would have liked that this film was Epsiodio 8 and had another film to cover the story more naturally. It's not perfect but I don't think it's the worst Star Wars movie, put yourself in Abrams shoes and believe me he did what he could to rescue her from being an absolute failure.",POSITIVE

"Dec 20, 2019","The film itself could have been rolled out into its own trilogy but with the cards the director had been dealt with, with The Last Jedi, this film is absolutely superb and wraps it up so well.

"Dec 19, 2019","bad, really bad bad bad",NEGATIVE
"Dec 19, 2019","This is the worst of all of the franchise movies. Storylines didn't finish, introducing new unnecessary characters without a meaningful reason, the dialogues are flat, and there are several questionable choices regarding the story. The rhythm of the movie is a complete nightmare, the first hour is like a chase scene. We visit several planets, every mystery solved in a moment, zero character development happens. The movie does a lot of cheap commemoration to the old series which makes it more infuriating besides the other issues. There are several meme-worthy events also. I can forgive a lot of things about the stuff they introduced in the universe even if they are not making any sense, and there are so many basic issues with this that I won't even mention them.
There are 30-45 good minutes of the movie in the end which is worth watching. Which is worthy to say its a Star Wars movie. The design is amazing, the special effects are breathtaking, the sound is as good as you want from this franchise, and the actors do a good job if they are lucky to get a script/story/character to work with. It monumental, exciting, touching, its a shame that it lasts such a short time.
Overall its a really disappointing experience. I was biased because I love the SW universe. I was even indulgent against The Last Jedi because I hoped that the last one will make us forget it. Even the prequels have a satisfying ending. JJ Abrams was the guarantee. It didn't happen. I didn't know its possible but the Rise of the Skywalker is the worst of the whole series. The ending of the whole Skywalker saga deserved a better ending.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 19, 2019","Worst movie of the star wars saga. Poorly constructed script, confused with situations played. With a bad message. Bad jokes. JJ tried to undo episode 8 and the original trilogies. Why did we have the whole skywalker story if Anakin wasn't the one? Star Wars has always been a message of hope movie. BEN SOLO dies in a stupid way after redeeming himself. In the end no skywalker was happy. Ben and Rey kiss, he dies and then she's partying with poe and finn, it gets totally meaningless. Finn had evolved at eight and retreated at nine, it was just Rey and Rey. And Rey is so perfect that he doesn't need anyone in the end. It adopts the name ok. Honestly .... Horrible. Even the kids didn't like it.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 19, 2019",I cannot imagine a worse storyline that made less sense that took less effort that contradicted the lore more that was less entertaining and that could have ruined the joy of star wars more than what they did in episodes 8 and 9. this movie was terrible in every way and they should be ashamed of it. ,NEGATIVE
"Dec 19, 2019","It's definitely going to rile up a few people, especially to those who loved The Last Jedi, as The Rise of Skywalker almost acts as a course correction for that movie.

"Dec 19, 2019","I attended a press screening last Tuesday. Here is my review via BatmanOnFilm.

Even though Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time; Star Wars remains my favorite franchise of all time.

Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (written by Chris Terrio & JJ Abrams) is the last film, in the 9-part Skywalker saga that George Lucas launched in 1977 with ""Star Wars"" (later deemed, Episode IV: A New Hope.

I was able to see an early screening held for online press on Tuesday — and I left the theater with a feeling of conflict, disappointment, excitement and fulfillment.

To say this film is a mixed bag for me, would be quite an understatement.

Let me address a few issues I had with the film and then end on what I loved about it. Because that is the kind of a guy I am. Always ending with positive feelings!

Rian Johnson's 2017 ""The Last Jedi"" was a critically acclaimed, bold and beautiful film. The issue that Lucasfilm had with it, is that online fandom (relatively small, but loud group of folks) basically hated it.  And when you have several thousand people trolling and spamming the internet with their ire of a movie, it can eventually morph itself into validity.

In other words, the fans that hated it and were so active on social media with said hatred, that they succeeded in owning the narrative to an otherwise very successful movie.

Setting aside the racist/sexist faction of that fandom, lets address the thousands of good faith fans that truly hated Luke's arc, Rey's lack of backstory (who are her parents?!), Snoke's origin, etc.

Director JJ Abrams and his co-writer Chris Terrio seem to go out of their way to please those fans.  Far too much of The Rise of Skywalker feels like contrived fan service that reacts directly to the online fandom that hated The Last Jedi.

And it weighs down the film, a bit.

Now, I would argue that if the online backlash did not exist — or if I was unaware of it — then I don't think I would view this film from that perspective.  (Example: My wife is 100% unaware of online fandom, she liked The Last Jedi and I bet she will love TROS.)  But in the end, it does exist and The Rise of Skywalker often plays like an unnecessary apology letter to a relatively small portion of pissed off fans.

With that said — and I say this as someone that absolutely loves The Last Jedi — many crucial elements from that movie remain, and JJ Abrams incorporates them beautifully into the new film.

So, for every ""apologetic"" moment, there is also lovely moments that 100% pay homage to The Last Jedi.

And for that, I am grateful.

It is also worth noting, that once again the cast is stellar.

Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is, by far, the most interesting Star Wars character ever to be put on film.  I would even go as far to say that The Rise of Skywalker is as much his story, as it is Rey's (my 3rd favorite Star Wars character, right behind Luke).

Plus, many of the ""fan service"" moments land; and when they do, it will make you want to stand up on your feet and explode with joy.  For someone that loves all 3 trilogies, those moments were a real treat for me.

In the end, is The Rise of Skywalker a mixed bag?

Sure.

But even though I rolled my eyes more times than I did watching The Phantom Menace for the first time, I also cried for the first time while watching a Star Wars movie.

Cried.

Like, actual tears.

Three times.

Also, I am looking forward to seeing it again this week and who knows, maybe I will like it even more than I do now.

Please go see it. Enjoy it. And ignore online noise, too.

But after you do, I will gladly accept your acknowledgement that you now know just how brilliant The Last Jedi truly was. – Rick Shew

"Dec 19, 2019",Absolutely thrilling. A must watch!,POSITIVE
"Dec 19, 2019","This movie is extremely entertaining but I honestly don't know why. I found the other Star Wars movies much more different. This may be because the character Rey was the main focus in the movie which is why they are many negative reviews. However, I feel like the audience will love this movie. However, this was not shown in the film and will not be shown because this is the last film of the Skywalker saga. I strongly believe that this movie will make a lot of money just because people have already bought their tickets but they might regret it if they don't like Rey. If they love Rey, they will love this movie. This is because the movie is all about Rey.",POSITIVE
"Dec 19, 2019","A horrible ending to a beloved saga. It's hard to keep track of many many mistakes were made in this film, unexplained plot points was just the start, this saga that George began was focused on Anakin as the chosen one but Disney has seemed to forget this as this trilogy changes Anakins prophecy as the chosen one as he never did bring balance but rather the grand daughter of Palpatine did. Over all this trilogy was a mistake and Disney shouldn't have tried to add or change the Skywalker saga and do something unique instead.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 19, 2019","The movie was a pleasant finish to the Star Wars saga, emotional at some times. But the ending felt like it could have taken a more risky/thrilling path for the story.",NEUTRAL

"Dec 19, 2019","There should be a judicial court that sentences people and organisations who commit crime to human culture. This movie not only stole time I could have used wasting on YouTube or a random streaming service to rewatch something for the tenth time, it also gave the last blow to my great memory of the original Star Wars movies (pre-Disney). Would prefer to be blissfully ignorant of this tragicomical plot line, but unfortunately it's too late. Don't watch it.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 19, 2019","Awesome last chapter to end the Saga, Two thumbs up",POSITIVE
"Dec 19, 2019","Enough good in It to see what the film could have been but a contrived plot with little to no foreshadowing out of nowhere. Disjointed with the last two films, offering nothing new and lacking creativity.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 19, 2019",Terrible end to a disgusting trilogy,NEGATIVE
"Dec 19, 2019",Very fast paced. There's a lot of points that needed to be crammed in to make up for the lack of story in Ep. 8 and I feel it might out some people off. Some bits will annoy die hard fans (which I class myself as) but all in all the best of the trilogy. Look forward to seeing it again,POSITIVE
"Dec 19, 2019","The star wars feeling is back again, yeah!
(Now let J.J. Abrams make a re-cut of TLJ to finish the saga.)",POSITIVE
"Dec 19, 2019","Good movie, but it should have been an hour longer. Way too rushed in the beginning and it's hard to not miss something. But JJ fixed a lot of TLJ issues which weren't forced but helped fix some of the story... but he introduced his own issues. Like, hyperspace hopping?? Really??? 

Bottom line a good movie but some fans might take issues with some points.",POSITIVE
"Dec 19, 2019",This movie is the best one of the last trilogy. Far better than the last jedi and the force awakens,NEUTRAL
"Dec 19, 2019",The third and final straw that makes the Disney sequel trilogy worthless and utterly irrelevant. Star wars only contains the George Lucas made original/prequel trilogies!,NEGATIVE
"Dec 19, 2019",Thr first act was messy the ending was really similar to avengers endgame but I actually really enjoyed the film i sugest everyone to watch it twice the movie becomes 10 times better,POSITIVE
"Dec 19, 2019","As a wrap-up to a long-running cinemetic series, this movie definitely does not give the satisfying closure like Avengers Endgame. It was overly rushed in spots and other parts left a lot to be desired. There were a lot of easter eggs sprinkled throughout for hard-core fans, but it felt pandering after a while. The three things I did enjoy about the movie was the canonization of the amber (yellow-orange) sentinel lightsaber, that Force ghost Luke was much better than crazy hermit Luke, and that the series is finally over so no more damage to the Skywalker family line can be done by Disney. The Star Wars universe is rather fully established, so give us original stories in those settings...maybe something organically will happen giving us a new, well-loved and widely accepted trilogy that this last trilogy was unfortunately not.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 19, 2019","As a stand alone film it may be ok...  But as part of the joined up wider Star Wars universe, it took a massive dump on all 8 of the prior movies.  They developed some force powers to use for this one movie.  As a result blew a large plot hole in all the prior movies!  Star Wars needs to learn from Marvel and develop joined up stories.  They are capable (e.g. Rogue One and Rebels), but not with this film",NEGATIVE
"Dec 19, 2019","HOLLY WOW!! JJ and Team have really brought home a winner that is big hearted and oh-so strong with the force! I cried like a baby (so much!) but loved, loved, loved every moment of the Rise of Skywalker! Critics need a reality check, this is BY FAR the best of the last 3 and 1 of, (dare I say if not) possibly THE SINGLE GREATEST Star Wars Story ever told! Ep 9 does after all pay homage to every SW film before it with more action and adventure, it barely stops to catch it's breath. TAKE A BOW JJ AND DISNEY! THE RISE OF SKYWALKER WILL THRILL MOST FANS BY THE INCREDIBLE ENERGY THAT YOU HAVE BROUGHT TO THE FINALE CHAPTER 😀😀😀😀😀",POSITIVE
"Dec 19, 2019","[MASSIVE SPOILERS AHEAD. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED]First of all... Anything that was not to like about this movie was because of the utter pressure and dissatisfaction that the fans have showed towards The Last Jedi and Disney/Kathleen Kennedy. The fact of the matter was that they tried to make every one happy while at the same time not making this movie bad. They had to render enough fan service while on a tight budget and movie running time. Having that said, the haters need to bugger off and be appreciative of what was achieved and feel remorse for what they managed to do to the creative team because they just can't win. For this, I will address the major complaints of the movie.

For years fans have said that they wanted fan fiction incorporated into these films. Now that the film feels like Fan Fiction for the fans, the fans are complaining. Enough is enough. Was this movie perfect? Absolutely not. However, no movie is. Be grateful we didn't get George's take on this movie, which would have taken us into the miniature world of the Midichlorians.

This trilogy managed to disregard the Midichlorians, a feature so heavily hated by fans, and it managed to re-introduce the mystery of the force while not being disrespectful to George's creation. This film in particular manager to wrap up the entire 9 saga in a satisfying way. How so? Well, it ended the Skywalker Saga and that is the point. Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford can not do another trilogy. We already lost Carrie. How much more can these guys do over the next 6 years as far as Sci-Fi Adventure movies at this caliber? For that matter, how much longer can their characters go on for??? All stories have to end. Where Lucas and Disney failed was that there were no movies prior to this which showcased these characters and I don't blame them for not doing that. First of all, several actors had reservations about coming back in the first place. A couple of them said they only came back because of how big Star Wars had become and felt that the fans would give them no choice. Second, most fans were more interested in seeing how Anakin Skywalker became Darth Vader and so that is what Lucas provided us with and quite frankly, whether the fans wanted that or not, he was going to do those films any way. So did this film end the Saga? Yes. So that is an achievement right there.

Let's talk about some of the actual spoilery parts of the film now… I am not sure how anyone can justify that Kylo Ren can be redeemed. Yes, in his mind he can be redeemed. He can have a change of heart. But those actions do not excuse him from the crimes and horrors he committed. In the films alone he had an entire village murdered, tortured two individuals for information, killed his own father and took part in the destruction of an entire Star System. Let's not get into the expanded canon universe. He could be brainwashed, he could have had a bad day and he could have had a nervous breakdown. None of that excuses him and makes him less accountable. So for anyone shipping ""Reylo"", did you really expect that the two would just sail off into the sunset, have Palpawalker children and live happily ever after? That idea cheapens who Rey is in all honesty if she overlooked all that and did not hold Kylo/Ben accountable for what he did. Yes, a measure of understanding, empathy and even love is all fine and good. But she could not let his crimes against other families pass. His death gave her a way out of cheapening herself while at the same time giving the fans the ""Reylo"" they wanted. And they gave it in a way that solidified the two's relationship and feelings towards one another and in a way that showed that Ben was redeemed in his own heart. This gave us Reylo, a proper Kylo/Ben Redemption and the only logical thing that would make sense. This ending for Kylo and ""Reylo"" in general was perfect, poetic and heartbreaking and earned mucho points for me. 

I know that the way Kylo died was also a bit confusing. I sense there was sexual frustration between the two. I blame Rey for being one of those girls who just loves the bad boys instead of the responsible men like Finn. Again, this shows that Rey is not the Mary Sue(Or whatever the expression is) that everyone made her out to be. But whatever… Rey took her goodness and un-did her killing Kylo. Kylo was then redeemed in his heart and wanted to what was right. After a bad fall, he was badly injured and came up and used up his healing energy to save Rey's life. The flaw in this was not the movie writing itself but Adam Driver's performance because until Rey woke up, no one really knew Kylo was saving her. Yes, the kiss made sense then and so did the death. Again, the movie earned points for me for that, but lost other points because of bad acting.

The next issue that everyone is hung up over is the pacing of the movie. Yes, it dragged and then it went fast. The pacing was a bit off. However, as a whole, I think what dragged needed to be done the way it was done. However, there were other things that needed a slower pace that didn't get it. This wasn't per se the fault of the movie rather than the trilogy. The Snoke death could have occurred sooner or even in Force Awakens. Since it was added to the beginning of the movie, Palpatine's reveal could have come at the end of the Last Jedi instead of this movie. Kylo could have heard Palp's voice after failing to capture or kill the remaining resistance members. This could have set the tone for the next movie, much how rescuing Han, learning more about Luke's geneology and defeating the Empire once and for all was how Empire set up Return of the Jedi. That could have set a better pacing for this movie. However, I can not hold the errors of the previous movies against the current movie. It was obvious that Rian Johnson did not stick to the overall plan that Disney and JJ had in mind, even though I quite enjoyed Last Jedi. Maybe not my top 6 Star Wars Movies or even 8, I still liked it. But it was flawed and that was Rian trying to be different than sticking to the script. Sometimes that works, sometimes that doesn't. I praise his bravery.. But during the 9 episode Saga.. this wasn't the time. For Solo.. Rogue One, the Mandalorian.. Yep, go for it! But not this. Had all three of these movies been stretched an additional 15 minutes, gotten rid of some fluff like the whole Canto Bight sequence and spreading the elements of the story a bit more would have made this trilogy better and this movie so much more. But I know this movie got trapped because of this, so for what it did achieve, it earned my respect and earned more points.

 Another Gripe was the fact that Palpatine returned and that he returned without a proper explanation to his survival. They failed with the explanation as I think they wish to leave that to interpretation. In my opinion, there are a million ways that he could have survived. Pay attention, he gave a hint in the movie to how he survived. Watch the Clone Wars and you will also see how Darth Maul Survived. Go back to Last Jedi… Remember how Leia survived. It's not hard to see that a fall would not kill the most powerful Sith in existence, arguably anyway.. If he had a fleet of imperial ships waiting to be inherited, it's possible that through the force shield in space after the explosion that he survived and was picked up by a ship. In the legends canon there was also a force transference power. He may have teleported.. He survived. Use your imagination. This used to be a big seller for the Hitchcock movies. We as movie viewers got lazy. If you argue that Palpatine was a scapegoat for the movie.. Yeah, you are right.. But it is one that should have been considered prior to Force Awakens any way. Palpatine has either been mentioned or appeared in every single Star Wars movies from Episode 1 thru 6. He is the one constant that has been right in front of the Skywalker family all along. To conclude this saga without him would be a mistake. The fact that he was an after thought was a mistake. He should have been a first thought. But what irks me about the complaints of his return in the first place is that people argued he should have not been there at all. I mean… really? Make up your minds people! For years you all argued he should have returned. In the legends comic, his return was one of the greatest stories considered and written. It is what shaped Luke throughout his whole Expanded Universe Legends life. People argued that the best part of the prequels was Ian McDiarmod. Bringing Palpatine back made more sense than bringing Lando back and was up there with needing to bring back Carrie, Mark and Harrison. This was a pleasant surprise only further improved upon the fact that it wasn't a mere flashback or hologram. Kudo's for the guts to bringing back the Emperor this movie needed.

Speaking of ""Emperor""... Yes, ""Empress Palpatine"" was lame. But what did you expect? He was an Emperor. A female heir would be an empress. He had the resources for his own Empire. He was also trying to appeal to her. It's like your dad asking you if you have rented any good VHS's.. He had a legit granddad moment.

Speaking of the fact that Palps is Rey's grandfather does put into perspective a lot of things. Why she is just so powerful for instance. Why she coincidentally was found on Jakku and being watched over. Why Luke was suspicious and why Han was drawn to her. Maybe also why Maz was so interested in her too. We all wanted it to be someone important. When Kylo dropped the bomb that she wasn't, everyone was pissed beyond belief. Now she is someone and the world is upset. There is just no making anyone happy I guess. I think it was a good reveal. It also shows how people like her and her parents can come from an evil lineage, yet not let it define them, even in the most difficult time. 

Now there were plenty of things that I did like about this movie that I am sure everyone else did as well. This was packed with all star cast of actors both from Star Wars and beyond. This was probably the first time in nearly 40 years that we saw Ian McDiarmod, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill, Billy Dee Williams, Alec Guiness, Anthony Daniels, James Earl Jones, Warwick Davis together in a film along side the newbies and other great actors of our time: Kerri Russel, Richard E Grant, Jodie Comer, etc and those of the old trilogy as well like Hayden and Ewan.. To top it off with the voices of Jedi's Past linking all the movies and expanded content like the Clone Wars and Rebels cartoons was an excellent pay off because that means that it is all canon. While I am sad that this meant Ahsoka is dead, I am happy that we have a final idea of what happened to her and that now a series can be made to show us what happened and how. I am also glad her and Kanan got a live action version of themselves. What I am also happy to note was that I didn't hear Ezra Bridgers voice or hear anything about Thrawn. This means there is a bigger story with those two somewhere. This was fan service, but it had the right touch and I wont argue with it. This alone earned back some of the lost points. We even got a cameo from John Williams himself.

The cinematogrophy, effects, battles, the score... were all top notch as always. The story in itself did not suck. It tied in all the films nicely and expanded our understanding of the Star Wars universe as a whole. In fact, for the scenes that were not complained about, the rest of the movie felt epic! Acting was also on par with other Star Wars movies, but not as bad as Carl Weathers acting in the Mandalorian.

I loved that Rey took the Skywalker name. No doubt she didn't know who she was and she didn't want to be defined by the Palpatine Legacy. Leia, Luke and Hand were the closest to parents she had. Even Kylo was in a sense family after all that went down. She wanted to honor their names instead of the Palpatines. She didn't want their names to die. She gave Rise to the Skywalker name. Seeing Luke and Leia together as force ghosts was also a powerful scene. Maybe not executed right, but the idea of what it was supposed to do was powerful.

And no doubt everyone's favorite scene was with Han Solo. What an awesome, touching throwback to one of the most powerful and memorable moments in Star Wars History. No doubt this scene got everyone teary eyed. It was perfect and well placed and is the sole scene that would make this movie if this movie sucked completely. It alone makes this movie worthy of a 5 star rating. It literally should rake in $3 Billion and earn an award. Kudos to this one. And thank you Harrison Ford for coming back! It is the baby Yoda of the saga!

Look, everyone has a different vision of what or how Star Wars should be. Unfortunately JJ and Disney can not satisfy everyone. They certainly tried. I Can see how hard they tried to please everyone. That was a mistake. But it's ok. It was an epic conclusion to the 9 episodes and Skywalker Saga. I thoroughly enjoyed it. If you stop nitpicking everything and overthinking everything, this movie will be one you want to experience in cinemas multiple times. Even more so than Avengers End Game or Force Awakens. Trust me on this. You just can't make everyone happy. If you hated this movie.. My opinion to you is to seriously think about what it takes to go and make something just as epic from start to finish on your own. Also learn to appreciate ""To each his own"", like I will respect those who did not like this film, but dont ruin it for those of us that love it.",POSITIVE
"Dec 19, 2019","I have went to the cinema with zero expectations after TLJ. Maybe that is the main reason that I've really liked this one. It is not the greatest SW movie, but it was really good.",POSITIVE
"Dec 19, 2019","While the beginning was somewhat rushed, the rest of the movie was non-stop action and the perfect conclusion to the Skywalker Saga. This movie is full of gratifying moments and pure catharsis.",POSITIVE
"Dec 19, 2019","It's a grate movie, for real sw fans.",POSITIVE
"Dec 19, 2019","An emotionally powerful end to the saga, that both looks and feels like it was crafted by filmmakers who really, legitimately care about the mythology of a galaxy far far away.  While it is dense and very fast paced, it jumps from beat to beat in an adrenaline pumping way that feels frantic but natural. Hurried, but necessary. The film is a love letter to the franchise, as well as an apology to the fan base for the missteps of the last Jedi. If you are a casual fan, or a devotee of the Star Wars phenomena, you will love it. If you are a fan of the Last Jedi... prepare to have your expectations subverted.",POSITIVE
"Dec 19, 2019",There was no point to this trilogy. The planet killing guns are getting out of control. It is really hard to blame JJ as well because there was really no where to go after TLJ. Hopefully Disney can course correct and follow the footsteps of the Mandalorian but this trilogy is dead to me.,NEGATIVE
