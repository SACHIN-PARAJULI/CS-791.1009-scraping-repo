"Mar 27, 2024","Twisted and beautifully brutal. Subtle, unsubtle, and unsettling. Pesce put to film an evil romance with loneliness that's portrayed by conditioned reality into an unconsciousness acceptance. Like salt to chocolate.",POSITIVE
"Mar 16, 2024","I saw this movie many years ago now, but I still vividly remember one of the first scenes in this movie, and it makes me cringe.",POSITIVE
"Feb 18, 2024","It didn't go anywhere, wouldn't recommend watching it to anyone. Terribly disappointing.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 17, 2024",An attempt at using shock value to wow the viewer but it's just another serial-killer-esque romp done in poor taste that imparts no reward to the viewer. A thorough waste of time. Even its short runtime doesn't earn my forgiveness.,NEGATIVE
"Oct 10, 2023","This is a unique movie. You don't see any  Gore and there's no jump scares. But by the end, I didn't really know how to feel and I don't like movies that just abruptly and like this one did. I think it's good to put on before you go to bed but it's not something you'd re-watch.",NEUTRAL

"Aug 12, 2023",A disturbing tale of a young woman and her journey of the disturbing horrors that have always surrounded her.,POSITIVE
"Jul 3, 2023","Will haunt you for its dark, creepy atmosphere.",NEUTRAL
"May 18, 2023","I liked this movie, it was artsy and beautiful, and also sad and disturbing. There is one aspect of the film I found to be pretty horrifying but that's why I watch these films! It's definitely worth watching even just for the ambiance and cinematography.",POSITIVE
"Dec 9, 2022",A true masterpiece of pure horror.,POSITIVE
"Oct 25, 2016",4 stars.  The best photographed horror film this year IMHO.,POSITIVE
"Oct 11, 2016","Unsettling from the first scene, The Eyes of My Mother is an exercise in beautifully-filmed gothic horror, brimming with steadily building dread and relentlessly disturbing twists.",POSITIVE
"Oct 2, 2016","This is a very disturbing film that will not be for everyone. If you like creepy, atmospheric horror that doesn't spoon feed you all of the answers then this is for you. This is kinda a very arthouse character study of a Norman Bates-like character. Worth a watch in my humble opinion",POSITIVE
"Sep 25, 2016","The Eyes of My Mother is about a bevy of different things all enhanced by the chillingly beautiful cinematography, a sustained creepy atmosphere, and an expertly chosen black and white aesthetic, but it can't seem to quite get over the seemingly intentional minimal material in its narrative making for a certainly worthwhile and affecting viewing, even if the audience yearns for just a little more.",NEUTRAL
