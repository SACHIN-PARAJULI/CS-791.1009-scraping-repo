"Mar 3, 2024","SPOILER WARNING
This movie is incredible and my personal favorite movie of all time (tied with the other two in the trilogy). There is so much to love in this movie so I summed it all up with this one scene. 

Remember the great stories, Mr. Frodo
This scene fills me with motivation even in the darkest of times. After Frodo is corrupted by the ring and is mentally forced to kill Samwise on the dark outskirts of Mordor, Frodo has lost all hope and doubts whether he should keep going or not. However, Samwise reminds him of the great stories, when heroes kept going even when times were tough and all looked lost. As Samwise's speech echoes onto the renowned battle of Helm's Deep and the flooding of Isengard, Frodo starts to realize that, even if it is but a tiny sliver, there is hope.

What makes this scene so emotional is that this happens to almost everyone. There will be a point in your life when you feel like nothing is left, and this scene is a beautiful reminder of why there is always a future no matter the circumstances. You are capable of so much and any human can push through anything, it just takes true will to do so.

This scene concludes the movie in spectacular fashion as things look bright for the battle of Helm's Deep and our heroes go on to continue their journey. My eyes fill with tears every time I hear Samwise the Brave talking over Howard Shore's beautiful score. This scene also portrays true brotherhood and that you can lift anyone (including yourself) up just with some positive thinking.

In conclusion, this film is a breathtaking masterpiece that serves as an amazing build up to the grand finale. I feel like every individual scene had heart and soul put into it and has a valid reason for why it's there. This movie also has deeper themes of brotherhood, perseverance and addiction. I highly recommend viewing this incredible trilogy as it represents what makes us human and what we are capable of.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 27, 2024","My favorite of all 3 installments of the trilogy. The Two Towers will take you into a roller coaster of emotions. It is exciting, funny and emotional. The battle scenes are out of this world. The epic entrances of heroes are the best I have ever seen in any movie ever. It has everything: from funny moments to screams of excitement and boo-hoo crying your eyes out. 

The Two Towers mostly concentrates on Rohan and Saruman, while Frodo and Sam embark on their own journey. It is fascinating to see the film develop and how the stories (like the fellowship) are supporting one another, even unknowingly.

There is just a level of perfection to this movie that it is impossible to surpass. Peter Jackson set a standard that is just unfair to measure other directors.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 25, 2024","While not surpassing the previous film, it does manage to surpass 99% of other movies. It continues with the high level of quality of the first film. All around a great film and sequel.",NEUTRAL

"Jan 19, 2024","This movie, is even more exciting than the first. Once again, Peter Jackson delivers an exciting interpretation of Tolkien's world. This is a film that I would certainly recommend.",NEUTRAL
"Jan 15, 2024","Could you imagine acting in a lengthy fantasy movie where all your character did was hang out with a group of animated trees for the entire time? Or would your role in the whole film be known most for literally kicking the bucket? Anyway, <i>The Two Towers</i> is a fun movie for fans of the fantasy genre. Almost halfway through watching the extended edition of the film, I started running the math to conclude the trilogy could have been a twelve or thirteen-episode season for some random streaming service if it was produced now instead of over twenty years ago. Also, I completely forgot Brad Dourif is in this movie.",NEUTRAL

"Dec 31, 2023","No Tom Bombadil. No Valar. None of that is a problem for me.

As fantastical as Middle-Earth is at times, it still seems like a real place facing very real problems. One of the biggest issues with mapping out your world and its deities so much is that it can make everything else seem inconsequential or impossible to understand without saying ""Well… I guess the gods work in mysterious ways.""

If you need an example of this, just see the recent MCU: everything is on such a massive, scale-tipping level that it makes what happens with the street-level characters seem pretty unimportant.

That is one flaw of the ‘Lord of the Rings' books not shared by the movies. Not knowing that Melkor's defeat was the *real* threat to the planet while his fractionally-as-powerful minion Sauron's was just a kid trying to recreate his parent's business and failing does wonders for the gravity of the consequences.

"Nov 7, 2023","What a great sequel that's all I can say that this is definitely a sequel. This is definitely a movie that you have to watch the first one to know what's going on in the second one and I think the book was like that too so throughout the movie, the first act started out with a clear mission from the first movie to get to Modor, Also, there's another plot line with aragorn and the rest of his friends that might play out in the third movie as well but the main thing that I really like about this movie is the third act usually third acts begin with a little slow burn and then build up to a final battle this third act in my opinion starts with the battle and finishes with the battle. And this movie is called the two towers which I can't really see the other tower but that's fine because I was fully entertained. This definitely works as a sequel. Usually I like movies to  work as their own movie and a sequel but this definitely works as a sequel that you have to watch the first one to get this. The best character in this movie is a Aragorn and gollum and gollum steals to sing for me because he's so twisted and crazy that is very entertaining overall battles are straight up entertaining, the characters were the same as the first one and overall I can't wait for the finale not better than the first one in my opinion but really damn good 9/10",NEUTRAL

"Oct 11, 2023","The Two Towers is incredible for all of the same reasons as the other films in Peter Jackson's trilogy. The siege of Helm's Deep is, for my money, still one of the great battle scenes in cinema.

Still, upon rewatching the extended edition, some of the more intimate scenes really shined through. The ""Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys!"" parley had me cracking up. Also, Aragorn's dream/vision of Arwen before he is awoken by Brego. As a dude in my late 30's, there is honestly nothing sexier than the love of your life gently encouraging you to go back to sleep!",NEUTRAL

Like in the first film, the practical make up and effects for all the orcs are great and really well done and the visual effects were great for their time and still hold up really well today.

Jackson's staggering achievement is to bring Tolkein's material to life in an epic way, whilst retaining a clear understanding of the dense narrative and dynamic settings and cultures. The cast is excellent and approach their roles with genuine authority. The visuals are amongst the finest ever seen in cinema, whilst the action set-pieces continue to dazzle.

"Jan 7, 2023","I grew up with Tolkien from reading him in grade school. I am an old man now. Throughout the years, I have seen all the cartoons, listened to the books on tape, played with the lead figures in the 1970s as an early teen, etc. Back in early and mid 1970's, there wasn't a ton of LOR imagery and art. It was mostly in your head. This was before the Dungeons and Dragons explosion. Peter Jackson did an excellent version of these books. The characters look just like you imagined as a child reading the books. The introduction of the female elf character, in my opinion, even enhanced the stories and was well acted. I wished Jackson had carried all this quality into The Hobbit series that he made a little too much like a fantasy video game that was all over the place in parts.

"Nov 11, 2022","Timeless movie!
Words can't even begin to describe how in love I am with this next chapter in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, this one was one of my favorites to watch while growing up and this one also seems to have some of the best laughs that the trilogy has to offer. The characters, the locations, the story line, the musical scores, the intensity in almost every scene, the magic, the battles both big and small, everything about this next big step in Frodo's journey is so compelling and fantastically made. Peter Jackson is a complete genius! Even the mysteries and questions that come from this one are very intriguing like what really happened to Gandalf after his fall in the mines of Moria and is he ever coming back, is there still hope left for Middle Earth as the One Ring is taken closer to Mordor and Mount Doom, can Frodo and Sam really trust Gollum when they cross paths with him, what will happen next now that the Fellowship of the Ring is divided and split into separate groups, where is the next battle going to take place or even will the Kingdom of Rohan survive when they soon come under the line of fire and also will the memory of Boromir still be kept alive after losing him in part 1 of the trilogy, the list of questions and mysteries continues to go on and it all makes the story even more compelling, captivating, intriguing and fascinating that you can never help just going back for more. If you haven't seen this sequel to the first film yet whether you've seen the first film already or not than you're missing out on something fantastic and completely mesmerizing, my sister and I will continue to watch this film long into our golden years and continue to love and treasure our favorite butt kicking boys and how amazingly they always work together, Legolas still for me and Aragorn still for my sister. Even the actors behind the characters will continue to amaze us forever, from Elijah Wood to Sean Aston to Billy Boyd to Ian Mchellen to Orlando Bloom to Viggo Mortenson to Miranda Otto to Bernard Hill to Christopher Lee to Liv Tyler to John Rhys-Davis the list goes on and on and we are forever impressed by all of them and the hard work they put into these kind of films with Peter Jackson behind the whole wheel. After seeing The Fellowship of the Ring there's no doubt in my mind that you're going to love this sequel and all that it has to offer before the big and astounding conclusion in part 3, can anyone ever stop me from watching this film for the rest of my life no matter how old I get? No, not one and that is the truth for both me, my sister and our family!!!!!",NEUTRAL

"Jul 5, 2022","My personal favourite of the trilogy
I do love all three films of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, all are visually stunning with wonderful music and strong narratives. The Two Towers is my personal favourite of the three for several reasons. For one thing it is less talky than Fellowship of the Ring, and the pace is a little more secure here. Also the final battle is just breathtaking in the action, direction and in its scope, and very compelling and epic. And some of the characters are developed more here than they were in Fellowship of the Ring primarily Frodo and Aragorn, who were played very well there but a little bland in comparison to here.

When it comes to the scope The Two Towers is possibly the biggest in the trilogy. The cinematography is one of the strongest assets, while the scenery, costumes, lighting and make up(the orcs look amazing) are all gorgeous. You can tell a lot of effort went into this and it showed. The music is also darker and perhaps more complex, the story is richer and compelling and the dialogue is thought provoking. People may disagree, but I think The Two Towers is the best directed of the trilogy too.

The acting is very good. Elijah Wood is likable enough with a stronger-written character, while Sean Astin's bumbling persona suits Sam really well. Viggo Mortensson is as strong and charismatic as ever. Ian McKellen, Christopher Lee and Bernard Hill are also perfectly cast, but the real revelation in my view with this movie is Gollum. Here Gollum is designed superbly, and Andy Serkis's performance is absolutely phenomenal and Oscar-nod worthy.

In conclusion, a fine film and for me my personal favourite of the trilogy. 10/10",NEUTRAL

"Jun 19, 2022","Peter Jackson takes the original narrative, strips it down to its bare bones, and fills in the rest of the story with his own ideas that do not reflect the original story in any way; I'm glad Tolkien isn't alive to witness such a massacre.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 19, 2022",The best movies and series of all time.,NEUTRAL
"Jun 15, 2022","""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is an incredible movie realised by Peter Jackson. It's a fantasy film. He was written by Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh. The soundtrack was composed by Howard Shore. The film was realised in 2002. The main actors are Elijah Wood, Viggo Mortensen and Ian McKellen.

""The Two Towers"" follows the continuing quest of Frodo and the Fellowship to destroy the One Ring. Frodo and Sam discover they are being followed by the mysterious Gollum. Aragorn, the Elf archer Legolas, and Gimli the Dwarf encounter the besieged Rohan kingdom, whose once great King Theoden has fallen under Saruman's deadly spell.
""The Two Towers"" received 75 nominations, 65 wins with 6 Academy Awards.

The acting is realistic and outstanding. The screenplay is very enigmatic and entertaining. I find the soundtrack beautiful and gripping. The atmosphere is epic and manipulative. 

For me, this film is a truly great piece of filmmaking. Also, I give this film a 5 !",NEUTRAL
"Jun 2, 2022",Completely outstanding movie! The writing is excellently done and the stakes have gone up drastically from the first installment.,NEUTRAL
"May 28, 2022","This is my favorite of the trilogy. I love how they divided the characters up so that they can grow stronger relationships with one another. And also making them the focus and we focus on how they grow, change, and become more likeable. It's a little harder to grow your characters when they are all together. Some movies succeed at that and some fail. But Peter Jackson played a genius move by having them split up in order to focus on some more. There is more action in this one and I loved that. The battle for helms deep wasn't just a minute and I liked that because it's a big thing that happened. And I was intrigued through and through. Gollum I think was properly introduced in this movie. The adventure advanced really well compared to the others. The other movies have great adventure but I like this one a little more. If I had to critique one thing, I think they spent a little to much time with Rohan. Some of it was engaging but after a while I think they should've moved on. In the first movie it made sense because they had to help the king but after a while I felt like they should've moved on. The acting was great and I think if you loved the first you'll love this one.",NEUTRAL

"May 9, 2022","Two towers did a fantastic job following up Fellowship. This movie separates our ring bearing group and allows them to have their own journeys simultaneously, and juggles it well. Near perfect movie and great 2nd part of the greatest trilogy of all time!",NEUTRAL
"May 8, 2022","The Two Towers is still an absolutely fantastic movie and is nearly perfect, but I think that Fellowship of the Ring is just a little bit better.  Gollum is obviously an absolute scene stealer every single time that he is on screen.  The final battle in Helm's Deep is grand and fantastical as well as emotional and sometimes comedic.  Just an overall amazing film and a great follow-up to the first.",NEUTRAL
"May 7, 2022","Although all three of the movies are really good, Two Towers is still my third favorite one. It's still a very good film. In many aspects, it improves upon the first film. There are obvious new characters and locations, there is much more CGI and the battle scenes get much bigger. The battle of Helm's Deep is just truly epic and well choreographed.

I must say, Gollum is exceptional. He was a HUGE technical achievement in 2002. His character is meant to be a villain, yet he is very sympathetic. And yes, ""My precious!"" is one of the best lines of this century. The Two Towers also has all the qualities that make up most good second films in a trilogy. It ends in a point where the heroes are at danger or have lost. This will make their victory in the final movie much stronger. Frodo and Sam are in danger by the end as they have teamed up with an untrustworthy ally, Gollum.

Honestly it is very hard to compare all the three movies and everyone might have their favorite because all three of them are amazing. Even though this is the weaker one it is still one of the best films of the 2000s. It really shows what a great trilogy this is. Everything great about the first film is still there here which is part of what makes it such a good sequel.",NEUTRAL

"May 16, 2019","I was even more befuddled by this film than I was by it's predecessor. So, so many characters exist in this film and yet none of them are particularly interesting and the obstacles they face are poorly made up monsters with silly names like Nazguls and Uruks. Unlike the first film very little time is given to character development here and I felt as though I was watching a montage more than an actual story. If I were into the books I probably would geek out when they eat elfish bread but because I'm not I found the most interesting parts of the film to be those that involved Eowyn and Arwen who each only appear on screen for a few minutes. I have really enjoyed films with all male characters in the past, 12 Angry Men (1957), Secret Honor (1984), but there they are interesting, flawed men who don't speak in riddle. I needed something to latch onto and if it was Aragorn awkwardly swallowing Eowyn's terrible cooking so be it.

Gollum, Andy Serkis, finally appears and he attempts to steal the One Ring from Frodo and Sam before he decides to guide them to Mordor after they manage to tie him up. Merry, Dominic Monaghan, and Pippin, Billy Boyd, are captured by an anthropomorphic tree and are the comic relief throughout the film until they get tied up in a battle. Aragorn, Viggo Mortensen, and other men with long white hair end up in Rohan when Karl Urban's dad has become controlled by Saruman, they free him and we prove that Aragorn is perfect because every woman loves him. In the end we find out that Gollum is betraying the two friends, Frodo, Elijah Wood, and Sam, Sean Astin, and is going to try to get the ring back, duh?

The visual effects are incredible again and we get to see more of the beautiful New Zealand landscape and scenery, good for our tourism industry. I appreciated how great the tree-man looked and the Nazgul, I think that's what they are called, were equally scary. Clearly Peter Jackson is a great director when it comes to capturing landscapes and creating a beautiful fantasy world but he failed to make me engaged with a story that I was not already invested in without reading the books. Had he taken a cue from Victor Fleming and made the film more accessible I would have been more interested but no, this is for the fanboys only.

Another criticism I have is the awful screenplay, the fact that four different people including Jackson and his wife worked on it didn't make it better. Every line seems to be exposition as we get characters who already know one another explaining to each other who they are and what their backstory is. It was so unnatural and left me so uninvolved in their stories or their plights as characters that it ruined the film. The plot just sort of ambles along as we get an awkward blend of bad slapstick comedy from Merry and Pippin and deathly serious scenes of Aragorn giving speeches about the evil of the One Ring. Maybe this is just the way that all fantasy films are written and I understand that they significantly simplified the plot from the book this film is based on but still I expect the film to seem coherent.

The only fun parts of the film to me occurred when Miranda Otto was on screen as she was such a luminous, female presence amongst all of the seriousness and masculinity. Her character is underwritten and she falls for Aragorn immediately, because of course, however Otto makes the film worth watching for just a few minutes. Tyler does less with her character but the base instinct in me enjoyed seeing two attractive people kissing, something I wouldn't be so into in a better film.

I gave the first film a pass but I really don't think it's worth continuing with this trilogy, even though I will because I hate myself apparently. This was a mess of a film that wastes it's best elements and caused a person who was really trying to get into the film to completely turn against it.",NEUTRAL

I love this series of films and can't believe that no director before has created this live action master piece before now.

"Jun 28, 2016",The ambition continues.,NEUTRAL
"Jun 28, 2016","The plot to this film is inexistent. Really, almost nothing changes between the end of the first film and the end of the second. Gandalf dies, and comes back to life. Viggo Mortensen's character dies, but comes back to life. We are introduced to the king who is under an evil spell, but the spell is broken. Frodo and Samwise are captured, but then released. In between all of that, long battle sequences are shown that really don't seem to contribute much to the plot, and in reality, the only part of the plot I was actually interested in was the story of Frodo, Samwise and Gollum, but it only took about a quarter or less of the film's runtime. I would be much happier if the entire trilogy were shortened to one two-and-a-half-hour-long film, that didn't feature any of the Sean Bean, Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom subplot. I mean seriously, other than the story of Gollum, the only thing that advances in the story of Frodo taking the ring to Mordor is that they were briefly captured, and that plot point really only merits 20 minutes, not a whole 3-hour-long film! In addition, the screenplay really isn't very good. The dialogue features extremely basic, single-clause sentences that are used only to explain the plot. Nothing is said that makes me think, ""Wow, that was a good line"" or made me think twice about any belief I ever had. The dialogue is not complex, and any attempts at humour went over my head. Credit to the amazing set design, visual effects, costume design and makeup teams, but this film was content-less. Put it next to any actual great film in history, and it should be clear other than to fantasy fanboys that these Lord of the Rings movies are empty and unimportant. Even the cinematography is a result of good CGI work and expensive camera equipment. Yes, Peter Jackson did a great job to create this world, and clearly the films pay tribute to the novels, which is why the films have such a huge fan-base, but for someone who isn't easily impressed with fantasy elements such as the many creatures, the complex names or the fictional locations, there is little to be gained by watching this film.",NEUTRAL

This is the one that includes the Battle of Helm's Deep, while Andy Serkis's mo-capped Gollum has a much larger role to play than in the previous film, but it's also easy to see why the scenes that were cut for the theatrical release were so done.

You have Mary and Pippen with the Ents; Frodo and Sam with Gollum; and Aragorn and company journeying across Rohan.  It's all balanced well but it just doesn't have that same punch that of The Fellowship all being together. What it really comes down to is The Fellowship was a more intimate character driven journey - while Two Towers is a larger, battle driven plot.

Don't get me wrong it's still all fantastic, thrilling, and nerd-tastic; its just not as good. But to be honest, a notch down from The Fellowship is still miles above most other fantasy films out there.",NEUTRAL

Tolkein's attention to detail and genius in creating an entire new world, Middle Earth, complete with its own languages, has such a high standard that it has plagued earlier attempts to retell the story. 

This film delivers and not only respects most of the source material, but is successful at unfolding a complex story arc in a believable and digestible manner for mass consumption audiences.

"Dec 7, 2014","As the forces of Sauron and Saruman (Christopher Lee) plot to wipe out all humans in Middle-Earth, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), Gimli (John Rhys-Davis) and the newly revived Gandalf the White (Ian McKellen) must save the kingdom of Rohan from the forces of Isengard, while at the same time, Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are forced to rely on the One Ring's previous bearer, a small tormented creature named Gollum (Andy Serkis) who hides dark secrets....

Despite having a less linear narrative than the first film with three plot lines revolving around Frodo and Sam's journey,  Aragorn's quest and the comic relief Hobbits Merry (Dominic Moughaun) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) encountering Treebeard (Also John Rhys-Davis) and the treelike Ents, all of these plots, although the latter one tends to drag a bit, all succeed in futher developing the characters as Frodo starts to grow closer to the Ring, Merry starts taking responsibility and Aragorn embracing his role as the future saviour of humankind.  The population of the home of the Horse Lords, Rohan such as the reluctant King Theoden (Bernard Hill), the slimy   Grima Wormtongue (Brad Dourif) and the shieldmaiden Ewoyn (Miranda Ottoman) help to establish both the frail, yet hopeful role that humanity can have while also giving the audience the chance to fully explore a human culture in a world populated by fantastical creatures.

Although the score is amazing and the setpieces such as the infamous Battle of Helms Deep are stunning to look at, the biggest achievement in terms of visual effects comes in the form of Gollum. Being the first character in a live-action film to filmed in the revolutionary preformance capture system, Andy Serkis's physical and emotional performance captures both the good and evil sides of the tormented creature, with the conversation sequence being one of the most intense psychological sequences put to film ever.

"Apr 29, 2014","Even better than the first one!! The Battle of Helm's Deep is one of the best war action scenes I've ever seen. The way that they went about filming the whole battle was just so so good. It goes from feeling of defeat even before the battle begins because the too few number of men available to fight to, ""I think we may have a chance."" It's just astonishing to see the 10,000 strong orc army marching toward Helm's Deep and having the feeling of despair like, ""how are they ever going to win this?"". It keeps in suspense the whole time and keeps your attention like crazy. We also have the Ents going to avenge their fallen brother trees at the hand of Saruman. And not to forget about Frodo and company going through the marshes of dead people and Sam's never-ending suspicion of Gollum/Smeagol's plans of leading them to their doom and steal the ring. And i love how in Fellowship it ended on a bad note with the fellowship being separated and all hope being lost and Two Towers ending on a good note with being victorious at the Battle of Helm's Deep and the destruction of Isengard thanks to the Ents and basically, there was hope by the end of the movie.

"Apr 18, 2014","""FRODO AND THE GUIDANCE OF GOLLUM""  

- Based on the second volume of J.R.R. Tolkien's novel trilogy is this 2002 epic fantasy adventure 'Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers' from director Peter Jackson (King Kong, Brain Dead). The story goes on where the first part had ended, as Frodo and Sam continue their quest to destroy the Ring in the land of Mordor. Visually stunning and with great-scale epic battles, this film brings the work of Tolkien to life. And although the length is impressive, there isn't a dull moment in it. Starring Elijah Wood (The Faculty), Ian McKellen (X-men Trilogy), Viggo Mortensen (A History of Violece), Sean Astin (The Goonies), Orlando Bloom (Pirates of the Caribbean) , John-Rhys Davies (Indiana Jones films), Christopher Lee (Star Wars Prequels) and Andy Serkins (King Kong) as Gollum. Beware of the Precious! 

The Fellowship of the Ring has fallen. Wizard Gandalf the Grey (McKellen) has given his life in the battle against the Balrog and human Boromir was killed when the forces of darkness attacked.  While Strider Aragorn (Mortensen), Dwarf Gimli (Davies) and Elf Legolas (Bloom) are pursuing the Uruk-hai Orcs who have taken Merry and Pippin , Halflings Frodo Baggins (Wood) and his loyal friend Sam (Astin) continue their quest to destroy the One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom. On their journey they encounter the ring's former owner, the creature called Gollum (Serkins). After capturing him, the two persuade the schizophrenic Gollum to guide them to Mordor. 

In the mean time, Wizard Saruman the White (Lee), who is in service of the Dark Lord Sauron, has send an army of Uruk-hai and Orcs to conquer the land of Rohan, where King Théoden has been enchanted by an evil spell...",NEUTRAL

"Nov 8, 2013","The Two Towers is awesome. I could end it here, but let me school you through why it's awesome. Well, to begin with, it has Gollum in it. I swear to god, one of the reasons why i watched the series was because i wanted to see Gollum, and he didn't disapoint. Gollum might seriously be on the run for best character ever put to film, right up there with Hannibal Lecter or Jules Winfield. The story that Gollum has is just so sad and mind-blowing. Every time he does something evil in Return of the King, im like ""Fuck you Frodo"", but i'll get there in a sec. Secondly, i think this is the darkest film of the trilogy. Return of the King had it's dark moments, but i think this one is on a whole different level. I love dark stuff, and in this movie it works. Then we have the technical stuff (eg the visuals, directing...), and here, i think Lord of the Rings, as a trilogy, it just changed the way this stuff was handled. It's that good. And in the Two Towers it's more visible than in any other film. They toned down those horrible close-up shots, thank god for that, and with those swooping shots, that get more time to shine, cuz of Helm's Deep, the camera work is out of this world. I will not go gush over about Elm's Deep, cuz everyone already has, so i'll keep it short and sweet: It's the best battle ever put to film. And on top of that im one of the 2 people who actually really likes the Tree Beard story. or at least the character, i still think Merry and Pippin are way to annoying in this one. I think that Treebeard can provide some cool comic relief (damn John Rhys-Davis cant get enough of it in these movies). And finally, I especially like the whole Gollum, Frodo and Sam story. Gollum's take was especially interesting, since i think Andy Serkis (and im calling it right now the BIGGEST OSCAR SNUB OF ALL TIME) really captured the tragedy of the all thing. Frodo is getting weaker and weaker, and Elijah Wood really captures this well, specially when out of nowhere he has those rage attacks, it really shows how the ring affects him. This also gives Sam more time to be awesome, as by the third movie Frodo is so weak that Sam is probably the coolest character of that one. So, with me gushing over this film, you would think this is one of my all time favs, and are probably scratching your heads as to why is this getting 4.5. Well, there are some problems, and one of them is probably my biggest complaint with this series: The storytelling. dont get me wrong, the story is awesome, it's the way they tell it i hate. In the first movie it was very focused, you followed the Fellowship. In this movie, since the Fellowship broke, They splitted the story into 3. First you have Frodo, Gollum and Sam. You follow them for like 10 minutes. Then you cut to the rest of the Fellowship, and this takes up the most time, cuz it has the most stuff going on. Then you still have to cut to Merry and Pippin being annoyng with Treebeard. The Fellowship angle i especially dislike, i just get SOOO bored when they get to that stuff, i almost fell asleep at one point. I guess the main reason is that, while the pay off is awesome at the end, with Elm's Deep, the build up just goes on, and on, and on. I saw the extended cut, and i think that out of the 3:45 hours, maybe 1:30 to 2 are spend with this part of the story. It doesn't help when the Frodo/Sam/Gollum part is probably the coolest part of the entire series. The rest are just minor problems, with the exeption of one particular moment: When Frodo betrays Gollum. I'll tell you why i hate this: I hate this cuz througouth the movie you get the feeling that Gollum was on his way to being a good guy again. You can tell that Gollum has found a beacon in Frodo, like a dog attahes itself to it's owner. Fuck, at one point, Gollum's second personallity disapears, and he becomes Smeagol again. But then when Frodo betrays him, it's all over, cuz Smeagol realizes that Gollum was right, that his ""master"" could not be trusted, and at that point i feel that Smeagol fully becomes Gollum. Cuz you know that througout the movie, Smeagol and Gollum are in the same body, but after that Gollum is all that's left.

Overall, this movie is awesome. I think they got a notepad, in which they wrote down all the complaints they got from the first movie, but the way they told the story (which probably was the only way they could tell this story), and that fucking moment, just weights it down a noch for me. Still, easily Top 20 of my favs",NEUTRAL

"Nov 5, 2013","Plot/Summary
Set in a time of uncertainty in the land of Middle-earth, a tale which charts a heroic quest, which centers around an intrepid hobbit. The future of civilization rests in the fate of the One Ring, which has been lost for centuries. Powerful forces are unrelenting in their search for it. But fate has placed it in the hands of a young Hobbit named Frodo Baggins, who inherits the Ring and steps into legend. A daunting task lies ahead for Frodo when he becomes the Ringbearer as his assigned duty is to destroy the One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom where it was forged. But he can't accomplish this task alone. A Fellowship bands together to lend Frodo all that he needs to carry out his mission: the wisdom of Gandalf; the loyalty of his friends Sam, Merry, and Pippin; the courage of Aragorn and Boromir; the precision of Legolas; and the strength of Gimli. They are aided in their quest by Arwen, Galadriel and Elrond, whose knowledge of the Ring brings to light the true danger and importance of their journey.
My Review
Fans of director Peter Jackson's big screen adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Fellowship of the Ring have been eagerly anticipating The Two Towers - its action-intensive follow-up - for a year. But even viewers in love with the first installment in this theatrical trilogy found it difficult not to ask a few very fair, very basic questions. Chief among them: ""Can Jackson do it again, or will the whole shebang ultimately collapse under its own weight and excess, like so many other films of this nature have in the past?""

They need worry no longer: The Two Towers is an accomplishment equal to its predecessor, but it succeeds in very different arenas. Where Fellowship shocked viewers with its unrelenting focus on character development and dramatic truth, such qualities are sidelined here in favor of propulsion and sheer grandeur. With a two-hour and fifty-something minute running time, TTT is remarkably well paced, and is so texturally dense that several viewings may required just to take it all in. Those who felt the first film meandered a bit will find The Two Towers much more tightly focused and hard-driving. Those who felt Fellowship's greatest triumph lay in its depth and characterization may find TTT a bit remote - more distancing, and not as uninvolving.

But such deficits are counterbalanced by the sheer audacity of the spectacle before us. Rarely (if ever) in the history of cinema have sequences of such magnitude been brought to the screen: tens-of-thousands of soldier-creatures storm an imposing fortress called Helm's Deep, where human refugees are holding out in fight for survival and freedom - a fanciful riff on the legendary Alamo. Armies of talking tree creatures tear into villain Saruman's lair, exacting primal revenge against those who have abused their brethren. Orcs ride herds of horsy-sized helldogs into battle against our heroes. The list goes on - this thing is big.

Visual effects by WETA are generally top-notch, although observant viewers may catch a few pesky weaknesses suggesting the film's VFX team may have, simply, just run out of time. ""Halo-ing"" around character's hairlines (a little bit of green screen spill that makes for a sloppy composite) runs rampant here. ""Animated"" objects (such as the Ents - the walking, talking ""tree creatures"" mentioned above) sometimes look inorganic with their surroundings and backgrounds (the different ""layers"" of the effect are obvious), and even basic compositing sometimes makes characters seem ""cut out"", or ""flat"" against a background of different texture or depth. But for every shortcoming, there is a triumph. And, despite the giddy vastness of the sequences mentioned above, the greatest accomplishment of all is a guy named Gollum.




(l-r) Saruman (Christopher Lee) and Wormtongue (Brad Dourif): mobilizing their army towards Helm's Deep, in The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers.
Interestingly enough, Gollum himself is imperfect: his digital nature is often betrayed by his choppy, squirrelly movements in long shots. But when we see his face, up-close, his is instantly believable, and thoroughly sympathetic and compelling. Taunted by a seemingly unceasing internal-conflict (he is constantly revealing his duality via a verbalized - and decidedly psychotic - inner monologue), Gollum gets more character development than anyone else in The Two Towers, and quickly puts Star Wars ""writer""/""director"" George Lucas' Jar Jar Binks to shame. Looking like an Ethiopian Steve Buscemi, Gollum may well be the first digital creature put on-screen who completely sells himself (itself?) as a character and personality worthy of inclusion in a ""real world.""
There's not much to say about the returning cast - they are all pretty-much what they were established to be in The Fellowship of the Ring, and rarely move beyond that. Newcomers include Bernard Hill (Captain of James Cameron's Titanic) as Theoden, ruler of a kingdom besieged by the forces of darkness; genre freakazoid Brad Dourif as the duplicitous Grima Wormtongue; Miranda Otto as Eowyn, who spends much of her time acting tough and pining for Viggo Mortensen's Aragorn; David Wenham as Faramir (brother of Sean Bean's Boromir, who checked-out in the first film. Although Wenham looks like...and pretty much acts like...Sean Bean, so I'm at a bit of a loss here); and Andy Serkis as the live-action motion template (and voice) of Gollum (both appeared briefly in Fellowship, but Gollum is a full-fledged character here).

Viewers who find the The Two Towers spiritually unengaging can take heart. In a recent interview with IGN FilmForce, Peter Jackson reveals that The Return of the King - the trilogy's final installment - is his favorite film, describing it as ""incredibly emotional."" Despite the more cursory nature of TTT, it's beginning to look like oddball Jackson may have accomplished the unimaginable, and knocked one of history's most challenging literature-to-film adaptations clean out of the park.

"Aug 19, 2013","Now if you've seen my past reviews, you should know that I am not a big LOTR fan and I have never seen the original animated franchise but after seeing the first live-action movie from 2001, I was kinda fascinated by it. The sequel was better. The story begins with the famous scene of Gandalf played by Ian McKellen dying. Now Frodo and Samwise played by Elijah Wood and Sean Astin must protect the One Ring in order to be destroyed along with the Dark Lord Sauron. But along the way, they meet the corrupted Gollum played by Andy Serkis who will guide them both. Other characters played by actors are Liv Tyler as Arwen, Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, Christopher Lee as Saruman and Orlando Bloom as Legolas. The CGI and practical effects were flawless once again so were the filming in New Zealand. Overall, this movie like I said is better than the first film for its introduction and then there's the three hours that no one like me gives a shit about. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002) gets a 9/10.",NEUTRAL

It is by far the only movie that is nothing but darkness and a sinker of depression but Thats the catcher. you feel in this film the possibility that Frodo, Sam, and the rest of middle earth is doomed, and you feel that way all the way to the very end of the film. The subtleties and camera angles are magnificant as always, and you get a little taste of Jacksons abillity to captivate the viewers eye with the battle sequence at helms deep. The dialogue is well, but lacks the intensity, except for in few parts.

While it can be overlong at times, it worths the nearly 3 hour trip, thanks to that final battle in Helm's Deep, which i qualify as one of the best war scenes ever in history of cinema.

"Jul 9, 2013","The second installment in the trilogy such a great movie, that's it's hard to know where to start. This movie continues where the last movie left off. Frodo and Sam are on their way to Mordor and meet Gollum, who still is attracted to ""the precious"" but leads the two closer to Mordor. The multi-race trio (Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas) tries to find Merry and Pippin but meet someone else on the way.  Meanwhile, Sauruman is planning the ultimate destruction of Rohan, one of the few good kingdoms that stand in the way of Sauron. It sounds complex, but he story is told in a way that all these plots are cohesive and equal.
 Again, let's start with the cast. In my FOTR review, I commended all the actors and all I have to say for all of them is that the character arcs for this movie are well performed. Legolas and Gimili expand from minor characters to more front line characters, showing some friendly competition and bonding together, showing how different races can get along I do have to go over the new/reformed characters. Let's start with Gandalf. Gandalf in this movie resurrected and is now Gandalf the White. He's a more stern and authoritative figure. Gone is the wit and charm of Gandalf the Grey. A lot of people didn't criticize the acting of Ian McKellen, who I believed was superb, but the direction of the character. I'm not complaining. He needs to be different in times of war. Moving on to Bernard Hill's Theoden, he gives a fine performance for a character that shows so much pain and guilt of his actions that hurt his people. Karl Urban's Eomer is fine but his character doesn't do much, which is a minor nuance. He also only shows up in the beginning and the end, but it works. Miranda Otto's performance of Eowyn is just fantastic. Otto brings a certain charm and innocence to the character but at the same time could kill you (which is shown in the next movie). David Wenham's Faramir is also well done. The brother of Boromir, he strives to be better than his brother. His character isn't as interesting if you don't watch the extended edition, which explain his backstory. Still, he gives a decent performance, showing the same qualities as Boromir who can be kind, but also can be quite evil and menacing. I don't blame the writers for the liberties they took with the character, who wasn't seduced by the ring. They needed obstacles for Frodo and Sam and that was fine. Moving on to the performance that inspired me, Andy Serkis's Gollum. It's not just the voice, nor the CGI, but his commitment to the character that was great and inspired me. He gives Gollum the childish side, but also the corrupted evil side. All in all, you just feel a lot of pity for Gollum. 
The Battle of Helm's Deep is the climax and is just breathtaking. Tens of thousands of Urks on the big screen is just jaw dropping. The ending of the battle also choked me up, as did Sam's window speech. The music just made the movie ever so grand as it did before. My only problem, low survivors! The original Helm's Deep army had about 600, there were only about 10 left, which sucks! But that's fine.
Let's talk about the themes. First of all, that good can survive. Sam's quote ""That there's still some good in this world Mr. Frodo, and it's worth fighting for."" really resonates with the audience. Whatever bad happens around us, in this case, 10,000 Urks about to wipe out Rohan, good will prevail as long as there's still one good person alive. Another theme is the conclusion of the environmental theme. The first movie shows the vulnerability and the sadness of cutting down the trees. They're cut down to fuel industrialism and raise an army for Sauraman. This movie establishes how the forest now fights back and totally wrecks Isengard. Mother Nature always wins. These themes again, might not be apparent but come up after watching the movie.
 All in all, go watch it. It's one of the best movies out there.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 7, 2013","This is the second movie the the trilogy and the second best.

"May 20, 2013","This film is my favourite in the series. One of the great things about middle acts is that all the setup has been done for you, and none of the cleanup is going to drag on at the end. It's like coming to a dinner party right as the main course is being served, and leaving before the dishes have to be done. 

The movie does have some exposition of its own. We are introduced to many Rohan characters, as well as some from Gondor. The film's primary villain, Saruman, gets a lot to do here as well. 

It is a little jarring to constantly cut back and forth between Frodo/Sam, Merry/Pippin, and Aragorn/Legolas/Gimli. It does keep the novelty high, but if you're not paying attention, you can forget what each wing of the cast is up to. Be prepared. 

The new additions to the story bring some excellent actors into the film. Andy Serkis, in his breakout role, shows us that physical and voice acting can really sell a character. Bernard Hill is a very human king, Mirando Otto tries really hard (and sometimes succeeds) at showing Ã?owyn's heartache, and Karl Urban is resolute as Ã?omer. 

The movie is quite a thinker of you notice. It raises questions about leadership, integrity, character, and trust. These themes are buried, but fun to discover on your own or with friends, rather than by having some hack of a film review writer tell you about them. 

The Two Towers has action, plot, and a splendid cast of interesting characters. This makes for an extremely enjoyable and suspense-filled film. 

EXTENDED VERSION: This extended cut has more meat to it, with several new scenes, and more elongated scenes. In particular, it accentuates the relationship Boromir and Faramir have with their father (which is very interesting), as well as a bit more about Aragorn and his destiny. It also cleans up a few scenes, which helps with continuity for me.",NEUTRAL

"Mar 28, 2013","A step up from the previous instalment but also a few steps away from Tolkien's work and closer to the typical action movie framework at the expense of the characters and of the movie itself.

It benefits greatly from not having to introduce itself- the first one did that and it suffered from it. This time the length doesn't feel like an issue because there's more going on but the action gets old after a while and isn't what the spirit of Tolkien's work was about. The Hobbits are also annoyingly outcast as nothing more than bystanders who spend most of the time crawling rather than standing.

It improves on the first in the important areas but then replaces those improvements with some new issues- in both cases it just feels like Jackson is over-playing his hand. The upsides to that though are the thrills, the epicness (yes, it's not a word, boo-hoo) and the stunning visuals that Jackson creates so well. 

I prefer it to the first but I'm left with the same feeling in the end- it could've been better and with less effort too.",NEUTRAL

If done right, the payoff is huge; case and point, the Dark Knight, Empire Strikes Back, and the Two Towers.  The movie has action aplenty, but the magic is found in the quieter moments, in Gollum/Smegol's (Oscar worthy and snubbed) schizophrenic discussions to Sam's 'Stories' speech.  The characters' struggles and development are given front stage as the storm clouds gather for the war to decide the fate of Middle Earth.

"Feb 13, 2013","""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" was significantly better than the first installment which isn't   saying much. My low opinion of it is partly influenced by my distaste for these kinds of films, I'll admit that. I am not too fond of a film that is purposely drawn-out, has banal storytelling and characters, except for maybe one or two computer generated ones; Gollum is as fascinating a creature as Dobby was in the ""Harry Potter"" series. It's well written contrary to ""The Fellowship,"" also better acted. Orlando Bloom and Hugo Weaving just look awkward in their respective roles; two characters who do not feel natural in an artificial world. It's only great attributes are everything related to visuals; the computer generated effects are awe-inspiring, especially when the film is coming to an end. I wonder how Peter Jackson and his staff imagined and choreographed all of the detail shown in the battle scenes, even if it was done with a computer. To me, the actual fighting is not interesting at all; it's where these creatures are running to, where they are falling; the several objects used by them, and so on. Some of the shots of locations (castles, and what not) done by CGI are gorgeous to look at, too. As I said earlier most of the characters were unappealing to me, only rarely did I care for a few. I've seen them countless times before and did not like the way they were presented, still I did not expect anything different. The three storylines and what happens in them were mostly predictable, somewhat boring, and not really entertaining. It's style over substance, difficult to catch its pulse.",NEUTRAL

"Feb 6, 2013","More crafted than the previous one, darker, with a more complex structure, more complicated from the environmental an technical point of view, The Two Towers continues the premise of the first part of the saga, and enlarges its dimension to reach a betterly warlike atmosphere and a gloomy aura that never cuts the emotional and masterful style of Peter Jackson's lucid and wonderful  perfectionism. This film doesn't stay at just keeping the tension and the cinematic brilliantness from the previous film, but it simply denses and polishes it. This one was the hardest to adapt, indeed, because it has too many plots, it has a complex situation, a chaotic and complicated structure, and too many details to be exposed. It was also so hard to express what this story should mean, and to make it both dazzling and thougtfull. Again, Jackson's team made it. Concerning, dramatic, but also evocative and inspiring. This film focuses more on the purely pictorial aspect, on cinematography and score, edition and careness of the environmental atmosphere. Pure Art, in the classical sense. But probably, the greatest things of this film are two: the power of its narrative pulse, and also the introduction of one of the best supporting characters ever: Gollum, both in the psychological and interpretative way, as well as in the digital and creative sense. Every single instant of this classic film, than can be hardly (when not just impossibly) criticized, because of its practical absence of mistakes, is full of the most highly inspired and exquisite artistic taste and sense of heartfulness and beauty.

"Jan 28, 2013","What used to be my least favorite of the fantastic Lord of the Rings series has gotten better with every rewatch. Two Towers is a fantastic movie in every sense of the word, and I can finally say it beats Fellowship. This movie continues the great story and develops the characters even more. The acting becomes increasingly better, with not only the returning standouts Wood, McKellen, and Mortensen, but now with new standouts: Astin, Tyler, and most certainly Andy Serkis. Serkis's portrayal of Gollum is one of the best motion-capture performances ever, and deserves the Oscar it never got nominated for. The movie is amazingly paced, and is surprisingly more entertaining than Fellowship. It is funnier, more emotional, has even BETTER music, and features one of the best battles in any movie I have ever seen: Helms Deep.

The film is more complicated than the first, with more subplots relating to the war shown. Frodo and Sam's journey with Gollum is a highlight, and their unique relationship is captured masterfully.

"Jan 13, 2013","There's no doubt about it that this film is a bridge between Fellowship of the Ring and Return of the King. I'm not usually not the biggest fan of bridge stories since all they do is just set up the finale without adding anything new. For example, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix's only purpose is to prove that Voldemort is back and to set up the final battle, making this the worst of the Harry Potter series. However, The Two Towers is completely different from most bridge stories. The film continues where Fellowship of the Ring left off with the Fellowship broken up and Sauron beginning his attack on Middle-Earth. Frodo and Sam are lost on their way to Mordor and ask Gollum/Smeagol to guide them. Merry and Pippin have escaped their captors and are kept safe by Treegard, a talking tree that is the eldest of his kind. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli are assisting a town under attack by Orcs at their fortress in Helm's Pass. While all of this is occurring, Sauron is growing stronger with the ring approaching closer. I thought that Two Towers was an improvement over Fellowship. Unlike Fellowship, while it does have a long length, I was able to keep my interest the entire time with clever dialogue and a smartly written script. There's not many action scenes in this film, so the story relies on the dialogue to establish characters and set-up what will occur in the Return of the King. The character that shines the most in this film is Gollum. This is the first time in the series that he's seen entirely. Every scene that he was in, I was clinging to his every world. Andy Serkis does a great job portraying the character and the ending shows that there will be a lot more of him that could be just as exciting as in this film. I'm glad that I was able to finally see this film because it just leaves me, as well as newcomers and fans of the series, in anticipation for Return of the King and the epic conclusion.",NEUTRAL

"Jan 6, 2013","The captivating thing about Two Towers is the fight choreography and the battle at Helmâ(TM)s Deep (which was kind of the movieâ(TM)s climax), it is one that you will not forget that easily and the movie is just another powerful extension of what Peter Jackson could do, the movie is filled with a lot more CGI (from my view) than the first, and it may not be the best of the three, but Two Towers delivered some powerful performances, especially from Aragon (Viggo Mortensen), the Dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and the Elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom).

After you have watched The Fellowship of the Rings, you are ever so eager to see what the Fellowship, (which is now broken into three groups Frodo with Sam, Pippin with Merry and Aragon with Legolas and Gimli) will be able to achieve on their own, as part of the master plan to destroy the ring at Mount Doom. The interesting thing about watching this flick is that some managed victory in their own areas, giving you the viewer a delightful hope, while Frodo (Elijah Woods) and Sam (Sean Astin) were moving closer to their target.

The movieâ(TM)s plot is focused mostly on the battle at Helmâ(TM)s Deep. The other fellowship members except Frodo and Sam and after the fall of Gandalf when he battled the Balrog, chased after the Uruk-hai who took Merry and Pippin so as to rescue them. While they chased Merry and Pippin found an adventure of their own in the forest. The rescuers Aragon, Gimli and Legolas found themselves in Rohan and had to save the king and defend the city from an attack from Sarumanâ(TM)s forces, this defense and intense battle happened at Helmâ(TM)s Deep.

The three most notable changes in the movie compared to the book that I picked up instantly are (although many other differences can be found) 1. In the book Theoden is just depressed and deluded by Wormtongue but in the movie he is possessed by Saruman. The second is about Theeoden, who didnâ(TM)t just run to Helmâ(TM)s Deep as the movie made it see, he actually fought at first. The last was the exclusion of Shelob, who was later included in the final movie of the trilogy.

Not winning as much as the first, Two Towers won two Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects and Best sound Editing. It was a commercial success making close to 10 times its 94 million dollars production cost.
Not as much of a powerful score like The Fellowship of the Ring the movie is a nice follow up to the first, and it served like a bridge from an excellent beginning in the trilogy (in the fellowship of the ring) to a magnificent ending (in the Return of the King). You canâ(TM)t watch the first only without seeing this also, so get the DVD box set and enjoy.

"Dec 28, 2012","""Throw me...don't tell the elf.""

It could've been the worst of the 3 - being the middle it has no start and no end so there's no conclusion. But no, it's easily my favourite of the trilogy progressing the story nicely and introducing more characters and creating more of a character of 'Gollum'. 

There's a greater sense of size and epicness of the world in 'The Two Towers' its done on a grander scale - probably due to the success of the first film. There's more of the world to see and a larger emphasis on the task 'Frodo' and the gang are up against. It also contains what I consider to be the greatest battle scene of all time - 'The Battle for Helms Deep'. That last hour is a magnificent feat in film making.

Whereas 'The Fellowship of The Ring' was relatively dark and miserable throughout, 'The Two Towers' as a happier ending and is the part that shows that there is hope and they finally believe they can accomplish the task. There's a greater feeling of togetherness throughout then film 'Legolass' and 'Gimli' start to become friends. The king of 'Rohan' is returned to the crown and 'Gandalf' returns. Despite the appearance of what some perceive to be a darker film it is not it's quite the opposite.

Unlike then previous film the 3 running time for 'The Two Towers' works perfectly it doesn't drag, everything is necessary. The CGI is clearly improved and considering its only 1 year later it's quite remarkable. 

An improvement in every way on the previous film a greater emphasis on the world and an all together brighter and happier outlook on what they're facing - and containing the greatest battle scene I've ever seen. This really is the 'Empire Strikes Back' of 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy.",NEUTRAL

Elijah Wood once again plays Frodo (as he and Sam attempt to complete their journey), Viggo Mortensen excellently plays Aragorn (heir to the throne of Gondor), but it is the character of Gollum that steals the show (as well as trying to steal the Ring!). Glimpses of the creature were seen in the opening movie, but here the audience really get to know the character through a brilliant performance from Andy Serkis and the help of incredible CGI.

"Nov 9, 2012","Like the other films in the franchise, The Two Towers is a staggeringly ambitious accomplishment. With the introductory material out of the way, Jackson makes room for massive action sequence after massive action sequence, fitting moments for character development in the spaces between them. Here characters are resurrected, tree people drown goblins, and elves slide down stairs on shields while firing arrows at enemies, but there's also quite a bit of to be said about the universal truths that come through the various storylines (the importance of perseverance, the small making a difference, etc.). It's impressive just how much Jackson gets across about these characters and environments with small details, a ripped flag pointing to the devolution of a once-great city, etc. It more than works as the middle-chapter of the trilogy, delivering spectacle and heart in equal measure, keeping the momentum going as the story continues on into the last (and best) entry in the series.",NEUTRAL

"Oct 13, 2012","The second chapter of the Lord of the Rings is a sight to behold. It really is something that is both emotionally and critically satisfying. The story continues and it's awesome! The pacing is pitch perfect, never getting boring for a three hour film. It fells like it needs more than to be cut down. Even the near 4 hour version feels short. The film has a very good message which I won't spoil for you. The acting is perfect and the Helms Deep battle scene is so amazing it can leave your jaw literally dropping. Although all the technical wizdary is amazing, it is the heart of the story that truly matters. It's a story that will make you laugh and cry. It's something that will leave an impression on you for a long while. This is really Aragorns film and shows what he has to struggle with in following his path to kingship instead of following Frodo. The struggle he goes through is felt along with Frodo and everyone else. Each one has a struggle. Frodo and Sam having to deal with whether or not they should trust a creature Gollum to lead them to Mordor. Who by the way is played wonderfully by Andy Serkis. Merry and Pippin who want to help in a war that us way too big for them but not for a certain creature they befriend. Aragorn and company also struggle with the coming battle. The tension is amazingly raised. If there is one negative aspect is that it ends and have to wait to see the finale to see hoe everything ties up. Then again that's the beauty of a series like this. To leave you anticipating the next chapter innate great story.  Its all powerful stuff. The strong message that I can give away is the one of hope over evil. It's a strong one and leaves me anxiously waiting to watch The Return of the King.",NEUTRAL
"Oct 13, 2012","A slight step-up from the already pretty good TFOFTR, Two Towers spends much of its time in the world of the humans/elves within Middle Earth...this, however is its main problem, getting bogged down in boring characters we don't even know. However, its strengths are quite strong. The editing between the storylines (Gollum/Sam/Frodo, Tree-beard/Merry/Pippin, Aragorn/Gimle/Legolas) flows smoothly, the emotions are more palpable, and the Battle at Helms Deep is one for the ages.

"Oct 6, 2012","The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers does not acheive the unique majesty of the Fellowship of the Ring, but it might have a more memorable sequence than anything seen in the first movie: the Battle of Helm's Deep. Sequels take two routes. The Empire Strikes Back route elevates the Trilogy to new heights with a more complex story, or the Die Hard route crafts a fun picture but ultimately acts as a retread of the first movie. While overall LOTR: The Two Towers falls toward the latter, it has enough character development and story progression to only slightly have it below the first movie. Plus The Two Towers builds to what will be one of the greatest war sequences in cinematic history: the Battle of Helm's Deep. By revolving the story around its battle masterpiece, LOTR: The Two Towers avoids becoming the forgotten movie in the Trilogy and successfully sets up the finale, the Return of the King.

The Two Towers begins where the Fellowship ends: with the sundering of the fellowship. The story splits into 3 parts. Gandalf (Ian McKellen) did not perish from his fall in Moria, but has battled the Balrog he fought in the Fellowship and transformed into Gandalf the White. Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), and Legolas (Orlando Bloom) chase the orcs that captured Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) and are returning them to Saruman (Christopher Lee), who believes they have the ring. Their chase takes them through the man-inhabited country of Rohan, run by King Theoden (Bernard Hill), his right-hand man Grima Wormtongue (Brad Dourif), and his niece Eowyn (Miranda Otto) and nephew Eomer (Karl Urban). Meanwhile, Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin), are lost in the labyrinth of mountains they entered at the end of the Fellowship. To get out, the receive the services of Gollum (Andy Serkis), the previous ring owner, who is cursed with multiple personalities and will stop at nothing to reunite with the ring. However, Gollum has also been to Mordor, so Frodo and Sam need him to guide them to Mordor so they can complete their quest.

The special effects take a big jump in The Two Towers, and not just Helm's Deep (which I will get to), but on a more intimate level. It is shocking to think that Gollum does not exist; apparently Andy Serkis was placed into a motion capture suit, so much credit goes to Serkis and the CGI for not only giving Gollum realistic movements, but for crafting a character with easily discernible personalities. 

But the piece de resistance of LOTR: The Two Towers is the 45 minute Battle of Helm's Deep, where Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and Theoden have to defend the people of Rohan from the attacking orcs of Saruman. Apparently the battle was mostly shot in CGI, giving each of the thousands of participants a little memory to choose a fight at random, making the battle sequences believeable. The battle encapsulates the many aspects of a war: the tension filled-preparation, the eerie calm before the start of the battle, explosions, and individual heroism. By using a pan-over filming approach as well as gigantic walls for the orcs to climb over, the battle's grandeur is elevated to Shakespearean levels. All credit goes to the combined efforts of the special effects, art, sound, makeup, and acting departments. 

The cinematography department also deserves credit for using New Zealand to distinguish the various lands  where these adventures are taking place. Is is easy to distinguish the locations from one another: Rohan's rolling hills, the bog Sam and Frodo have to go through, Rivendell's waterfalls, and many other locations. Edoras, the Rohan capital, is described as a hill in front of mountains, which took months for the cinematographers to find the right spot. The detail and specificity is not lost on the viewer and provides a stunning backdrop for the character's traversing.

The acting is solid across the board. Serkis shines because of the parallel between his Gollum and Elijah Wood's Frodo, who becomes more weary and paranoid because of the ring's effects. With Gandalf more in the background in this movie, Viggo Mortensen gets to display more acting chops as his Aragorn has to ascend to the importance of his birthright. The newcomers also bring something to the table: Karl Urban shows youthful loyalty and fire, Miranda Otto provides a strong female character needed in the story, Bernard Hill exudes royalty, David Wenham gives Faramir, Boromir's brother, self-assuredness and wisdom, and Brad Dourif reeks of deception. 

As exhausted as the characters and myself were after the Battle of Helm's Deep, the Two Towers acknowledges that even more is yet to come. The Two Towers successfully elevates the setup from the Fellowship of the Ring by raising the stakes for the characters as they come closer to their fates. Who would think that hobbits, elves, dwarves, and wizards could illicit such enthusiasm and emotional catharsis?",NEUTRAL

I guess the only thing i disliked is that the story ends where it starts, with Samwise and Frodo alone with Gollum now, but it doesen't even really matter cause that's key to the story and it'll be interesting to see what they do from here.

"Sep 23, 2012","Although I have seen all of the Lord of the Rings films before, I had never read the books, and so recently I decided to read them. I then thought it might be fun to watch each film as I complete each part of the story. And so, having finished â~The Two Towersâ(TM)â¦ and read the first eighty or so pages or so of â~The Return of the Kingâ(TM) we come to the second of Peter Jacksonâ(TM)s films. For the record I have to say that I watched the extended version, available on DVD and Blu Ray.

NOTE: There may be spoilers in here; if you havenâ(TM)t seen the â~Fellowship of the Ringâ(TM) please skip this paragraph.

With the Fellowship broken at the end of the first film we follow the fortunes of the remaining adventurers. Frodo and Sam are to make their own way to Mordor, but not without a little help from an unexpected quarter. Gollum has been following them and now he finds himself aiding them on their quest; but can he be trusted? Sam certainly thinks not. Meanwhile Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are on the trail of Merry and Pippin who had been taken by a band of Orcs towards Isengard, the stronghold of the wizard Saruman, a follower of Sauron. The Orcs had been attacked by a band of horsemen from Rohan but the Hobbits escaped into the forest. Here they meet an Ent called Treebeard and he takes them to a gathering of all the Ents in the wood. Following them, the other three are surprised to be met by Gandalf who they thought had perished in the mines of Moria. From here on it begins to get a little complicated but needless say there are battles to be won as the war for Middle Earth hots up.

Peter Jackson and his team did not disappoint again, another epic film with tremendous scope. I also have to mention again the original music by Howard Shore; another great score with some really great themes. As far as performances go, well everybody did a great job but those that stood out (for me) were; Elijah Wood as Frodo, Ian McKellen as Gandalf, Sean Astin as Samwise â~Samâ(TM) Gamgee, Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn and Bernard Hill as Theodin (King of Rohan). Also worthy of note were; Billy Boyd as Pippin, Dominic Monaghan as Merry, Orlando Bloom as Legolas, John Rhys-Davies as Gimli/Voice of Treebeard, Liv Tyler as Arwen, Miranda Otto as Eowyn, David Wenham as Faramir,  Christopher Lee as Saruman, Karl Urban as Eomer and not forgetting Andy Serkis as Gollum/Smeagol.

Having recently read the book I did find that this departed from J.R.R.Tolkienâ(TM)s original to a much larger extent than the first instalment â~The Fellowship of the Ringâ(TM). Much more is put into establishing background and motive than in the text and, to a large extent, it works pretty well. It does, however, distract from the task at hand in places and I did find it a little heavy going here and there. I canâ(TM)t, on the other hand, fault the production; it is all brilliantly brought together and it looks fantastic! The battle scenes are immense and to be admired. Itâ(TM)s certainly one, despite a couple of misgivings, I still rate very highly.

SteelMonsterâ(TM)s verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

"Sep 7, 2012","After the slightly disappointing ending to <i>The Fellowship of the Ring</i> -- it felt less like an ending and more like an arbitrary decision to cut the film off -- <i>The Two Towers</i> continues <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> story, and brings along with it the same sort of problem. It's the middle film in a three-part series, and as a result, it has no real beginning or ending part, nor does it conclude the vast majority of the arcs that it begins to establish. It leaves you feeling disappointed, not because it's bad, but because it feels like it's leading up to something that you'll don't get to see. Not yet, at least.

There are three distinct plots this time around. The most important is the one involving Frodo and Sam (Elijah Wood and Sean Astin), the Hobbits tasked with carrying the One Ring to Mordor in order to destroy is. They manage to convince Gollum (motion captured and voice work done by Andy Serkis), the creature who was consumed by the Ring for 500 years and who yearns for it every day, to act as their guide to lead them into the depths, and spend the entirety of the film walking by mountains and through bogs.

The second story involves two other Hobbits, Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), who begin the film under Orc control but manage to escape early on. They head into a forest and spend pretty much the rest of the film hanging out with the Ents, a group of walking, talking trees. The Hobbits were initially being traced by the three other members of the Fellowship, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), but they end up going on a far different path.

They wind up heading to Rohan, a region ruled by Men, in order to aid them in their fight against the Orc armies. They meet up with Théoden (Bernard Hill), Rohan's king, and eventually team up with him which will eventually lead to a climactic, seemingly hour-long battle involving Men, Elves, and Orcs, which concludes our film. That battle is most certainly the film's highlight, as before that, mots of it consists of dialogue and people riding on horseback from one gorgeous location to another.

It's all set-up with only minimal payout. Most of the character and story arcs don't conclude in this film, leaving us wanting more. This is a problem with the book as well, but it's unfortunate that it happens here. We bide our time for far too long, as the Ring has to progress a certain distance before we can actually do anything of importance. Most of what happens here is leading up to the next film, or to the Battle of Helm's Deep, that hour-long war scene I mentioned earlier.

Speaking of our climactic battle, it's very exciting and is definitely worth the long time it takes to get to it. If you wanted to see a huge battle involving thousands of orcs and hundreds of humans, this is the one you need to watch. The death toll is large, the action is fresh and exciting, and there's enough humor injected into it to make it not as depraved as seeing hundreds of people die could be. Each of the characters involved gets a chance to shine, and it's the most exciting thing to happen in the series thus far.

A few new characters are introduced this time around, the first of which I've already mentioned. Théoden is here for about half the film, beginning our story under Saruman's (Christopher Lee) control. Éomer (Karl Urban), Théoden's nephew, and Éowyn (Miranda Otto), his niece, play fairly large roles as well. There's also Faramir (David Wenham), who shows up in the latter portion in Frodo's storyline. Only Faramir's story reaches a point where I was happy with it.

What we learn in <i>The Two Towers</i> is that the film is no longer about a Hobbit's quest to take the Ring to Mordor. Instead, it's about turning Aragorn into an action star. I know that it's more about him finally accepting his destiny as Isildur's heir and more or less becoming who he should have been in the first place, but this film barely touches on that. He becomes the star, gets the most exciting set-pieces, and is basically there just to kick all kinds of tail. The Hobbits are all more secondary characters, and their stories lack the energy of Aragorn's, this time around, at least.

The film still looks great, and despite all the meandering, is constantly entertaining. The world's fate is at stake, and while each action might not directly impact it, you watch to see what will eventually matter. These are all rich characters that are well-acted, so if you get to see a lot of them, there isn't much of a problem. I would have preferred a bit more action, but considering that's not what the book was like, I'm not going to complain much.

<i>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</i> is still a very enjoyable film, although it's not as good as its predecessor in large part because it feels like it doesn't go anywhere. It begins in the middle and ends in the middle, with a lot of talk that leads to nothing. The Helm's Deep battle is magnificent, and I'll watch these characters for hours on end, but I would have liked for a bit more to happen. It does make you want to see the third film right away, though.",NEUTRAL

"Aug 28, 2012","I used to think this one was the best of the trilogy but after watching all three together I find this movie quite different. It's still a great movie and I watched the 4 hour directors cut but it doesn't hold together as well as 'Fellowship' after several watches... and I am nitpicking here but I feel Sauron & Saruman aren't really taken advantage of and we lose the mind of the evil force that is coming up against the people of Rohan. Instead we are just left with the masses of the enemy but no real emotional tie to the conflict, just cool action scenes and amazing cinematography and of course I can't forget the costumes & make up, seriously amazing work on these movies.

"Aug 26, 2012","It has a great story, but it's very complicated and any viewers that didn't read the book will get confused by the amount of characters and locations they need to remember for it to all make sense. The effects, and acting is great, but there isn't much emotion and real attachment to any of the characters. This one does have much better direction during the action but Jackson still feels the need to get incredibly close to people's faces when the action has stopped. Also, none of the characters are particularly likable (and make very frustratingly dumb decisions), but it has some much needed action scenes. Also, there are a few plot holes & many of the simplest questions aren't answered.",NEUTRAL

"Aug 21, 2012","After a strong, if somewhat wobbly first film, The Lord Of The Rings trilogy goes significantly downhill with it's inferior sequel.  The Two Towers has all the strengths and flaws of the first, though the strengths have diminished slightly, and the flaws have an even bigger presence.

The Two Towers is a continuation of the original film, in which a young hobbit named Frodo Baggins, as well as some friends, attempt to destroy a mystical ring, though dark forces oppose them.

At the end of the first film, the main characters are split up, which unfortunately, makes the film extremely complicated.  Various plot lines are juggled and if the audience doesn't keep track of them all, things can get extremely confusing.

One plot line, involving Frodo and Sam attempting to destroy the ring on their own meet the Gollum.  The Gollum is truly the most interesting character in the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  His conflicted nature splits him into two personalities, one who wants the ring, and will kill to get it, the other that truly cares about Frodo and Sam.  

The most uninteresting plot line involves Pippin and Merry being taken by walking trees and forced to do....nothing.  We scarcely ever see the duo, and when we do, it's often dull.  The primary source of comic relief in the first film is gone, making The Two Towers especially hard to watch.

There's less action and more talking.  The length has actually been increased by a quarter hour, which makes the film even more tedious than the original.  Even the dramatic battle at the end of epic scale is little compensation, as it doesn't feel very exciting.

At times, it feels like The Two Towers is repeating itself over and over again.  You can count on the fact that every hour or so, someone almost dies, only to be saved an arrow to the offender's head.  It's the primary source of escape in this film.

The acting, at the minimum, has not been hurt.  Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen and the rest of the cast are as strong as ever.  Christopher Lee's role, however, is significantly smaller, which is unfortunate.

Special effects also have not been affected in a negative way, and they are just as grand and marvelous as ever.

The score, by Howard Shore, feels a bit weaker than that of the original.  The main theme is used less frequently, and the usage of lighter pieces are almost completely gone, due to the film's darker nature.  It's still a good score, but it's weaker than it's predecessor's.

Dull to the point of hair pulling, The Two Towers fails to entertain.  Even with the addition of Gollum, The Two Towers is boring beyond belief, and the action scenes are minimal.  With little to excite viewers, it's a marvel that this tedious sequel actually has a positive reputation.",NEUTRAL

"Aug 20, 2012","The second chapter of the epic tale of Lord of the Rings is just as incredible as the first. In this, we see the story and the characters go into much darker places. I didn't even think that was possible after all that happened in Fellowship, but I was sorely wrong. The fellowship is broken, there are characters scattered all over Middle-earth, and everything just seems hopeless. I loved the way that Peter Jackson conveyed the feeling of despair in each character at some point or another in the film. Grade: A",NEUTRAL
"Aug 20, 2012",i have the collections..very good movie,NEUTRAL
"Aug 18, 2012","The role of the a second film in a trilogy is often overlooked, but is probably the most important. The first film must introduce the adventure to audiences, and the third must conclude it. The role of the second film, therefore, is to simaltaneously build on the first film and prepare viewers for the third. But if this was all a second film did, it would be a dreadful bore, and that's exactly where The Two Towers is so successful. It's mesmerizing, and if the third film didn't exist, I would call the battle at the end of this film the greatest in cinema history. The Two Towers is brilliant and perfect in every way, tying the first and third together with grace, power and epic thrills.",NEUTRAL

"Aug 15, 2012","Such a great movie. The trilogy is such an epic trilogy that really should be watched back to back. It's just filled with so many emotional scenes, deep character development, and so much attention to detail.  The extended edition adds a lot of depth to Faramir, showing flashbacks that emphasize his father's favoratism towards Boramir. It really provides reason for Faramir's actions, and we understand what he wants, but think of him as so much more of a hero when he doesn't take the ring, and ultimately let's Frodo, Sam and Gollum go. He really is my favorite character. Although, overall, this is not my favorite of the three, the first one is, but I can agree it is a great movie and a solid 10 out of 10. There is no reason at all for it to get any less, is there?",NEUTRAL

"Aug 14, 2012","A fantastic second chapter in this epic trilogy.

"Aug 13, 2012","Quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen, if judging a movie on standalone merit.  Those who liked the movie tended to have read the books, taking pressure off the director to actually capture what was needed into the movie.  This director completely failed to introduce character personalities, leaving a viewer who has not read the books disengaged from the characters - and wishing they could get their money back for three full hours that they won't get back.  No excuse for cut corners like that, especially for a three hour movie.",NEUTRAL

"Aug 5, 2012","The weakest entry in The Lord of the Rings trilogy is still epic in every sense of the word.  While the first film focused more on the majestic fantasy of Middle Earth, Two Towers shifts that focus toward long, drawn-out battle scenes.  These are no ordinary battle scenes, either.  In fact, I have never seen another film (or film series) that captures warfare on such a large-scale.  The result is thrilling, and the endless waves of combat never really wears out its welcome.  While the breaking of the fellowship at the end of the first picture was necessary, it makes the plot somewhat disorienting as the story constantly shifts between the separated parties.  I have also never been a big fan of Gollum, and his role in this film is a bit ambiguous.  The true importance of the character isn't truly fleshed out until the final film.  Nonetheless, Two Towers is everything one would hope for and serves as an excellent continuation of the trilogy.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 5, 2012",Few can dispute the sheer magical epicness of The Lord of the Rings trilogy. The Two Towers is a much darker and grim film in comparison to the others though.

It has two major action sequences, and being a three hour movie, that means there is loads of dialogue and exposition. I have no problem with long periods of talking (12 Angry Men might just be my favorite movie of all time), but the dialogue isn't anything super special and nothing much really happens in between the two battle sequences. How can nothing really happen in a movie this long? Well, the running time is divided between 4 different story lines so none of the story arcs really have time to advance very far. The battle sequences are enjoyable as well as all the production values throughout the film, and it does manage to set up the final movie very well.",NEUTRAL

Once again the cast are spot and every page (At least almost) comes alive with utter brilliance, the cast are really getting into their characters now which seemed hard on paper and to bring Middle Earth alive is a great feat. Peter Jackson has done a wonderful job and only nutcases can't see how much hard work and art has been put into this film, it does get a little slow in the middle but after that is an epic rush. It's just so beautiful to watch. The film draws you in, and never lets you down as it delivers more action and more complexity than the first one. It is a brilliant lead into the finale. The fantastic thing about the film is that though it is of the fantasy genre, we feel close to these characters and actually care about their situation.

"Apr 13, 2012","The Two Towers is practically the middle of the The Lord of the Rings story; it doesn't have a beginning because that has been provided by The Fellowship of the Ring and it doesn't have an ending because that will be provided in the sequel. 

This is a little disappointing because it's another mightily long movie (179 minutes) that doesn't seem to materialise anywhere. But the fact that I am still giving the rating of four stars most certainly implies that the sequel was still an excellent film to say the least.

This time, unlike in the predecessor where everyone stuck together the squad splits in three. Frodo (Wood) and Sam (Astin) must continue in their quest to Mordor where they come across devious creature Gollum (voiced by Andy Serkis) who claims that he will help them in their quest to destroy 'The Ring'; is their new ally as innocent as he seems however?

The second group of the crew is made up of fellow hobbits Merry (Dom Monagham) and Pippin (Billy Boyd). The duo narrowly escape a brawl with Sauron's forces and are left alone in the woods with trees which are able to talk, walk and are basically comparable to 80ft humans! However, will the two hobbits find a helpful ally in them...or an unwanted villain?

The third and biggest of the bunches are the warriors. Gandalf (Ian McKellen), Aragon (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), Gimli (John Rhys-Davis) and co. battle for Middle Earth against Sauron's forces, protecting Frodo and Sam for them as they do this. They plan to take down Saruman (Christopher Lee) who is a big piece of Sauron's army.

Bigger and better than the first one? I think not, but a mightily good effort from Jackson again, replicating J.R.R Tolkien's fine books. Again a little long but an equally good movie all the same.",NEUTRAL

I didn't care for the romance between Aragorn and Arwen when I was a kid (because I was nine). But now as a film buff who loves great movie romance, I'm still not on board with the Aragorn and Arwen story. However, the action sequences are impressive.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 20, 2012","Previously, on 24. I mean, The Lord of the Rings: The One Ring of Power has been found. After a perilous journey for the fellowship of the ring that ended with Gandalf (Ian McKellen) falling to what seemed to be his doom with the balrog at the bridge of Khazad-dum, the rest of the fellowship escaped. After respite in the land of Lothlorien, they journeyed on, and Boromir (Sean Bean) succumbed to the ring's power and fell against the Uruk Hai. We pick up where that left off: With a splintered fellowship heading in separate directions, which expand the scope. We have Frodo and Sam (Elijah Wood and Sean Astin) heading to Mordor, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli (Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies) hunting the Uruk Hai of Isengard (One of the ""two towers"") who have Merry and Pippin (Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd) and think they have the ring. These are the three main groups the perspective alternates between. Frodo and Sam finally come face-to-face with Gollum (Andy Serkis in his breakout motion capture performance), and take him as a guide to Mordor (The other of the ""two towers"" in The Two Towers). Throughout, Frodo is the only one who treats him kindly, but no one else does, which will come into play in Return of the King. Andy Serkis does an amazing job, both with capturing the motion and the emotion of Gollum: From the gangly movements to the gurgly voice that has become iconic in the 13 years since this film released, and he performs Gollum's bipolar very well, especially in scenes where Smeagol and Gollum ""talk"" to each other. The diverse trio takes us to the kingdom of Rohan, where King Theoden (Bernard Hill) has been corrupted by Grima Wormtongue (Brad Dourif), an ""advisor"" whose ""advice"" made Theoden kick out his own nephew Eomer (Karl Urban), who helps out the Uruk Hai trackers. Grima's ""advice"" eventually gets him in trouble with Gandalf (Spoiler alert: He survived, but not a spoiler because he was in the trailers, and the story's been around for 60+ years as of my writing this review) and Theoden. After learning of the terror Saruman wrought in lands far off from the city of Edoras, the people all go to a fortress called ""Helm's Deep"" and prepare for what is undoubtedly one of the most visually-stunning large-scale battles ever committed to film, and one that is more emotionally charged than anything Peter Jackson would put out ten+ years later. It is not in computer generated imagery that battles are committed to film, but in the emotional stakes and the gritty harshness of the battle: Hard rain, truly imposing Uruk Hai, and weapons of unimaginable (to them) destruction. It's good they didn't lead with this kind of battle. Finally, the story alternates to Merry and Pippin's encounter and subsequent travels with Treebeard the Ent (Voiced by Gimli's John Rhys-Davies), an ancient race of trees that can walk and talk like us, but are easy going, except when Saruman (Christopher Lee) fells trees the Ents know. They take it personally. This is a massive film, but when there is not a climactic battle raging, we get to know our main characters, from the Hobbits' sentimentality many of us could relate to, to Gimli and Legolas' growing to trust each other/get along as best elves and dwarves can, given their history. The battle is spectacular, and the CGI is incredible on Gollum and the Ents, but one thing they couldn't breath life into were the backgrounds of medium-shots of Merry and Pippin riding on Treebeard: It's too obvious Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd are in front of a green-screen for these sequences. When we see Treebeard and them on him, it's as if they're actually on a tree. Howard Shore provides a grander score for the grander scope, now that the story is starting to intensify: Gone are the flutes and easy tune of the Hobbit themes, except for a small dose here or there, but they can never go back to the way it was. Things have certainly grown gloomy since Frodo set out on his quest to destroy that ring, but there's still the occasional laugh you can find (I found one in Helm's Deep). Gimli and Legolas also provide great on-screen chemistry that creates almost as much comic relief as Merry and Pippin. This may be the part where the kids would ask you to turn off the movie because it's gotten too dark, but you will have to watch through the end to see if the sun shines brighter than ever after an especially dark night.",NEUTRAL

"Feb 18, 2012","In the extended edition version of ""The Two Towers"", most of the changes come in the form of scenes that were already present in the theatrical version but have been extended here, however there are a few notable differences therein: such as additional footage of Frodo and Sam, the Ents, and Merry and Pipin as well.
Among the most notable additions is a short scene showing Theodred's (Theoden's son's) funeral.
This version also gives us a lot more information regarding Aragorn's status as Dunedain by finally revealing his age (over 80 years old) as well as a scene in which Saruman becomes aware that Aragorn is of Dunedain lineage.
My favorite new scene in this film is a flashback of Faramir in which his relationship with his brother, Boromir, and his father, Lord Denethor (who doesn't appear in the theatrical version) is expanded on, resulting in Faramir being developed further as a character.

"Feb 17, 2012","Question 'Could Jackson make a sequel that is better than TFOTR?'. Answer:'erm...Yes!'. Defining the word 'big' in a bigger way once again, we follow the hobbits as they continue their journey to destroy the word ring. I had one question in my head when i went to see this film, 'can it possibly be better than the first film?' and it was. It was astounding. Completely mesmerising. Darker and more dngerous, it continues where the first film ended, and Frodo and Sam have a long journey ahead. Not only is this the best of the trilogy for me, its one of my favourite films. Attracting you so much you dont even notice the time flying by. Jackson yet again tells a story of hope, love, loss, war and heart which we just cant step away from. Visual art all the way through, from the massive mountains to small scale cities, TTT has something has everything that TFOTR had and much more. As i said in my first review, you develop a love for the characters which are fighting for the good of middle earth. After all thats happening from all the bloodshed and walking that takes place, you forget the realism to the film; it notches into you when you least expect, giving you a full taste that no one is invincible, and everyone is mortal. Heart renching moments occur many times in the film, some uplifting and some devestating enough to draw you to tears. Again, oscar nominated acting, which isnt really surprising; not being noticed for what it achieves, is. In my opinion, the most underated of the trilogy. Setting the concrete of the final battle for the ring, and again leaving you with a gaping mouth wide open and a feeling of wanting to watch more. Underated and completely mindblowing in sequences, this second part contains as much heart as the first film and a blast of power that the ring can have on you. Remember that feeling when you left the cinema, and having to wait another year for the final part. It was unbearable.",NEUTRAL

Personally, I didn't find this one as compelling as the first one, maybe because it is the filler between the beginning and the end.

"Feb 13, 2012","I can't praise this movie enough. From one of the best openings of all time as Gandalf battles the Balrog, to the grandeur of the plains of Rohan and culminating in the epic Battle of Helm's Deep. It's this battle that is one of the few occasions where the film actually outshines the book. The setting, sound, music, editing, it's all first class.
The main reason this movie sits above Fellowship though is Gollum. An incredible blend of the acting of Andy Serkis and CGI trickery makes for one of the most pivotal characters coming to life. He is fascinating to watch and as far as I'm concerned, portrays Tolkien's creation exactly.
This is the Best Picture Oscar winner of the three and an absolute masterpiece of modern cinema.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 12, 2012","This is not a sequel, but merely just chapter two of a great epic trilogy. The fight actions, especially in the final battle were spectacular. This film was not as slow as the first film but was faster paced, which I did not know was possible for a three hour film. I believe this film was actually the best one of the trilogy, from the writing, acting, directing, and the cinematography. It gets lost in the shuffle because it is not the beginning nor the end of the series. If any film of the three deserved the Best Picture, it was this one. Great scenery and plot lines, not to mention the internal conflict of both Gollum and Frodo as they near Mount Doom. Great film.",NEUTRAL

"Feb 5, 2012","I do not know whether this film does justice to its source material, partly because: 1) film and literature are completely different media, and 2) I have not read any of the novels yet (and I probably never will.) Even after spending almost 6 hours in the middle-earth, I still find it difficult to keep up with everything that's happening in this world. Too many characters, too many white races with no distinct features (with the exception of Elves), too many complicated names of regions and stuff in general, which make it challenging for me to take the story seriously. But around half way through the film, I realized that I shouldn't take it too seriously. Hell, this a fantasy film, with magic and Orcs and dwarves and all kinds of unrealistic shit, so I decided to just go with it. The result is quite spectacular and a really good time. Peter Jackson, once again, succeeds in telling this epic tale of bravery and sacrifice; terrific special effects, exquisite production design, and all-around strong performances make this installment an wildly entertaining ride. It's not without flaws and there are a couple of ridiculous and deliberately dramatic moments that made my eyes roll, but in the end it made me yearn for the final chapter. The Two Towers is damn entertaining.",NEUTRAL

Whilst all this is happening, the allies have to fight the growing armies of Saruman the White or fall in the attempt. This film has adventure, action and battles on epic scales, which includes the battle of Helms Deep, which is my favourite scene. Not without its flaws, but after all, Lord of the Rings is a hard book to turn into a movie.

This is the challenge Peter Jackson was left with in creating the first in his Lord of the Rings trilogy: the collective imagination of literally millions of fans, each one filled with different intricacies and opinions concerning characters, settings, basically everything involved in production design and being a director in general. With such a burden weighing on Jackson's shoulders, no one would have blamed him if he simply curled into the foetal position and sobbed when he actually bagged the role of director. But I'm sure I speak for fans, critics and the entire world when I say that I'm so glad that he didn't. The first in the sweeping epic of the Lord of the Rings, The Fellowship of the Ring begins with the origin of the one ring; an object created by the dark lord Sauron in order to take over Middle Earth. After a battle sequence or two, we join up with our hero of the piece; Frodo Baggins, a Hobbit from the Shire.

The dialogue between Elrond and Arwen is especially good--moving, convincing, poingiant, even brilliant, but Tolkien deserves the credit for that, not Jackson.

"Nov 12, 2011","The only attempt that Hollywood adapted J.R.R. Tolkien's epic fantasy novels before the live-action films was in the form of a 1978 animation film that compressed all three novels in the span of 132 minutes. A decade later, director Peter Jackson made his name as part of Hollywood's elite directors with the live-action adaptation of the novels that were filmed back-to-back-to-back in Jackson's native New Zealand and released one year after the other around the holidays. With the visual and makeup effects to create the fantasy world of Middle Earth, the film also featured an outstanding ensemble that include Eiljah Wood as Frodo, Oscar-nominee Ian McKellen as Gandalf and Oscar-nominee Viggo Mortensen as Aragon. Howard Shore's score can go down as one of the most recognizable score of all time. The visual effects and the action sequences during the big battle is one of the highlights of the trilogy.

Jackson's films will always have their critics; even The Two Towers, arguably the most beloved and critically acclaimed of the three. But I remain amazed.

"Sep 17, 2011","Peter Jackson left the entire world on a cliffhanger when he finished The Fellowship of the Ring. After having done such an impressive job with the first film and then having the balls to stay true to the source by finishing as he did, he was almost setting himself up to fail; giving himself a task even greater than the original undertaking: a sequel. Not just any sequel; a sequel to film being touted as one of the greatest fantasy films ever made and himself being declared a genius. This sort of hype is almost impossible to live up to. Almost.

Taking up where its predecessor left off, The Two Towers follows Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas as they chase down a troop of Uruk-Hai, Frodo and Sam as they journey further towards Mordor and Merry and Pippin as they, well, get into lots of trouble.

The story is much more divided in comparison to the first of the series with a fellowship of nine journeying together rather than three different groups and their various shenanigans. This is the first challenge to overcome for filmmaker Peter Jackson: how to tell all these stories in under four hours? Not only that, but how to allot time to the different storylines without 1) making it boring and 2) losing focus on the main story which just happens to be the more boring aspect of the source material: Frodo and Sam's trek towards Mordor. After all, how inventive can one director be with half the story taking up by two diminutive figures walking towards a place which they don't actually reach by the time the films finishes?

It's almost as if Jackson hasn't noticed these issues as the second film is just as fulfilling and story-driven as the first without sacrificing any major plot points or basically getting rid of anything that would cause a fan outcry. Yes, technically the ents do show up to help at the battle of Helm's Deep and no we don't get to see Merry and Pippin in Treebeard's house or talking to Quickbeam but in the end, Peter Jackson has conquered these seemingly mammoth tasks with ease. This is a reflection on Jackson's instinct for pace, as the extended edition shows that these time-consuming though unnecessary scenes were in fact filmed, but were left on the editting floor. Jackson's fearlessness with the source material yet mindfullness of it as well means that the story is left completely intact; enough to appease any fan. Jackson has also made room for the lighter moments as well, revelling in the joy of discovery when Merry and Pippin first encounter Treebeard and having time for jokes between the double-act which just keeps getting better of Legolas and Gimli. Jackson doesn't forget about his characters either, keeping the film from feeling hollow by introducing the beautiful Miranda Otto as never-to-be love interest Eowyn and the abandoned-by-his-country Eomer as well as extending his existing characters in Merry and Pippin who only get more endearing, Frodo and Sam whose seemingly unflappable relationship is beginning to show some strain. And even though Gandalf's character goes under a major revamp he's still the same enigmatic mentor as before, albeit slightly more badass. It's this attention to detail which makes Peter Jackson's work so watchable, all the way through the crazy runtime.

Shore's score is as strong as ever, this time bringing the beautiful theme of the world of men to the fore. Shore's understanding of motif and mood is pivotal here, even more so than Fellowship as the story isn't as driving as its predecessor. Because of this, Shore's score is able to ferry us through the slower moments and throughout the entire film.

The performances here are just as textured as they were in the first film. Not only that, but the sequel factor means that actors are able to loosen up a little more, in particular in the case of Orlando Bloom's Legolas and John Rhys-Davies' Gimli. The two of them have more fun than it should be possible to have in an epic of this size and they pull it off without ever feeling camp or not taking it seriously enough. Ian McKellen's Gandalf is still the standout of the series but it's great to see the rest of the cast becoming more and more involved in their characters. Viggo Mortensen's Aragorn is one of the performances which shows a lot of progression. His presence has more gravitas in this one and his character is more layered than the original; more difficult to read. Elijah Wood has much less to do in this film, leaving him to keep mostly the same expression on his face for most of the film. While this may be true to story, it does occassionally make you wish that he had something else to do than walk around some rocks for a while. Sean Astin's Sam is similarly beleagured and while their parts of the film are integral to the story, you sometimes wish that we'd move back to the interesting parts a little sooner. Bernard Hill makes a great addition to the cast as Theoden as well as his onscreen daughter Eowyn played with fragile strength by Miranda Otto. Brad Dourif's Grima Wormtongue is fantastic; a slimy, manipulative groveller who snivells perfectly through every scene he's in.

Another of Towers' achievements lies in another of its new characters: Gollum. Gollum is a completely CG creation, performed by Andy Serkis with groundbreaking technology, enabling Serkis to interact with the actual actors and thus makes the performances all the more real. This innovation makes for incredible viewing as one of the more unfilmmable sections of Tolkien's work is brought to life onscreen. Serkis' performance is largely discounted in terms of acting accolades but it's incredible to see. His work here set the benchmark for motion capture.

But all these technical factors fade into the background at the Battle of Helm's Deep: a battle scene so epic that it drowns out everything that comes before it. Ten thousand Uruk-Hai facing off against Rohan's much depleted forces is so overwhelming that it makes it difficult to spot any kind of flaws in the rest of the film. Jackson seamlessly blend CG with fantastic costume and makeup to create an entirely believeable all out war which lives up to the scenes detailed in the book and revells in the little moments like Legolas riding a shield down some stairs or a rousing speech from King to King. Jackson's sense of pace throughout the battle is fantastic, moving from the Entmoot to Sam and Frodo without ever losing momentum. And the coup-de-grace of Gandalf's arrival is as breathtaking a moment as the series brings in any of its three films.

While this may be the weaker cinematically of the three films, the fact that I'm still giving it five stars shows you just how high the bar is set for this series. The fact is that, despite lacking the grandeur of the third and the sense of wonder and scariness of the first, it's still a better film than 90% of the blockbusters Hollywood vomits up on regular basis. Truly incredible filmmaking.

Defining Scene:
The Battle at Helm's Deep. Of course.

"Sep 14, 2011","Possibly the best entry in the trilogy (although all three are so good and uniform that it is hard to say one if better than the other...they are essentially one long film).  Everything from the first film continues on here, with a few more epically fantastic CG battle scenes.  Andy Serkis as Gollum is fantastic, and probably one of the best uses of performance capture, at least up to this point.  CG can be amazing when the time and money is put into it and it is used properly.",NEUTRAL
"Sep 10, 2011","The second film of the trilogy begins where the first left off. Frodo and Sam are now on there own, without their fellow hobbits Merry and Pippin who have been captured by the orcs of Sarumon's army; who ultimately escape and flee into the darkness of Fangorn Forrest. But Frodo and Sam don't know they're being followed by the lurking slime known as Smeagol, who wants his ""precious"" back once again. And Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli are led to Rohan by Gandolf the White; who was presumed to have died in the first film, where King Theoden is being taken over by the evil powers of Sarumon. King Theoden's niece Ãowyn feels that Aragorn and his men have what it takes to defeat Sarumon's army with Rohan's army joining them in battle. Ãowyn ends up falling for Aragorn, but Aragorn doesn't know if he feels the same knowing he made his promise to return to Arwen. And with the battle between good and evil at the end, it just shows that Sauron's army will keep growing and Frodo and Sam need to keep moving. 'The Two Towers' is an amazing follow-up to 'Fellowship' and features the same ever-amazing cast and adding the new characters like King Theoden, Faramir, and the amazing Smeagol voiced by Andy Serkis. Peter Jackson's direction style really showed off in this chapter and made everyone excited for 'Return of the King', which rightfully deserved everyone one of it's 11 Oscars. People who aren't fans or haven't heard of LOTR should be aware of what they're missing out on; truly the movie experience of a lifetime.",NEUTRAL

The same efforts from Peter Jackson are clearly visible. Again everyone has done a great job in their respective acts. I could easily watch the extended version without getting bored. The character of Gollum is quite interestingly made fit in the story.  The battle of Isengard is what this one is wholly about. Its quite a lengthy war but its one of the jaw-dropper.

And the fact that these films run 3+ hours each is good thing since that means  the audience gets that much more content to sink our teeth into if that's your thing.

The theme of justified is critized especially by Faramir but it seems this is halfbaked and would need some more reaching over the script. The character of Gollum / Smeagol is written excellently and the Faramir storyline gives some - yet a little bit halfbaked - bone: what principles are you willing to follow or let to go just to get approvement of your fathers?

Why? Because of Peter Jackson.
Nevermind when Gandalf arrives in his white horse a la John Wayne or when the uruk hai runs with the torch as if he was going to light the olympic flame, hell, I might even be able to forgive the scene with Legolas and the skateboard like shield. 
The butchery of the story is what took it too far. King Theoden's character was done all sorts of wrong in this movie, the corny ass scene where Aragorn falls off and winds up back in the camp after his horse saves him as he holds Arwen's necklace was dripping syrup so corny it was, the relationship between Legolas and Gimli was turned around for the worst. I wasn't expecting it to be loyal to the book 100%, but you can't simply put stuff there that was meant the opposite way. And the worst part is that, for example, Theoden's character change and Gimli-Legolas relationship went back to how it was written in the third, so this one seems like an anomaly of sorts.
The cherry on top of the cake for me to dislike this movie is that Peter Jackson can't hide an infatuation he has with elves, infatuation that Tolkien didn't have, so he adds them in the Battle of Helm's Deep just because he wants elves there, even if it changes the actual story told in the book where it is a stand of humankind against Saruman, not humankind going to cower to caves while the elves come to save the day (something they don't do in the book trilogy, they are too busy leaving middle earth).
Visually, this movie is stunning and the ents were just like how I had imagined as a kid. Sadly, this is Peter Jackson's version of the books and how he reads em/enjoys them, not a movie about the book.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 11, 2011",My favourite of the series,NEUTRAL
"Jul 10, 2011","For what it's worth, this is a review on the extended edition.

I spent most of my review of Fellowship gushing over the production values, the actors, the music, the direction, cinematography, the sense of history, etc.  I'll save you the regurgitation of it here, and only mention that the same level of quality continues on into The Two Towers.

Where as Fellowship centered on a group of characters the entire running time, Two Towers has them split up into three groups.  The first consist of Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli, as they find themselves in Rohan, ""home to the Horse Lords.""  The Rohirrim are, I suppose, your typical, quaint villagers most commonly found in fantasy epics.  A little more beefed-up, history-wise, of course.  They're under direct threat of Saruman.  Lest you forgot, he strolls around his tower of Orthanc, building an army of super orcs (Uruk-hai) and burning the surrounding lands to make way for an industrial age.  Rohan's king, Theoden, is not willing to risk open war so he decides to evacuate his people to the fortress of Helm's Deep.  There, with Aragorn fighting by his side, he will make his last stand.

Meanwhile, Merry and Pippin find themselves in the company of a tree.  Well, if you want to get technical, an Ent (talking tree), named Treebeard.  I'd like to think his tree-parents had a sense of humor when naming him.  Anywho, Merry finds himself wanting to play a bigger role in the battle for Middle-Earth, so he pushes Treebeard and his Ent friends to go to war with Saruman.

Lastly, and most importantly as far as the one ring is concerned, Frodo and Sam make their way through Emyn Muil, the Dead Marshes and right up to the black gates of Mordor in their quest to cast the ring into the fires of Mount Doom.  It doesn't take them long to get lost, but they find a guide in Smeagol/Gollum, the previous owner of the ring (before Bilbo) and another tragic figure in the Lord of the Rings trilogy.

Aragorn and the plight of Rohan take center stage in this film, and that's all fine and dandy.  The introduction of Rohan and much of its inhabitants make for a welcome change of pace.  Theoden King tends to babble on a bit much about . . . everything, but finally acts with some balls come the film's finale.  There's also a love interest introduced in Eowyn, the king's niece.  It's not much of a love story, mind you, as Aragorn's heart still belongs to Arwen, but it's an interesting angle none-the-less.  I also mentioned last time that the characters of Gimli and Legolas got the short end of the stick.  Here, they're fleshed out a bit more.  Sure, Legolas is given most of the token bad-ass moments, and Gimli is the comic relief . . . but for the most part it works because come the end of the film, you really do enjoy the two and their constant game of trying to one up each other, even in battle.  Of course, Gandalf plays more of an extended cameo in this flick, but he's always a welcome addition.

Merry and Pippin unfortunately have most of the boring stuff, right up to the climax.  Ents are deliberately slow creatures, and right when the movie is in the middle of something interesting, sometimes it will cut to these guys and the pace slows to a crawl.  Still, there's a great moment towards the end when the Ents march on the tower of Orthanc and ""fuck up Saruman's shit,"" so to speak.  It's the ultimate act of nature vs industry, and a great moment of catharsis for those sick of Treebeard droning on and on about trees.

In Frodo's quest, well, they're honestly not given a whole lot to do this movie.  They walk.  They walk some more.  The interesting stuff is done via Gollum, the tortured soul always at war with himself, and always in pursuit of the ring.  Gollum was the first CG character that people actually bought into and cared for.  He's eccentric, he's funny and he's compelling.  The hobbit gang does run into Faramir, and then we get a bit more background on the ""sons of Gondor"" but that aside, this isn't their movie.

To be honest, this film was always my least favorite of the trilogy, but that doesn't mean it isn't an incredible story.  Yeah, I think this one has the same flaws as the first, what with the incredibly long running time and some superfluous scenes, but that's to be expected.  What we're given in return is a fantasy rich with great characters, incredible locales and music, and some great action.  For those who like their epic battles, Helm's Deep is about as thrilling as it gets.

The Two Towers, like the other two Lord of the Rings films before and after it, has a hurdle you have to get over.  But if you're willing to go for it, it almost ceases to become a movie, and you feel yourself just getting transported into another world for a few hours.  For me, that's exactly what I look for in a fantasy epic, and the best compliment that it can receive.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 4, 2011","This is one of the best <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> film. My favourite scene is The Battle of Helm's Deep, what an amazing action-packed I ever seen. 
Viggo Mortensen is one of the best hero characters as Aragorn and brings an excellent performance with his amazing swordfights, flunts and horseracer in this fantasy film of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> series. Gollum shines in a much-welcomed large role, due to extremely realistic computer animation, and a fine performance from Andy Serkis, upon which the animation was modeled. Bernard Hills's performance is truly first rate, as Theoden, King of Rohan, a performance which contributed greatly to ""The Battle of Helms Deep"", scenes which are a spinning tornado of emotions for the viewer. And this captures the deliriously beautiful New Zealand landscapes.
skilfully integrated extra footage makes this sequel much better than the cinema and previous DVD versions. Event without the hefty end credits, you get another 35 minutes of battle action and details on Aragorn, his elf girlfriend (Liv Tyler), new gal pal (Miranda Otto) and talkative Treebeard.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 4, 2011",As good as the first,NEUTRAL
"Jun 24, 2011","The sequel to the first, The Two Towers definitely matches up with the first. After watching the first I was unbelievably excited to watch this.  Although they are very long films, it works, and I don't want them to end.  By the end of this, I wanted to pop in The Return Of The King right away. 

The Two Towers takes place right where the first ended.  Frodo and Sam are now alone, and begin their quest to Mount Doom.  Well Arogan, Legolas, and Gimli search for the pack of orcs that took Merry and Pippen.  Frodo and Sam also come across a the small creature Gollum who was following them in the first.  After they capture him, he agrees to guide them to Mordor, since they are lost, they have no choice but to trust him, and he is now part of the quest.  

I was extremely pleased at the greatness of this film.  It does not drop one bit from the first, and if anything it has gotten better.  

I personally love all the characters in the film, but if I had to pick one, it would have to be Legolas.

Gandalf also returns in the second as the ""white wizard"".  Don't worry, for those who haven't seen the film, it is not a spoiler.

The Two Towers is an extraordinary film, and proves that the first two are my favourite films of all time

"Jun 23, 2011","My favorite one. What can be said about this fantastic trilogy that hasn't been said already?. Spielberg said it was impposible to make. The battle at Helm's Deep is epic, hopless and...",NEUTRAL
"Jun 23, 2011","Man you guys have tot ry to be there for when they do Return of the King on the 28th @ 7:00. cause out of what i've experienced from seeing Fellowship and Two Towers on the big screen again, seeing Return of the King is going to be fantastic.

Plot: 1) Frodo and Sam have been separated from the rest of the fellowship and are now continuing to make their way into Mordor. But things take a turn as they run into the creature Gollum who is still trying to get the ring back.
2)Now that Borimir is gone, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimbli chase the Uruk-hai that have Marry and Pippin. But when they chase the hobbits all the way into Fangorn Forest, they meet an unlikely friend who takes them into a new quest: to save the country of Rohan.
3)Pippin and Merry went into Fangorn after the Uruk-hai that took them was attacked by Rohirrim. There they meet Treebeard and come across the gathering of Ents concerning what to do with Saruman.

After thinking about this movie when I saw it on the big screen the other night when one of my best friends asked me which movie was by favorite, I began to reconsider as to which one is my favorite between Two Towers and Return fo the King. I mean sure, who cares since I love them all and the trilogy has always been my favorite and unless my Lord commands or guides me otherwise, it always will be. But what makes this movie in a sense, stand out from the rest is how is...describes or develops more. It gets more into some of the characters such as Gollum, it gets more into the war, but more importantly, it gets more into the darkness and how there seems to be no hope at all for anyone. This is mostly done concerning Rohan. With the music and the things Saruman and his forces do to Rohan, how much they go though, It's just so powerful. They played that so well long before Helm's Depp-the most enduring battle scene in the history of cinema in my opinion-that in some ways, it's a slight wonder how it didn't win best picture over Chicago (besides the fact that Chicago is good) bad enough that Fellowship lost to Beautiful Mind (I have not seen it but from what my brother says who is a rather skeptical guy, Beautiful Mind had no place in the nominations compared to Fellowship) So much was done to prepare for the finale, and it was perfectly done.

Actors/Characters:
Elijah Wood/Frodo Baggins:Still did an Excellent job as Frodo.
Sean Astin/Samwise ""sam"" Gamgee: Same as Frodo. But I especially liked his monologue at the end. that was well done.
Ian McKellen/Gandalf the White: He still did good if nto made the character slightly more intersting now that he's come more mystical and powerful.
Viggo Mortensen/Aragorn:Man he's just so much more bad-a in this movie. You just have to love Aragorn.
Orlando Bloom/Legolas: What the heck was that? sliding down the stairs using an Uruk=hai shield while shooting down more Uruk-hai? The way he got on that horse during the fight with the Wargs and their riders? THAT'S JUST SO FREAKING AWESOME!!!!! Legolas is more and more lovable every time we see him.
John Rhys-Davies/ Gimbli and Treebeard: He is just as funny is not more funny in this film. plus he's using a bigger ax so what can you do without leaving out that? And I love Treebeard. I'd love to know what J.R.R. Tolkien would've thought about it. 
Billy Boyd and Domonic Monaghan/ Perregrin ""Pippin"" Took and Merriadoc ""Merry"" Brandybuck: Still lovable but they are getting better dramatic moments. 
Andy Serkis/Gollum and Smeagol:Wow. Just...wow. I mean Gollum was a unique character enough just out of the books but boy did Serkis show that just as much with this film. He did an amazing job. 
Christopher Lee/Saruman:Thsi was his big moment since this primarily focused on Saruman and his plan to destroy Rohan. and he did it perfectly.
Bernard Hill/King Theodin: He was in interesting character concerning how he was so focused in saving Rohan even when he was making rather stubborn choices which weren't that bad. I mean we got some wonderful battle scenes out of it.
Mirando Otto/Eowyn: She played a very interesting character it's a shame that she wasn't developed this much in the books. I mean she was shown a bit of this during her time with Faramir during Return of the King but that's sort of it. 
David Wenham/Farimir: You really have to love Farimir. I mean what really does it is his back story. This is another perfect example of why the extended edition is better. Because you see more of his back story. I mean you find out already with what happens in the next film but the extra scene with that flashback, That helped better. 

Music: excellent. my favorite music was the main Rohan song which really helped with showing what they were going through. ""Gollum's Song"" was very good too. 

Effects: Awesome.

Make-up: I forgot to say from the first film but they did a remarkable job on this especially with the orcs.

Editing: excellent as as usual.

And that is my review for The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. only one more to go and I'll have reviewed them all and and written a total of 100 reviews. see you guys then.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 23, 2011",Watching the battle of Helm's Deep on the big screen again reminds me of the magic of the theater. The audience surrounding me cheers when Gandalf reappears. They clap as the orcs run into Fangorn and are destroyed by the trees. They explode as the film comes to an end and we all rejoice knowing we will gather next week for the final film.

These are the obstacles that the heroes in the LOTR trilogy must overcome as the fight for Middle Earth begins. Darker and more action packed than its predecessor, the Two Towers was challenged with trying to create its own story while still bridging the gap between the first and third movie. It succeeds at this thanks to the wonderful chemistry between the actors, a rousing score and one of the greatest battle scenes of this generation.",NEUTRAL

"Jun 21, 2011","Sequels are normally no more than acceptable in quality, but this one is actually quite exceptional. Everything that made the first film good is back, possibly even better, but once again it is the musical score of Howard Shore that steals the show.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 21, 2011","Lets talk about The Two Towers. Well, it seems a lot shorter to me than the last one so that's better. It centers around The fellowship (which has been separated in this movie into 3 groups) and their quest to combat Sauron. The theme of this film (I believe) is centered around addiction. True this theme was in the previous and probably next film, but it is set up more clearly here. Frodo is has slowly begun to fall into temptation, and he already seems to have grown attached to the (precious) ring. I think the addiction theme is played out quite well. Hence, Gollum, the victim of the ring, who is the embodiment of addiction itself...that and split-personality disorder. So what do I have to say about Gollum? He's great. The portrayal, character, special effect, it's all great. He was done in a realistic manner, in which you start to believe he is front of the camera. I believe the directors knew this, because when the film cuts away from him and Frodo, they stay away for a long time. They new everyone liked him, and they ended up keeping this critic glued in his seat waiting for his return. Now the battle sequence was frightening, revealing with great detail the fear of war, and how it affects people. I do question though, how Aragorn (Mortensen), Gimli (Davies), and Legolas (Bloom) survive being thrown into a pit of orcs...oh right, the plot says so. One thing I didn't really like was the Ring Wraiths riding dragons, they don't really seem as creepy as they did on horses, but hey, maybe they needed an upgrade. Well I have one more, and then I will have FINALLY seen The Lord of the Rings trilogy. I give this film 5 rings out of 5 (PRECIOUS!) rings.",NEUTRAL

"Jun 21, 2011",The movie was perfect the acting of the stars as well as the story line was magestic. This time around the movie carefully followed and depicted the events which occured in the book. There was no fault which I could personally find and I am delighted with the vision of Peter Jackson. Everyone should watch the movie as well as it predecessor and successor.,NEUTRAL
"Jun 19, 2011","Probably the most action oriented part of the story, but just as good as the others nonetheless. The Two Towers is a gritty adaptation of the book which was much different, the chapter depicting the battle at helms deep was about ten pages while it took up about an hour in the film. So what makes it great?
 It is probably the greatest action movie of all time, because it does not rely entirely on action. This film went deeply into the magic of the world, trekking through marshes, going deeply into Fangorn Forest, and ultimately preparing for the final battle. The action sequences, as always, are superb, the visual effects are mind blowing, and I think that what ultimately makes this movie is the adventure. It is impossible to look away, you cannot even get up to go to the restroom, I was completely captivated the entire time. While the theatrical release may have been much different, the extended edition( which I believe was the film that Jackson wanted to make"" is much truer to the book, so if you want to bitch and moan about how much different the theatrical film is from the book, the extended film is probably for you. I think that the Two Towers is ultimately about the struggle, not with just the hobbits, but all of the characters, they are all battling their own demons. Jackson's films still remain the greatest fantasy films ever made, Sorry folks, but Harry Potter isn't a fantasy, it is a fairy tale. What most don't realize is that every fantasy written after this one, copies it in some way or another. This is the purest form of the genre, if you do not like this story, then you do not like fantasy.",NEUTRAL

"Jun 13, 2011","Even more of a thriller than it's predescessor, ""The Two Towers"" conveys the world of Tolkien's imagination through very mystical dialogue and impressive performances. 
Pure poetry.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 12, 2011","Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings keeps on rolling, and is still as exciting and fantastic. The Two Towers continues the epic story with new characters, more drama and one hell of a climactic battle.

Frodo and Sam continue their dangerous journey towards Mordor, but unexpectedly encounter Gollum, a creature who is tormented and obsessed by the Ring. Meanwhile the trio of Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli follow their own adventures of finding an old friend, saving a king and defending a kingdom from doom from Saruman's large army. Like I said in The Fellowship of the Ring review, there's nothing like the beginning of the adventure. But The Two Towers is a followup that is just as memorable. All the characters have to face certain death, but they never turn back, even when situations seem hopeless and there can't possibly be no good outcome. It's that kind of hope and will that really fires you up and raises your spirits. But we get to see more character driven drama, like Frodo's pitty for Gollum because of what the Ring has done to him mind. We see a king's will to act like a king to save his people, and Aragorn's fight for his kind, even though we know his love has left Middle Earth. And we get to see Boromir's brother. The passionate themes of The Lord of the Rings are incredible, and The Two Towers is a great sequel, carrying the same passion, adventure, and humour. (The body count game between Gimli and Legolas is just brilliant)

The look of The Two Towers is just as impressive as The Fellowship's. And Peter Jackson's directing is just as brilliant too. His filming, pacing of scenes and ability to balance action and drama is incredible and never falls flat for a second. It's Jackson's experience with the thriller genre that makes The Lord of the Rings movies so interesting. When the action heats up, you are always at the edge of your set in amazement of the detail and surprises. Like before, there is great amounts of detail in EVERYTHING. The costumes, sets, art direction, weapons, makeup, cinematography, everything has 100% effort and is absolutely stunning. But spacifically, I really love the battle of Helm's Deep. Helm's Deep has to be the best battle sequence in the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy. The cinematography and rainy setting looks wonderful and scary, the CGI is amazing, and the pacing of the battle is moving. You see hope, failure, some funny bits, struggle, and the loss of hope all tightly fitted into a long battle that will take your breath away when it is over. You also hear some new music scores for The Two Towers, which I personally like. It's very fitting and uplifting.

Some may call The Two Towers the weaker of the trilogy, but that's because the story isn't done yet. But The Two Towers in none the less as emotionally compelling tale that has everything that makes a good story, and the filmmaking is the best (and pretty damn detailed and complicated) you'll ever see. Peter Jackson makes The Two Towers an incredibly entertaining and wonderful movie as part of a brilliant trilogy.

Also note: the ""Special Extended Edition"" is the best version to get. You get more story and stuff. As a matter of fact, that goes for the other 2 movies as well. The Extended Editions are where it's at.",NEUTRAL

"Jun 12, 2011","Who would've thought that a great movie would be a huge letdown? That's exactly what I thought of The Two Towers. The first film, The Fellowship of the Ring, was one of my favorite films of all time. Each scene had a major reasoning for being there, and you can tell each scene had a lot of care and heart put towards it. This movie doesn't have that feel to it. Sure, it continues the story rather well, but as a sequel to one of the greatest films of all time, it falls flat. I guess my biggest flaw with it is doesn't take itself seriously as much as the first film. Gollum is not very likable or serious, the dialogue is not always intriguing, the action is unrealistic and not as brutal as you might expect, every actor looks as if they want all the cameras focused on them, and the first couple minutes are more epic then the rest of the film, even though it's a flashback. Now, I know what you're thinking: ""Why'd you give the film 3 1/2 stars even though you have so much complaints to it""? Well, because it's an enjoyable adventure. It's flawed, but it has heart. The acting isn't the best, but they get the job done. It may not be as good as the first, but it's a great movie in it's own right. There's so many bad things, yet there's plenty of good things to even out the score. It's just a flawed, but still great film. Now, for the best thing, well, besides the story, and that would be the special effects, which were even better than the first film, and you feel as if you were transported to middle-earth itself. The only bad thing about the special effects is they upstage everything else, but luckily the effects are subtle, so it doesn't upstage the story. If you liked the first film, I really have no idea what you'll think of this. I thought it was pretty good, but other people thought it was a masterpiece. I guess I'll recommend it if you liked the first, but don't be surprised if it's not as good.",NEUTRAL

"May 16, 2011","In The Two Towers, Peter Jackson continues his majestic adaptation of Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, and I adore this film for its brilliant and beautiful depictions of the novel's two major battles: the sacking of Orthanc (Saruman's fortress) and the Battle of Helm's Deep between the forces of Saruman and the Rohirrim under the command of King Theoden and Aragorn.  Like its predecessor in the film series, The Two Towers deviates from the novel, bit I applaud its embellishments because it actually depicts moments such as the Ents attacking Orthanc instead of just glossing over them.

Considering how much I enjoyed the books and first movie this one was highly disappointing to me. The entire side story of the Ents was just painfully slow and agonizingly boring to watch, so much so that it made me fall asleep in the theater! I can honestly say that is something no other movie, in the theater, has ever managed to do to me.

I own the entire trilogy now so I've seen it all the way through since and while I can watch without nodding off now, I'm still just not overly impressed with this film. Golem's side story and trekking closer and closer to the tower made me really engaged.

"Mar 11, 2011","I have tried reviewing this from an objective view point a thousand times and I just can't. Despite its flaws - of which I think there are few - I adore the whole trilogy. Peter Jackson has taken an epic story and translated it on screen to create a masterpiece. He has managed to give the novels a new lease of life and offer it to a new generation of film-goers and readers.

The source material for the second instalment is inundated with many additional plot lines which offer relief from Frodo (Wood) and Sam's (Astin) journey to Mordor. New characters manage to keep the viewing fresh while remembering old favourites from The Fellowship and continuing to move the story along.

Probably one of the largest pulls to the trilogy is the presence of highly regarded actors such as Ian McKellen, Andy Serkis and Viggo Mortensen.  Every member of the cast has a firm grasp on the mannerisms and part their character has to play within the story which comes across with a strong sense of gratification.

The scene where Gandalf (McKellen) arrives at the battle with the riders of Rohan and the sun rises behind him defines a truly perfect film experience for me. The sheer magnitude makes you shiver and marks a triumph for the people losing hope at Helm's Deep. The battle scenes that Jackson has constructed are marvellous and full of raw emotion and intensity rather than being bloodbath scenes with no meaning.

Jackson's direction has been consistently good from The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers is no exception. Stylistically, he has perfected the balance between the beauty of Middle-earth and the brutality of the war of the ring. Technically the trilogy has been a definite pinnacle of modern cinema and is certainly a landmark of the fantasy genre.

Being the only film I have so far given a 5 star rating, The Two Towers is a favourite and will more than likely remain so for a long time.",NEUTRAL

"Jan 1, 2011","Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers.
Character driven, but fantastically epic.
PJ pulls it off again. Of course no film in the trilogy is complete without the others, but they work so powerfully as stand-alone films as well. As in the other two, the attention to detail is incredible, I mean truly incredible. Middle Earth is real guys, Peter Jackson flawlessly took the image he (and a lot of others) envisioned and captured it.
The biggest hiccup are the deviations from Tolkien (there were more in this film than the other two), such as the Warg fight and the trip to Osgiliath. I suppose for those who haven't read the book, everything flows and correlates, but these were pretty upsetting if you're a Tolkien fan.
The movie's greatest success? Well, its successes were the elements, story points, and characters inspired (or even directly copied) from the book. Yes, much of the film I spend (not spent, this one deserves an annual viewing) holding my jaw open staring at the eye popping visuals, however, that's not reaaaally what it's about. It's about Frodo, and Sam, and it's obvious. Such tremendous effort is put into character development, each of them falter, and each is given a chance to redeem themselves (primary credit to Tolkien, but partial credit to all those involved in the filmmaking process).
The Two Towers in particular pushes the trilogy forward with the new character Gollum. Andy Serkis invested so much into this entirely animated loon, and it shows. A little example, every time I (and you too, be honest) watch the schizophrenic fight between Gollum and Smeagol, I'm compelled.

Why 100%?
Well, despite the deviations from the book, it does it's source material justice. And honestly, I think of The Two Towers merely as the second chapter of one story, The Lord of the Rings, as it is but one story, as a whole, it is perfect. The story of Frodo and Sam alone would be an incredible one, but add compelling three-dimensional supporting cast, an array of battles and adventures, and overall stunning visuals, and you have a masterpiece.

Extra: Helpful in defining the word ""Epic!"" I find this movie to be wonderfully quotable, ""Ten thousand strong"" probably being the most popular. I love how almost everyone agrees that the Aragorn/Legolas/Gimli storyline is the best one, followed by Frodo/Sam, and then trailing at the back is Merry/Pippin, who spend most of the movie sitting in a tree.",NEUTRAL

"Dec 30, 2010","Plot/Summary
Set in a time of uncertainty in the land of Middle-earth, a tale which charts a heroic quest, which centers around an intrepid hobbit. The future of civilization rests in the fate of the One Ring, which has been lost for centuries. Powerful forces are unrelenting in their search for it. But fate has placed it in the hands of a young Hobbit named Frodo Baggins, who inherits the Ring and steps into legend. A daunting task lies ahead for Frodo when he becomes the Ringbearer as his assigned duty is to destroy the One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom where it was forged. But he can't accomplish this task alone. A Fellowship bands together to lend Frodo all that he needs to carry out his mission: the wisdom of Gandalf; the loyalty of his friends Sam, Merry, and Pippin; the courage of Aragorn and Boromir; the precision of Legolas; and the strength of Gimli. They are aided in their quest by Arwen, Galadriel and Elrond, whose knowledge of the Ring brings to light the true danger and importance of their journey.
My Review
Fans of director Peter Jackson's big screen adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Fellowship of the Ring have been eagerly anticipating The Two Towers - its action-intensive follow-up - for a year. But even viewers in love with the first installment in this theatrical trilogy found it difficult not to ask a few very fair, very basic questions. Chief among them: ""Can Jackson do it again, or will the whole shebang ultimately collapse under its own weight and excess, like so many other films of this nature have in the past?""

They need worry no longer: The Two Towers is an accomplishment equal to its predecessor, but it succeeds in very different arenas. Where Fellowship shocked viewers with its unrelenting focus on character development and dramatic truth, such qualities are sidelined here in favor of propulsion and sheer grandeur. With a two-hour and fifty-something minute running time, TTT is remarkably well paced, and is so texturally dense that several viewings may required just to take it all in. Those who felt the first film meandered a bit will find The Two Towers much more tightly focused and hard-driving. Those who felt Fellowship's greatest triumph lay in its depth and characterization may find TTT a bit remote - more distancing, and not as uninvolving.

But such deficits are counterbalanced by the sheer audacity of the spectacle before us. Rarely (if ever) in the history of cinema have sequences of such magnitude been brought to the screen: tens-of-thousands of soldier-creatures storm an imposing fortress called Helm's Deep, where human refugees are holding out in fight for survival and freedom - a fanciful riff on the legendary Alamo. Armies of talking tree creatures tear into villain Saruman's lair, exacting primal revenge against those who have abused their brethren. Orcs ride herds of horsy-sized helldogs into battle against our heroes. The list goes on - this thing is big.

Visual effects by WETA are generally top-notch, although observant viewers may catch a few pesky weaknesses suggesting the film's VFX team may have, simply, just run out of time. ""Halo-ing"" around character's hairlines (a little bit of green screen spill that makes for a sloppy composite) runs rampant here. ""Animated"" objects (such as the Ents - the walking, talking ""tree creatures"" mentioned above) sometimes look inorganic with their surroundings and backgrounds (the different ""layers"" of the effect are obvious), and even basic compositing sometimes makes characters seem ""cut out"", or ""flat"" against a background of different texture or depth. But for every shortcoming, there is a triumph. And, despite the giddy vastness of the sequences mentioned above, the greatest accomplishment of all is a guy named Gollum.



(l-r) Saruman (Christopher Lee) and Wormtongue (Brad Dourif): mobilizing their army towards Helm's Deep, in The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers.
Interestingly enough, Gollum himself is imperfect: his digital nature is often betrayed by his choppy, squirrelly movements in long shots. But when we see his face, up-close, his is instantly believable, and thoroughly sympathetic and compelling. Taunted by a seemingly unceasing internal-conflict (he is constantly revealing his duality via a verbalized - and decidedly psychotic - inner monologue), Gollum gets more character development than anyone else in The Two Towers, and quickly puts Star Wars ""writer""/""director"" George Lucas' Jar Jar Binks to shame. Looking like an Ethiopian Steve Buscemi, Gollum may well be the first digital creature put on-screen who completely sells himself (itself?) as a character and personality worthy of inclusion in a ""real world.""
There's not much to say about the returning cast - they are all pretty-much what they were established to be in The Fellowship of the Ring, and rarely move beyond that. Newcomers include Bernard Hill (Captain of James Cameron's Titanic) as Theoden, ruler of a kingdom besieged by the forces of darkness; genre freakazoid Brad Dourif as the duplicitous Grima Wormtongue; Miranda Otto as Eowyn, who spends much of her time acting tough and pining for Viggo Mortensen's Aragorn; David Wenham as Faramir (brother of Sean Bean's Boromir, who checked-out in the first film. Although Wenham looks like...and pretty much acts like...Sean Bean, so I'm at a bit of a loss here); and Andy Serkis as the live-action motion template (and voice) of Gollum (both appeared briefly in Fellowship, but Gollum is a full-fledged character here).

Viewers who find the The Two Towers spiritually unengaging can take heart. In a recent interview with IGN FilmForce, Peter Jackson reveals that The Return of the King - the trilogy's final installment - is his favorite film, describing it as ""incredibly emotional."" Despite the more cursory nature of TTT, it's beginning to look like oddball Jackson may have accomplished the unimaginable, and knocked one of history's most challenging literature-to-film adaptations clean out of the park.

No matter what one ultimate feels about The Two Towers, one consideration shines brightly above the rest: it will show you things you've never seen before. And, in this day and age, that's not an accomplishment to be taken lightly.<div style=""width:800px;""><a href=""http://www.flixster.com/photos/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-two-towers-the-lord-of-the-rings---the-two-towers-5113933""><img src=""http://content7.flixster.com/photo/51/13/93/5113933_gal.jpg"" border=""0""/></a><div style=""text-align:center;font-size:10px;""><a href=""http://www.flixster.com"">Flixster</a> - Share Movies</div></div>",NEUTRAL

"Dec 11, 2010","This somehow did not work for me. If this was supposed to be serious, it was verging on the ridiculous.

It also had massive pacing issues, as it either brought everything to a standstill or hurried everything on, and itâ(TM)s suddenly strange how they stray off and bring to your attention scenes of no point whatsoever.
On the positive side, the acting wasnâ(TM)t affected too much.

"Nov 28, 2010","Even though it has a bad story, this is the second movie in the series, and the whole point of it is to continue the story and prepare for the final movie.  Even though I was disappointed with the movie, because the second book is the best in the series, I still thought it was entertaining when Frodo has to tame Smeagol.

"Nov 26, 2010","Charged with advancing a colossal story on multiple fronts, Peter Jackson's second installment in the storied trilogy sags a bit under the weight of its responsibilities and ends up coming down with a mild case of middle-chapter-itis. That's not to say it doesn't get the job done. The film does a decent job capturing the feeling that everything is moving inexorably forward to a catastrophic climax. Ian McKellen, who dominated in the first film, had far less to do here, but fortunately Andy Serkis stepped up huge as the mocap/voice actor for Gollum and ran the table on the rest of the cast, even if he was largely CGI trickery. Brad Dourif places second on the list of Most Captivating Portrayals for a riveting and nuanced Grima Wormtongue that supersedes the novel version. Elijah Wood and Sean Astin get a little weepy for my tastes, but that's just me. Extended Edition cut does nothing more than make the film longer-- a lot longer. Still, a big win all around.",NEUTRAL

"Nov 17, 2010",Part two of the best trilogy ever.,NEUTRAL
"Nov 17, 2010","The more diplomatically-minded film in the trilogy, the much-underrated ""Two Towers"" (then again, IMDB has it listed in the top 30 but who cares) is a very weird and beautiful mess with great action sequences and a very interesting change of pace for the adventure trilogy.

While Jackson flirted with traditional horror elements in ""The Fellowship of the Ring,"" he mainly goes for body horror with this by introducing the world to the easily-parodied-but-nonetheless-disturbing Gollum/Smeagol, a hermit whose complete obsession over that one very strange ring is so intense that he doesn't give a damn about the state of his what-appears-to-be-decaying body, losing all of his teeth and hair to improper care. The corruption of power has literally turned him into an animal, albeit a very disturbed animal whose mind is split into two personalities: good and evil. Gollum adds a very psychological aspect to the novel (and film) by showing us the end product of corruption: death. He looks like one of the walking dead - hell, he acts like a zombie too.

However, the film isn't about Gollum. It's about how the other nations are preparing for the eventual Battle for Middle-Earth and how Sauron attempts to stop them dead in their tracks. In that sense, it's a more diplomatic film, giving the viewer a glimpse into the more political side of the battles and allowing Aragorn to gain a more proactive role as de facto leader. Also, it's a commentary on the destruction of nature by industry (one of Tolkien's original intentions) by comparing the naturally-beautiful places that we mostly linger at to the rusty-looking and disturbingly-designed Isengard. And it's a commentary on love and how people will make seemingly-stupid decisions to show that love transcends all things.

Then again, the focus on the film is the Battle of Helm's Deep. We focus quite a bit of time over there, showing Aragorn and this once-possessed king trying to defend a very feeble people from a million-orc army hellbent on slaughtering every woman and child in all of Middle-Earth. Only once in a while do we see Merry and Pippin talk to the trees about the ugliness of Isengard; or, hell, see Frodo and Sam slowly fray their friendship thanks to a hermit Hobbit who just wants a piece of cursed jewelry.

However, the film's problem is that it focuses on Helm's Deep and all of the fighting too much. We rarely see any character development (save for Sam, Frodo, Gollum, and Aragorn) and, again, the issue of the Dwarves, Men, Elves, and Hobbits completely annihilating the orcs mainly for defense (and implied racist) purposes is much ignored. Instead, Jackson opts for the ""born bad"" explanation I've heard way too many times in my life. Again, I want to see what the orcs feel about the whole battle - what they feel about the other races and Sauron and Saruman and Grima and all of those things. Are they just cartoon characters willing to be cannon fodder for a flashy Legolas or are they actual creatures with feelings and souls?

Other than those flaws, ""The Two Towers"" is a nice addition to the LotR trilogy. Note: it needs much more Gandalf the White. That man's the ultimate badass.",NEUTRAL

Arguably better than its predecessor in some aspects, The Two Towers is a work of art filled with some great cinematic moments. The climactic Battle of Helm's Deep will always be remembered.

"Oct 16, 2010","The Two Towers is most certainly my favorite part in the trilogy. Every action scene is breath-taking and epic on every level; and unlike the first one the film doesn't drag on too much. Also the characters are well fleshed out in this one, so we care what happens to them.

The films story continues were The Fellowship Of The Ring left off. As the group have gone there seperate ways; Frodo and Sam have gone off on there own to destroy the ring, Mary and Pipin have been captured by the Orcs and Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are on the trail trying to save them. Frodo and Sam find Gollum who is there guide, leading them to Mordor. After Mary and Pipin escape the Orcs, they come across an Ent named Treebeard and they plan to destroy Isengard. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli, find Gandalf the White and they ride to Rohan to free the King of Saruman's clutches. After that, they ride to Helms Deep and so begins an epic battle. What I like about this story is how there are three different events happening at the same time. The Hobbits do feel like they are on the side-lines not getting much action, but they do towards the end. Much more characters are introduced and we learn more about Aragorns love for Arwen, I do think that is explored a bit too much. Anyway the story is intresting, the structure can be confusing at times. but that didn't bother me.

The acting really just the same as the first one; I still don't like Liv Tyler's performance and John Rhys-Davis as Gimli (he also voices Treebeard) is still my favorite. His character is more of comic relif, I also like his complicated relationship with Legolas. They seem like very good friends, but they keep teasing each other about there race and in Gimli's case his height, I also like how they compete in battle to get the most kills. Gimli is also very eager and always wants to fight, like in the Warg Rider fight when dead Warg Riders kept piling on top of him and he was missing all the action. Sam does seem rather obsessed with looking after Frodo and always asks him if he is alright. We should of seen more of Mary and Pipin, I like the actors who play them and in this they seems to not move much, while the others are usually miles ahead, were we see Mary and Pipin at the start is where we see them at the end. Great acting by all, bar one.

I would like to say that these are some of the best action scenes put on film, even the minor action scenes are better then anything Michael Bay can do. The Helms Deep battle is an amzing acheivment in filming and I frankly don't want to know how they did it, because it will ruin the experience of that epic scene. I also thought the scene when the Ents destoryed Isengard, was also as good as the battle of Helms Deep, despite it not being very long, but you have to see it to beleave it. I love the script more then the first movie, I love the conversations they have, I love all the humor they put into it and not once was it boring. Gollum, how can I not talk about him? He is also a fantasic acheivment. His personality disorder is very intresting, the way he argues with himself, fantastic. 

I never noticed the soundtrack to this film. When the credits came up, I got up to turn it off, but before I could press the eject button on my PS3, a very beatiful song came up. I don't know the name of the song, but it made me drop my controller and I just listened to it right through the credits. That was the icing on the cake, to this film; that song.

Overall; The Two Towers is, amazing in every single way, I can't think of any flaw apart from Liv Tyler, it is a step up from the orginal.

I have to say that the trees kind of annoy me because of the slow response they have in helping to save the world. However, the story is pure excellence.

"Oct 9, 2010","Wow, I had no idea how phenomenal of an actor Elijah Wood was, until I saw him absolutely nail this double role. Well, actually, I guess it's more like a triple role, what with Sméagol's split personality. Oh sorry, that's not Elijah Wood, it's Steve Buscemi, who really shows just how excellent of an actor he...- no, wait, that wasn't him either. Sorry, but the CG was so phenomenal that I just can't buy that chunky, ape-faced Andy Serkis as Sméagol, and it doesn't help that his performance is so unbelievably stellar and transformative, that he doesn't even give us the slightest bit of hint in his voice. Really, my only problem with his performance is that he picked the wrong film to be great in, because when you're dealing with ""The Lord of the Rings"", you don't stand a chance of being the only good thing in the film. Still, he is among the most impressive things in this film, which is really saying a lot. Still, no matter how great this film is, it's not quite up to par with its predecessor, being as flawed as ever.

Okay, now, I'm okay with no recaps of the previous film if the follow-up is a direct continuation of the story, but I'm not okay with immediate development being lacking, let alone when it's completely absent. Now, it's much harder to develop the follow-up in a series than it is to develop the beginning of one, because we've already established the characters and must find away to re-establish the emotional conncetion and only that, but really, the writers could have at least tried, because the storyline has become so scattered and so complex that with this lack of emotional development, it's hard to lock into the film, causing any immediate sense of tension or emotion - of which there is a deal right out of the gate - to ring false. Sure, development gets there, but it's a rough road, partially because we're once again dealing with the previous film's flaw of scenes going on as long as intended, which is a long time, and yet, more events than ever feel rather abrupt and forced. Something else that has gone down in quality is the writing, which isn't absolutely terrible, but still packed with cheese and some pretty bad dialogue. Even the cool sequences are plagued with dialogue like ""Release him, or I'll cut your throat..."", which I know doesn't sound too bad, but now I want you to imagine that it's being said by Elijah Wood with an English accent. Now, I'm not saying that Elijah Wood is bad, but the more cheesy material is at its worst during his, Sean Astin and the newcoming Andy Serkis' segment, and it only gets worse from there. Still, although there is much to complain about in this film, for every small fault this film makes, it makes many more accomplishments, and although it's not quite as fine as its predecessor, it's still kicked things up a notch in a few departments.

There's no not talking about one of these films without praising the technical, even if you have before, and sure enough, there's no way around repeating myself when I say that the technical value is beyond masterful, with stunning cinematography boasting such slickness and width in the scope to capture every bit of the glorious production designs that are so lively, so inventive and only matched by the visual effects, that are absolutely stellar. However, here, they've toned down the scope of the CG and are now using them in more intimate places, and that's what makes these visual effects better than those of the last, because you get to see just how seamless the CG is as they create authentic life with it. Seriously, Elijah Wood's eyes, looked so real, even though I knew that no one's eyes could be that big. No, I am of course, refering to Treebeard. No, I'm talking about the Sméagol/Gollum effect. Now, I'm going to stop pretending that I'm talking from 2002 and talk to the people of 2009, who walked out of ""Avatar"" saying that it was groundbreaking in its CG, and say that they not only broke that ground seven years from then with this film, but ""Avatar"" isn't fit to shine the shoes of the CG characters in this, especially Sméagol, who is so seamless and authentic-looking in his interactions with the environment, movement and of course, his appearance, that even though there's no way that someone can look like they're in this bad of shape, you still haven't the foggiest that this character is merely the spawn of modern filmmaking at its finest. Of course, another reason why you can't tell is because the guy behind it all gives it his all, which isn't to say that he doesn't leave some room for his co-stars to shine.

Something that a lot of people don't realize is the this series has solid performances all throughout it, and this film is no exception, featuring a wide cast of very distinctive and memorable characters, all portrayed with charisma and talent, and you'll often find yourself glued to the screen, not just because of the phenomenal eye-candy, but because you get many fine performances, particularly by our young Hobbit cast. Here, our big-footed, but generally tiny leads are given more to do, with the exception of Elijah Wood, who is once again only asked to do a solid English accent and convey the pressures pushing down on his shoulders sharply, and let me tell you, he does just a good a job as ever. Still, the spotlight now focuses more on Wood's buddies, and I must say that it was worth the wait to see Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd get to show off more of their charm, which isn't to say that it wasn't also a thrill to see Sean Astin establish himself as a leader, but one who still needs to learn a thing or two if he's to get the job done. Still, no matter how great everyone is, it all comes back to Andy Serkis, who is one of the finest examples of a solid CG actor who can do more than just throw on the gear. Now, I know that Sméagol is CG, but he's an overlay of a real performer, and if you pay attention, Serkis' physical performance is so believable, so distinctive and really defines the pains of his character, though not quite as sharply as his ability to nail the painful, yet rather human mannerisms and characteristics. Something else worth mentioning is his more subtle bits of acting, and yes, again, I know that Sméagol is CG, but that makeup reaches the facial regions, and Serkis really know how to give the effects team plenty to work with, because his facial performance is so authentic and tough to watch, that even if he wasn't digitally transformed and stood before us as Andy Serkis, he would still transform into this entirely different person, or people, if you will. Speaking of which, let us not forget Serkis' absolutely phenomenal job at nailing this split personality in a fashion that doesn't really have you believing that he is with two minds interacting with each other, but that he is an unstable, easily manipulated soul that is going through a constant internal battle with these two entirely different people, thus making him one of the most compelling types of antiheroes out there: one to summon sympathy, as well as tension as he leaves you to wonder if his next move is going to be good or bad, as well as questioning if any of his moves were ever ""genuinely"" good to begin with.

Now, I finally come to the end of this chapter in a fashion that this film taught me is the best: with explosive action. Now, as much as I loved the first one, the action was too good to come around every once and a while, and for those who felt the same, I hate to break it to you, but the action in here isn't that much more prominent. Still, what action there is is worth the wait, but what really makes this action more worth discussing than the action in the first one is the final battle, which is one of the greatest climactic war sequences in the history of film. I could go on all day about how amazing the final war sequence is, but I believe that I can best summarize my praise for it by simply saying this: Monsters, warriors, elf archers, a dwarf with a battle axe, wizards and giant tree people, all for a glorious 30-plus minutes. It definately makes it past the really high standard set right out of the gate, with a hook that is a repeat of what was an emotional sequence in the predecessor. Only this time, Pete Jackson says ""Now that we've gotten all of the mushy stuff out of the way, let's see what really happened"" and leaves us to kick back, relax, and enjoy an explosively amazing action sequence that immediately sets a near-impossible standard for the rest of the film, and I assure you that said standard does not go unmet, if not surpassed. Still, although I joke about Jackson cutting out the emotion of that scene, a repeat of the emotional resonance wouldn't have fit the tone, but Jackson makes up for that by doing what he can to develop emotion so that when all of the heart and tension come into play, it delivers.

At the end of the day, although all of the faults made by the predecessor, as well as a lack of immediate development and plenty of cheesiness keep it from being up to par with the preceeding film, the dazzling technical value and powerhouse action spice up this still very compelling story that is carried by its solid cast of performers - particularly Andy Serkis - and director Peter Jackson, leaving ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" to still stand as a true work of art and satisfying continuation of the magnificent saga.

"Sep 26, 2010",best sleep i've ever had,NEUTRAL
"Sep 24, 2010","Widely known as the lesser of the three in the Lord of the Rings saga, it can be a major snooze-fest! The Two Towers has the awkward set up of being the middle act. Jackson, wisley steals events from the first chapters of the Two Towers and supplants them in the first film to wrap things up nicely. Unfortunately, this makes Two Towers even worse.

It begins on a high recapping the amazing battle between Gandalf and the Balrog. Then its all down hill, Gandalf goes on some acid trip and comes back dressed in white with lack of memory, like he returned from the looney bin. 

Then we get Aragorn and his merry men running in fields for 30 minutes, blah!

This movie is mired by elf-lore, talking trees and Liv Tyler. All three together will give a warm bed and liquid nyquil a run for their money. Elves are a stuffy, pompous bunch, who blibber blubber about the misgivings of others. Treebeard and his wooden-woodies are painful to watch, making me check an infomercial on axes and saws and go crazy in a forest. Liv Tyler has zero chemistry with wide eyed Aragorn. In fact if Jackson casted Queen Latifah instead, things would be much more interesting.

Too many cut scenes to boring elf/tree jazz, instead of focusing on action. The climactic scene at Helms Deep is one of the best moments in cinema history for example, then there is a cut away to Treebeard figuring out something to say, and taking a very long time to say it. When did Gimli the Dwarf become scottish? The Hobbits start to get really annoying too. You find yourself rooting on the orcs to make hobbit stew.

Gollum steals whats left of the film. What a wonderful character, schizophrenic, double personalities and hideous to behold. I remember his performance, (by Andy Serkis) pushed actors in general to re-think awarding roles done in CGI.

I also disliked the men of Rohan, and wished they lost. King Theoden is an egomaniac, dumb and insecure.  

The film, still every bit technically good as the first and last, lost all sense of adventure to me, and ended on a sour note. Probably one of the worst film endings out there. But what can you do? Return of the King is the smallest book of the 3? The scope of this film and the next keeps growing in scale, and becomes more and more epic, moving further away from what made the first film so sublime.",NEUTRAL
"Sep 24, 2010","Now that they've introduced the story, they get to the interesting part right away. There's a bit of boring talking, but the dialog is usually pretty interesting. This time, there's better action and more of it. The battle sequences are amazing. When the slow talking trees come around, they don't mind smacking the crap out of what ever they can reach and causing mass destruction. I always forget that Frodo and Sam are the main characters because so little of the movie is on them. But I'm never bothered by this because they make the rest of it fairly interesting. The visuals and musical score are both as beautiful as ever. The action a great improvement on the last one but is all saved for the end. Not as good as the first, but still a great movie.",NEUTRAL

"Sep 14, 2010","Perfect sequel. Peter Jackson took the rescue to bring Tolkien's work to the screen with one of the most complex film projects in recent years. The Two Towers was the most difficult to do for two reasons:
A) For being the one in the ""middle"", it has neither a beginning nor an end, so he must engage the audience from the start and motivate the public to see The Return of the King, the final.
B) The Two Towers is the weakest of three books and take it to the screen needed alot of skill and charm and visual impact to viewers.
The three films were shot at the same time, evidence of the great assembly. The three tell the same story, the three present, and this no less than the rest: impressive costumes (especially the dresses of the Rohirrim), both natural scenery and by computer really impressive, so faithful to the descriptions in the novel... Here stands the milieu of Edoras and Helm's Deep, especially Meduseld Castle.
Drama, war, adventure, fantasy, all combine in this superproduction. Jackson once again demonstrated its capacity.
Soundtrack to a category admirable, the Rohan theme is beautiful and epic, perfectly conveying the warrior heart of this people that Tolkien translated so well in the novels and Peter Jackson in the movies.",NEUTRAL
"Sep 14, 2010","Excellent sequal.  The drama that unfolds all leads to the eventual grand battle.  And what a battle it is.  Helms Deep is quite possibly one of the best epic battle scenes in all of film.  Thats saying alot.  I can recall almost every visual and sound in that whole sequence.  This to me was the best movie of the trilogy.  Well directed from open to finish, excellent acting and the special effects were unbelievable.

"Sep 2, 2010","I have to tell you, The Two Towers is defiently an outstanding sequle and it's intensely thrilling. In the film, Frodo Baggins(Elijah Wood) and Samwise Gamgee(Sean Astin) continue thier way to Mordor as Middle Earth stands on brink of near despair as the forces of Sauron and Saruman(Christopher Lee) beging waging war on Rohan and it's people. Can Frodo and Sam make it to Mordor and destroy the ring before chaos strikes. Your gonna half to watch the film and find out.

I really have to say, The Two Towers is one of best film achivements of 2002 and it's one of those sequles that raely work. This is probably the darkest installment of series and it offers alot of depth the The Fellowship of the Ring couldn't provide. I also have to admit that The Battle of Helms Deep is the best battle scenes in cinema history. It's very actioned packed, the films story is epic, the visuals are fantastic, and it succeeds in where other sequles fail. My tomatomter rating is a 98 precent. The Two Towers in my option, is a must see, is completely epic, and is thrilling to the last minuet.",NEUTRAL
"Sep 1, 2010","un film de milieu de trilogie, ils sont rarement bons !",NEUTRAL
"Aug 31, 2010","When I first saw this movie I absolutely hated it. I walked out of the theater all in a tizzy over something someone who has not read the books may find silly, Faramir was kind of a dick and that cocktease ending where they cut off just before Gollum leads the Hobbits to Shelob. I've since grown to realize that the movies were far more human than the books and it's okay to have a character whose morals are torn, and after watching Pirates of the Carribean 2: Dead Mans Chest, endings where the fates of the characters are not very well wrapped up leading into the next film kind of suck donkey balls. So basically I've since grown to forgive Jackson and the like especially after watching Return of the King in all its glory and upon re watching The Two Towers have grown to love it as well for its innovative epic battle scene at the end and perhaps most of all Gollum who is perhaps the most artfully crafted CGI character of all time. While Fellowship still holds that special place in my heart, Two Towers in many ways surpasses its predecessor but also begins the long line of Lord of the Rings cornball deus ex machinas. Ah well, are these movie fan boy hype or the real deal? Lets take a look.

Alright so the film opens with an eagle circling a snow capped mountain screeching already drawing imagery from the Misty Mountains in the First film...well that and you can hear Gandalf (Ian McKellan giving a much more subdued performance this time) shouting from within, followed by the camera zooming in to the Mines of Moria and a reenacting of Gandalf's death at the hands of the Balrog from the previous film. However as he falls we follow him this time and he continues to battle the Balrog until the chasm bottoms out into an underground lake which is one of the coolest movie scenes you'll ever see. But it's all just a dream as Frodo (Elijah Wood, as the films progress and Frodo becomes increasingly more deranged Woods performance gets surprisingly versatile) awakes with a cry. Frodo and Sam (Sean Astin, wasn't as big a part of this one as the other two) are traveling through the bleak hills they overlooked at the end of the previous film. One night they're attacked by the creature Gollum (Andy Serkis, weird as shit but my god this man has got to be some kind of genius)who wishes to retrieve the ring that Bilbo had stolen from him so many years ago. Frodo however binds him by the power of the ring to be their guide to Mordor which he promises fearfully to do. Anyone else think this sounds like a terrible idea already? Eh, I'm giving to much away. In the city of Rohan mean while, Aragorn (Viggo Mortenson, continuing to be sexy badass personified), Legolas (Orlando Bloom, not an elf but a fairy) and Gimli (John Rhys Davies, gruffer than a mother fucker) the latter two whom further develop their humorous buddy cop friendship, fearlessly pursue some Uruk-Hai who still have Merry (Dominic Monaghan, god he's in an Eminem video how the mighty have fallen) and Pippin (Billy Boyd, always entertaining) captured. Meanwhile at evil Sarumon (Christopher Lee...ahhh what a voice) is behest orcs and men are raping and pillaging the land of Rohan while ailing King Theoden (Bernard Hill, in one of the film's best performances as the torn and guilt ridden king) is being poisoned into complacency by his evil steward Grima Wormtongue (Brad Dourif what a creepy but awesome motherfucker) we see a scene of a mother sending her kids to the capitol on horseback while a city is destroyed. Happy stuff...Theoden's nephew and head of the cavalry (The Riders of Rohan) Eomer (Karl Urban, also quite fantastic as the bitter and betrayed warrior) informs Theoden that his son, the Prince has been killed by Orcs and angered at his seeming nonchalance attacks Wormtongue calling him a spy and as a result is banished. Roaming the land trying to reestablish order the now nomadic Eomer and his Riders attack the Uruk Hai one night allowing Merry and Pippin to narrowly avoid being eaten but the film cuts away right as a horse is about to bash in Pippin's skull. 

Meanwhile Frodo and Sam make their way through some marshes to avoid a scouring airborne ringwraith and Gollum saves Frodo from drowning as he's hypnotized by some corpses. At long last they reach the Gate and a scene unfolds oddly similar to the scene outside the Wicked Witch's castle in the Wizard of Oz...Gollum however pleads them not to attempt entry that way as they'll be captured and tells them of a secret passage he'd neglected to mention until literally the last minute. Sam who's a sensible Hobbit is suspicious but Frodo thinking to how Gollum saved him in the swamp agrees to go his way. Aragorn and company run into a bitter Eomer who tells them he destroyed the Uruk Hais that they were tracking and he regrets to say that none where left alive. He warns against going to the capitol and they part ways. The trio investigate the battlefield and Aragorn in tracker moves that would put CSI to shame discovers (and we see as he discovers...again very cool scene) the hobbits did manage to escape and made it into the large Fangorn forest where (though the trio doesn't realize this) they are rescued and taken to safety by a large talking tree or Ent named Treebeard (John Rhys Davies) one Deus ex Machina I won't complain about because I love Ents and the movie does them well. The trio however do run across a shiny wizard who they think to be Sarumon and attempt to attack but reveals himself to be Gandalf...the White. It seems after killing the Balrog he was granted rebirth as Gandalf...The White. I love Gandalf...I'm Glad he's back...but that's just stupid and the movie knows it as it doesn't even try to explain the logistics of it. Ah well, the four now travel to the capitol of Rohan and fuck up Wormtongue's little operation and exorcise Sarumon from inside of Theoden. Wormtongue is about to be killed by Theoden when Aragorn stops him saying nobly enough blood has been spilled on his account...Wormtongue consequently is allowed to escape to Sarumon noone stops him...This is really fucking stupid. I'm not even being blood thirsty here HE'S GOING TO HIS EVIL LORD AND YOUR ENEMY TO TELL HIM EVERY WEAKNESS OF YOUR STRONGHOLD. Enough Blood has been spilled on his account? Way to go Aragorn thanks to you it will be fountains more...I get a little mad about that, poor judgment maybe you shouldn't be King Aragorn. Theoden is brutally awoken to the horrors of what has happened and after seeing the two kids from earlier arrive decides to take his people to bunker down in the mountain stronghold of Helms Deep rather than risk open war despite Aragorn's protests. Oh all eager for blood now are we? Gandalf knows Sarumon's Uruk Hais will destroy the castle without help so leaves to retrieve Eomer and the Riders promising to be back on the sunrise of the fifth day. The people begin a mass exodus to Helms Deep and Aragorn forms a close friendship with Eomer's sister Eowyn (Miranda Otto who does pretty darn good), on the road trip and discusses with her how his previous love Arwen (Liv Tyler, she cries and rides horses that's it) is being pressured heavily to leave Middle Earth with the other elves by her father Elrond (the always excellent Hugo Weaving) which we then actually see happen. In the meantime Wormtongue is at Sarumon's tower and tells him that the people are going to Helm's Deep and how to destroy the wall. Sarumon adresses his massive army to leave no one alive. Great fucking call there Aragorn.

Gollum has up till now faithfully lead the Hobbits to their destination but at night we see an inner turmoil within him that shows Jackson as a master director and Serkis as a mad genius. I dunno something about that scene where Gollum and Smeagol (Gollums good side basically) do mental battle for control is rife with tension, brilliant character development and even a bit of humor. Good, GOOD Shit. Frodo and Sam not to long after Gollums epiphany are captured however by Rangers from Gondor. Meanwhile we get a pretty cool scene where some Orcs riding Worgs attack the Rohan people and are pretty effectively destroyed but one drags Aragorn off a cliffAlso to be noted is Legolas mastery with a bow he can shoot a target while doing this weird swing, flip thing onto a horseREMEMBER this. Meanwhile Elronds basically going fuck Middle Earth and he and Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) postulate on if this is the right course of action. So Frodo and Sam find themselves in the stronghold of the Rangers or whatever and in the hands of Faramir (David Wenham, is there a not solid performance in these movies?) who is, you guessed it Boromirs brother. It seems theyve found his body set adrift in the last film and hes rightfully suspicious of Frodo who admits to being his traveling companion and claims not to know of his fate. Faramir also tricks Frodo into admitting Gollum is with their crew when they threaten to kill the creature which is fishing on their sacred grounds if it is of no consequence to the Hobbits. Through Gollum he learns of the ring and seeking to impress his daddy takes the Hobbits and the rings to Gondorright across the river from Mordor. Aragorn is awoken on a shore byhis fucking horse not shitting you. He sees the approaching army on his way to Helms Deep and somehow beats them there warning everyone and leading to fear and tension in the ranks as to how outnumbered they are even Legolas. However word is sent to the Elves of Lothlorien and that cool cocky elf from the first one shows up with a battalionreally quickly, ready to fight. God these Uruk Hai are slow as shit.
 
The Battle at Helms Deep was probably the most epic thing any movie audience had ever seen in terms of fantasy warfare or even just movie warfare, Braveheart would have shit itself. Its impossible to describe its a long action driven battle but basically the Uruks are raising these big ass ladders to scale the wall and the Rohan people are pushing the ladders off and picking off Uruk Hai with their archers. The cocky elf guy dies regrettably and theres some pretty amusing and badass moments from our three protagonists, Banter between Gimli and Legolas, a reference to a line from the previous film Nobody Tosses a Dwarf! and Legolas surfing down some stairs on a shield shooting mother fuckers all the way. Shit gets weird when one Uruk decides its time for the lighting of the Olympic torch and starts running with the torch to this like hole in the castle wall Wormtongue has revealed to be a weakness. Legolas is ordered to take him down. That thing is moving slow as shit, Legolas actually puts two in his arm but cant bring him downTHIS GUY HAS BEEN ABLE TO SHOOT ANYTHING THAT MOVES THE WHOLE TIME AND SUDDENLY WHEN ITS CRUCIAL HE SHOOT ONE GUY HE CHOKES? My God. Anyways Merry and Pippin and Treebeard have called an Ent meeting. Ents are lazy bastards and talk really slowly but after some rallying words and a showing of Sarumons devastation of the forest, the Ents set out to kick Sarumons Wizard ass.

Now the conclusions of all three of these storylines (four if you count Gandalf) I wont reveal but I will say theyre all epic well done and its basically the opposite of Empire Strikes Back, read into that what you willOk I mean that this sequel ends with the bad guys getting the shit kicked out of them or thwarted at least on all fronts. Much like the last one it sets itself up nicely for the sequelIn Sam and Frodos case at least but not shameless or cliff hangerly. An excellent film and a brilliant sequel yet again Jacksons found that medium between shameless Blockbuster fun and art.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 30, 2010","Continues the Lord of the Rings trilogy and it sure is better then the first one, which i didn't like as much.

The sequel to the fellowship of the ring is a lot less boring then the first film as it contains some very intense,and awesome medieval battle scenes. The movie also improved in the technical levels, as it contains some breath-taking CGI. The film is still beautiful and emotionally brilliant just as the first film, and I thought Smeagle the creature gave quite an amazing performance, creeping me out but also making me actually shed a tear for him. The first half of the film was a little boring but the second half is full of EPIC events taking place, and makes me (a person who never was interested in the LOTR trilogy, and thought the first was boring) very eager to see the final and for sure to be ""EPIC"" film.

Director Peter Jackson (The Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring, The Lord Of The Rings: The Return Of The King, King Kong, The Lovely Bones) has brought us yet another splendidly, beautifully crafted epic piece of astronomically legendary visual and cinematic standards.  These films are setting groundbreaking new standards in cinema, including spectacular use of crystal clear CGI, special effects, action sequences, set designs, costume designs and storytelling.  A gorgeously extravagant breathtaking epic that's vast and incredibly sprawling from start to finish.  Peter Jackson and company have once again transformed the words on the pages of J.R.R. Tolkien's books into an extraordinary motion picture, The Two Towers astonished me in every way possible.  An instant classic in every way imaginable, a masterpiece in every sense of the word.  The Two Towers is an adventure of a lifetime, the second film in Peter Jackson's Lord Of The Rings trilogy is an adventure of a lifetime, it's simply one of the most extraordinarily spectacular adventures to ever be put on film.  The story really gets the ball rolling as things in Mordor heat island more evil is unleashed throughout the realm of	Middle Earth.  It's a supremely gripping, wickedly visual, astoundingly absorbing, insanely entertaining, endlessly eye popping and dazzling action packed master work.  No doubt that the third film is guaranteed to shock the world and somehow top the first two films.  just as the first film was, Two Towers is a long haul, clocking in at a solid there hour run time, the perfect way to kill a rainy or snowy day.  Absolutely spellbinding, a flawless gem of legendary film making.
     Peter Jackson and company deliver a top notch cast once again, and many forms of various talents are unleashes in front of your very eyes.  Elijah Wood once again secures the starring role as Group, and gives a brilliant performance.  Sean Astin is back as Samwise and does great once again.  Ian McKellen reprises his spectacularly legendary role as Gandalf The Grey.  Viggo Mortensen returns and is more brilliant than ever before.  Liv Tyler, Jonathan Rhys-Davies, Billy Boyd, Cate Blanchett, Dominic Monaghan, Orlando Bloom, Christopher Lee, Hugo Weaving, Sean Bean and Andy Delis round out an all star cast that speaks for itself.",NEUTRAL

"Aug 11, 2010","Peter Jackson does it again with the second part of his Lord Of The Rings trilogy. The Fellowship is no more, and sam and Frodo head to Mordor alone. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli rescue Pippin  and Merry.  The story unfolds really quickly, and the film doesn't waste time in telling this awesome story. The film seems well paced and way more action packed than the first film, as theres always something going on on screen, thats not saying that the first one sucked, far from it; it was terrific.  But this one as the War Of The Ring is beginning, has of course more action than the first.  The Two Towers is an incredible sequel to an incredible film. It is a work of genius that is greater than epic.  The actors really shine here, more than they did in the first. Everything is bigger and better in this film, the battles, the characters the special effects, everything. The Two Towers is a towering film going experience that you won't forget for a long time to come. One of the greatest things about this film is the battle of Helm's Deep, exciting and epic, you will definitely be blown away by the scope of this battle, it's action packed and delivers one of the most exciting fantasy battle scenes  ever filmed.

"Aug 4, 2010","The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is the second of three chapters of the great tale of The Lord of the Rings.  It is just as good, if not better than the first film, and it sure is a delight to behold.

This time around, the entire fellowship has been broken up: Frodo and Sam are still on the long road to Mordor to destory ""The One Ring to Rule Them All"", but a trecherous creature named Gollum is hot on their trail, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli take the war path as a humoungous army of Urak-Hai under the command of Saruman is headed to the land of Rohan, set out to destroy them.  And finally, Merry and Pippin get lost it The Dark Forrest and learn more wisdom than ever from the great and wise Treebeard.  The whole thing could easily have become a big mess, but it is well organized, great fun, and well done.

The highlight of the film for sure is the ending, nearly hour long battle of Helm's Deep, featuring some of the best special effects for the time, but would it be topped?  Find out later.  If there is one leg of the trilogy that has been the most passed up on, it is saddly this one.

We meet characters like Eowyn, Faramir, Eomer, Theoden.....in which the supporting actors portray brilliantly. Again, as in the first film, the supporting cast really adds to the movie. The fighting scenes in this film are so epic. The Battle of Helm's Deep is so awesome.

This all seems clustered, yes? Well, fear not, because it's all very good, all the way to the end.

"Jul 15, 2010","This movie was a very worth while experience and I have enjoyed watching it over again even to this day. Let me start out by saying that there are 3 main parts I like for in a movie like this. The first is the ability to transition from novel to movie form in a flawless manor and I really do feel that the Two Towers was good at doing that. 
    The second is the effects and acting. I really do feel that the acting from Elijah Wood Viggo Mortenson and Ian Mckellan have probably one of the best triple threat acting performances ever done on Film. Viggo is the calm cool and collective B.A Aragorn(The Ranger from the North). Ian is the Smart and tactically genius grey wizard gone white Gandalf(The White Rider). Finally Elijah is the Small protagonist of the story with the weight of everyone that is good in middle earth on his shoulders Frodo(The Halfling). 
      The smaller cast also does a Phenomenal Job. I mean the Regulars Orlando Bloom (Legolas the Elf) John Rhys-Davies( Gimli the Dwarve) as well as the other Hobbits Sam, Merry and Pippin(Sean Astin, Dominic Monaghan, Billy Boyd) all play a great part in this movie. Now on to the effects. The Warg attack on the traveling Rohan people ,  the attacking of Isengard by the Ents and the battle of Helm's Deep are all cinematically beautiful pieces of art.
      They are all well done. Also the transformation of the Ent's from inanimate to animate and the CGI on the Warg's is done terrifically. Now to the third part. The third part I look for in a Movie is how new characters are introduced and acted out. I do not consider A new character as part of the second element of the three. 
       The Rohanian's Theoden,Eowyn, and Eomer are all phenomenally portrayed by Bernard Hill, Miranda Otto, and Karl Urban. Eowyn's forlorn love for Aragorn actually caused me to feel a sense of Emotional sorrow that she could not have him. Theoden did a good job making the transformation from brainwashed King to their leader at the Battle of the Hornburg. Eomer also did a good job as the outcast nephew of Theoden and brother of Eowyn as well as the leader of the Eored.
         In the end I would have to give J.R.R Tolkien's Plot a 10/10 Peter Jackson's Directing a 9.5/10 The Acting of the Cast a 9/10 and the effects/screenplay a 8.5/10 which comes to a 37/40 or a 3.7/4.0 stars.

"Jul 12, 2010","An excellent middle chapter in the trilogy. Pretty much everything about it is perfect: great writing, great acting, great special effects, great direction, great music, great art direction. I had forgotten about Sam's excellent speech at the end, which pretty much sums up everything that is great about The Lord of the Rings and storytelling in general. It also hit me much harder this time just how much of a tragic character Smeagol/Gollum really is. If you can get over the wonderful visual effects that created him and the funny voice and actually think about him as a character, his story is just so sad and painful. I really felt sorry for him this time around. This movie also has a lot of Treebeard, which is awesome. (Did you know Treebeard was based on Tolkien's friend C. S. Lewis? Well he was.) I also noticed that King Denethor of Gondor was also Walter from Fringe. There's just so much to love and admire in these movies, it's astonishing.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 12, 2010",Best part of the trilogy.,NEUTRAL
"Jul 12, 2010","With even better visuals, characters, and scenery, ""The Two Towers"" manages to be even better than the first one.

Despite this, the movie deserves serious consideration in terms of what movies you want to have in your collection.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 11, 2010","Ahhhh, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. Another reason for Americans to get more major landscape envy because New Zealand is just so damn beautiful in this movie. Oh, and did I mention that Peter Jackson is a great director? From New Zealand, too. For once, I can be proud of something that New Zealand has done in the film industry. If only we could do more of this kind of stuff.
Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) continue their journey to destroy the One Ring they have in their possession. They meet a creature who once had the Ring, Gollum (Andy Serkis), who they trust to lead them the right way. The people they left behind are now launching an attack on Isengard, making the battle for the Ring bigger and worse than they had expected. 
I liked The Two Towers a bit better than The Fellowship of the Ring because this one has a higher entertainment factor. I think this was probably because of the character Gollum, who we see a lot more of and turns out to be quite a mysterious character; albeit an ugly and crazy one. What I like about it is that it is crammed full with characters, but it doesn't turn into a usual mishmash of people because the depth and characteristics of them are evident, even if they have some pretty short scenes (like Cate Blanchett as Galadriel). 
Again, what can I say? I know it. Everybody with half a brain knows it. The Lord of the Rings films are masterpieces. And just because I can, I'm gonna say this is the best thing New Zealand has ever done. The Two Towers is a fantastic second installment, if only other sequels could be as good as this.

"Jun 28, 2010","The journey that was started in The Fellowhip of the Ring continues in The Two Towers. But this time, the fellowship has been seperated into three groups ever since the ending of the movie. Boromir is dead and Merry and Pippin were captured by Saruman's forces with Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas are on their trail. But most importantly, Frodo and Sam are on their way to Morder to destroy the One Ring of Sauron.

Since The Fellowship of the Ring proved an enormous success among audiences, there was of course going to be a lot of excitement for The Two Towers and The Return of the King. Is this movie as good as The Fellowship of the Ring? Yes, it is, but it's also better.

The Two Towers starts right where The Fellowship of the Ring left off. The first few minutes show us what really happened to Gandalf (Ian McKellen). In the previous film, when we saw the grey wizard fight against the Balrog of Morgoth, he was pulled down with it. Now we see that they were actually fighting as they fell into a nearly bottomless fall.

Then it cuts to Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) on their way to Mordor. But they keep getting lost. But then one night, Gollum (Andy Serkis) attacks them to try and steal the Ring. They manage to subdue him, but Frodo makes him their guide to Mordor. As they travel, we see that the creature has split personalities: the meek and more kindly Smeagol, and the greedy and sinister Gollum. Frodo grows to trust him, but Sam despises him.

Meanwhile, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Gimli (John Ryes-Davies), and Legolas are following the Uruk-hai who captured Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), who eventually manage to escape into the Fanghorn Forest, which is occupied by Ents. The chase leads them into Rohan, the home of the horselords, which is led by King Theoden (Bernard Hill). But he is under the venomous influence of Saruman (Christopher Lee) through his servant, Grima Wormtongue (Brad Dourif).

Saruman is intending to wage war against Rohan to eliminate those who would oppose Sauron. But not all hope was not lost. Gandalf has come from beyond the grave, now more powerful than ever. He is now Gandalf the White. And when Theoden recovers, he must prepare his men for war against Saruman's forces at Helm's Deep.

This adaptation of the second book doesn't cover everything that was in its source material. The film only tells about two thirds of it. The first chapter, The Departure of Boromir, was moved to the ending of The Fellowship of the Ring. The Two Towers goes through chapters 2-7 from Book III (Aragorn, Gandalf and the others' story) and chapters 1-6 in Book IV (Frodo, Sam and Gollum's story). The rest would be inserted into The Return of the King.

The transition is also not quite as faithful as The Fellowship of the Ring was. Plenty of things are left out and some things are changed (like the elves arriving at Helm's Deep and Frodo, Sam, and Gollum are taken by Faramir and his men to Osgiliath). Some of the characters personalities are a little different, too (particularly Faramir). But as with Fellowship, it carries the heart of the book.

Just as with its predecessor, the movie has an excellent story and is technically stunning. The visual effects are excellent. The best of them are used on Treebeard and the other Ents. The makeup done on the Uruk-hai is also worthy of note. But the really good parts are the action scenes. There's the fight with the Balrog at the beginning, a fight with Wargs, but the battle for Helm's Deep is a highpoint and one of the best battle scenes in cinema.

The acting is just as great, and even better than it was in Fellowship. And even then it was excellent. The actors are really starting to grow into their characters. Elijah Wood makes Frodo's struggle with being the Ring-bearer believeable. Sam is also a great companion to Frodo and is a more braver character than he was in the previous film. Gandalf, who doesn't have as much screentime this time, is still the perfect Gandalf. Viggo Mortensen's Aragorn is more heroic in this as he takes on army of Uruk-hai. And the two duos of Merry/Pippin and Gimil/Legolas are also fun to watch.

The supporting and new cast is also quite good. The most engaging is Andy Serkis as Gollum, who makes the split personalities really work (particularly in one scene in the middle of the movie). Christopher Lee gives it his all as Saruman and like Ian McKellen does with Gandalf, he embodies the role. Bernard Hill gives a voice of authority as King Theoden. Brad Dourif gives a chilling performance as the sly Grima. Miranda Otto makes a good Eowyn. Karl Urban doesn't get very much screentime, but he makes a good Eomer. David Wenham also makes a good Faramir. Hugo Weaving, Liv Tyler, and Cate Blanchett also have small appearances in the movie.

I understand that there is a time limit, and Jackson does a great job in telling a cohesive story through the film without the detail, but looking at some of the scenes and trying to act like I have never read the books I began to realize that there were just too many details missing in the plot line that didn't really work in the film itself. The seeing orb for one has an entire backstory to it and the motivation behind Wormtounge seems to lack. 

One thing holds true, the graphics and locations in this film will surpass time. Visually a masterpiece, performance wise brilliant, and the battles give that outstanding feeling and wow factor that can only be delivered by such an amazing editing job and battle sequence.",NEUTRAL

"Jun 1, 2010","The saga CONTINUES!  I got the chance to sit down and watch the 223-minute special extended edition, and man, The Two Towers is still just as epic as I remembered.  Samwise and Frodo continue their journey to destroy the ever-powerful ring in the fires of Mount Doom.  But, at the same time, the Dark Lord Sauron is building an enormous army with the sole purpose of trampling all of Middle Earth.  Man is the first species on the extinction list, and they fight for their lives on two fronts.  The Two Towers is where we are officially introduced to the tragic character of Gollum; his story is such a sad one, and the way they handle his character with seamless special effects is beautiful.  The CGI and special effects here, even though they coming up on being eight years old, still hold up and look great; they look better than 95% of what we are getting in movies today.  There is a certain craft about the making of this trilogy; you rarely see the fantasy genre approached with such care, and Peter Jackson, with his camera dynamics and movie-making comprehension, was the perfect person for the project.  I still have to watch it again, because I still havenât seen it since it first came out on DVD, but I think I may prefer the theatrical cut to the extended.  Donât get me wrong, the extended cut more than merits a watch; there is a lot more character development and motivations defined.  I prefer the extended cut of The Fellowship of the Ring because you get a much richer back-story to this magical world you are being introduced to.  With this second movie, however, the first two thirds of the movie are just building and building to a climactic third act that kicks your ass.  Building wonderfully, yes, but you still want to get there before the 150-minute mark, and the added material, while insightful, doesnât allow the movie to flow as fluently as the theatrical cut.  It is an engrossing movie with every 10-15 minute scene just flying by, but the extended cut is for hardcore fans only.",NEUTRAL

"May 24, 2010",This was my favorite one of the three.,NEUTRAL
"May 24, 2010","The director Peter Jackson's scrupulous devotion to the spirit of J. R. R. Tolkien's ''Lord of the Rings'' trilogy manifests itself in a gripping, intense fashion for the second of the film adaptations, ''The Two Towers.'' It may be the first sequel that does not bother to reprise the major plot elements of its predecessor immediately; the plan is to simply drop us right into the action.

Even for those deeply immersed in the material, this stratagem creates a few moments of apprehension -- the same disconcerted quality that the hobbits Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are experiencing on their journey; this mission began in ''The Fellowship of the Ring'' when Frodo was entrusted with the ring that gives its bearer enormous powers and, incidentally, begins the end of life in Middle Earth, as was indicated in the first ''Ring'' movie, ''The Fellowship of the Ring.''

Never has a film so strongly been a product of a director's respect for its source. Mr. Jackson uses all his talents in the service of that reverence, creating a rare perfect mating of filmmaker and material. Mr. Jackson's ploy in this beautifully considered epic is to give viewers the same feeling of confusion that his characters are experiencing. By doing this he simultaneously answers those who complained that too much of the previous ''Rings'' was about setup.

A brief recap of a climactic battle between the friendly wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and a fire demon -- one of many climactic battles from ''Fellowship'' -- is shown near the start. But this scene is used to set ''The Two Towers'' in motion. It is a daring gambit to have viewers enter a movie bearing such complex preceding action with so little information. Even though the first film took in enough cash to jump-start the flagging United States economy single-handedly, Mr. Jackson does not seem to understand that there are people who haven't absorbed the ''Rings'' chronology into the entirety of their beings. And there may even be folks out there who haven't seen ''Fellowship,'' but will be lured into theaters for ''Towers'' by all the attention that ''Fellowship'' attracted. Such moviegoers may feel left out, puzzled and unable to keep up.

With the narrative of ''Rings,'' Tolkien was investigating determination, loyalty and, finally, faith, finding innumerable ways to offer up the concept of purity of heart, as found in Matthew 5:8 and in Kierkegaard, whose contention was that purity of heart was the ability to will one thing into being. The pursuit of purity is at the center of ''Towers.''

For our hero, Frodo, whose quest is to purge the forces of menacing evil from Middle Earth, purity is demonstrated by combating the temptation to wear the ring and be consumed by its corrupting power. He gets a taste of what the future might be like when he and Sam meet Gollum, a hobbit who was once seduced by the ring. He is now an emotional and physical shambles; emaciated and slunk into a perpetual crouch, Gollum's translucent, waxy skin is a membrane that just barely contains his insides.

Gollum is divided within himself; he is an infantilized wreck who wants to please and befriend the hobbits. But he is also a hissing, bitter child-man whose paranoia keeps him breathing, and plotting. Gollum is a computer-generated creation and as fully realized a character as can be found in ''Towers'' -- perhaps the most fully realized. (He has been dropped into the movie more effectively than George Lucas crammed Jar Jar Binks into his recent ''Star Wars'' addenda.) With the voice of Andy Serkis, whose movements were also copied by the animators, Gollum is torn by his nature, and Mr. Jackson allows him to be conflicted in a way none of the other characters in the film are.

This is partially because ''Towers'' is more or less a bridge to the finale of the ''Rings'' trilogy due a year from now, though this picture is one of the most accomplished holding actions ever.

So, much of the flow of ''Towers'' is dictated by the amount of information that has to be saved for the next installment. Mr. Jackson compensates for that by inflating the warrior Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) into an even more assured, reflexive action hero. He helps a bewitched king (Bernard Hill) defend his castle against the endless, possessed armies of the villainous magician Saruman (Christopher Lee), the foe responsible for the fate of Gandalf. In his flowing white gowns and beard, Mr. Lee's warlock is a force to be reckoned with because he alone has a voice as commanding as Mr. McKellen's.

In sheer action mechanics, Mr. Jackson's achievements in ''Towers'' are even more compelling than what he managed the first time around; he has given the martial scenes of this sequel a completely different thrust. His engrossing action style is exciting and dramatic; when the swells of Saruman's army crash into the walls of the king's castle, we could be watching Orson Welles's ''Chimes at Midnight'' as directed by George A. Romero -- Shakespearean-scale bloodshed and loss as an exploitation movie. The exultant creepiness of horror films is Mr. Jackson's instinctive filmmaking style. He exaggerates it here in epic terms, and the grandeur is astonishing -- one scene of Saruman's creatures flinging themselves at the castle is framed as an overhead shot, with their shields moving like the wings of a peculiarly lyric and fatal insect.

Mr. Jackson's mastery of craft in some areas is so powerful that the flaws are more noticeable than in the first film. The little-boy allure of the storytelling in ''Towers'' is sure to evoke the same reaction that it did in ''Fellowship.'' ''Towers'' is like a family-oriented E-rated video game, with no emotional complications other than saving the day. Women have so little to do here that they serve almost as plot-device flight attendants, offering a trough of Diet Coke to refresh the geek-magnet story. (It is a lapse in Tolkien's work that Mr. Jackson has not figured out a way to correct, even with the token reappearances of Liv Tyler and Cate Blanchett from the first film.)

Mr. McKellen is a marginal presence this time around, which is unfortunate because he is needed for ballast; ''Rings'' is such a kids' fantasy that a daddy figure is required. He is the father who soothes his charges under the spell of Tolkien's bad-dream threats. But he does get one -- only one -- whooping chance to do so in ''Towers.''

The most incredible accomplishment of ''Towers'' is that at its heart it is a transition film that lasts nearly three hours and holds the viewer's attention. Because ''The Two Towers,'' which opens worldwide today, has to keep so much story in reserve for the last installment, the movie falls short on emotional involvement. Still, Mr. Jackson rises so completely to the challenges here that I can't wait to see his next movie -- by that, I mean the one after the ''Ring'' cycle ends.",NEUTRAL

Frodo and Sam continue their long journey and have to trust Gollum to get to Mordor, but not much really happens within their journey.

This part really saves the movie, and otherwise, I would have quickly fallen asleep. The soundtrack is still great, everything still looks cool, and there is an awesome battle at the end.

"May 8, 2010","The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, or ""Thrillogy"" as I prefer to call it, is beyond doubt seen by so many fantasy fans, myself included as the best book to film adaptation series ever made...

Firstly, the shooting of these films on location in New Zealand was a brilliant decision by Peter Jackson, the beauty and diversity of the brilliant country is second to none in terms of filming locations. 

The acting quality of these 3 movies is near enough faultless, and Jacksons special effects team does a brilliant job making an audience 5-10 years after they were made think ""wow I saw a film a week ago with worse special effects!"" The sight of the Riders of Rohan charging towards Minas Tirith is a sight to behold even 7 years after the films theatrical release.

These films deserve all the interest they get in the early noughties and need to be remembered for years to come as some of the best and most captivating films of all time. 

Even the fact that all 3 films were shot before even the first was released shows the confidence that Peter Jackson had that his 3 films were going to go down in history of cinema!

For being nothing below works of priceless art, a 10/10 for all 3 parts of this masterful trilogy!

"May 2, 2010","Peter Jackson has always maintained that The Two Towers is ""the second act"" of his epic undertaking, and perhaps the true greatness of the middle chapter will only be clear when viewed in context. As a stand-alone film, however, The Two Towers is not quite as good as Fellowship. (Nor, indeed, does it extend the universe or deepen the relationships in the manner of The Empire Strikes Back.) That it still merits the full five stars is merely an indication of how high the benchmark has been set. Picking up pretty much where Fellowship left off, this is a considerably darker film, with Frodo (Wood) falling further under the influence of the Ring (giving rise to some seriously spooky hallucinations), while Saruman (Christopher Lee) wreaks even more havoc. There's also the first appearance of Saruman's spy, the sinister Wormtongue (Brad Dourif), and the complex Gollum, a brilliant combination of computer trickery and raspy vocals from Andy Serkis (the campaign for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar starts here. t may lack the first-view-thrill and natural dramatic shape of Fellowship, but this is both funnier and darker than the first film, and certainly more action-packed.

Another great acting ensemble and many oscar worthy acts. The visual effects, like before, are worthy of the oscar that it received. The story line, though based off the book, was phoenomenal. The intense battle scenes kept me on the edge of my seat and the dialogue between the characters kept me interested all the way. And when the ending finally came and the credits began rolling i rushed home and marked my calendar on the day of the release date of the final film. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is, in short for a better word, perfect.",NEUTRAL

"Apr 25, 2010","The Two Towers is somewhat burdened with the most difficult job in the series: that is, to let the series make a transition from the first installment to the last one. Obviously, the second installment in a trilogy is typically the weakest, and as its own film, The Two Towers will probably be another testament to this rule, but at the end of the day, does this really matter? Peter Jackson intended these three films to be one gigantic one, not unlike how Tolkein intended the original books to be one behemoth book. And for what it's supposed to do--that is, to form a bridge between Fellowship of the Ring and Return of the King and still be an exciting film in its own right--the film does splendidly. This installment is more episodic than Fellowship (probably because what's left of the broken Fellowship is on their own in little groups now) but this is to the films advantage, as the climax near the end of the film is breathtaking. Whereas the first film was sort of lyrical in its execution, this film is much more of an action-thriller-war film, so the established great performances from the first film (McKellen, Mortensen, and company) don't quite stand out as much. That said, there is one dynamite performance in this film, and that is Andy Serkis's chilling, now-iconic turn as Gollum, the devious hobbit-like creature. It's still well-written, it's still well-directed, it's still well-acted, and it's still technically gorgeous, but it's hard to straight-up enjoy this film as a stand-alone film, since virtually everything in it is an obvious buildup to the third film.",NEUTRAL

"Apr 22, 2010","In my personal opinion, The Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers is the most magical, impressive and visually stunning film in existence. Peter Jackson has succeeded in creating a timeless classic. There are some of you that argue it is overrated, which I think is a travesty. The story of the ring is epic in itself, with the trilogy by J R R Tolkien one of the most well known all around the world. And as The Sunday Times said (and you know you can trust a tabloid newspaper...ahem) ""The English-speaking world is divided into those who have read The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings and those who are going to read them."" Peter Jackson has successfully taken this story and created a translation onto screen in so much depth, bringing the story to a whole new generation. 

It is obvious in the viewing of The Lord of the Rings of the painstaking care and love that went into its creation. If I had been given the cast list for The Lord of the Rings, I would have been amazed by how many big stars were on board and would have told you that it wouldn't work. I would have been wrong. Ian McKellen, Andy Serkis, Hugo Weaving, Orlando Bloom, Viggo Mortensen etcetera are, in a word, prodigious. Each and every member of the cast offers the perfect portrayl of characters in their mannerisms and identity. In esscence, no one else could have done it better. 

One thing that really struck me about The Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers were the battle scenes (which again were brought to life in Return of the King). If I could choose one moment that defines a perfect film experience for me I would say the scene where Gandalf arrives with the Riders of Rohan with the sun rising behind him. It is epic in proportion and none of the emotion is lost in trying to make bloodbath scenes. Jackson was much more subtle and it pays off.

Overall, no matter whether you love it or hate it, The Lord of the Rings trilogy is the pinnacle of modern cinema. As I think The Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers is the strongest of the trilogy, surely it is THE best film in existence?",NEUTRAL

"Apr 17, 2010","The opening scene of The Two Towers provides an outstanding, yet very brief, taste of action, cinematography, and special effects, only to be matched (and far surpassed) in the final hour of the film. The stunning events of the third hour of The Two Towers are undoubtedly the centerpiece of the film, and while the first two hours serve finely as story development, they primarily build anticipation for the final hour, which mostly depicts the battle of Helm's Deep. More than anything else, the first two hours merely tease and torment the patient audience. It's a shame that such a gap has to exist between the first minute and the final hour, but I take no reservations in saying that despite how you feel about the first two hours of the film, the final hour will make the wait entirely worth its while.

As stated, the road to the battle of Helm's Deep can be enormously long and painful for any viewer aware of what breathtaking scenes await towards the end of the film. Perhaps The Two Towers' biggest fault is in its own accomplishments; the first two thirds of the film are well shot, well paced, and they necessarily and adequately progress the storyline, but when compared to the spectacular final hour, the first two hours seem uneventful and insignificant. However, to be fair, I feel that it's simply impossible to create two hours of film that could appropriately lead into the battle of Helm's Deep. It's difficult to comprehend how such scenes came to exist in the rather short amount of time Peter Jackson has had to create six hours (so far) of finished film. The battle of Helm's Deep is simply unreal; it's unlike any event that has come to pass since fantasy films gained, and regained, popularity.

As assumed, The Two Towers begins where The Fellowship of the Ring ended. The majority of the film follows four separate groups and their story lines: Frodo and Sam; Aragorn and Legolas, Merry and Pippin, and Saruman and his army. The performances live well up to the standards of the first film, with a particularly notable performance from Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, whose role is significantly larger in The Two Towers. Aragorn satisfies a thirst for someone to root for, a thirst that was left partly unquenched in Fellowship. It's much easier to root for Aragorn than it is for Frodo; Aragorn has many more qualities of a leading man, a soldier, and a hero. More than once did the audience, filled mostly with academy voters, applaud the heroics of Aragorn. Gollum also shines in a much-welcomed large role, due to extremely realistic computer animation, and a fine performance from Andy Serkis, upon which the animation was modeled. In Fellowship, it was appropriate to consider Gollum one of the many great 'features' of the film. However, here he is more of a leading character and a 'star,' and his convincing dual-personality, stabbing voice, and well-choreographed body movements make him consistently eye-grabbing and the center of focus of nearly every scene in which he appears.

As was The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers is a visual delight. Those who have seen Fellowship are no doubt familiar with the beauty of the landscapes of New Zealand. The cinematography is, again, one of the best aspects of the film. The swooshing camera movements that follow the armies and horsemen throughout the fields are extremely satisfying in this post-Matrix era. The shots of the ascending enemy-laden ladders in the battle of Helm's Deep are terrifying and chillingly gorgeous all at once. The visual effects take an appropriate leap forward from those of the first film. While the visual effects in Fellowship were outstanding, the battle of Helm's Deep provides for the best application of CGI since the rippling waves of The Matrix's 'Bullet Time.' The battle of Helm's Deep features absolutely awe-inspiring and seamless integration of acting, stunts, and computer animation. Each orc seems to have its own personality, demonstrated in its movements and visual features. The masses of armies fight with strategy and true character, which I imagine is much harder to accomplish than animating thousands of identical clone troopers. The only problem I have with the visual department is the look of Gimli, the Treebeard. Gimli's visual features seem a bit childish and uninspired, inconsistent with the standards set by the rest of the film. But again, there is simply nothing that compares to the battle of Helm's Deep. George Lucas and the Wachowski brothers certainly have not created anything that approaches the grandness and magnificence of The Two Towers' final hour, and I doubt they will do so anytime soon.

In The Fellowship of the Ring, I had a few minor problems with Howard Shore's score. While I thought it was gorgeous and it established several very memorable themes, I don't think it handled the sentimental scenes (opening in the Shire, Gandalf's passing) properly. I thought it caved in to the melodrama a bit too much, resembling the emotions from James Horner's Titanic. However, I believe that The Two Towers requires the type of score which Howard Shore accomplishes best: dark, continuous, and unrelenting, as demonstrated in Se7en and Silence of the Lambs. The theme used in many of the action scenes in Fellowship (low brass, six notes repeated with a rest in between) is much more present in The Two Towers, appropriately. A brand new theme is also unveiled, the theme for Rohan, a prominent kingdom in Middle Earth. Rohan's theme is played more often than any other melody in the film, underscoring most of the memorable and heroic scenes with great effect. Howard Shore undeniably exhibits his skills as an 'A-list' composer, and with a possible double Oscar nomination this year for The Two Towers and Gangs of New York, he could get propelled to the very top of the 'A-list,' right beside John Williams and Hans Zimmer in terms of demand.

If not the picture itself, there should be a way to recognize and award the battle of Helm's Deep. The battle sequence alone represents successful filmmaking in its highest form. The choreography of the battle, the visual effects, the pacing, acting, cinematography, and music, all work together in perfection to achieve grand filmmaking which is as entertaining and enjoyable as film can be. For this very reason, no one, whether a fan of Fellowship or not, should miss The Two Towers.",NEUTRAL
"Apr 16, 2010","4.5: This is my review of the trilogy as a whole: Can you imagine how fascinating it would have been to have a pint of cider with J.R.R. Tolkien?  That certainly would have been something.  I can think of  few other people throughout history I'd rather sit down with (Jesus, Odysseus, Moses, Cleopatra, Buddha, Elizabeth, etc being other options).  I used to read The Lord of the Rings novels every year when I was younger, but I haven't read a word since prior to seeing this film my freshman year just south of Columbia University at the nearest theater on Broadway.  I went to each of the three films just before either heading back to Minnesota, departing for the United Kingdom, or hopping over to France for my winter vacation.  It was a great way to end the first semester every year and I definitely remember missing it my senior year when the fourth film in the trilogy failed to arrive for the holiday season.  Due to the fact that it has been so long since I've read the books, it is easier for me to view the films as films, instead of as adaptations of the novel.  I, of course, can't entirely divorce the two experiences and I still long to see certain scenes.  Some of the scenes I longed to see this time around were actually in the extended version.  I'll have to buy that when it comes out on Blu-Ray as well.  The film doesn't look spectacular on Blu-Ray when compared to some of the more pristine newer releases, but it still blows DVD away of course.  The fact that I read the novels so many times at such a young age means that they will be forever tied to a certain time and place.  They'll always hold a special place in my heart and psyche.  Thus, the films will never compete for my affections in precisely the same way.  I do love the films though.  They are spectacularly entertaining and spectacularly good.  The only feature film trilogies that immediately come to mind that can compare are Kieslowski's Three Colors trilogy and the original Star War's trilogy.  There are television series, such as Band of Brothers or my favorite televisions shows, and film series longer than a trilogy, such as the Up series, that compare, but very few.  The production design, costumes, makeup, digital effects, locations, sets/props, etc are all superb.  New Zealand does really seem to have been the perfect location for the trilogy.  The casting is quite exceptional as well.  I had minor qualms initially, some of which linger, but I've grown to accept just about everyone in their roles (I still hate Celeborn though).   Gollum/Andy Serkis's performance is particularly powerful.  I really think it was worthy of an Academy Award.  The pacing of each of the films is superb.  The films don't lag for a second.  Each scene is absolutely riveting and essential for me.  I can think of few areas where the script could have been improved.  The places where it strays too far from the text of the Lord of the Rings and begins to incorporate elements of The Silmarillion are some of the weaker sections, but some of these also give the film an even greater hinted at depth.  Each act, each scene, each film simply leaves me wanting more.  The third film is almost impossibly brilliant.  I can't think of another picture out there, to include all of my favorite films, that I'd be more apprehensive about seeing with a significant other.  There is no other film that leaves me as emotionally naked.  I can't help but oozing tears and bearing my soul, to some extent at least.  The third act, in particular the last 15 minutes or so, is magnificent.  It doesn't get much better.  Few filmmakers have the guts to drag a film on like this.  Normally I feel like filmmakers put off the ending in order to arrive at some sort of resolution.  This is the opposite.  Jackson and company delay the resolution as long as possible, and thereby comply with the books demands.  It is close to perfection.  I can't wait for the extended versions on Blu-Ray.  Amazing, in every sense of the word.  It does make me wonder what other filmmakers would have made of it.  I am intensely curious about Del Toro's take on the world.",NEUTRAL
"Apr 16, 2010","The Two Towers continues Peter Jackson's epic trilogy, with us knowing that the adventure is almost over, but us not knowing how. The Two Towers is an amazing film and wonderfully continues the story, picking up from the previous film. Peter Jackson has already proved that he is a master storyteller and this film works perfectly. The music is still grand, the acting is terrific and the cinematography is beautiful, the final battle at Helm's Deep is probably the film's best part, while Andy Serkis delivers an incredible supporting performance as Gollum.

"Apr 10, 2010","This is actually my favorite film of the trilogy. It by far deserved the oscar for best picture over Chicago, In my opinion at least. This may be the only film that is purly fast paced and completely captivating. I am particularly fond of this film because of the epic war scenes, which brings out far more intensity than the previous film. This is the only Lord of the rings film I am able to watch several times. So what makes this film so appealing and well made?
The Story and Plot: Fascinating how all this could have been dreamed up and created in the form of a book, than captured on film. The attention to detail Jackson has is undoubtably one of the most committed of all time, espicially here. It is in this film we are introduced to Gollum, one of the more interesting characters on the entire story. He sets an aura for the majority of the film, keeping us on the edge of our seats, wondering what he is capable of and what he will actually do. The characters of Sam and Frodo grow far more interesting as their will and abilities are put to the test. Once again it is the war scenes that really push this films through and astound me and keep me glued to the T.V.
The acting: The acting in this film is much the same as the last, with a few exceptions. Viggo Mortenson really pulls through and demonstrates  the ruthless and sensitive side of Aragon, this for me was the standout of the entire film. Wood and Austin really show their grit and talent as their characters are strained and tested. The share size of the cast is also astonishing, once again the attention to detail in the casting and extras is masterful.
A final note is the dazzeling effects. The costumes are perfectly made and a wonder to the eyes. 
Overall this is without a doubt the best of the entire trilogy. I recommend this to every movie lover and anyone who enjoys the epics or fantasy stories.",NEUTRAL

"Apr 6, 2010","The second installment in the trilogy of the adapted tales from J.R.R. Tolkien picks up exactly where The Fellowship Of The Ring left off, where we see the hobbits Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) continue there journey to the depths Mordor in their mission to destroy the ring, whilst there departed companions make new allies and forge an assault on Isengard. Undeniably separated, Aragon (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) desperately search to find the missing hobbits, who are captured by the Orcs. Meanwhile Gandalf (Ian McKellen) travels in an attempt to locate help, for the engaging battle that soon followed. Director Peter Jackson does deliver a excellent offering for a sequel, though it falls a twinge short of the felllowship. The screenwriting team did manipulate some major storylines from the novels, though the many differences never reflected in this enterprising endeavor. The film was nominated for six Academy Awards and won best sound effects and editing. The visual effects team did another fantastic job, as they created more engaging battle sequences and the introduction of the CGI character, Gollum. Despite the manipulated plot, The Two Towers is still a very entertaining film, filled lots of action and stunning visual and sound effects.

"Apr 5, 2010","This film may only give part of the payoff for the set-up in The Fellowship of the Ring, but boy, is it sweet. Peter Jackson delivers something in The Two Towers that improves it greatly from the first film, and it is represented by two things. One is the CGI Gollum, who is the most chilling character in the film, but also provides much of the comic relief. The other is the awesomely epic Battle of Helm's Deep. This battle redefined the epic scope of the trilogy, and was one of the greatest battles in the history of film. However, this film is highly confusing at times, and often crams way too many characters into one scene. You MUST watch Fellowship of the Ring first. The extended cut, on the other hand, does much more for me than the theatrical version, as it not only gives us a funeral scene for Ãowyn's brother ThÃ (C)odred, it also gives us an excellent flashback to Gondor. This flashback gives us more Sean Bean as Boromir (and who didn't want that?), and gives us our first look at John Noble as Denethor, Boromir and Faramir's sinister father, who plays poor Faramir against his older brother, whom he favors. As for other performances, Ian McKellen still excels as Gandalf, though the mystic nature of the White character makes me somewhat miss the simple kindheartedness of the original Grey. Christopher Lee continues to play villains spectacularly as the evil white wizard Saruman, and Elijah Wood and Sean Astin give it their all as a Frodo and Sam in great peril. Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd are given more to do in this installment, providing both humor and drama as Merry and Pippin (especially in the extended scenes with the Orcs). Hugo Weaving, Liv Tyler, and Cate Blanchett provide a mystic presence in their respective characters of Elrond, Arwen, and Galadriel, and trilogy newcomer David Wenham, Miranda Otto, Bernard Hill, Brad Dourif, and Karl Urban all provide great performances as Faramir, Ãowyn, ThÃ (C)oden, Grima Wormtongue, and Ãomer, respectively. But as stated above, Andy Serkis truly is the best actor in this film, even in motion capture. His Gollum is compelling, fascinating, comedic, and frightening all rolled into one, and shows what could happen to any poor soul corrupted by the power of the RIng. After the expository nature of The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers ups the stakes, moving the film trilogy one step closer to its epic conclusion.",NEUTRAL

"Feb 20, 2010","It's hard to rate this movie, as well as it's predecessor The Fellowship of the Ring, and it's sequel Return of the King, as seperate entities. The entire thrill of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy was that it stood as a cohesive and complete movie spaced out over the span of three seperate films. As such, I have posted the same review for all three movies in the series with minor changes concerning plots near the end. All three of these movies are filled with a vibrancy of the sort that is rarely seen in films of any type, let alone a fantasy epic. The attention to detail and the obvious care of the source material stands out in every part of Jackson's trilogy masterpiece. This is more than a movie, it is a work of loving respect by a man who understood what it meant to be able to lose yourself for even a short time in the mystical world of J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle Earth. Everything about these movies is of the highest standards. The acting is believable, (which is amazing considering that they were expected to make us believe in wizards and elves), and moreso the acting is honest. There is no attempts to carry things overly dramatic or to seek a spotlight above the others. These are roles that are fun to watch and instantly create a bond of caring between viewer and actor. The plot, is of course, based upon one of the greatest selling series of books of all time. As expected it is thrilling, heroic, tragic, chilling, suspenseful, as well as action-packed. The direction is spot-on, and the filmwork itself is beautiful. Everything about these three movies is of the highest calibre, and make for one of the defining series of filmmaking for this generation.
*Potential Spoiler Alert*
The action picks up immediately from the end of The Fellowship of the Ring and does not slow down for the entire length of the picture.  The development of the characters continues, with elements of the friendships between characters now allowing for inside laughs that the audience can enjoy as well.  These are no longer a group of strangers, they are a group of friends that the audience has come to know just as well as they have.
The introduction of the Smeagol/Gollum character, and the job done in bringing him to life is absolutely stunning.  Andy Serkis is absolutely genius in his portrayal of a character so tragic that you cannot help but become entralled with him.  The true magic is that you begin to cease seeing the character as a special effect and begin to see him as a real person inhabiting this movie.  Brilliant.
Little can be said about the awesome spectacle that is the climactic battle at the end of this movie that has not already been said before.  It is an awe inspiring scene of such fluid pacing, yet startling vividness and grandeur that you cannot help but be impressed by it.",NEUTRAL

The quality of the battle at Helm's Deep is completly unparallel to anything before or since. The more internal story line as we follow Frodo and Sam's progress is of the highest quality. However probably my favourite part of the whole movie is the dialogue, it never crosses the line from epic to corny, it has a modern feel to it without ever taking us out of Middle Earth and quite frankly it occasionally gives me goose bumps.",NEUTRAL

"Feb 15, 2010","Everything I faulted the first movie for seems to have been corrected in The Two Towers. Gandalf's lighthearted moments were subtle, not goofy. Elijah Wood was better, in some unquantifiable way. Viggo Mortensen looks even better as Aragorn when he's haggard and tired. This movie also does a great job of capturing the friendship/rivalry between Legolas and Gimli, which is one of my favorite aspects of the books.

I neglected to mention the creature effects in the Fellowship review, so I'll hit on them now. In Fellowship, I thought the orcs and goblins looked terrible, pretty much on-par with the ooze creatures in the Power Rangers movie. They look a lot better in Two Towers. The Ents look a little wonky, something about their eyes. But I have to say, Gollum looks fantastic. I can't think of anything that they could improve.

"Feb 8, 2010","Really, I should probably let this film soak in a bit; I am, after all, on something of a ""post-viewing"" high right now. However, at this moment, my feeling remains the same from the first installment - this is the movie experience I've been waiting my whole life for. In case you haven't gathered, this movie is visually stunning, literally breathtaking. I mean that, some of the scenes in this film simply stopped my lungs in their tracks, shocked at the pure, enveloping beauty of the shot. Peter Jackson has a profound grasp of visual manipulation like few directors have ever had.

The acting is, as always, superb. Specific mention goes to both John Rhys-Davies in his well enjoyed comic turn, and very largely to Andy Serkis, who was a major role in creating the most realistic and brilliantly well-performed CGI character I've ever seen (Gollum).

For the most part, and as a fan of the books, I take no offense to the slight plot modifications. My understanding is that Tolkien himself realized that visual adaptation of LotR would require a somewhat different take on his work, and was apparently open to such minute changes. 

In short, if you found the continual enjoyment I did with the first movie of LotR, this movie will in no way let you down. Not even for a minute.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 7, 2010",Not as strong as the first film. It lacks the emotional focus but still remains a truly inspired piece of art. The film feels a bit drawn out at spots. But the final battles more than make up for its pacing in its first half. And most of the reason for it not being as successful as in most parts of a planned trilogy is that the first one was just incredible and so hard to measure up to.

"Jan 28, 2010","The first entry in Peter Jackson's film adaptation of ""The Lord of the Rings"" was so perfectly plotted and engaging the films that follow almost feel weaker in comparison.  The film-maker's task with the middle segment of the trilogy is certainly rife with more challenges.  With the breaking of the Fellowship at the end of the first film we're now asked to follow three separate stories.  Frodo and Sam continue their journey to Mordor to try and slam-dunk the One Ring into Mount Doom with the aid of the sneaky Gollum,  Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli attempt to rally the kingdom of Rohan to battle against Sauron which culminates with the siege of Helm's Deep, whilst Merry and Pippin escape the clutches of their orc captors and encounter Treebeard the Ent whom they hope will take the fight to Saruman in Isengard.  Whoooof!!!  Well, this wouldn't be too bad if Jackson didn't engage in some bizarre choices which actually LENGTHEN an already cumbersome plot.  The character of Faramir has always been the antithesis of his brother Boromir but here screenwriters Fran Walsh
Philippa Boyens make him just as obsessed as his brother to exploit the power of the One Ring.  So, we're ""treated"" to a painful (not to mention expensive-looking) detour as Faramir drags the hobbits back to Osgiliath.  The first time I saw this I was pretty pissed, but the so-called ""Extended Edition"" which was subsequently released, makes this more palatable by interspersing some flashbacks of Faramir being swayed by the impossibly strict wishes of his father Denethor.  In fact, if the movie suffers from anything, it's the dearth of flashbacks.  For example, Liv's Tyler's already freestyle role as Arwen is pulled through the thread of ""Two Towers"" like a lengthy splinter. I'm sure she was injected into the films merely to flesh out more of the female roles, which I agree with in theory.  But the scenes between her and Aragorn which were omitted from the first film are now shoe-horned into this central chapter in the form of flashbacks, increasing the scattershot effects of the narrative.  Jackson also telegraphs the whole concept of the kingdom of men coming into their own age of independence by having the elves intervene in the final battle.  All is not dire, however.  There is lots to admire in this film and Jackson certainly gets more right than wrong in this massive undertaking.  Gollum, for example, is certainly one of the most memorable and full-blooded CGI characters in cinema history.  Having Andy Serkis in a motion capture suit on set to interact with Elijah Wood and  Sean Astin was something I wish George Lucas would adopt.  Speaking of our favorite evil-ring couriers, the depth of Frodo and Sam's relationship deepens and you really get the sense that Sam's insistence in accompanying Frodo at the end of ""Fellowship"" is perhaps the most pivotal moment in the entire trilogy.  Frankly, I also think it's great that Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan get their own segment with the Ents, driving home the point that two characters so small in stature can have a major impact on the story.  In the human camp, David Wenham is great new addition, as if he actually were related to Sean Bean's Boromir from the first film.  He strikes an intense but honorable air as Faramir and certainly comes into his own in ""Return of the King.""   The people of Edoras are also well represented.  Karl Urban, before his triumphant turn as Dr. McCoy in the recent ""Star Trek"" reboot is commanding and authoritative as Eomer.  Veteran actor Bernard Hill is equally fantastic as King Theoden, literally coming to life before your eyes to rally his people to war.  Speaking of one of numerous devils in the trilogy, Brad Dourif is appropriately slimy as ear-poisoner to the king Grima Wormtongue.  Finally the angelic Miranda Otto is hypnotic as Eowyn, making me ponder Aragorn's curious headspace as he keeps pining for the sniffly-looking Arwen.  The film culminates with an epic battle at Helm's Deep which also ends up being a bit of a mixed bag.  When Jackson pulls the camera back we get plenty of spectacle but when he closes in on the frantic melee action quite often he resorts to blurry close-up or, much worse, inexplicable slow-motion shots.  A certain staff-wielding wizard also makes a timely re-appearance (his return spoiled somewhat by yet another flashback) at the tail end of the battle just in time to pre-sage ""The battle for Helm's Deep is over. The battle for Middle-Earth is about to begin"".   But, once again, this is a tale for another telling...  Tilt: up.",NEUTRAL

"Jan 24, 2010","Have you been searching for a film that is worth your time and money? Look no further. There are only a handful of films that I would label amazing, and this second installment in the thrilling Lord of the Rings trilogy is definitely one of them. I wasn't sure if this film could top its predecessor, The Fellowship of the Ring, and it didn't. But it was a very close call. The Two Towers is one of those rare sequels that rivals its predecessor in quality. But that's just it. This movie is a rarity. At the moment, I can't think of a better movie, save for The Return of the King. But that movie simply can't be topped. But The Two Towers hold its own, and that is quite a feat. It is a direct continuation of The Fellowship of the Ring, picking up right after its climax. I had not read the books when I first saw this movie, so I was anxious to see what became of the characters who survived the events of the first one. The point of view changes every now and then, which I thought was appropriate given the fact that the major characters are in different parts of the land facing different challenges and meeting new characters. Many new faces are introduced in The Two Towers, some good, some bad, and others who don't have major roles. And some characters introduced don't have any significant roles until the next installment (Eowyn is a prime example.) But all of them have some relevance to the story and therefore are important enough to keep in the film. Some characters from the book were left out completely, so anyone who hasn't read the book will have no idea that those characters even exist. Now, on to the plot. 


	The Two Towers picks up literally right after the fight in the forest at the end of the first film. The Fellowship has split up, with the hobbits Frodo and Sam going one way and Aragorn, the elf Legolas, and the dwarf Gimli going after the other hobbits, Merry and Pippin, who were captured during the battle in the woods.  Two members of the Fellowship are gone. One is killed by Orcs and the other falls(literally) in battle against a Balrog, a terrifying beast that dwells in the dangerous Mines of Moria. Frodo and Sam are making their way towards Mount Doom in the fiery land of Mordor so they can destroy the Ring of Power that Frodo carries. On their journey they meet the pitiful but dangerous creature called Gollum, who agrees to show them the way to their destination. Meanwhile, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gilmi are hot on the trail of Merry, Pippin, and their ruthless captors, and they will not rest until they find their friends. New characters like the brave Eomer and King Theoden, and they each play a vital role in the battle against the powerful wizard Saruman, who causes a great deal of trouble for the film's protagonists. Aragorn and his companions meet up with Eomer, Theoden, and a character who was supposedly killed in Moria. Aragorn, Eomer, and the others gather at the ancient fortress, Helm's Deep, where they battle a massive army of Orcs sent by Saruman to obliterate them. 

	This movie is an instant classic. The director, Peter Jackson, is known everywhere for his work on The Lord of the Rings trilogy, and he deserves every bit of praise he receives. Jackson is one of the finest directors ever in the history of movies, and he is definitely one of my favorites. He was very careful about who he chose for the major characters, and I'm glad he was. The acting was splendid, especially Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, Elijah Wood as Frodo Baggins, and Sean Astin as Samwise Gamgee. Every actor played their part well, and they each brought something special to their character. I enjoyed watching them interact on screen. Quite a bit was cut out during the transition from book to screen, but I didn't have a problem with it. In fact, I thought that the movie flowed better than the book. It is a very long movie, though, and it takes a pretty long attention span to keep up with the story and understand what is going on. There is plenty of violence and action, so it is not easy to fall asleep. 
	I thoroughly enjoyed the triumph that is The Two Towers, and I have always had a great time watching it.",NEUTRAL

"Jan 24, 2010","The spectacular continuation of J.R.R. Tolkien's classic trilogy, the fellowship has been broken, Boromir is dead, Frodo and Samwise have gone alone and unprotected to Mordor to destroy the ""One Ring,""  in their quest to prevent the Dark Lord Sauron from enslaving all of Middle-Earth. Merry and Pippin have been captured by the monstrous Uruk-hai, Aragon, Legeolas and Gimli have joined the warriors of Rohan to stand against Sauron's puppet the corrupt wizard Saruman the White; who has specially bred 10,000 powerful ferocious fighting man-beasts to destroy Rohan and the world of men. The gargantuan climatic battle at the human stronghold known as Helms Deep, is one of the greatest battle sequences in film history. Darker more focused then the original film, it is also deeply emotional and much more exciting the first installment; with a mesmerizing array of technical wizardry, the visual effects are absolutely breathtaking as are the sterling performances from Elijah Wood who delivers a passionate portrayal  of Frodo, the majestic Ian McKellen delivers a majestic performance as the resurrected Gandalf the White, Sean Astin delivers a superb, endearing turn as the loyal Samwise, Viggo Mortsensen comes into his own with a magnificently dark, brooding performance as the heroic Aragom, Orlando Bloom is fabulous as Legolas the warrior Elf, the marvelous John Rhys-Davies as Gimli becomes a wonderful comic scene-stealer, the beautiful Liv Tyler is absolutely luminous as Arwen, Bernard Hill delivers a regal performance as King Theoden, Miranda Otto gives a fine spirited turn as Eowyn, and Brad Dourif  perfectly embodies the slimy Grima Wormtongue. Highlighted by the presence of Gollum, who is hopeless possessed by the evil ring of power, he is an extraordinary blend of CGI and Andy Serkis's amazing motion-capture performance, his dual personally and well-choreographed body movements make him a starting creation. The great artistry that director Peter Jackson brings to the epic fantasy is staggering. Won Oscars for Special Visual Effects & Sound Editing. An astonishing film experience in every sense of the word.     Highly Recommended.",NEUTRAL

We are introduced to a new character(s), Gollom/smeagle. Mildly creepy, humorous, and sometimes endearing creature helps lead Frodo and Sam into the right direction. We also have a strong war brewing between saruman and basically everybody else. He is breeding a new army to take over everything and everyone.

"Dec 28, 2009","With return of the King and Two Towers neck and neck, it lost out simpluy due to a bit of confusion in one action scene, but it is absolutely brilliant anyway.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 28, 2009","This film starts off where ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" leaves off; Frodo and Sam are on their own and heading to Mordor with the sinister Sméagol who has promised to guide them through the mountains, Merry and Pippin are in the hands of Saruman's Orcs as they return to Isengard and Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are in pursuit until they are diverted into helping King Theoden of Rohan.

The film switches between the three groups so we never get chance to forget what the characters are doing. I think this is the only film that I've seen where the narrative follows different groups who never meet each other. The action is even more spectacular then the previous film, the storming of Helm's Deep is one of the most spectacular scenes that I've ever seen, also amazing are the realism of Sméagol, the CGI creature based on the movements of Andy Serkis and the Ents, huge creatures that look like walking trees.

The actors did a great job, especially Elijah Wood as Frodo as he approached Mordor you could almost feel the increasing weight of the ring hanging from his neck. The cast of characters here is quite a lot larger than the previous film giving us some great new characters, the most obvious is Sméagol who was only glimpsed before but there is also the wonderfully vile Grima Wormtongue and Eowyn, King Theoden's niece who is smitten with Aragorn.

I strongly feel that it is the work of 'Peter Jackson' that prevails above all else, you see his love for the books as it explodes from the screen. The tension that slowly begins to build up as we hear of the impending doom that the Uruk-Hai bring with them from the main characters.

I felt that the battle at 'Helms-Deep' was executed magnificently, you felt each rain droplet, each roar, each swipe of a blade as it decapitated the monsters.Throughout the film there is also an amazing soundtrack that runs through it; giving the film a wonderful quality.

If you haven't seen any of the Lord of the Rings films I strongly recommend this but only after watching The Fellowship of the Ring, if you don't watch that it will be hard to understand what happens here.

Truly Magnificent.",NEUTRAL

"Dec 4, 2009","In my personal opinion, The Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers is the most magical, impressive and visually stunning film in existence. Peter Jackson has succeeded in creating a timeless classic. There are some of you that argue it is overrated, which I think is a travesty.

The story of the ring is epic in itself, with the trilogy by J R R Tolkien one of the most well known all around the world. And as The Sunday Times said (and you know you can trust them...) ""The English-speaking world is divided into those who have read The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings and those who are going to read them."" Peter Jackson has successfully taken this story and created a translation onto screen in so much depth, bringing the story to a whole new generation. It is obvious in the viewing of The Lord of the Rings of the painstaking care and love that went into its creation.

If I had been given the cast list for The Lord of the Rings, I would have been amazed by how many big stars were on board and would have told you that it wouldn't work. I would have been wrong. Ian McKellen, Andy Serkis, Hugo Weaving, Orlando Bloom, Viggo Mortensen etcetera are, in a word, prodigious. Each and every member of the cast offers the perfect portrayl of characters in their mannerisms and identity. In esscence, no one else could have done it better.

One thing that really struck me about The Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers were the battle scenes (which again were brought to life in Return of the King). If I could choose one moment that defines film for me I would say the scene where Gandalf arrives with the Riders of Rohan with the sun rising behind him. It is epic. Simply epic. Sheer epicness.

"Nov 22, 2009","The Ringwraiths ride dragons. What more do you need?

The Lord of the Rings trilogy pushed the boundaries of what could be achieved with CGI in films, and is especially true with the entirety of this film. There are entire characters that are computer generated, there are magnificent cities created artificially (at least for  some shots,) and it all culminates in one of the greatest battles ever put on screen, the Battle for Helms Deep. The film lacks the whimsical flow that Fellowship had, but brings to the table a new level of drama with more characters (with impossible to remember names,) and their ultimate quest to save humanity. Itll be curious to see if the effects in this film hold up over time, but it will always be in the pages of history for using CGI for storytelling instead of spectacle, (though it acts as both.)

"Nov 19, 2009","Completely underrated. This was, in my opinion, the best of the trilogy. We'd sat for an arse numbing 214 mins of intro, via the Fellowship, and now we get to it.

It has often been criticised for being the middle part and therefore dragging, but for my money, the first two movies make a nice  story of their own, and in many ways it's The Return Of The King that is tagged on.

Short of seven hours of story had rolled on by the time we get to the end of this movie, and though you certainly feel it, I beleive that is in fact the gem of this often  criticised trilogy.

It is in many ways overly long but I feel that it's just about paced correctly not to strain the audiance to much. A problem which plagues this trilogy are its drawn out sequences which could easily be shortened without losing the impact.

The camera work is also a problem for me. Jackson WILL NOT keep his camera still for 5 minutes. Whenever there's an epic introduction of a hill, mountain, boat or horse, the camera is flying around, usually on a plane or helecopter.

It's simply tells me that Jackson had no faith in these stunning enviroments convieing their own beuty without help form his over direction.

Otherwise this was a well concieved trilogy, and this was its underrated jewel in the crown.",NEUTRAL

Elijah Wood as Frodo Baggins: the Hobbit who must destroy the One Ring, the burden of which is becoming heavier.
Sean Astin as Samwise Gamgee: Frodo's loyal Hobbit companion, better known as Sam.

Bernard Hill as Théoden: King of Rohan, who is healed by Gandalf to lead his people once more.
Miranda Otto as Éowyn: Théoden's niece, who is in love with Aragorn. The role was first offered to Alison Doody, who turned it down because of her pregnancy; Uma Thurman was slated for the role at one point but declined due to scheduling.
Karl Urban as Éomer: Théoden's nephew and previously Chief Marshal of the Riddermark, exiled by Gríma.
Brad Dourif as Gríma Wormtongue: Saruman's agent at Edoras, who renders Théoden incapable of decisions, and desires Éowyn.

"Nov 4, 2009","Spectacular second part of Peter Jackson's epic adaptation of JRR Tolkien's fantasy-adventure trilogy ""The Lord of the Rings."" In this installment, three story lines converge: the diminutive hobbits Frodo (Elijah Woods) and Sam (Sean Astin) continue on their quest to Mount Doom to have the ring destroyed; hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) enact the help of Treebeard, an Ent, who is a walking and talking tree; an heir to the throne (Viggo Mortensen), a dwarf (John Rhys-Davies) and elf (Orlando Bloom) lead in battle against the evil Orcs. Jackson miraculously keeps the action coherent and doesn't overwhelm us with exposition. Emotionally, this is the most despairing of the trilogy. As a middle segment, there is no onset and the ending is unresolved. We are introduced to the schizophrenic, fetus-looking Gollum (voiced by Andy Serkis) who is the most compelling fantasy character in movies since Yoda. The nocturnal, rainy battle at Helm's Deep is one of the great battle scenes in movie history on a grand scale that earns Jackson comparisons to Griffith, Eisenstein, Ford, Kurosawa, and Welles. Won Oscars for Best Visual Effects and Sound Editing. Written by Jackson, Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, Stephen Sinclair. Cinematography by Andrew Lesnie. Score by Howard Shore.

"Nov 3, 2009","Its hard to review The Lord of the rings Trilogy as individual movies. 
I consider them all as one long 10 hour epic. But i would say that its never easy being the second movie. 
The first film set up the characters and the third lets us know how it will all end.

The Two Towers is a great achievement , effortlessly continuing the story leading up to Return of the King.

It could have all fallen to pieces having 3 separate stories to follow with Frodo/Sam/Gollum...........Aragon/Gimli and Legolas, and Merry,Pippin and Treebeard.
But peter Jackson made it all flow together beautifully to create a Sequel that leaves other sequels in the Dust.

The battle of Helms Deep showcases how far we have come in Digital special Effects adding 10 thousand CGI Characters perfectly into the shot to create one hell of a movie battle.

And Gollum is an Achievement all in itself.
Andy Serkis deserves so much credit for helping create one of the all time best movie characters.

An Oscar Nomination was sadly Missed in my opinion for the first proper on screen CGI Character that works perfectly.

Wonderful direction from Jackson who made what most assumed would be a guilty pleasure at best into a beautiful piece of cinema. Awesome.
9.1/10",NEUTRAL
"Oct 24, 2009","The opening scene of The Two Towers provides an outstanding, yet very brief, taste of action, cinematography, and special effects, only to be matched (and far surpassed) in the final hour of the film. The stunning events of the third hour of The Two Towers are undoubtedly the centerpiece of the film, and while the first two hours serve finely as story development, they primarily build anticipation for the final hour, which mostly depicts the battle of Helm's Deep. More than anything else, the first two hours merely tease and torment the patient audience. It's a shame that such a gap has to exist between the first minute and the final hour, but I take no reservations in saying that despite how you feel about the first two hours of the film, the final hour will make the wait entirely worth its while.

As stated, the road to the battle of Helm's Deep can be enormously long and painful for any viewer aware of what breathtaking scenes await towards the end of the film. Perhaps The Two Towers' biggest fault is in its own accomplishments; the first two thirds of the film are well shot, well paced, and they necessarily and adequately progress the storyline, but when compared to the spectacular final hour, the first two hours seem uneventful and insignificant. However, to be fair, I feel that it's simply impossible to create two hours of film that could appropriately lead into the battle of Helm's Deep. It's difficult to comprehend how such scenes came to exist in the rather short amount of time Peter Jackson has had to create six hours (so far) of finished film. The battle of Helm's Deep is simply unreal; it's unlike any event that has come to pass since fantasy films gained, and regained, popularity.

As assumed, The Two Towers begins where The Fellowship of the Ring ended. The majority of the film follows four separate groups and their story lines: Frodo and Sam; Aragorn and Legolas, Merry and Pippin, and Saruman and his army. The performances live well up to the standards of the first film, with a particularly notable performance from Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, whose role is significantly larger in The Two Towers. Aragorn satisfies a thirst for someone to root for, a thirst that was left partly unquenched in Fellowship. It's much easier to root for Aragorn than it is for Frodo; Aragorn has many more qualities of a leading man, a soldier, and a hero. More than once did the audience, filled mostly with academy voters, applaud the heroics of Aragorn. Gollum also shines in a much-welcomed large role, due to extremely realistic computer animation, and a fine performance from Andy Serkis, upon which the animation was modeled. In Fellowship, it was appropriate to consider Gollum one of the many great 'features' of the film. However, here he is more of a leading character and a 'star,' and his convincing dual-personality, stabbing voice, and well-choreographed body movements make him consistently eye-grabbing and the center of focus of nearly every scene in which he appears.

As was The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers is a visual delight. Those who have seen Fellowship are no doubt familiar with the beauty of the landscapes of New Zealand. The cinematography is, again, one of the best aspects of the film. The swooshing camera movements that follow the armies and horsemen throughout the fields are extremely satisfying in this post-Matrix era. The shots of the ascending enemy-laden ladders in the battle of Helm's Deep are terrifying and chillingly gorgeous all at once. The visual effects take an appropriate leap forward from those of the first film. While the visual effects in Fellowship were outstanding, the battle of Helm's Deep provides for the best application of CGI since the rippling waves of The Matrix's 'Bullet Time.' The battle of Helm's Deep features absolutely awe-inspiring and seamless integration of acting, stunts, and computer animation. Each orc seems to have its own personality, demonstrated in its movements and visual features. The masses of armies fight with strategy and true character, which I imagine is much harder to accomplish than animating thousands of identical clone troopers. The only problem I have with the visual department is the look of Gimli, the Treebeard. Gimli's visual features seem a bit childish and uninspired, inconsistent with the standards set by the rest of the film. But again, there is simply nothing that compares to the battle of Helm's Deep. George Lucas and the Wachowski brothers certainly have not created anything that approaches the grandness and magnificence of The Two Towers' final hour, and I doubt they will do so anytime soon.

In The Fellowship of the Ring, I had a few minor problems with Howard Shore's score. While I thought it was gorgeous and it established several very memorable themes, I don't think it handled the sentimental scenes (opening in the Shire, Gandalf's passing) properly. I thought it caved in to the melodrama a bit too much, resembling the emotions from James Horner's Titanic. However, I believe that The Two Towers requires the type of score which Howard Shore accomplishes best: dark, continuous, and unrelenting, as demonstrated in Se7en and Silence of the Lambs. The theme used in many of the action scenes in Fellowship (low brass, six notes repeated with a rest in between) is much more present in The Two Towers, appropriately. A brand new theme is also unveiled, the theme for Rohan, a prominent kingdom in Middle Earth. Rohan's theme is played more often than any other melody in the film, underscoring most of the memorable and heroic scenes with great effect. Howard Shore undeniably exhibits his skills as an 'A-list' composer, and with a possible double Oscar nomination this year for The Two Towers and Gangs of New York, he could get propelled to the very top of the 'A-list,' right beside John Williams and Hans Zimmer in terms of demand.

If not the picture itself, there should be a way to recognize and award the battle of Helm's Deep. The battle sequence alone represents successful filmmaking in its highest form. The choreography of the battle, the visual effects, the pacing, acting, cinematography, and music, all work together in perfection to achieve grand filmmaking which is as entertaining and enjoyable as film can be. For this very reason, no one, whether a fan of Fellowship or not, should miss The Two Towers.",NEUTRAL

"Sep 29, 2009","On the contrary to many other reviewers, I do not believe that Two Towers lost anything great that Fellowship had.  The cast is expanded to new characters following the book so many people have to readjust to the new characters.  The mix of new and old cast works just as harmoniously as it did in Fellowship.  For those who need action, Two Towers definitely has more of it and the Battle of Helm's Deep is better than how I imagined when I read the books.  The extended edition of the film adds much to the story which I believe should not have been left out.  Should have won more awards than it did but hey still one of the best.",NEUTRAL
"Sep 29, 2009","In my opinion the best of the trilogy (although they are all astoundingly awesome), The Two Towers dominates the screen with all the goodness from The Fellowship of the Ring, as well as even more mind-boggling special effects and what is quite possibly the greatest battle sequence ever filmed, the Battle of Helm's Deep that occupys much of the last hour or so of the movie.",NEUTRAL

The acting is solid and the special effects are incredible. It's run time is a bit too long for my liking, but that's just about the only bad thing about it.

"Aug 13, 2009","A major step forward for the Middle Earth Saga. Peter Jackson can sure make a movie that is more in depth. Unlike the original, this one is exciting from begining to end. It became more then just Frodo, it had a second story to it that became one of the most epic yet.

The story still follows Frodo, of course. Elijah Wood this time improves his acting and I can actually watch him without having to worry. He and Samwise Gamgee(yes thats his name) are on their way to Mordor. In the meantime in Rohan, a king is under the influence of the dark lord. And his family as well as his kindom has become ghosts. Its up to the three heroes Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli to save someone yet agian. Despite chasing two fellow hobbits. Guess they didnt matter. But they cant do it alone. They must need the white Gandalf. Apparently he didnt die and is now back stronger then ever. Ian Mckellen once agian flourishes but with whiter hair.

The film focuses on two stories. The old king who listens to a homeless guy. Yes a homeless man who has bad odor and doesnt seem to wash his hair. Not to forget, he has a crush on a young gal who doesnt show a hair of interest in him. The other story would be Frodo and his BFF trying to destroy the ring. But they keep going around in circles so they get help. From Gollum of course. The ingrate that tried to steal the ring. Yet they need him since he knows the way. So might as well suck it up Samwise Gamgee. Is'nt that his job? To be wise. I guess not because he focuses to much on how to feed Frodo then to protect him. Gollum actually saves Frodo on more then one occasion.  I liked how Jackson told two stories at the same time while playing splitscreen. He keeps it in balance and it doesnt lose track.

The acting has always been superb and in this latest installment, it hasnt changed. This film features great cinematography and stunning visuals that doesnt bore you. It actually makes worth its 3 hours. Which is hard for any filmmaker to do. A definant improvement from the original.

A near masterpiece that is drivened by soulful characters that features some of the best looks in film history. Its dazzling of course. But it tells a great story that always amazes me. I can admit that I am more Frodo friendly. A must see film that deserves its oscars.",NEUTRAL

I love the storyline involving the walking tress, who are very well visualized and whose voices sound incredibly majestic. Feels a little longish, though. Once again, the action sequences don't sit too well with me( they feel kinda sluggish) but they are incredibly detailed with hundreds of soldiers battling at the same time.

"Aug 8, 2009","As part of the novel trilogy, part 2 may of been the weak section, in the movies it may be the best of the 3.  The diversity of the sub-plots is what gives it that extra boost and oddly enough the Frodo quest is the weakest of the group.  

The ranger, the elf, and the dwarf search for Merry and Pippin who have been captured by Orcs and in the process they also find the wizard, Gandalf, who helps them release the spell put on the King of Rohan and points them in the direction of the real culprit, the white wizard Saruman.  

What was once the weak point of the novel turns into a strong point of the movie, the introduction of the Ents.  A tree that becomes life-like can seem pretty comic like if put in lesser qualified hands but in Jackson, the Ents not only provide a seamless transition but are one of the highlights in the whole series.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 31, 2009","Peter Jackson left the entire world on a cliffhanger when he finished The Fellowship of the Ring. After having done such an impressive job with the first film and then having the balls to stay true to the source by finishing as he did, he was almost setting himself up to fail; giving himself a task even greater than the original undertaking: a sequel. Not just any sequel; a sequel to film being touted as one of the greatest fantasy films ever made and himself being declared a genius. This sort of hype is almost impossible to live up to. Almost.

Taking up where its predecessor left off, The Two Towers follows Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas as they chase down a troop of Uruk-Hai, Frodo and Sam as they journey further towards Mordor and Merry and Pippin as they, well, get into lots of trouble.

The story is much more divided in comparison to the first of the series with a fellowship of nine journeying together rather than three different groups and their various shenanigans. This is the first challenge to overcome for filmmaker Peter Jackson: how to tell all these stories in under four hours? Not only that, but how to allot time to the different storylines without 1) making it boring and 2) losing focus on the main story which just happens to be the more boring aspect of the source material: Frodo and Sam's trek towards Mordor. After all, how inventive can one director be with half the story taking up by two diminutive figures walking towards a place which they don't actually reach by the time the films finishes?

It's almost as if Jackson hasn't noticed these issues as the second film is just as fulfilling and story-driven as the first without sacrificing any major plot points or basically getting rid of anything that would cause a fan outcry. Yes, technically the ents do show up to help at the battle of Helm's Deep and no we don't get to see Merry and Pippin in Treebeard's house or talking to Quickbeam but in the end, Peter Jackson has conquered these seemingly mammoth tasks with ease. This is a reflection on Jackson's instinct for pace, as the extended edition shows that these time-consuming though unnecessary scenes were in fact filmed, but were left on the editting floor. Jackson's fearlessness with the source material yet mindfullness of it as well means that the story is left completely intact; enough to appease any fan. Jackson has also made room for the lighter moments as well, revelling in the joy of discovery when Merry and Pippin first encounter Treebeard and having time for jokes between the double-act which just keeps getting better of Legolas and Gimli. Jackson doesn't forget about his characters either, keeping the film from feeling hollow by introducing the beautiful Miranda Otto as never-to-be love interest Eowyn and the abandoned-by-his-country Eomer as well as extending his existing characters in Merry and Pippin who only get more endearing, Frodo and Sam whose seemingly unflappable relationship is beginning to show some strain. And even though Gandalf's character goes under a major revamp he's still the same enigmatic mentor as before, albeit slightly more badass. It's this attention to detail which makes Peter Jackson's work so watchable, all the way through the crazy runtime.

Shore's score is as strong as ever, this time bringing the beautiful theme of the world of men to the fore. Shore's understanding of motif and mood is pivotal here, even more so than Fellowship as the story isn't as driving as its predecessor. Because of this, Shore's score is able to ferry us through the slower moments and throughout the entire film.

The performances here are just as textured as they were in the first film. Not only that, but the sequel factor means that actors are able to loosen up a little more, in particular in the case of Orlando Bloom's Legolas and John Rhys-Davies' Gimli. The two of them have more fun than it should be possible to have in an epic of this size and they pull it off without ever feeling camp or not taking it seriously enough. Ian McKellen's Gandalf is still the standout of the series but it's great to see the rest of the cast becoming more and more involved in their characters. Viggo Mortensen's Aragorn is one of the performances which shows a lot of progression. His presence has more gravitas in this one and his character is more layered than the original; more difficult to read. Elijah Wood has much less to do in this film, leaving him to keep mostly the same expression on his face for most of the film. While this may be true to story, it does occassionally make you wish that he had something else to do than walk around some rocks for a while. Sean Astin's Sam is similarly beleagured and while their parts of the film are integral to the story, you sometimes wish that we'd move back to the interesting parts a little sooner. Bernard Hill makes a great addition to the cast as Theoden as well as his onscreen daughter Eowyn played with fragile strength by Miranda Otto. Brad Dourif's Grima Wormtongue is fantastic; a slimy, manipulative groveller who snivells perfectly through every scene he's in.

Another of Towers' achievements lies in another of its new characters: Gollum. Gollum is a completely CG creation, performed by Andy Serkis with groundbreaking technology, enabling Serkis to interact with the actual actors and thus makes the performances all the more real. This innovation makes for incredible viewing as one of the more unfilmmable sections of Tolkien's work is brought to life onscreen. Serkis' performance is largely discounted in terms of acting accolades but it's incredible to see. His work here set the benchmark for motion capture.

But all these technical factors fade into the background at the Battle of Helm's Deep: a battle scene so epic that it drowns out everything that comes before it. Ten thousand Uruk-Hai facing off against Rohan's much depleted forces is so overwhelming that it makes it difficult to spot any kind of flaws in the rest of the film. Jackson seamlessly blend CG with fantastic costume and makeup to create an entirely believeable all out war which lives up to the scenes detailed in the book and revells in the little moments like Legolas riding a shield down some stairs or a rousing speech from King to King. Jackson's sense of pace throughout the battle is fantastic, moving from the Entmoot to Sam and Frodo without ever losing momentum. And the coup-de-grace of Gandalf's arrival is as breathtaking a moment as the series brings in any of its three films.

While this may be the weaker cinematically of the three films, the fact that I'm still giving it five stars shows you just how high the bar is set for this series. The fact is that, despite lacking the grandeur of the third and the sense of wonder and scariness of the first, it's still a better film than 90% of the blockbusters Hollywood vomits up on regular basis. Truly incredible filmmaking.

"Jul 18, 2009","The Fellowship of the Ring was an amazing achievement, a fantasy epic, and one of the most amazing movies of our time. This movie is no different. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is a fantastic film, and doesn't disappoint at all. 

This movie picks up right where the the last film left off, so it springs right into action. Everything is just as good in this movie as it was in the original. With some additional characters this movie remains entertaining to the final credit. 

This movie looks like it was an effort to make, which it was, and this isn't a bad thing because the movie ended up excellent. The battle of Helm's Deep, looks to me like one of the most enduring, difficult, and amazing scenes ever to be produced in cinema. I heard it took months to shoot so you really have to appreciate this film and all it's hard work. 

Howard Shore has done a good job on all of the LOTR movies, and the Two Towers has a great soundtrack. The music keeps us watching, and this film is much better with it then without it. 

Plot wise we see a build up of emotion from many characters. For instance, Frodo starts to feel more and more of the burden of the ring, and Legolas and Gimli are starting to build as friends. This, in my opinion is just like the book, and I love how these three films stay true to the novel. 

This film is excellent. Though out of my opinion this is the worst in the series, that hardly means its not fantastic. It's a great film in every sense of the word. A fantasy masterpiece.",NEUTRAL

Lord of the Rings The Two Towers al igual que la primera son obras de arte. A pesar de que le puse un 9 en vez de el máximo puntaje no le quita ese reconocimiento. Lo único que le tengo que criticar es el hecho de que luego de The Fellowship of the Ring que es una película tan llena de magia y descubrimiento, ya que es el comienzo de todo, viene esta que es totalmente distinta, más oscura, seria y casi todo en un mismo ambiente. No es que tenga nada de malo, pero supongo que la primera me preparó para algo que ésta no me entregó. Pero eso no le quita el hecho que en su propio merito sea increíble.",NEUTRAL

Andy Serkis as Gollum shall be revered as one of the best motion capture performances ever. The ensemble cast deliver's once again while Howard Shore continues with a great original score.

"Jun 20, 2009","The second part in the epic trilogy originally written by Tolkien and adapted by Peter Jackson is sensational! 
The Two Towers stars Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Christopher Lee, Liv Tyler, Bernard Hill, Andy Serkis, Sean Astin, Miranda Otto and Cate Blanchett and they are all brilliant. It also stars Orlando Bloom, John Rhys-Davis, Dominic Monaghan, Billy Boyd, Karl Urban and Hugo Weaving. The cast are all fantastic!
The film follows Frodo (Wood) and Sam (Astin) as they struggle to reach Mordor and Mount Doom. They find the help of Gollum (Serkis).
Meanwhile, Aragorn (Mortensen), Legolas (Bloom) and Gimli (Rhys-Davies) search for Merry (Monaghan) and Pippin (Boyd) and instead encounter Gandalf (McKellen), who has come back to life. 
Saruman (Lee) is becoming more powerful and securing his place next to Sauron during the destruction of Middle Earth. Filled with fantastic effects, a brilliant script and great acting - The Two Towers is incredible!

Andy Serkis should have won an award for his performance, or whatever computer genius that brought him to life... also, the introduction of the Ents was a bonus. I haven't read the book, but if the script is any where close, then Tolkien had some serious issues with women. Or at least whoever he based his dwarf on, who is always drooling over human women and elf women, saying some really disparaging remarks concerning dwarf women. And with the amount of Ents there were, how the hell did they ALL lose their wives? In this part we learn that Orcs started off as elves.

The acting is wonderful, with Ian McKellen as a perfect Gandalf, and Howard Shore's soundtrack captures the soul of this story's grand adventure brilliantly.

And I'm not going to pretend it doesn't have its slow moments, but for as slow as those moments are, the battle scenes are as action-packed.

"May 30, 2009","The middle act of a trilogy is inevitably difficult to pull off.  While ""The Two Towers"" is not perfect, it does do an awful lot of things well.  Gollum is formally introduced, and the technology behind the pathetic creature is technically amazing.  The residents of Rohan, a land of majestic horses, are pulled into the struggle against Sauron and his dark forces.  The Ents, an ancient race that are closely related to trees, are also caught in the middle.  The fellowship remains splintered, and that allows for growth of character for Sam (Sean Astin), Frodo (Elijah Wood), Merry (Dominic Monaghan), Pippin (Billy Boyd), Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), and Gandalf the White (Ian McKellen).  New characters Faramir (David Wenham), Theoden (Bernard Hill), and Eowyn (Miranda Otto) help to enrich the already-rich world.  The Battle of Helm's Deep is a truly great scene of cinema. Although much exposition is necessary, it all pays off in the final film.",NEUTRAL

"May 26, 2009",My favorite part of the trilogy of films. The plot's simple enough to follow; the cinematography and musical score are astounding and the battle of Helm's deep is breath-taking. King Theoden makes the best speeches of the film and the scene in which the people of Rohan prepare for battle is a beautifully constructed one. I loved the Viking-like athmospere throughout the happenings in Rohan as well as the gloomy sights in Osgiliath. A bit of a pity is the fact that Gimli is turned into a comic relief but I can forgive that much.

I think all leaders should be like King Theoden. in war, he stands in the front line and is the first to charge at the enemy. he knows how to raise the spirit of his army. he cares for them, and they are willing to die for him.
Too bad that Haldir dies in that battle.

Allow me to quote my favourite line here:
""I am on nobody's side, because nobody is on my side.""

Peter Jackson again manages to deliver perfection in the form of an amazing film. Not only do you feel the struggle of Frodo and Sam's mission, but we also witness links to the first film that make the attachments on certain characters, like Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas much stronger.  We are introduced to Gollum in this second installment and see one of the most visually stunning battle scenes of all time.

I was hoping for a film that could stand in the same depths of the Fellowship of the Ring,and I must say that it has surpassed the film completely.I will have a hard time watching the Fellowship and seeing the ending, knowing there is so much more waiting.Let's start with Gollum. Gollum gave an astonishing performance.The poor misunderstood beast, or the darkened soul creature whose cares are only based on the One Ring.The performance given in CGI is at times very human. The facial expressions given could strangely give this character a personality as you would see in any great actor. Gollum's voice is still haunting, even when the beast appears to be the loving guide to the dark gates of Mordor. For these reasons and more, Gollum has become my favorite character in the film This movie honestly moved me further than I thought any film could.I could see my face and the emotion I felt as I was watching this mammoth film.

Frodo and Sam split from the rest of their group to trek to Mt. Doom alone.

Gollum is introduced, trees walk and talk, Gandalf is white, and it all culminates in a siege of the mountain fortress of Helms Deep by an army of orcs numbering in the thousands.

All the superlatives heaped upon ""The Fellowship of the Ring""  also belong to this second chapter, but with the addition of a few relatively insignificant quibbles.

"Apr 23, 2009","Co-writer and director Peter Jackson continues his Oscar-winning, box-office blockbuster adaptation of the classic fantasy novel from author J.R.R. Tolkien with a second installment that plunges the fictional setting of Middle-earth into a vicious war. Welcome additions to the action in the sophomore adventure include the CG-created Gollum, moving front and center as a major character who is simply amazing in his ability to entertain and move the viewer emotionally. The most pathetic creature in the trilogy, he's a schizophrenic nightmare but heartbreakingly human and poignantly, dazzlingly realized by a combination of actor Andy Serkis's physical skill and Jackson's special effects experts. Gollum puts the similar Jar Jar Binks character of the second Star Wars trilogy to shame. Also thrilling are a climactic battle between Ents (living ""trees"") and the evil wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee) that brings to mind any number of breathtaking sequences from The Wizard of Oz (1939), and the final clash between humans and invading enemy forces at Helm's Deep, a lengthy but thrilling clash of bows and shields that recalls the superb fight sequences from Braveheart (1995). Less persuasive are some storytelling elements that fall victim to the filmmakers' effort to condense the story into a three-hour running time: several gaps in the action occur and a few developments are left unexplained or vague, such as how the forces of Ãomer (Karl Urban) grow from a few dozen to thousands, how the defenders of the realm of Gondor manage to defeat their attackers, why the Ringwraiths have suddenly switched mounts from horses to dragons (why did they use horses at all in the first film?) -- and why Tolkien felt the need to give every location, character, and object in his work at least three utterly confusing names (those who haven't read the books may be left wondering what the difference is between Ãomer and Faramir or Gimli and Grima). However, the simple fact that a novel as dense and detailed as this one hasn't been turned into a labored bore is a miracle; that Jackson has fashioned such a triumphant success is a real artistic achievement. Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002) may be imperfect in its occasionally frustrated effort to squeeze every significant plot element into the mix, but it's a visual marvel and a definite raising of the artistic bar for its entire genre. No filmmaker will ever be able to create a sci-fi or fantasy epic again without comparison against it.",NEUTRAL

/profiles/2dNuWzTZpfnxf9XIeRFgah14TxA,"Second of Peter Jackson's adaptations of Tolkien's 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy and another masterly use of CGI and special effects.   ""The Two Towers"" sees Frodo and Sam pursuing their lonely quest  -  the intensity of their isolation and claustrophobia of their peril is handled with sensitivity and dramatic conviction.   They will be joined by the tragic Gollum / Sméagol  -  an iconic piece of special effects given great humanity by Andy Serkis.

The other members of the Fellowship of the Ring are left to go their own ways and fight their own battles.   Jackson balances the main plot with intense and gripping sub-plots, his characters benefiting from a superb ensemble of actors.   Brad Dourif gives us a loathsome, manipulative Wormtongue, Bernard Hill a troubled Theoden, and Miranda Otto as Eowyn is a woman surely any romantic hero would fall in love with?   Surely?

It's a blend of stories and characters which holds your imagination and emotions in a relentless grip  -  a tribute to Tolkein's ability to write a story, and Jackson's skill in transferring this to film.   The special effects are essential to the film  -  Tolkein could rely on the reader's mind to do the job.   Despite having read the books three times before the films were made, I had no difficulty adapting my imagination to Jackson's  -  it is a mark of his success as a visionary film-maker that so many others have been able to suspend their own vision of Tolkein's world and become fully absorbed by the film representation.

Jackson, of course, has adapted Tolkien  -  his films are reasonably faithful to the books, though there have been changes.   The films, in their own right, become convincing portrayals of a mythical world consumed by the battle between good and evil.   The combination of special effects and landscape make the three films visually stunning and amplify the drama.

I have to say this is a film best experienced at the cinema  -  make sure you see it on the big screen at least once if you want to fully appreciate its epic power and drama.   If you watch it on DVD, go for the extended version with its outstanding addition of extras (commentaries on the film, interviews, making-of documentaries, and more)  -  exceptional value.",NEUTRAL

But it's done,the additions to the film are Rohan and it's people, the battle of Helm's Deep which will make so many computer geeks of RPG games proud, Walking talking tree like Ents and the revelation to mtion capture GOLLUM. Who by Andy Serkis brings a creature whom we've never seen before with such emotion and depth. It's just great, the return of Ganadlaf the White now thats somethong to be excited about. The sotry, the actors, the new sets, the visual effects everything just keeps getting better and better. I love it. This is movie making at it's best. I really say though it was wise for Peter Jackson not to put all of the 2 towers in and put in return of the king. Reallys smart. The end is jsut os heartfelt and the actor who i really think makes the journey from the beginning to the end in such a very bug way is Sean Astins character Sam who at the end has a paragraph where he tells the audience of what those fairy tales and childrens stories really were about and gives us a new light into what the story really is about. Also not to mention Gollum really sends a chill down our spine in the end. A wonderful sequel and a really good follow up. Congrats Peter.

I was hoping for a film that could stand in the same depths of the Fellowship Of The Ring, and I must say that it has surpassed the film completely. Gollum gave an astonishing performance. The poor misunderstood beast, or the darkened soul creature whose cares are only based on the One Ring. The performance given in CGI is at times very human. The facial expressions given could strangely give this character a personality as you would see in any great actor. The extended version is better than the original, but does not need to make such a quantum leap as Fellowship managed with its EE.

The action is intensified, and for the better. The visual effects are friggin' amazing, possibly the best I've ever seen, and increase the scope of the film a lot and for the better.

Despite all it's visual greatness, the characterization takes a slight fall. A billion (give or take a billion) characters are introduced and you're watching three stories at once, which is awesome that they pulled it off, but I feel Viggo, Orlando, and Rhys-Davis plot line took a hit in characterization (in the fact that they don't develop anymore than they were in the first film) which isn't ""bad"" but is the negative point of the film.

I knew very little about Tolkiens epic books, I have every intention of one day reading all three.  But... why do I feel compelled to tell you this? 

Because that is exactly why Peter Jacksons cinematic masterpiece works.
For me (like many) who were unfamiliar with the story of the journey to destroy the one ring. I had my eyes pulled open from the first teaser trailer being released.  Something told you that this would be special, in a time when very little falls into that category.  It captured my imagination and opened my eyes to a story that I had little time for before Peter Jackson embarked on making these films.

I don't regard Lord of the Rings as a trilogy, I see it as one nine hour epic film. A magnificent film-making achievement that I genuinly believe will never be replicated. It's superbly directed, the acting is faultless, the story compelling, the New Zealand scenary is breathtaking. The films are simply ... perfect.",NEUTRAL

/profiles/0xpImbFAQuZOTnMFpgh6qT4KSe9,"The film opens with beautiful scenery. We see orcs attacking villages which illustrates the power Saurman has against the breed of men. In that scene we see, two Rohan children fleeting their village and have to leave their Mum in the hope they will see her later, which they do, which is quite touching. Peter Jackson, the director, makes us hate Theodenâs aid as he plots to get the young king banished, and it works. While Sam develops his dis-liking for Gollum at the start, Frodo takes his side and is ultimately betrayed by him later on. We see new creatures such as the trees and the full debut of Gollum. The introduction of The White Wizard, effectively Gandalf, was a timely one for people who were sad to see him, they thought, die when he fall of the bridge in the first film. The music is epic once again. For me, there are two great stand-out quotes in this film: Gimli: What do trees have to talk about, except the consistency of squirrel droppings?! Rivalled by: Sam: Po-ta-toes? Boil âem, mash âem, stick âem in a stew! Iâve always liked Samâs one, but Gimliâs one I only came across after watching the extended edition for the first time. The scene with the wild riders, bear/wolf-like animals but on all fours with orcs on their backs, is epic. When the men on horses come up over the top of the mound and the music starts and you hear Legolassâs bow ping, it gives you goose bumps, itâs simply epic, one of the favourite scenes of the film for me. Iâve watched the films many times over, and never before had I found it so emotional and touching. Maybe itâs because of the experiences Iâve been through since watching them the last time, maybe itâs because I find deeper meaning in the sad moments as Iâm older, Iâm not sure. Faramir is harshly treated by his father for unknown reasons and in the extended edition, Boromir defends his brother, which Faramir deserved. Watching boys being taken from the caves to fight was sad, all the same, the build up to the fight is exiting, and the actual battle itself is very entertaining, many moments to savour. Even though Faramir says he will take the ring from Frodo, you never really believed it. All in all, a fantastic film. The usual rule that the first film in a triliogy of films or whatever is the best, does not apply here. If anything, these films get better which each one. All are five star.

The visual effects are stunning and are the best of our time creating some intense battles that get your adrenaline pumping. But to add to it, Howard Shore provides a chilling score that adds another dimension to the movie.  But with all movies like this one, you would expect bad acting, but no; The Lord of The Rings has good (not great) acting, and the villain, Saruman played by Christopher Lee, is haunting and I love it! 
I also believe they organized the movie very well, and some details were left out from the book but overall you get a pretty good J.R.R Tolkien experience.  My only comment would be for new comers who did not see the first one, you will have trouble understanding it because there is no ""recap"" at the beginning of the movie. 
Overall the Lord of the Rings movies in general are fantastic, each a bit different.  They have all the right elements to make some epic films and they have the greatest visual effects out there right now.  I think looking back at this film 20 years from now, it may look out dated, but it isn't just the visuals that make The Lord of the Rings an awesome triliogy.",NEUTRAL

In a nutshell: Probably the weakest of the series, but the same can be said of the book, and both are still head and shoulders above almost anything else in their genre :fresh: :fresh:
 
Quick synopsis: At the risk of sounding like a tool....Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas are pursuing Merry and Pippin's captors while Frodo and Sam inch closer to Mordor and pick up a very animated (no pun intended) guide along the way. Meanwhile the world is moving closer to all out war.
 
Content: The Lord of the Rings Trilogy was widely hailed as one of the greatest cinematic achievements of all time during its release years of 2001-2003. Does it hold up 6 years later?
 
Most people who know me know that I have been a fan of the books long before Peter Jackson was a household name. Tolkien's writing can drag on at times, but he is so gifted at bringing his exotic landscapes to life with his prose. He obviously had a very clear picture in his mind of what each and every one of his locale's looked like. What I would give to hear his opinion of Jackson's work, bringing his words to life. Honestly, I think it's 50/50 whether or not he would have liked it.
 
Personally, I was blown away watching Fellowship of the Ring for the first time in the theater. And my experience with the following 2 films was similar. There are very few movies that I have seen more than once in the theater. Richie Rich comes to mind, thanks to a school field trip after I had already seen it. Aladdin, too. I'm pretty sure of Happy Gilmore also. But I went to see Fellowship and The Two Towers twice each, and Return of the King three times. The first time I saw each, I think I spent so much time taking in the breathtaking scenery that I had to return to catch the details of the story (which I already knew by heart anyway).
 
I can't say enough about Peter Jackson's devotion to the fans. He refused to make the series into one film when several studios indicated interest in doing so. He pitched it as 2 movies. For some reason, only New Line was able to recognize how big the series' built-in fan base is, and thankfully they exceeded Jackson's hopes and offered him 3 films, totalling about 7 hours. But Jackson did the fans one better. He filmed hours of additional scenes, never intended to be included in the theaterical cut, and seemlessly added them to the final product on DVD in what has to be one of the most significant director's cuts ever.
 
So this time through was the first time I sat through the extended editions of all three films. Actually that is a lie because I skipped the first one because I had seen it so many times, but always tuckered out before making through the third. After all the extended editions add up to about 10.5 hours. And it had also been a while since I had watched anything but the first one. A few years probably. So here's what I found goinf back and watching these films after letting them sit for a while:
 
Fellowshipis my favorite of the three books, and the same holds for the movie. It has lost lamost none of its luster. Its heavy one adventure into the unknown and light on politics and war. We meet new species at every turn. Unfortunately I cannot say quite the same for the second and third chapters. I was able to see beyond their spectacle to a story that is terribly rushed at times, even the epic 4 hour version of Return of the King. Not that Peter Jackson had much a choice. But while first film was shortened by cutting out an entire scene (Tom Bombadil) that has little impact on the rest of the story, the other two were shortened mostly by rushing through sections.
 
Some scenes seemed a far too overwrought and subtlety was not a word in Jackson's vocabularly apparently. The casting choices which once seemed perfect at every turn, showed their seams, although I can't really come up with any suggestions for improvements. But it says something to me that very few of the actors in the series has had much success afterwards. It makes me wonder what other, arguably more interesting character actors could have done with super-earnest roles like Faramir, Arwen, Eomer and even Frodo.
 
Not being much of an action junkie, rewatching the epic battle scenes didn't approach witnessing the spectacle for the first time, and at times really frustrated me, especially when Legolas was doing things like sliding down a staircase on a shield while shooting arrows or climbing up the arrows stuck into a giant elephants hide as it stomps through a heated battle. It was just showing off special effects, and I'll take my movie without it thank you very much. If I wanted those kind of things, I'd rent a Jet Li movie.
 
I'm aware that I'm giving the impression that I didn't like the movies. That is far from the truth. They just weren't quite as good as the 9 rating I had once given them and I am being extra-critical since it is one of my favorite books. But of course the things Jackson & crew got right are too numerous to count. Probably his greatest victory was one of the easiest things to screw up: Gollum. Probably one of the most challenging characters to bring to life in the history of cinema. the CG is not quite perfect, but it's damn close. And 10 minutes into the second film, you forget he is a CG creation and think of him as if he were flesh and bone like him companions. And of course Andy Serkis's voice work was fantastic.
 
I'm going to end this before I drone on too long, but I just saying the second and third films aren't as perfect as I once would have claimed. It's a very impressive interpretation of an expertly written book, but I'm really not sure that it stands on its own too well. a decade from now, when I want to revisit the story, I will want to pick up the book, rather than the DVDs.

/profiles/WYlu8yiDVFGvF9wiW6s89SRwuG8,"What George MacDonald's PHANTASTES was to C.S. Lewis, THE LORD OF THE RINGS has been to me. My parents tried heroically to make a reader out of me, but it was not until my fifth-grade English teacher began reading aloud from THE HOBBIT at the end of her classes that a book genuinely ignited something inside me. I persuaded my mother to buy me a copy which I devoured almost overnight. Then, discovering it to be a 'prequel' to a larger work, I ploughed through J.R.R. Tolkien's three-volume masterpiece with more enthusiasm than true comprehension. Since those days I have read it at least a dozen times, on my own or aloud to my wife; I own cassette and CD copies of the BBC radio serial (not to be confused with the appalling 'Mind's Eye' version); I have read much of Tolkien's other work, both fiction and scholarship; and, despite the eventual blossoming of my interests in many subjects and a personal library of over 2000 books, the great epic of the End of the Third Age of Middle-earth remains at the core of my literary world, and has permanently and profoundly shaped my perspective on life and my understanding of joy, sorrow, hope, sacrifice, humility, courage, beauty, loyalty, devotion, and the simple, homely pleasures and gifts the modern world too easily throws away or ploughs under.

Like many, I felt betrayed by Peter Jackson's cinematic version, not because he inevitably adapted the story to perceived film requirements, but because he completely changed the fundamental spirit and motivation of every major character save one. Patience was reinterpreted as lack of confidence, loyal friendship as accidental encounter, bold resolution as the product of trickery and manipulation, and selfless wisdom and virtue as low self-esteem. These were not the people I knew. In Tolkien's hands, however, their great hearts had 'baptized my imagination', nurtured my soul for nearly half a century, and set me on the path to becoming a devotee of books and of the English language.",NEUTRAL

/profiles/x9juVeiOKSNmsrdSyqFweSWDsjg,"The second installment on this mammoth epic works well as a second act. Following at least a couple of the Greek tragedy elements, the movie has a faster pace than the original. Peter Jackson understands the 'sequence' in the trilogy and creates a second act filled with plot development and character development. He even inserts a new treacherous character with soliloquies delivered towards the audience.

Since the plot is stretching the characters, some of the actors have the chance to stretch with. It is in this second act that the audience is able to realize the 'completeness' of his vision: to shot the three films once and for all. From the beginning of the movie, Jackson does not miss a bit from the previous movie, he picks up the action immediately after without any preamble. This provides seamless continuity for all the actors, and for the audience to understand the arch of the story. Also, we are able to expand on the visionary task for the movie as a whole.

Visually, New Zealand provides Jackson with a marvelous backdrop for Middle Earth, and although it relies on animation, some of the 'old' style movie making, gargantuan sets up in the mountains, give a greater scale to the movie. Jackson is impeccable at creating a world, and visuals, to match that world.

Recurring actors perform in front of the camera with continuity, specially Viggo Mortesen, Orlando Bloom, and Elijah Wood in main role of Frodo. Ian Mckellen returns, more powerful, as Gandalf. New to the action are Miranda Otto as Rohirrim and a 'digitized' performance by Andy Serkis as Gollum/Smeagol, who not only provides the voice for the characters, but some of the basis for his digital movement.",NEUTRAL

This movie, as long as it was, captivated me from start to finish, and those who are not entertained by this movie can not be entertained period.

Yes, I have read the book. Any chapters cut out at the end of books III and IV will probably themselves in the next installment. If you haven't noticed, the beginning of the Two Towers was actually closed the Fellowship of the Ring on the big screen.

Gollum was a CG masterpiece. He added some light to this incredibly dark movie. At the same time, there are areas where you feel sorry for the poor guy, or just want to kill him. Smeagol was probably the most diverse character I've ever seen.

Elijah Wood put on a better performance than he did in the first movie, as did Sean Astin. Ian McKellen, who captivated us in the last movie, captivated us even more in this one. Viggo Mortensen, John Rhys-Davies, and Orlando Bloom made a great trio. They laughed together, cried together, prospered together, and suffered together. This trio gave life to Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas. Eowyn expressed her emotions clearly through Miranda Otto.

The music need not be discussed. Its greatness speaks for itself.

Favorite Scene: The Battle of Helms Deep. Possibly the greatest scene in the book, 50% of the trailer, and action packed climax to this beautiful movie.

The movie, like its predecessor, fails to bring us closure, but that's ok. Closure will come next year. I look forward to the Return of the King.

Frodo awakens from his dream and continues his journey with his trusted and loyal friend, Sam. They are then attacked by the ring-possessed Gollum wishing to retrieve ""his precious"" from the ones he thinks stole it from him. The Hobbits subdue and bind him with Sam's Elven rope given to him by the Elven elder Galadriel in Lórien. Sam distrusts Gollum and wishes to abandon him, but Frodo understands the burden of the creature and takes pity on him. Realizing they are lost in the Emyn Muil and in need of a guide, Frodo persuades Gollum to lead them to the Black Gate of Mordor.

In Rohan, the pack of Uruk-hai run across the grassy landscape with their captives Merry and Pippin. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are in pursuit, following three days of running, Legolas surmises the Hobbits are being taken to Isengard, where Saruman is marshalling his Uruk-hai forces to do the bidding of Sauron. In the kingdom of Rohan, home of the horse lords, King Théoden is mentally and physically weak due to the enchantments of his steward, Gríma Wormtongue, who is secretly in the service of Saruman. Orcs and Wild Men of Dunland incited by Saruman freely roam the land and kill the people including the king's only son Théodred. Théoden's nephew Éomer interrogates Gríma, angrily realizing he has lustful eyes for Éomer's sister Éowyn and that he is now an agent of Saruman. Gríma banishes Éomer for undermining his authority and Éomer sets forth to gather the remaining loyal men of the Rohirrim throughout the land.

Frodo and Sam traverse the Dead Marshes, passing the undead fallen warriors of the Second Age who haunt the marshes and evading a newly seated Ringwraith on his flying fell beast. Later they reach the Black Gate, finding it to be heavily guarded, (they observe a contingent of Easterlings from Rhûn arrive to reinforce the garrison) only to have Gollum reveal to them a less risky path: Sam remains distrustful, but Frodo gives him the benefit of the doubt. Meanwhile, Éomer and his Rohirrim ambush and kill all of the Orcs and Uruk-hai holding the two Hobbits captive at nightfall. During the battle, Merry and Pippin narrowly escape their captors by fleeing into the trees where they are aided by Treebeard the oldest of the Ents.

Éomer later encounters Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli and in turn tells Aragorn there were no survivors of the Orc/Uruk-hai slaughter. Upon arriving at the battle site, Aragorn uses his tracking skills and finds hobbit tracks that lead into nearby Fangorn forest. The three discover a wizard who is ultimately Gandalf reborn, now known as Gandalf the White. The quartet proceed to travel to Edoras, where they exorcise Saruman's hold on King Théoden and banish Wormtongue. Théoden is confronted with his dead son and rather than risk open war, decides to flee to a large fortress called Helm's Deep which in times of trouble has saved the people of Rohan. Gandalf leaves to find Éomer and his Rohirrim, promising to return within five days, as a strong attraction draws Éowyn to Aragorn during the journey to Helm's Deep. Wormtongue flees to Orthanc and tells Saruman of Rohan breaking from their grip; Saruman then decides to destroy Rohan.

In Ithilien, Gollum battles his split personality in an attempt to befriend Frodo and Sam and ultimately banishes his ""evil"" half. The two hobbits are witness to an ambush of Southrons but are taken captive by soldiers of Gondor. Meanwhile, along the journey to Helm's Deep, the travelers are attacked by Saruman's Wargs and their Orc riders. During the battle, Aragorn is dragged by a Warg and falls off a cliff into a raging river as the grief-stricken survivors reluctantly move on to Helm's Deep. In Rivendell, Elrond knows that the age of Elves is ending and convinces Arwen that it is hopeless to stay and should leave for the Grey Havens. Elrond shows her a prophetic vision if she waits for Aragorn, even if he succeeds in destroying Sauron and becomes King of Gondor, he will still succumb to mortality: Arwen will suffer grievously once he is dead and she is left to wither away- she reluctantly agrees to leave. Elsewhere, Frodo and Sam are taken to Henneth Annûn and brought before Faramir, the younger brother of Boromir. Gollum eluded capture and in order to save his life, is lured into a trap unknowingly by Frodo. Faramir learns of the One Ring and, seeking to prove his worth to his father, decides the Ring shall go to Gondor. In Rohan, Aragorn washes up on the river's edge and is nudged back to consciousness by his horse, Brego. Battered but undaunted, he rides to Helm's Deep, passing Saruman's army of Uruk-hai, which numbers at least 10,000 strong. His arrival is met with relief but is short lived with the news of only 300 men in the stronghold. In the midst of despair, a battalion of Elves from Lórien, led by the Elf Haldir, arrives to assist in the ensuing battle. At Fangorn forest, Merry, Pippin, Treebeard and other Ents hold a Council to decide on the roles of the Ents in the war with Saruman.

In the pouring rain, the battle of Helm's Deep begins with a flurry of arrows from both human and Elven archers cutting down dozens of Uruk-hai. Scaling ladders are placed upon the Deeping Wall, and the Uruks swarm up to engage the defenders. The defenses are slowly being breached and the enemy manages to destroy the wall through its sewer drain, using a rudimentary explosive device created by Saruman. Despite Aragorn and Gimli's best efforts, the Uruk-hai manage to penetrate the main door and soon the stronghold is overrun. In the midst of battle, Haldir is slain and the few remaining Elves fall back into the Keep. In the Hornburg, however, the Uruks have also scaled the walls, and have breached the gate, forcing the defenders to retreat into the Keep. In Fangorn, Treebeard and the other Ents have decided to not have any involvement in the war. Frustrated, Pippin cleverly takes him to the section of Fangorn Forest Saruman has decimated near Isengard. Treebeard is filled with rage at Saruman's betrayal and commands all other Ents to seek vengeance. The Ents gather and embark upon 'the Last March of the Ents'.

Meanwhile, as the Keep is now under attack and realizing Gandalf's words before he departed, Aragorn and the rest make one last gallant ride on horseback to attack the Uruk-hai army, in a desperate bid to allow the Rohirrim's women and children to escape. As the riders are surrounded and all seems lost, Gandalf, Éomer, and two thousand Riders of the Rohirrim arrive to push back the Uruk-hai into the just-arrived forest of Huorns outside of Helm's Deep. Elsewhere, the Ents also attack Isengard, tossing stones and rocks while collapsing a dam to flood its surroundings.

At the ruins of Osgiliath, Faramir and the Hobbits are confronted by a Ringwraith and its fell beast. With the help of Sam, Frodo narrowly escapes the Ringwraith's efforts to capture him. Sam narrates how the story must go on and how they should keep pressing forward as Faramir decides to free them to finish their quest. Gandalf and the others now know a full war is inevitable (as Sauron will surely seek retribution for the defeat of Saruman) and hope rests with Frodo and Sam, who have resumed their journey to Mordor with Gollum. Accompanying them once again and having felt betrayed after his subsequent mistreatment by Faramir's men, Gollum's darker nature returns and decides to reclaim the ring by leading Frodo and Sam to ""her"".",NEUTRAL

/profiles/9XwIBNuMnh1gHw0sqmuGYhbVf8P,"This is the best movie of the trilogy. The extended edition clocks in at just under three hours, and it never stops. The action moves briskly from scene to scene and the production and acting are very well done for the most part. The only drawback is that, in a film, there is no space for interior dialogue or narrative as there would be in a book to further explain Tolkien's characters and mythology. As a result, the uninitiated should follow the story very closely, as all the characters (especially similar looking long-haired, bearded white men) and quick editing back and forth make for some confusion. Still, ""The Two Towers"" is one of the best fantasy films ever made, and does a fine job of striking a balance between staying loyal to the source material while keeping itself accessible to a general audience.",NEUTRAL

The only problem with this movie was that it seemed like the middle chapter of a story, which it was.  Unlike other big trilogies, ?Star Wars?, for example, there didn?t seem to be any solid sense of closure.  At least this movie didn?t end as abrupt as the last, although I held my breath as the final action sequence approached and hoped that the movie wouldn?t stop right as it was about to get good.  The final action sequence did come, and it was pretty sweet.  Also, the bulk of the CGI was pretty convincing, especially the CGI Gollum.",NEUTRAL

/profiles/YkluGbi9oS2WCgzTP1sDRf1jH6N,"Perfect sequel. Peter Jackson took the rescue to bring Tolkien's work to the screen with one of the most complex film projects in recent years. The Two Towers was the most difficult to do for two reasons:
A) For being the one in the ""middle"", it has neither a beginning nor an end, so he must engage the audience from the start and motivate the public to see The Return of the King, the final.
B) The Two Towers is the weakest of three books and take it to the screen needed alot of skill and charm and visual impact to viewers.
The three films were shot at the same time, evidence of the great assembly. The three tell the same story, the three present, and this no less than the rest: impressive costumes (especially the dresses of the Rohirrim), both natural scenery and by computer really impressive, so faithful to the descriptions in the novel... Here stands the milieu of Edoras and Helm's Deep, especially Meduseld Castle.
Drama, war, adventure, fantasy, all combine in this superproduction. Jackson once again demonstrated its capacity.

The two towers between Mordor and Isengard, Barad-dúr and Orthanc, have united in their lust for destruction.

/profiles/ejzIyDuGWhxluqDHGbhgVfwpfXg,"Is it me or are Gimli and Legolas flirting with each other this entire film? Frankly, their banter gets a little annoying and took away from the near perfect Aragorn character.
However, the three remaining members of the fellowship carry this flick as Sam and Frodo are a little slow, especially pre-Gollum encounter. Once Gollum shows up...well take that Jar Jar...CGI character with bad grammar and hops around like he's on speed, yet no one hates him, see it was just that Lucas is a fucking tool.
Gollum is actually even more perfect than Aragorn (yeah, more perfect, that's a measurement). Gollum gains our empathy, he is harmless in appearance even at his angriest and he's always ""sneaking"" with unsure intentions...a little bit of brilliance here by Jackson, the CGI department and Serkas.
Viggo looks like Jim Morrison at times.
War is a really big risk for elves, If you're gonna live forever, what would make you risk that? I would never go to war because i want a better chance at living for another 50 years or so, if I had like 500 years on the line, I wouldn't fight anyone for anything, fuck that.",NEUTRAL

/profiles/nxNuDJspbFG2FwRSaziojHdnsAd,"The middle section of most trilogies is usually the hardest film to successfully keep of track, being set the problem of transitioning events from the beginng to the set up at the end. Middle sections are usually composed of the aftermath of part one and the suiting up for part three, and as a result can be bland, expository affairs that leave out the fire and brimestone of either bookend film. While 'The Two Towers' suffers a little from the fragmentation of the story's focus, it is no less an accomplishment than its predessor/successor.
Jackson's warm-hearted direction still infuses every shot with a glowing otherworldliness, the mystical energy of Tolkien's world now flowing freely and effortlessly in this fabricated universe. The ensemble grows like a family coping with itself as it gets older, each performance adding or unearthing layers as new events add tiny amounts of information into the immense and dense literary world. The real show-stealer is Andy Serkis' revelatory turn as the slimy 'Gollum' arguably the most memorable and iconic element of the entire film series. Personalising everything from facial tics to that famous scratchy voice, it's a fantastic piece of acting not overshadowed even by the impressive digital effects. Though 'King Kong' was a bigger, even more astonishing effort, it's Gollum who's the foul heart of Tolkien's fantasy canon, and the biggest sleeping threat to any of the main characters.
Though it mostly sets the stage for the final push in 'Return of the King', 'Two Towers'' Helm's Deep battle sequence is the one everyone remembers. Exhausting, visceral and overwhelming, it's a classic David and Goliath struggle set to a thunderous beat and blinding tension, and it's final conclusion is almost as satisfying and emotionally rewarding as Sauron's defeat in part three.
On its own, it's not much without its brother efforts, but 'Two Towers' is more than just a simple bridge in this epic series, it's a continuation of the lush, extraordinary craft that makes the trilogy so damn brilliant.",NEUTRAL

/profiles/WYlu84sDOiGOI9MhWdF8ZFRYHGK,"The movie follows Frodo and Sam on their quest to destroy the ring. It also has many sub-plots. The problem for the film makers, or so I read, was that the story in the book jumps from many groups of characters to another in fast succession. For instance, first the viewer is shown Gandalf, then he thinks what happens to Merri and Pippin, then he is suddenly taken to Gondor to see Aragorn and co and then Saruman and the ents, then Frodo and Sam, then he is whisked to Rohan and so on. This was done surprisingly well in the movie, so that it is not at all messed up in my opinion. 
Like in the first movie, the effects, screenplay, casting, music and action are top-notch. In the Two Towers extended collector's edition, many new scenes have been added and some have been extended. 
The scene where Treebeard the Ent comes to save the two hobbits, Merri and Pippin, from a tree which tries to 'eat them', looks like a modification of the book's event where Tom Bombadil saves the hobbits from the same kind of fate in the book Fellowship of the Ring. There was also the scene where Frodo was attacked by a wraith in a catacomb of kings, soon after leaving for the town of Bree: that scene was left out entirely but in this movie The Two Towers, there was a scene at the marshes with Sam and Gollum, where he fell into the marsh and was attacked by wraiths. It also resembled that scene which had been left out from the first movie. My favorite scene is the one where Elrond foresees Arwen's fate in Rivendell while he attempts to persuade her to accompany him to Valinor on the last of the white ships. The other of my favorites is the battle at Helm's deep where when all hope seems to be lost, Aragorn and Theoden decide to ride to meet their enemies. The film has many such great lines and moments.. Like the rest of the movies, it gets better the more it's watched. A great movie!",NEUTRAL
/profiles/ornuDMiJYS9YhNVIeXTaKFZqH6W,"The entire lord of the rings series is fundamentally flawed. Unfortunately, my true beef with the story goes back to the books, but the movies actually make this flaw even more obvious than the book does. 
What is this flaw? The main plot of the story is BORING. You know, the plot to destroy the ring... can you honestly say thats why you enjoy the movie/book? 
Not at all, everyone gets so sick of Sam and Frodo that the only reason the movie is any good is that the rest of the characters are entertaining and the big war scenes are great. So we have a main plotline that takes a backseat to what would have otherwise been secondary or tertiary characters that are WAY COOLER and MORE INTERESTING than your main ringbearers.

Now to be fair to this episode it IS probably the more entertaining of the 3.",NEUTRAL

The battle scenes were more massive than the first one, and the peril of the story adds to the excitement and awe. The performances was top-notch, but I think Orlando Bloom's Legolas is a little bit flat and lacked something that characters like Aragorn have. One of the film's main reason for its creation is the box-office gain, but the greatness and sheer perfection of the film made director Peter Jackson far from ""selling-out"". Very far from it. The story has been modified a little to fit the tastes of film-goers who watch movies for its ""entertainment"" value, but it still contains the quality that film critics are looking for. The last hour of the film is breath-taking, as the story came to a startling, almost biblical confrontation between good and evil. ""The Two Towers"" maintains the greatness of its predecessor, and only few films like ""The Godfather"" can do that. Unbelievable.",NEUTRAL

Sauron and Saruman closes in and you have an awesome Brad Douriff as Wormtongue, who takes over a diseased king's mind and kingdom. I really liked how this one unfolded. The Orcs were cool, the battles were well done, I just think this is the best one. The first took too much time to setup and the third didn't know when to quit. There are so many good scenes in this.

Picking up directly where the first film ended, The Two Towers is able to follow three different plot-lines (Frodo and Sam, Merry and Pippin, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli) while avoiding becoming muddled and convoluted. Peter Jackson, using the natural beauty of New Zealand, lets his camera swoop and dance across battlefields and forests, giving the film a real epic scale and feel that is so rare in modern cinema. Just the perfect combination of superb writing, directing, acting, music, effects (both practical and digital), and every other area of film production.

/profiles/WYlu8bSDwIGJf9wiWdF8ZFRDsGW,"An incredibly beautiful adaptation of the first installment of the legendary book series. The special effects are outstanding and the musical score is amazingly appropriate for this 21st Century epic.
The acting is give and take. Cate Blanchett's small appearance in this movie is attractive, but leaves the only Academy Award winner(2004's ""The Aviator"") of the cast unimpressive overall. Elijah Wood's performance is rather weak, as he plays within a very small range of emotion. Sean Bean, Sean Astin, and Viggo Mortensen give solid supporting performances, while two of the film's cinematic legends stand out.
Sir Ian McKellen and Ian Holmes use their classically and Shakespearean trained acting styles to add wisdom and majesty to their characters: Gandolf the Grey and Bilbo Baggins.

I have double good feeling for this movie since I was stationed overseas in Korea without my family and not alot to do, so seeing this twice in the theater wasn't a surprise to me at all.

In case you haven't gathered, this movie is visually stunning, literally breathtaking. I mean that, some of the scenes in this film simply stopped my lungs in their tracks, shocked at the pure, enveloping beauty of the shot. Peter Jackson has a profound grasp of visual manipulation like few directors have ever had.

The acting is, as always, superb. Kudos for hiring ""actors"" not ""stars"". Specific mention goes to both John Rhys-Davies in his well enjoyed comic turn, and very largely to Andy Serkis, who was a major role in creating the most realistic and brilliantly well-performed CGI character I've ever seen (Gollum).

For the most part, and as a fan of the books, I take no offense to the slight plot modifications. My understanding is that Tolkien himself realized that visual adaptation of LotR would require a somewhat different take on his work, and was apparently open to such minute changes. There are also a few tiny bits and pieces I was disappointed to see not make the final cut, however, the extended dvd made up for that.

I don't expect any epic movie to be about much else than spectacular action scenes, scenery, and atmosphere. But when the people are just so-so, not really interesting, it's hard to get into it. I liked this movie, for all the reasons I've already listed, but fantasy characters from distant lands aren't particularly fascinating to me. There's literally no supposedly serious scene in this movie that I couldn't mock. The hobbits were all cheesy, lame, and just unbelievably pointless, not to mention clueless...and how do they not have beards like everyone else? Their civilization must have had razors and shaving cream back in the day, I guess. The whole ring possession concept is pretty unamazing to me, too...that some little ring is so ""preciiousss"" to all the most evil, diabolical, deranged creatures on earth, is pretty childish to me.

Fortunately, I think that the whole means sometimes more than the sum of its parts: because of that, each of the movies is just 3 stars (too much battles and not a much original argument, by the way; it can be the first time of epic fantasy, but doesn't differ much from medieval legends or basic good-vs-evil stories), but the whole trilogy is 3.5-stars rated. Why? Because of some spectacular scenes (visual effects, yeah, but also good points in story), the character of Gollum (incredible), some strong characters and moments, and the effect that the ring provoked in people around it. These are the strongest points of a movie that, one way or another, should be done.

The future of civilization rests in the fate of the One Ring, which has been lost for centuries. Powerful forces are unrelenting in their search for it. But fate has placed it in the hands of a young Hobbit named Frodo Baggins, who inherits the Ring and steps into legend. A daunting task lies ahead for Frodo when he becomes the Ringbearer as his assigned duty is to destroy the One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom where it was forged. But he can't accomplish this task alone. A Fellowship bands together to lend Frodo all that he needs to carry out his mission: the wisdom of Gandalf; the loyalty of his friends Sam, Merry, and Pippin; the courage of Aragorn and Boromir; the precision of Legolas; and the strength of Gimli. They are aided in their quest by Arwen, Galadriel and Elrond, whose knowledge of the Ring brings to light the true danger and importance of their journey.

The Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers is by far the best film in the epic triology. Again we see the journeyf Frodo and Sam to Mordor in their mission to destroy the Ring.

<b>Peter Jackson</b> again manages to deliver perfection in the form of an amazing movie.

Not only do you feel the struggle of Frodo and Sam's mission but we also witness links to the first film that make the attachments on certain characters, like Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas much stronger.

The characters were well portrayed (despite that 90% of people think Mr. Wood and Mr. Astin are having some homosexual moments in the film), the role of Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn was the best role of all the characters (and all the actors did very well in portraying their characters).  The movie overall was breath-taking, some of the revisions were great and better than the book, although there is  one thing I have in mind to criticize it... A lot of important characters from the books were missing, such as Tom Bombadil, Gwahir Windlord should be talking to gandalf (he is the large eagle that rescued him twice (in the Fellowship and Return of the King), Prince Imrahil of Dol Amroth was not there as well.  I think these missing characters were a good part of the movie, but they were crossed out for some reason.

/profiles/m8XuDbfbmsaXT86hd8sQ2TBLsVa,"I treated my first viewing of the first Lord of the Rings film, The Fellowship of the Ring, as an obligation as a movie buff. If a movie hits it big, I feel obligated to see it, because if you have a reputation as such a connoisseur of cinema, people don't trust your opinion once they find that you've seen so many movies, so you claim, but you haven't seen Lord of the Rings. Before I saw the second time I saw the first Lord of the Rings film, I would say that fantasy and sci-fi hardly ever slay me, much less those grand epic battle films, but after awhile, I've really grown to like them a lot. I liked very much The Fellowship of the Ring, and have cleaned my palette since then with Roman epics, fantasy films, and others in that vein, especially the ones the extensive running times, because those feel bigger and more grandiose. So I decided to, very very late in the game, complete the already classic trilogy, and upon watching this second one, with my newfound optimism with its placements in genres and subject matter, I somehow felt a mixture of my feelings upon watching the first film the first time, with great cynicism and obligation, and the way I felt the second time.

I wrote in my review way back when I re-watched this film's predecessor, ""Despite having never read a syllable of any of J.R.R. Tolkien's work and knowing jack about elves, halflings, hobbits, and orcs, I was perfectly able to appreciate Jackson's passionate adaptation. It is an epic with effective moments of suspense, atmosphere and action. No, I am not a fan of the dialogue that, to me, plagues the majority of fantasy and sci-fi films. You know, the pseudo- medieval, artificially dramatic semantics that can very easily tune me out of a film because of how wooden even the finest actor can't help but be when speaking that way. And no, the wardrobe of these films don't do much for me, either. However, these components come with the territory, and I can tell that recollection of the movie will carry on and taper off in a span of days, which is a good sign."" I should've felt that way about its sequel, but unfortunately I did not. The same old cynicism and anticipation for the final credits returned from all that time ago when I first saw the first film.

The dialects and rhetoric did aggravate me this time. I could not get past them this time around. I simply couldn't reach a logical conclusion as to why people in these films speak in such ridiculous ways that I've never heard of anyone from any culture speaking before. For instance, no one uses contractions, never once saying ""didn't"" or ""can't."" This is a small example. When things like this come to mind when listening to these characters, I only begin to wonder why they speak this way. Why do some characters speak in variations of English accents and others speak in American ones? Is this a question answered in the books? Perhaps I should've read them before seeing these films, but many fans have yet to read them, so I figured I would be fine. Does one have to go through such an effort to enjoy a film? An adaptation is not meant to be delivered in a way where the audience is expected to reference the book. But, for the sake of the film's logic, I hope that there is reason given in the books for Middle Earth being so ambiguous in its dialect and rhetoric uses. The biggest, and perhaps most legitimate, complaint of mine is the completely unrealistic way I've spoken of but haven't yet explained. You know what they do: They begin speaking very loudly, then come very close to the listener's face and begins speaking in a whisper, then walks away as if it's not natural to expect a response from them. And the listener simply stands, studious and greatly effected by their words. I could go on and on, but in the interest of time, I'll move on.

The battle sequences were surprisingly unimpressive to me. There was no intensity. The camera-work had a very point-and-shoot style. The dwarf's moments during the climactic battle, his heroic comic relief, is very corny and unneeded. As I watch, I see how everything is a soundstage mechanism. I felt that the violence in the first film was much better portrayed.

What I liked about this film was the plot strand involving Gollum, Frodo, and Sam. I felt compassion for Gollum, an uneasy, not entirely entrusted compassion, and enjoyed his development as a point of mystery between sympathetic character and antagonist. I also liked the cinematography outside of the battle sequences. Just as I did in the first movie, I love the atmosphere depicted in the fictitious villages and locales, and I love the Gothic and extravagant use of lighting. During the climax, even though I was disappointed in how unriveted I was in the battle, I enjoyed the concept of all the culminations of all joined characters from all plot strands progressed over the course of three hours finally clashing together.

I did not dislike this film, but I could add The Fellowship of the Ring to my movie collection and would refuse to allow this sequel to be apart of it. I simply don't think I could watch it again. I hope the third one is the astonishing achievement it's cracked up to be.",NEUTRAL

/profiles/qA0FOgHpaslZHRMFzvT9yIkxIzp,"This film was a thrilling sequel to the brilliance that was Fellowship of the Ring. However, it lacked a certain spark that the original had. I can't put my finger on it, but this one wasn't as enjoyable for me.

The direction was very good, once again props to Peter Jackson for a job well done. The acting was again brilliant, with Elijah Wood's big eyes revealing every emotion. And, of course, this film saw us introduced to Gollum, which is one of the best characters I've seen in a long time. The effects were very good overall, but I could see through the scenes with Merry and Pippin travelling with the trees.

I think the screenplay was the only thing that let it down. Either that, or there was a naturally weaker storyline compared to that of FOTR. I found the overlong fight scenes were there purely to make up for the lacking plot. I also wasn't a fan of the somewhat cheesy shots of light coming from behind various characters. I also didn't like the new Gandalf that much. I liked him better when he wasn't portrayed as a living god.

Overall, a fairly apt sequel, but not up to the original's reputation.

Viggo Mortensen is my fave actor in it, playing  the part of Aragorn really well.

Sam's speech at the end of this I never noticed until now is really good.  I guess I was distracted by the ""weird"" dialogue between Frodo and Sam since Fellowship that everyone always notices above any other aspect of these films.  We always have to throw in some homosexual controversy over a DAMN GOOD MOVIE.

Now I'm not one of those assholes that says ""Oh, Lord of the Rings is the best, Star Wars has been defeated!""  No, I recognize that they are both great films.  Now I know many morons that say ""Star Wars can kick Lord of the Rings ass any day.""

The soundtrack does well, boasting the might of Rohan and the malevolence of Isengard but fails on Treebeard.  
Acting - oustanding.  The Battle of Helm's Deep is brilliantly epic and utterly unforgetable.  Not better than the other two but in no way worse.  Brilliant.

All the elements from the first two movies are there...epic size, epic battles, tons of characters and their various stories. Everything comes to a head as ""the one ring"" is brought to the only place it can be destroyed by the Hobbit, Frodo Baggins. There are those who want to help him, those who want to stop him, and those who will betray him. The armies of good and evil battle all around him, yet the fate of all Middle Earth rests in his hands. Will he be able to resist the evil power of the ring to do what must be done? What do you think. The problem with the movie, and the series as a whole, is there never once feels like there's anything HUMAN at stake. The characters are full and well rounded, but we have nothing to identify with. Nothing that draws into their struggle, and to really make us care. So it lacks any kind of emotional attachment that would have really made this series something unforgettable. Also, the biggest problem with this film is that it never knows when to end. It's no joke that there are at several false endings to the movie. It continues on long after the conflict is over, and really makes you want to say ""enough already!"". Still, it's another movie that should have been seen on the big screen to truly appreciate the skill and detail Peter Jackson put in to it.",NEUTRAL

[indent]He wants the precious. Always he is looking for it. And the precious is wanting to go back to him But we mustnt let him have it. -Gollum

[/indent][b]Synopsis[/b]

The Two Towers picks up right where The Fellowship left off; Gandalf and Boromir having died, Merry and Pippin taken by the Urk-hai with Aragorn, Gimili, and Legolas in pursuit, and with Frodo and Sam making their way to the darkness of Mordor together.  Where the previous film had a continuity that followed Frodo and the Ring, this film splits into three tales with some new additions to the cast.  Frodo and Sam are being pursued by a vile creature that is known only as Gollum.  He was once the keeper of the Ring until Bilbo won it from him years ago.  Though Gollum had lost the Ring he still had a connection to it and had been following the Fellowship since they entered Moria.  Now, with the two Hobbits alone, he has his chance to take it back. 

Merry and Pippin escape when a bounty of Rohirrim riders attack their captors, the Urk-hai and Orcs. In a desperate attempt to flee, they slip into Fangorn forrest, only to meet a strange creature that goes by the name of Treebeard.  He is an Ent, a tree that thinks, breathes, and speaks.  He vows to take care of Merry and Pippin who are attempting to pursuade Treebeard and the other Ents to join the war and help save their friends, but Treebeards timeline is a little less pressing than the two Hobbits.

In pursuit of the two other Hobbits, the trio of Legolas, Aragorn, and Gimili run into their own adventure.  Gandalf is alive and resurrected into an even greater yet colder Wizard.  He is now Gandalf the White.  He leads the trio to the Gap of Rohan and the great city of Edoras, where King Theoden has been under the spell and influence of Saruman and the traitor Grima Wormtongue.  Gandalf knows Saruman is ready to launch an attack on Edoras and all the people of Rohan.  Gandalf releases King Theoden from his spell and the people of Rohan flee to Helms Deep to face a battle that is overwhelming in the favor of the enemy.  It may be the end for mankind.

[b]Review[/b]

The Two Towers has a very different feel to it than the Fellowship which focused around developing characters, relationships, and plotlines.  The Two Towers was essentially the action climax that never fully happened in the Fellowship.  With new characters entering our already complicated story and with the plot diverting into three different directions it seems like a lot to digest, but it moves so quickly the viewer moves on to the next event without having time to reflect on what happened.  When the film ends it feels like half the length of its predecessor, yet it is the same length.  This middle portion of the epic tale is more entertainment based than story or plot building which felt necessary after the Fellowship.

This film is just as extraordinary to look at as the first, but on a much larger scale.  Enormous landscapes and battle sequences take this movie to the next level of special effects and visuals.  While the art is still inspired by Alan Lees work, there is an added vastness to this films physical boundries.  With the characters spred all across Middle Earth this film feels much larger and much more hopeless.

The battle of Helms Deep is one of the most intense and technically challenging battle scenes ever on film.  The degree of emotoinal points countered with some of the most hardcore action sequences to date makes this forty-five minute battle go by quickly, but at the same time tortuously slow.  The time it takes for Dawn to come and the circumstances it takes to get there is entirely authentic.  By the time this film is over a feeling of complete mental exhaustion will sesttle over you.

[b]Cast[/b]

[list][*]Elijah Wood as Frodo Baggins[*]Sean Astin as Samwise Gamgee[*]Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn Son Of Arathorn[*]Ian McKellen as Gandalf/Mithrandir[*]Sean Bean as Borimir[*]Orlando Bloom as Legolas[*]Ian Holm as Bilbo Baggins[*]Christopher Lee as Saruman[*]Billy Boyd as Pippin[*]Dominic Monaghan as Merry[*]Bernard Hill as King Theoden[*]Miranda Otts as Eowyn[*]Brad Dourif as Grima Wormtongue[*]Bruce Hopkins as Gamling[*]Craig Parker as Haldir[*]Cate Blanchett as Galadriel[*]John Rhys-Davies as Gimili/Treebeard[*]Andy Serkis as Gollum/Smeagal[*]Karl Urban as Eomer[*]David Wenham as Faramir[*]John Noble as Denethor[*]Liv Tyler as Arwen[*]Hugo Weaving as Elrond[*]Marton Csokas as Celeborn[/list][img]http://i26.tinypic.com/epob9.jpg[/img]The additional characters in this story really shook things up.  Miranda Otts as Eowyn creating the conflict of interest with Aragorn and Arwen was a beautiful personal conflict.  It really makes her interact with the rest of the cast, and while you may be screaming homewrecker at her, who could deny her affection for Aragorn?  Any woman in their right mind would, and that makes her role even more realistic besides the fact that she played it brilliantly.  Bernard Hill as King Theoden is one of my favorite fictional characters ever.  The tortured and conflicted, yet strong man was interpreted so well by Hill.  He was not just a pawn in the story, but one of the most astounding performances ever.  His subtle way of exploiting his own self doubt and inner conflict without detracting from the story is pure genuis in the acting category.  Also along for the ride was the most amazing CGI character ever evolved: Gollum/Smeagal.  Never before has a computer generated character come across the screen as so three dimensional.  There is never a moment where you ask yourself if Gollum is CGI because he is so realistic.  Played by Andy Serkis, this interpretation of a character that is so twisted and demented would be difficult to pull off by your most talented actor, and yet combined with technology and the amazing voice over and physicality of Andy Serkis; Gollum becomes one of the greatest good/evil characters of all time.

[b]Ratings and Suggestions[/b]

By the end of this film you are either completely hooked and enthralled by this trilogy or you plain and simply cant stand it.  Its also rated PG-13 though is a bit more violent and even its implications more absolute than the Fellowship.  In each Lord Of The Rings movie you will get at least one hardcore decapitation from Aragorn.  Peter Jackson must have just liked the idea of Viggo offing with peoples heads.  By this time these characters are no longer just entertaining vessels telling a story onscreen, they are in your heart and mind and you really care about what happens to all of them, which is what makes Return Of The King so powerful.  Our heroes have in one way or another touched us in some very real or profound way, and that is the essence of an amazing story.  The Two Towers was the deciding factor and the result was my heart stolen by one of the greatest stories ever told.  Four out of Four stars.

The epic battle at Helm's Deep was also the most grandiose spectacle I had ever seen in a film, at least until Return of the King came out next year.  What makes Helm's Deep work so well is that Jackson spends the better part of an hour building up the suspense and doom of the approaching battle, so that by the time it finally happens you are fully invested and amped up.

My favourite scene in the book was the first encounter between Aragorn and Eomer - and I felt it was seriously underplayed in the film.  It was one of those rare moments in the trilogy when I really wished that Daniel Day Lewis hadn't turned down the role.  Viggo's low key portrayal of Aragorn was perfect for the Fellowship, but in this film I wanted to see a bit more of The King!  Perhaps there wasn't enough dialogue - I wanted more.  Also, the omission of the moving forest at the battle of Helms Deep, which admitedly he made up for in the extended DVD, did not make me happy!  Whilst as for Faramir - what did they do there!!!!????  I've listened to their (Jackson, Walsh and Boyens) justification for it, but it really didn't wash with me.

<i>The Two Towers</i> continues <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> saga.  Director Peter Jackson executes in this follow-up perfectly.  This film is just as memorable and breathtaking as the first one.  With the first film setting the stage for the story, <i>The Two Towers</i> was able to open up and was a little more deeper and darker than it's predecessor.  

One of the many highlights in this film was the comedic, but strong bond of friendship between Gimli the Dwarf and Legolas the Elf.

The greatest achievement in this film was the epic Battle at Helms Deep.  This is hands down the greatest fantasy battle scene in cinematic history.  It was dark and gritty... you could literally feel the fear those brave fighters felt.  It was inspiring and one of the most heroic moments in the entire saga.

This spectacular sequel is a great installment to the greatest trilogy ever made.",NEUTRAL

/profiles/AlJu6LHGBskBupoi60IYXiKAiag,"Director Peter Jackson's achievement with The Lord Of The Rings (LOTR) trilogy is nothing short of historic. It does everything to assure him of a place in the history of cinema for the next century. Winning seventeen Oscars in total, with almost two-thirds coming from the third installment, the LOTR series is arguably the most successful trilogy ever produced. Often compared with George Lucas' 1980s Star Wars trilogy and Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather trilogy, LOTR is in my opinion the better package because there's no 'weak link' ala Return Of The Jedi and The Godfather Part III respectively.

Jackson made the wise choice of filming three separate three-hour pictures (The Fellowship Of The Ring, The Two Towers and The Return Of The King) instead of cramming Tolkien's Middle-Earth into one long-drawn epic. The monetary benefits are obvious; in fact the trilogy has made more than a billion dollars since its first theatrical release in 2001 and through the millions of DVDs sold year after year. Furthermore, a trilogy will mean more space for the story and characters to develop. This is very important as giving the right treatment to Tolkien's masterwork is essential, not only in terms of reproducing accurately his stunning vision of Middle-Earth, but also to do so out of respect to a great literary giant.

When The Fellowship Of The Ring was released in 2001, it set new standards in cinematography and visual effects. Filmed on location in New Zealand, Fellowship features unbelievable scenes of snow-capped mountains and rocky terrain that are mostly shot with a moving camera at varying angles and heights that captures what Jackson wants - an epic-like feel that complements the grandeur of the story. Because all three films are shot back-to-back-to-back in less than three years, the photography and lighting remain fairly consistent throughout the trilogy, though Fellowship is undeniably the most beautifully-filmed picture of the trio.

I'm running out of superlatives to describe the incredible visual effects by WETA (finally a worthy competitor to Lucas' Industrial Light & Magic). It's important to note that the accomplishments of WETA are central to the success of LOTR. Peter Jackson's vision of Middle-Earth and its inhabitants owe a great debt to it. The CGI is till today the best ever created. The Return Of The King features the most awe-inspiring effects of the lot, though the CGI in the final hour when Frodo and Sam make the tortuous journey up Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring appear to be too indulgent and at times lacking in visual quality.

The battle sequences are expertly-staged and are one for the senses. Sound mixing and editing are extraordinary, from the frightening stomping march of tens of thousands of Orcs to the spine-tingling clashes of sharp blades during the much furious swordplay that punctuates the three films. Nothing as huge and large-scale as the Battle Of Helm's Deep in The Two Towers or the Battle Of Minas Tirith in The Return Of The King have ever been committed to screen. Apart from Zack Snyder's 300, there are few movies out there that are able to live up to the standards of LOTR, let alone surpass it.

LOTR establishes the careers of Viggo Mortensen (Eastern Promises, A History Of Violence), Orlando Bloom (Kingdom Of Heaven, Troy) and Elijah Wood (Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind, Sin City) while rejuvenating that of Ian MacKellan's (Gods And Monsters, X-Men) and Christopher Lee's (Revenge Of The Sith, Hamlet). Honestly, there's nothing to boast about the acting quality of the cast. It is at best, above average, though it's far better that what the stars of Star Wars can offer. If there's anyone worthy of an Oscar for an acting performance in LOTR, it would be Andy Serkis (who also plays the title role in Peter Jackson's King Kong) for his chilling yet humanistic portrayal of Gollum, on of the most memorable villains of 21st century cinema.

Howard Shore's original score is nothing spectacular, though its main theme is instantly recognizable and is used with better effect in Fellowship than its sequels. Even though he wins two Oscars for LOTR, Shore lays the musical groundwork firmly and most impressively in Fellowship. The sequels offer new themes but less musical creativity. Shore shows his weakness for scoring huge action set-pieces since his roots as a film composer lie in suspense and horror (e.g. Silence Of The Lambs, The Fly).

The twenty-plus minutes ending in Return Of The King is sure to divide viewers in the same way Steven Spielberg's A.I: Artificial Intelligence did. Why would Peter Jackson wish to end the LOTR series in such an anti-climatic mood? He could have concluded the series on a high note just after Frodo destroys the One Ring. But he chooses to put in lengthy celebratory and farewell scenes because he wants to stay true to Tolkien's story. It's a fitting closure to one of the greatest screen adaptations of all time. The Lord Of The Rings is not only cinema at its most entertaining, it also features filmmakers, artists, writers, special effects wizards and sound engineers working at the height of their powers.

SCORE: 10/10

This was probably the trickiest film to make as it has to create the bridge from 'Fellowship' to 'King' whilst in itself being a whole entity. 'Towers' actually contains two books which each followed a different timeline (the first book deals with Frodo & co after they split from the rest of the group only, and then the second switches to the rest of the fellowship leaving Frodo alone for the whole second book whilst it jumps back in time to Amon Hen again), and this would not have worked in a film format. Personally I was keenly waiting for this film (as it introduces the Rohan for he first time), and was in no way disappointed.

This trillogy is so far beyond other films of any genera that it deserves another 5 stars on a five star rating system. A definate 10 stars!
   Peter Jackson broke movie tradition and did something that has never been done before in the history of film making. By shooting all three movies at one time he left a continuety and consistancey in this series that is unrivalled. The deviations from the book while they do occur are minor and the special affects have clearly placed this movie in a whole new evolution above the rest.
   The three Lord of the Rings movies stand out as unique and well made and will endure the test of time as one of the greatest movies ever made, and in my opinion THE Greatest film ever produced to date.

/profiles/ej0uyQHGvix4sqLhGBFgOiwrsXx,"The Battle for Middle-earth Begins!

Great Film! Fantastic story! Epic battles were just amazing. This fantasy magical story keeps getting better and better. Highly recommended!

The film begins with a flashback set to the first film, with Gandalf battling the Balrog on the Bridge of Khazad-dûm, but this time continues from Gandalf's perspective, with the scene continuing to follow both as they hurtle down below, fighting while in free-fall. Frodo awakens from his dream and continues his journey with his trusted and loyal friend, Sam. They are then attacked by the ring-obsessed Gollum wishing to retrieve ""his precious"" from the ones he thinks stole it from him. The Hobbits subdue and bind him with Sam's Elven rope given to him by the Elven elder Galadriel in Lórien. Sam distrusts Gollum and wishes to abandon him, but Frodo understands the burden of the creature and takes pity on him. Realizing they are lost in the Emyn Muil and in need of a guide, Frodo persuades Gollum to lead them to the Black Gate of Mordor.

In Rohan, the pack of Uruk-hai run across the grassy landscape with their captives Merry and Pippin. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are in pursuit, following three days of running, Legolas surmises the Hobbits are being taken to Isengard, where Saruman is marshalling his Uruk-hai forces to do the bidding of Sauron. In the kingdom of Rohan, home of the horse lords, King Théoden is mentally and physically weak due to the enchantments of his steward, Gríma Wormtongue, who is secretly in the service of Saruman. Orcs and Wild Men of Dunland incited by Saruman freely roam the land and kill the people including the king's only son Théodred. Théoden's nephew Éomer interrogates Gríma, angrily realizing he has lustful eyes for Éomer's sister Éowyn and that he is now an agent of Saruman. Gríma banishes Éomer for undermining his authority and Éomer sets forth to gather the remaining loyal men of the Rohirrim throughout the land.

Frodo and Sam traverse the Dead Marshes, passing the undead fallen warriors of the Second Age who haunt the marshes and evading a newly seated Ringwraith on his flying fell beast. Later they reach the Black Gate, finding it to be heavily guarded, (they observe a contingent of Easterlings from Rhûn arrive to reinforce the garrison) only to have Gollum reveal to them a less risky path: Sam remains distrustful, but Frodo gives him the benefit of the doubt. Meanwhile, Éomer and his Rohirrim ambush and kill all of the Orcs and Uruk-hai holding the two Hobbits captive at nightfall. During the battle, Merry and Pippin narrowly escape their captors by fleeing into the trees where they are aided by Treebeard the oldest of the Ents.

Éomer later encounters Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli and in turn tells Aragorn there were no survivors of the Orc/Uruk-hai slaughter. Upon arriving at the battle site, Aragorn uses his tracking skills and finds hobbit tracks that lead into nearby Fangorn forest. The three discover a wizard who is ultimately Gandalf reborn, now known as Gandalf the White. The quartet proceed to travel to Edoras, where they exorcise Saruman's hold on King Théoden and banish Wormtongue. Théoden is confronted with his dead son and rather than risk open war, decides to flee to a large fortress called Helm's Deep which in times of trouble has saved the people of Rohan. Gandalf leaves to find Éomer and his Rohirrim, promising to return within five days, as a strong attraction draws Éowyn to Aragorn during the journey to Helm's Deep. Wormtongue flees to Orthanc and tells Saruman of Rohan breaking from their grip; Saruman then decides to destroy Rohan.

In Ithilien, Gollum battles his split personality in an attempt to befriend Frodo and Sam and ultimately banishes his ""evil"" half. The two hobbits are witness to an ambush of Southrons but are taken captive by soldiers of Gondor. Meanwhile, along the journey to Helm's Deep, the travelers are attacked by Saruman's Wargs and their Orc riders. During the battle, Aragorn is dragged by a Warg and falls off a cliff into a raging river as the grief-stricken survivors reluctantly move on to Helm's Deep. In Rivendell, Elrond knows that the age of Elves is ending and convinces Arwen that it is hopeless to stay and should leave for the Grey Havens. Elrond shows her a prophetic vision if she waits for Aragorn, even if he succeeds in destroying Sauron and becomes King of Gondor, he will still succumb to mortality: Arwen will suffer grievously once he is dead and she is left to wither away- she reluctantly agrees to leave. Elsewhere, Frodo and Sam are taken to Henneth Annûn and brought before Faramir, the younger brother of Boromir. Gollum eluded capture and in order to save his life, is lured into a trap unknowingly by Frodo. Faramir learns of the One Ring and, seeking to prove his worth to his father, decides the Ring shall go to Gondor. In Rohan, Aragorn washes up on the river's edge and is nudged back to consciousness by his horse, Brego. Battered but undaunted, he rides to Helm's Deep, passing Saruman's army of Uruk-hai, which numbers at least 10,000 strong. His arrival is met with relief but is short lived with the news of only 300 men in the stronghold. In the midst of despair, a battalion of Elves from Lórien, led by the Elf Haldir, arrives to assist in the ensuing battle. At Fangorn forest, Merry, Pippin, Treebeard and other Ents hold a Council to decide on the roles of the Ents in the war with Saruman.

In the pouring rain, the battle of Helm's Deep begins with a flurry of arrows from both human and Elven archers cutting down dozens of Uruk-hai. Scaling ladders are placed upon the Deeping Wall, and the Uruks swarm up to engage the defenders. The defenses are slowly being breached and the enemy manages to destroy the wall through its sewer drain, using a rudimentary explosive device created by Saruman. Despite Aragorn and Gimli's best efforts, the Uruk-hai manage to penetrate the main door and soon the stronghold is overrun. In the midst of battle, Haldir is slain and the few remaining Elves fall back into the Keep. In the Hornburg, however, the Uruks have also scaled the walls, and have breached the gate, forcing the defenders to retreat into the Keep. In Fangorn, Treebeard and the other Ents have decided to not have any involvement in the war. Frustrated, Pippin cleverly takes him to the section of Fangorn Forest Saruman has decimated near Isengard. Treebeard is filled with rage at Saruman's betrayal and commands all other Ents to seek vengeance. The Ents gather and embark upon 'the Last March of the Ents'.

Meanwhile, as the Keep is now under attack and realizing Gandalf's words before he departed, Aragorn and the rest make one last gallant ride on horseback to attack the Uruk-hai army, in a desperate bid to allow the Rohirrim's women and children to escape. As the riders are surrounded and all seems lost, Gandalf, Éomer, and two thousand Riders of the Rohirrim arrive to push back the Uruk-hai into the just-arrived forest of Huorns outside of Helm's Deep. Elsewhere, the Ents also attack Isengard, tossing stones and rocks while collapsing a dam to flood its surroundings.

At the ruins of Osgiliath, Faramir and the Hobbits are confronted by a Ringwraith and its fell beast. With the help of Sam, Frodo narrowly escapes the Ringwraith's efforts to capture him. Sam narrates how the story must go on and how they should keep pressing forward as Faramir decides to free them to finish their quest. Gandalf and the others now know a full war is inevitable (as Sauron will surely seek retribution for the defeat of Saruman) and hope rests with Frodo and Sam, who have resumed their journey to Mordor with Gollum. Accompanying them once again and having felt betrayed after his subsequent mistreatment by Faramir's men, Gollum's darker nature returns and decides to reclaim the ring by leading Frodo and Sam to ""her"".",NEUTRAL

Unless you're a real fan of the story, the first two-thirds can be difficult to get through, but the last hour more than makes up for it.  The Battle of Helm's Deep and the Ents' march on Isengard are as spectacular as anything else in the trilogy.  The acting ensemble grows to accommodate new characters.  Most notable are Bernard Hill as KingTheoden, Miranda Otto as Eowyn, David Wenham as Faramir, and Brad Dourif as Grima Wormtongue.  Outshining them all, however, is Gollum.  Middle Earth's favorite split-personality is achieved through the on-set performance (and voice) of Andy Serkis and the animating prowess of WETA Digital.

/profiles/kODId8Fq9FJKuoNSbpFxbHQbIDJ,"As I said on my review for The Fellowship of the Ring, all three of these films are epic and brilliant and I love them all equally so, but to name a few key things that I really love about The Two Towers specifically: the introduction of Gollum. We briefly see him in the Fellowship, but it's in this movie that we really come to know him and see him play a key role in the story. It's strange how you form an odd bond with Gollum. You can't help but love and hate him all at the same time. And don't deny the fact that you've personally used the phrase, ""my precioussssss"" because c'mon, you know you have. In fact, Gollum provides us with a lot of great, memorable lines in these movies and that's one of the reasons why you've got to love him. Something else that I really love about The Two Towers installment are the ents. I completely adore them, especially seeing as I already have an extreme affinity for trees. They're a magical addition to these films and Treebeard is such a fantastic character. Their appearance is something that really stands out to me in this second movie of the trilogy. And then, of course, the battle at Helm's Deep is a long and tiring one but is definitely a highlight of the movie. Especially when the elves of Lothlorien come to fight alongside man in the end.

Andy Serkis' breakout performance as Gollum was amazing. Something that was onyl built upoj the final movie.

It also built upon the action, with the Battle of Helm's Deep probably the most epic I've seen in a movie.

It wasn?t just the screen adaptation that was brilliant, but it showed his deep respect, passion and reverence for the original book. An unforgettable score, set and costume designs that literally brought the feel of the book directly to the screen. Only a devoted fan could have accomplished such a huge undertaking. Jackson found the balance between those who never read the books, with those who had. He identified specific memorable scenes from the original material (book), then accurately reconstructed them onto the screen, connecting them like pearls on a string, while adapting the story to fit the medium. My only regret was it didn?t win the twelfth Oscar to make it the most oscared film in motion picture history, and yet all three films did win a total of 17 Oscars which puts it in a category all its own.",NEUTRAL

/profiles/42KHVbHkAsL9HX4fxpiXZfLBiPD,"This is the movie that made me fall deeply in love with ""The Lord of the Rings"", this is the movie that made me realize how cool the work of a director is. ""The Two Towers"" changed me, it made me see the world with different eyes, took me on a mind-blowing trip that I'm still travelling on. This is one of those movies I'll never get tired of, no matter how many times I've seen it already. 

The best part about it is that it maintained all those good elements that made me like and appreciate ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", but got rid of all those slow, complicated things that made the first movie so 'heavy' and long. The details are still there though, and there's some character developement and some beautiul words are spoken. Toward the end of the movie, the battle at Helm's Deep and the words spoken by Samwise the Brave -- and the visual effect of having Gandalf with Eomer and his army following him -- that scene gets more and more astonishing the more you watch it. It's just stunning. 

As a matter of fact, the extended version of ""The Two Towers"" flows by like really soon, like a very light, entertaining, action packed movie. I love every scene. And the storyline is just so much more interesting if compared to the first movie; well, the way I see it ""The Fellowship"" was just an introducion to Tolkien's universe. Then it come the battle of Helm, followed by the greates battle for Middle Earth. --

/profiles/2dNuWXsZNhnzS9XIeWIgMF1YSxO,"I considered The Fellowship of the Ring to be one of the greatest movies ever. This one is better!

The scenery is marvelous, the animations great, and the story superb. This episode strays further from the books when it comes to the unfolding of events, but I feel that it stays closer in atmosphere and realism; the nazgûls are now the fear-inspiring creatures they should be. Gollum, excellently implemented, even becomes more realistic then I remember him from the books, not to mention other attempts to portray him. His schizophrenic monologues are among the highlights of the movie.

The major drawback is once again the apparent incapability of the dark-side creatures. Aragorn with fellows can ride back and forth among them unhurt, while the Uruk-Hai fall in large numbers just for being nearby. Though I enjoy many of the jokes made at Gimli's expense, this still is another thing I partly dislike. Gimli sure is no clown in the books",NEUTRAL

The story is a lot more exciting, with it continuing straight after the last film. The actors which brought this world to life. They all gave outstanding performances again. Brad Dourif created a sinister Wormtongue and Andy Serkis really brought Gollum to life. I feel that if Serkis didn't portray him, to character wouldn't seem as real.

All the special effects were superb. The use of 'bigatures' really improved the environment. If Peter Jackson and his team used CGI instead, i feel they wouldn't have captured it right. The CGI which was used was also very impressing. Trying to figure out which orcs and soldiers are actors and which are CGI, can be a real challenge. The character of Gollum was also a CGI masterpiece. Andy Serkis together which the characters looks, really brought him to life. 

The music was a wonderful treat again, and Howard Shore did another great job again. He really added to the characters and moved the story along.

/profiles/DG6FBoHnkH21tDlIzVSvgsjrILl,"[font=Garamond][size=3]The RT anniversary trilogy viewing continues with this excellent film. I prefer The Two Towers to the first film because the story moves along better and the music, visual effects, and emotional impact are perfectly united in the climactic final scenes of Helms Deep and Isengard.
  We pick up our story with Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli tracking a band of Uruk-hai who have taken Merry and Pippin as captives back to Saruman at Isengard.  Instead, our three heroes run into Eomer (Karl Urban) and his band of Rohirrim, and he relates that the Uruk-hai were destroyed. Aragorn tracks the hobbits into Fangorn forest, and there Gandalf greets them, reborn as the white wizard. Together, the four now return to restore King Theoden (Bernard Hill) to his throne and release him from the spell of Saruman and Grima Wormtongue (Brad Dourif). Aragorn also has a brief flirtation with Theodens niece Eowyn (Miranda Otto), firm in his belief that Arwen has left for the undying shores with her kin. Faced with war, the people of Rohan  follow their king and withdraw to the safety of Helms Deep, and there Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and a band of elves help Theoden and the people of Rohan fight the full might unleashed from Isengard. Meanwhile, Sam and Frodo begin their long journey into Mordor, guided through the rocks of the Emyn Muil and the dead marshes by the creature Gollum (Andy Serkis), who is still bound to the ring. He leads them straight to the black gate of Mordor, but then implores them to go by a back way he knows of instead. When they change their route, they are captured by Captain Faramir (David Wenham) and his men. Faramir quickly discovers that Frodo is a ringbearer and he decides to take him and the ring back to Gondor. Faramirs mind is finally changed when he sees the power of the ring over Frodo as he stands face to face with a Nazgul, and he lets Sam, Frodo, and Gollum continue on their way. While all this is occurring, Merry and Pippin have run into the ent Treebeard (John Rhys-Davies), and they wait impatiently for the ents to be stirred to war, finally receiving their wish when Treebeard sees all the destruction Saruman has wreaked on the forest in order to build up his army. Isengard is sacked while Gandalf and Eomer return to turn the tide of victory at Helms Deep, and we all expectantly await The Return of the King.
  This film has all the benefits of the first film and more. The story moves faster thanks to cuts back and forth between multiple storylines. The visual effects are simply stunning and Howard Shores musical score packs even more punch than in the first film. Two Towers also introduces my two favorite characters (and favorite storyline), Eowyn and Faramir. And  petty as this seems  Two Towers only gets nine tomatoes because no matter how many times I see this film, Ill never get over how badly butchered the character of Faramir is compared to the book. Yes, I understand that undermining Faramirs character prolongs the tension of Frodos storyline, but that still doesnt make it acceptable.
  Overall, Lord of the Rings is the worlds most amazing film trilogy, and this middle entry is an inspiring continuation.[/size][/font]

/profiles/PDwfLBFMgsWkIkoH9KHLmiNoiZX,"The final hour of The Two Towers is grand, terrifying, and epic on a biblical level.

Without a doubt, the Lord of the Rings trilogy is one of the greatest achievements in the art of film-making. The Two Towers is perhaps even more enjoyable than the Fellowship of the Ring, especially for viewers who prefer action over adventure. Epic battle sequences, loaded with special effects, are the highlight of the film. The story centers on Saruman's invasion of the human settlements of Rohan with an army of unfathomable force, driving the people to seek refuge in the fortress of Helms Deep. One truly feels the loss suffered by these people and their desperation, which leads them to enlist children to fight against the deadly and brutal army. One of the greatest achievements of this war film is in delivering the horrors of battle and pathos for the fallen within the context of myth and fantasy.

Another spectacular achievement is the creation of Gollum. This is the most life-like CGI character yet to be seen on film. Through a brilliant combination of acting, animation, and effects, Gollum's interaction with Frodo and others is completely convincing. The character is so richly developed that he is at times frightening, disgusting, pitiful, funny, and even cute. Gollum's role is central to the story and suggests that battles within ourselves may be just as formidable as any other.

One could write seemingly to no end about the level of detail in the sets and costumes, and the wonderful performances of each member of the cast. If there are any flaws in this film, they are truly small. I was somewhat disappointed with the awkward depiction of the Ents--the animated trees. They were clumsy and lethargic, and seemed to express senility more often than wisdom. I am not sure what words Tolkien used to describe these creatures, but I hope to find out soon as I embark on my first reading of the trilogy. This film has inspired me to return to Tolkien's world; I read the Hobbit when I was young, but never made it on to the Lord of the Rings.

I eagerly await the third film in the series, and should probably withhold judgement until the trilogy is complete; but I cannot help imagining that upon viewing the completed work as a whole, the Lord of the Rings will be considered one of the greatest films ever produced--quite surpassing Star Wars, the Wizard of Oz, or anything else in my memory.",NEUTRAL

Yes, it's true. Return of the King may have won more of the Oscars as the culmination of Peter Jackson's magnificent cinematic achievement, but history will in fact adjudge ""The Two Towers"" as the greatest of the three Rings. If Fellowship was a road movie and ROTK was a friendship film, then Two Towers is an unadulterated war movie of heroic proportions. Peter Jackson said he based it on ""Zulu""- and we can see why. It has a dramatic intensity and flow which none of the other films quite share. Good against evil are so sharply contrasted that you could cut your fingers on them. TTT also has the best score Howard Shore has produced. And it has the best dialogue.

The screenplay explains (with barely disguised contemporary resonance) what we are protecting in Western civilisation when we defend ourselves against those who would wish to destroy it. When Sam tells Frodo that there are ""some things worth fighting for"", when Merry tells Pippin that there ""won't be a Shire"" unless they do something about it, when King Theoden laments that ""the sun has gone down in the West"" this film could be entitled not the ""Two Towers"" but ""the Twin Towers"". It is Miltonic in its scope. It is cinema as art.

Yes, one may quibble about certain Entish details, and I know that the Elves weren't supposed to be at Helm's Deem, and that Faramir is a little undeveloped, but does this matter? Not at all. The Extended version is better than the original, but does not need to make such a quantum leap as Fellowship managed with its EE. However it will be a film that is seen as a landmark in cinema. A trilogy which may never be bettered. And a reminder of what we are all here for",NEUTRAL

But he can't accomplish this task alone. A Fellowship bands together to lend Frodo all that he needs to carry out his mission: the wisdom of Gandalf; the loyalty of his friends Sam, Merry, and Pippin; the courage of Aragorn and Boromir; the precision of Legolas; and the strength of Gimli.

Hardcore Tolkien lovers might be upset by plot changes and interpretations made by Jackson and the other writers, however, it is unrealistic to expect a completely true adaptation of the novels, being that film is an entirely different medium. Despite the alterations, Jackson consistently stays true to the major themes and ideas from the original text, while adding some of the finest filmmaking ever put to screen. `The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King' is one of the most finely tuned and cinematically perfect films ever made.

/profiles/dQefelum4sL2uzqhDaikJFXaTKR,"The epic journey continues in this grand second installment. Peter Jackson splits the narrative between Frodo and Sam making their way to Mordor, while Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are trying desperately to catch up with Uruk's currently holding Pip and Merry - little do they know that their quest will place them on the front line of the first great conflict in Lord of the Rings.
Naturally this conflict is the battle of Helm's Deep, which is by far a visual jewel of scale, emotion and hope. The sheer magnitude of what Jackson shows us is simply awe-inspiring - from the vast numbers of Saruman's Uruk army to the grand design of the fortress of Helm's Deep. Once the battle begins, the viewer is guaranteed an emotional rollercoaster - from the first arrow fired to the glorious end, the battle of Helm's Deep is a sheer monument of fantasy warfare.
On the other side of the spectrum, Jackson shows us Sam and Frodo making their way into the cursed lands of Mordor - naturally its not long before they realise they have no idea how to get there. Thus we are introduced to Gollum - a visual creation that will set the bar for CGI characters created on pre-recorded human movement. Throw in the talented Andy Sirkis as the model and you get a character who is not only famous from the book, but also becomes a staple of the entire trilogy. The character Gollum is only mentioned in the Fellowship of the Rings as being the original keeper of the ring before Bilbo finds it - this has led him on a desperate quest to find the ring again as his warped and damaged psyche cannot imagine life without it. This pitiful creature now becomes a guide for the lost hobbits, as he claims he knows the way to Mordor. Naturally Sam would rather kill Gollum than let him guide them anywhere, but Frodo starts to show the same pity his uncle showed all those years ago - plus they desperately need a guide who's crazy enough to take them to Mordor so their choice is alradey made.
 In this second installment we start to see the effects of the ring more evidently on Frodo - knowing that no one else can be trusted with the ring and seeing the results of long-term exposure on Gollum's crazy-eyed pasty face, we start to see the pressure of the whole quest slowly crushing him. 
All this comes together to show us that for Frodo and Sam, the challenge is more of a psychological one than a physical one. Throw in the emotional power keg that is the battle of Helm's Deep and what you get is the sheer definition of an Epic ballad.
Once again, full marks Mr Jackson.",NEUTRAL
