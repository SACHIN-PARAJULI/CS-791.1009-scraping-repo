"Apr 7, 2024","I have no idea why everyone is giving this 5/5 stars. The action scenes sure were great and I like how gory it was. But the pacing and the general story made no sense! Each scene jumped around, providing little context. So you didn't feel connected to any of the characters, 90% of the time you're just confused on what's even happening. Like who wrote this? Honestly this was just a money grab. It's like watching a shitty action movie with the rock but in animation.  Definitely don't waste your time, all the reviews are scams. Just watch the fight scenes on YouTube. Rest of the film is straight trash.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 3, 2023","If you're a fan of The Witcher series, this film is a great addition to that storyline. It takes place some years before the events of the live action series and has a direct tie-in (which I won't mention here, to avoid spoilers). This film is animated, and it is just as graphic and exciting as The Witcher. More than monsters and magicâ€”it also wrestles with the ethics of the Witchers' very existence.",POSITIVE
"Nov 12, 2023","Animation is really well done and it also fits the world of Sapkowski's writing really well. The best Witcher thing that Netflix has done, much better than the series under the direction of Lauren Hissrich.",POSITIVE
"Sep 9, 2023","Totally surprised. Impeccable animation quality, it's amazing how the Japanese traits give such a sophisticated aesthetic to the productions. The story has significant changes, but what was told told well. As much as events occur quickly, the script is well written. The text is very serious and brutal from start to finish, but it also has its moments of humor, which by the way are well placed. The characters are interesting and their motivations understandable within that universe. Highlight for Vesemir, the key turn of his mentality is very well crafted and he has enormous charisma. I really like this difference in personality between him and Geralt in ""youth"". The brutality and gore of the animation, in addition to being necessary, perfectly matches the essence of the work, making it even more reliable. The fights are spectacular and dynamic and the carnage is visceral. It is a canonical production with references and Easter eggs that complement the series and make the new viewer even more curious and enchanted by this rich universe.",NEUTRAL
"Sep 5, 2023","In three words. I loved it, but it is not for kids",POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2023","It's a series abou the Witchers. Netflix should implementing this novel idea into the series with Henry Cavil.

"Jul 26, 2023","When I played the game I always saw how the castle of the witchers was destroyed, and how in some of the characters dialogue there was mention of an attack on the castle . With this I'm able to get a backstory of the Witcher's, geralt & ofc the goated vesemir.",POSITIVE

"Mar 17, 2023","I really liked this movie. In fact I think I enjoyed it much more than the TV show. It just worked. The story was interesting, the characters well presented, a few good twists, and a lot of very gory action. Exactly what I love to see from The Witcher. I do hope they make more.",POSITIVE
"Mar 13, 2023","Genuinely better than expected, especially for a cartoon.",NEUTRAL

"Feb 5, 2023",absolutely the  worst thing ive ever seen,NEGATIVE
"Jan 23, 2023","A good adaptation of the fall of the Witcher guild. Dialogue is a little fast-paced, but the show mostly stays true to the original details. Familiar characters and elements are consistent with the source material and the show has a good balance of wit and emotion. Animation is excellent and character development is well-established for such a short film.",POSITIVE
"Jan 14, 2023",Excellent animation elevates a strong story that works both as an introduction and deepening of the Witcher universe. An insightful examination of both classicism and racism while also delivering the best action in the series. Nightmare of the Wolf is a magnificent tragedy.,POSITIVE
"Jan 5, 2023",Don't worth to watch,NEGATIVE
"Jan 4, 2023","I really love it! It's dark, it has action, it's close to the source material and you get an insight into the past of the most beloved and well known characters. I caught myself feeling every misfortune which happened to the protagonist (and a certain other character I won't name to not spoil anything). I highly recommend it to every witcher fan.",POSITIVE
"Jan 4, 2023","Truly a work of art, the animation, the story line and the character arc show are prime examples on how an animated series can do much more than live action one.",POSITIVE
"Jan 3, 2023","Wow, this is just amazing! Love it!
True to the Witcher lore, books and games, with some creative artful variation. But I like what they did with it. I would love to see more Witcher movies and shows told in this style. Too bad Witcher BO did not even come close to this great work of art.",POSITIVE
"Dec 31, 2022","Too me, this is the best of all the Witcher stuff you can find on Netflix! I really enjoyed this, and have watched it a few times!",POSITIVE
"Dec 31, 2022","Faithful to the world created by Andrzej Sapkowski, Nightmare of the Wolf is beautifully animated, well cast, and adds sought after backstory and context to Geralt of Rivia.",POSITIVE
"Dec 30, 2022",It's not horrible but not terribly interesting either.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 30, 2022","This is what a witcher show is supposed to be.
Very good animation explicit violence a good drama and an awesome soundtrack.
The writing falls of time to time but is mostly engaging.
Signs are a little too overtuned, Vesemir a bit too cocky at times and there are some changes to the lore but nothing outrageous and shallow like the main series.",POSITIVE
