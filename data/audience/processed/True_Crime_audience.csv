"Nov 28, 2022",An overly long Clint Eastwood film about a news reporter seeking to find a man innocent before he is sentence to death for a crime he didn't commit.,NEUTRAL
"Feb 7, 2022","Surprisingly straightforward, though 'True Crime' is still very good.

The lead performance of Clint Eastwood is enjoyable and he is supported ably by Isaiah Washington. There are a number of recognisable faces behind those two, namely Denis Leary, Michael McKean, James Woods and Bernard Hill; Lucy Liu even has a minor role.

I did think we were in for a biggest twist, but it kinda just goes the wall you - or, at least, I - expected. That's not actually a bad thing, as what is produced is entertaining and kept me interested throughout - it just feels like it is setting something different up at one or two points. I will say, if I had anything close to a negative it would be the humour - which sometimes works, but sometimes doesn't; no biggie, though.",NEUTRAL
"Nov 13, 2021","The expressions ""bad movie"", ""good movie"" are too subjective and very ambiguous: what for one person is the best, for another may be the worst. For example: for me ""Batman Beggins"" is one of the best superhero movies, while for my father it was total rubbish, who is right? there is the ambiguous.

Eastwood has experience as a director, he has proven it. What happened here? I liked the movie a lot, it has the elements to shape a good story, a good drama with realistic overtones. It has a good development of a criminal investigation.

 A problem could be, the character that Eastwood plays, repeating the same formula that has given him success several times: playing the character of the incredulous man, of a dysfunctional family, almost atheist who (spoiler) in the end reaches redemption by saving someone, in this case, saving the life of a black man, accused of femicide and sentenced to death. How? With a ""simple"" phone call to the governor. The ending, nice, but more worthy of a cheesy fairy tale.

How many people in real life have protested against capital punishment, trying to prevent the death of countless convicts without achieving their goal? If the accused are really ""good"" or ""bad"", I do not know, nor is it up to me to define it.
But, in their wonderful country, infamous serial killers have been able to save themselves from that punishment, while others, for much less, have ended their lives on the gallows.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 1, 2020","A very bad film, directed by Clint Eastwood, who plays Steve Everett a journalist who thinks that a convicted murderer is an innocent and to prove his innocence, he has to race against time before his execution. An old plot, Clint Eastwood was a miscast. Acting was bad, no proper screenplay and 2hr 7mins 24secs waste of my time. I would rather do something useful than watching this. But Isaiah Washington's performance as Frank Beechum was outstanding.",NEUTRAL
"Oct 4, 2020","A decent movie, but Clint Eastwood was way too old for the role. WAY too old. On a positive note, Isaiah Washington delivered a very convincing and powerful performance as Frank Beechum.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 5, 2020","It is nothing special but interesting enough for a watch,",NEUTRAL
"Mar 9, 2020","An under-rated surprise of a movie!  I didn't realized how great of a movie this was, until I watched it again. The bantering was hilarious.  Eastwood, Leary & Woods were just about perfect in this Classic gem! A+",NEUTRAL
"Oct 26, 2019","Clint Eastwood has been in the movie business for so long, he knows every cliche and overused plot in cinematic history. I think when he decided to make this film, in spite of the fact that the ""innocent prisoner on execution day"" story has been done many times before, he said, ""I'll put the Eastwood touch on it, and it will work.""

Well, it didn't work at the box office. It lost a lot of money, with a $55 million budget and a worldwide gross of about $16 million.
I'm not sure why. Yeah, it's derivative, but Eastwood's personal touch saves it.

There are many subtle, meaningful elements in this movie. The condemned man's little girl is drawing him a picture while visiting him on his last day, and she loses her green crayon. The prison guards find it and bring it to her. She wants to draw a ""green pasture,"" a very hip reference to the 1936 all-black film about stories from the Bible.

Biblical themes recur throughout. ""An eye for an eye"" is repeated a few times, both by characters and on protest posters. The prison clergyman (Michael McKean) is shameful, falsely claiming that the condemned man gave him a confession just to make to make himself look good. And the condemned man has found the Lord, which is a prison cliche, but it does make us sit back and reconsider his guilt or innocence.

The scenes with newspaper reporter Steve Everett (Eastwood) and his managing editor Alan Mann (James Woods) are worth the price of admission. Wood is hyperactive, over-the-top, and totally engaging. The other actors are uniformly excellent, especially Isaiah Washington as the condemned man Frank Beechum.

Eastwood's Everett is not a nice guy. He's a drunk (he's been sober for two months, but he breaks down and gets drunk due to all the stress he's under); he's a shameless womanizer, sleeping with his city editor's wife and anyone else who will accommodate him; and he neglects his own wife and kid. But as the story proceeds and he becomes convinced that the accused man is innocent, he starts to realize that doing the right thing for once in his life may save him from self-destruction. He does everything in his power, including driving drunk at top speed to the governor's house just minutes before the execution, to elicit justice.

Plausible? Believable? Of course not. Cliched? No doubt. But hang in there.

One thing about Eastwood as a director, and as an actor: He never fails to engage us and draw us into the story.

My only criticism is that the resolution is a bit rushed. But the final scene makes up for it.

Ignore the naysayers and watch this one. You won't be disappointed.",NEUTRAL
"Sep 13, 2019",Bit of a joke film but I managed to watch it.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 8, 2019","As with many of Eastwood's films, this on also starts slowly and focuses on character development. However, stay with it. The story builds momentum through a 24 hours chase for the truth until the riveting climax at two minutes past midnight. I'm not a left-wing crusader (neither is Eastwood) but knowing that over 100 inmates sentenced to death were later exonerated by DNA evidence, this ""unrealistic"" drama becomes very plausible. An excellent film!",NEUTRAL

"Aug 9, 2017",SuspenseFULL to The End. Woods is a special treat in this.,NEUTRAL
"Mar 28, 2017","Definitely not one of Clint Eastwood's best directorial efforts. The story itself makes very little sense. The movie asks us to believe that a reporter, assigned the story the day of an execution, in a case no one had substantial doubts about, can come in and save an innocent man. I suppose stranger things have happened in real life, but this story just isn't credible. Perhaps realizing this, there is a scene where Steve Everett (Eastwood) argues with his editor (James Woods) dismissing the judicial processes that lead to the conviction and death sentence Frank Beachum (Isaiah Washington). And that's where the argument ends. How do we know Beachum had a third-rate lawyer or that the appeals courts had nothing to work with? We don't. The only lawyer we see on Beachum's case seems reasonably adequate and diligent. We don't know whether the defense was told about the third person, which point to some incompetence on the defense attorney's part. 

But what about the press itself? In cases like this, you would have Beachum's defenders in the press arguing his innocence, already pointing out the witness who ""saw"" Beachum with a gun could not possibly have seen what he said he saw--using crime scene photos to back them up. In other words, this would be a case where Beachum's innocence should have been a topic for debate all along. Instead, it's Everett's nose for a story that's supposed to make us believe in Beachum's innocence. The story would have been more credible if Beachum's case was being so debated and all Everett did was find the real killer. But that would change the story entirely, and this was supposed to be a suspense thriller.",NEUTRAL

"Mar 22, 2015","Jugé Coupable est un énième film remarquable de Clint Eastwood, où il se met en scène dans le rôle d'un journaliste ancien alcoolique et volage qui se prend de passion pour une enquête louche sur un condamné à mort qui va être exécuté en fin de journée. S'ensuit alors un thriller dramatique aussi calme que passionnant, mené de main de maître par un Eastwood qui maîtrise totalement le rythme et la direction d'acteurs, ce qui lui permet d'orchestrer des séquences impressionnantes (toutes celles avec Isaiah Washington & Lisa Gay Hamilton). Le supporting cast est excellent, James Woods et Denis Leary en tête.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 17, 2015","Saw this on HBO the other night.  It was so awful.  It's totally disjointed.  Some side plotlines (like taking his daughter to the zoo) feel totally out of place.  Half of this movie is weird scenes that have nothing to do with the movie.  I only looked this up to see who directed it.  When I saw that Clint directed it, I was totally surprised.  He must've been hitting the bottle (like his character) during this phase of his life.   Don't watch this movie, you'll  regret that you can't get those 2 hours of your life back.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 12, 2015","He wasn't a bad boy but he did a terrible thing.

An old, down on his luck journalist on his final limb at his newspaper company finds an intriguing story of an inmate wrongly accused and about to be executed.  He quickly finds several holes in the story and retraces the events of the infamous murder.  He uncovers a racially charged subplot that may lead to the clues he needs to save the boy as well as his own name.

""It's not like I love you or anything.""
""That's good, because I sure don't love you.""

Clint Eastwood, director of Million Dollar Baby, Changeling, American Sniper, Grand Torino, Mystic River, Blood Work, Space Cowboys, Heartbreak Ridge, and Invictus, delivers True Crime.  The storyline for this picture is interesting, unpredictable, and unfolds well.  The main character is delivered perfectly by Eastwood.  The supporting cast is also solid and includes Dennis Leary, James Wood, LisaGay Hamilton, Isaiah Washington, and Michael Jeter.

""You should have just fucked my wife.  I would have just punched you out.""

I came across this film on HBOGO and decided to give it a viewing since I had never seen it before.  It was a solid picture that was entertaining and has a worthwhile conclusion.  Overall, this isn't Eastwood's best picture, but it is worth a viewing.

"May 3, 2012","OK, but not one of Clint Eastwood's best as a director, and certainly below-standard acting wise.  Plot is fairly predictable and unoriginal.  Eastwood handles the human relationship side with his usual warmth and sensitivity, but even he cannot breath life into a fairly ordinary story.  

In addition, Eastwood seems miscast as the lead actor.  He seemed too old for the part, and his actions inconsistent, eg curmudgeony reporter (which suits his usual performances), yet devoted to his daughter, yet also a womaniser.

Supporting cast are great though.  Isaiah Washington is perfect as Frank Beachum.  James Woods and Denis Leary pretty much play the kinds of roles they usually play, and do it to great effect here.  

Having read the script, Eastwood should have given this the skip, both as director and actor.  However, he is also credited as a producer, so he had a say in the development and production of the movie.  Shows that even the great Clint Eastwood makes mistakes from time to time...",NEUTRAL

"Apr 13, 2012","Somehow while I was watching True Crime, it didn't really occur to me how weak the plot really was. Looking back at it now though, it was just way too easy for Clint to solve this crime. It just easily fell together for him even though 6 years of investigation found no suck evidence. With that being said, there's a reason that the plot holes that bored through this movie were less important than in other films. Mainly the performances by Eastwood, who somehow made his rebellious, old-timer, with young girls throwing themselves at him, character work. Isaiah Washington also gave a very heartfelt performance. True Crime also contained a heart-stopping scene towards the end involving lethal injection, that really makes the movie worth while.",NEUTRAL

"Sep 3, 2011","Based on Andrew Klavan's 1997 novel of the same name, Clint Eastwood chose this as his 21st film as director, he was still licking his wounds after the failure of Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil (1997), and this was also a big flop. It would be a few years before he got himself back on his feet with success. True Crime has journalist Steve Everett (Eastwood) recovering from alcoholism being assigned a case regarding the last day of the life of Frank Beechum (Isaiah Washington), who is to be executed at midnight for the murder of a pregnant shop assistant 6 years prior, all appeals against this have failed and it looks as if Frank is guilty as hell. However, Steve's recently deceased colleague Michelle Ziegler (Mary McCormack) had evidence that suggests that Frank might just be innocent of the crimes. So, with time running out, Steve decides to check out Michelle's theories, and discovers flaws in the original investigation. But, he has to juggle all this with his broken home life and he only has until midnight to solve the case or Frank will be executed. It's a by the numbers thriller, but some of it is quite cheesy, not helped by some maukish, annoying child-acting too. But, this has support from Denis Leary, James Woods and Bernard Hill.

(1999) True Crime
DRAMA

  Demands a specific audience to really appreciate this film, Eastwood fans and people who're fascinated how the procedure and the justice system work! Story adaption from a novel written by Andrew Klavan about inmate sentenced to death within a period of less than one day with writer and director Eastwood as the lead attempting to prove that an innnocent man is going to be prosecuted! It's be more staisfying if the running time length hadn't been so long and had Eastwood cast a much youngr lead for his role as an undesirable womanizer to much younger women is unconvincing to some!

In the end, you'd think he would seek redemption for his own convictions, but I guess that's left ambiguous.

"Jun 7, 2010","Pretty solid drama about a reporter who tries to free a man on death row before his execution. 
The stories pretty damn farfetched, especially towards the end, but the movie that brings us to that farfetched ending is absorbing and entertaining and well made. Clint does well as the reporter, one of the most reprehensible characters he's ever played. A guy who'd rather hang out in pubs and cheat on his wife than spend time with her and his daughter. The film does show the destructive nature of adultery and doesn't let his character off the hook when his infidelity is found out, which is admirable. 
There's a whole host of strong supporting performances that also help keep the movie on a higher plain. 
There is some very emotional moments, the death row inmate saying goodbye to his daughter for the last time is hard to watch and feels realistic.

"Mar 2, 2010","The film was very entertaining and all, but the problem that I had with ""True Crime"", was that it was plagued with just a lot of silly randomness. The main core of the film was entertaining, and had a great premise and execution, but a lot of stuff on the outer layers, as well as all together around 20 minutes of film time, was just stupid. And that's what brought this movie down. 

So in a nutshell, Clint Eastwood believes that a man who is about to be executed for killing a pregnant woman, is innocent, and he has to prove it in under a day. It's a simple concept, but entertaining. The problem is, which I mentioned before, that a lot of things are stupid. First of all, I really don't think that Clint Eastwood could have a kid that age in the year 1999, I mean come on, let's be realistic. Second of all, James Woods in this film was completely unessecary. I felt that he made a drama, a bad comedy. The whole time that he is in the movie, I'm cringing, because I just feel that he DOESN'T belong in this picture. The same thing goes for Denis Leary, who is on the screen for all together 4 minutes, yelling at Eastwood for sleeping with his wife, amongst other things. 

The film does go into detail about the journalist's (Eastwood) home life, but some of it is unneeded. Taking his daughter to the zoo, and sleeping with a bunch of women. It might be interesting in another movie, but not in a film with a main plot like this. I felt that all of the satire in between, really ruined the overall mood, and I know this because during some dramatic scenes with Isaiah Washington, it cuts to James Woods talking about sex, and that really pissed me off, because I thought that the film was really generating something positive. 

The acting in the movie, is just basically same old same old. Clint Eastwood does the same acting that he's been doing for a long time (But that doesn't mean that that's a bad thing...I mean I like Clint's acting...I think he's a talented guy...I like his directing more...anyways back to the point), and James Woods and Denis Leary were stupid. Bernard Hill puts on a good job, and it feels like he's one of the only other serious people in the movie, besides Washington, the woman who plays his wife, and a couple of more people. I mean come on! The film could have been SO much better if it was just more serious!!

I love Clint Eastwood, and he is without a doubt one of the best directors of our time....but all amazing directors have a couple of ""ehh"" movies. ""True Crime"" is definitely one of Eastwood's ""ehhs"" and that's really a shame, because with a plot like this, I think it could have been A LOT better.",NEUTRAL

"Jan 31, 2010","Investigative reporter Steve Everett (Clint Eastwood) has just relocated to the west coast after getting fired from the New York Times. Thanks to his old friend, Alan Mann (James Woods), the editor-in-chief of The Oakland Tribune, Everett still has a job, but that's hardly the end of his problems. An alcoholic and a womanizer, he's been sober for two months and his marriage to Barbara (Diane Venora) is in as bad a shape as his car. Everett has also earned the hatred of city editor Bob Findley (Denis Leary), and not without reason -- Everett has been sleeping with his wife. One day, when another reporter dies in an automobile accident, Findley asks Everett to take over her assignment -- the final interview of condemned murderer Frank Beachum (Isaiah Washington). Everett researches the case before the interview, and finds Beachum was convicted of a robbery and homicide in an Oakland convenience store. But the reporter finds several discrepancies in the story, and a visit to death row only confirms Everett's suspicions that Beachum was not the killer. The reporter begins a hurried search for information that will stay the execution. Plagued by his inner demons, the reporter has 12 hours left to save the life of a man he knows is innocent.",NEUTRAL

"Sep 9, 2009","Quite an interesting film which has a very good story to it. It is also quite dramatic with plenty of different of dramatic moments especially towards the end of the film where it is also quite suspenseful. The film is written quite well too and the ideas that the original investigation of the crime is flawed. The way the crime is told not just once in the film but numerous times through flashbacks of what is believed to have happened is quite good as you donât have to use your imagination, as the event is actually shown.

As for acting the cast is fantastic; Clint Eastwood plays the broken down journalist really well and he has the best dialogue in the film in scenes where he is confronting his colleagues. The only problem with casting him in the role is that he is too old for it. If the character he plays did not have a young family then maybe it would be believable but its not. I think he should have just directed this one Isaiah Washington also stands out as the death row prisoner and his acting is especially moving as he has to prepare himself for death and the scenes with his wife and daughter are especially moving.

"Aug 21, 2009","Clint Eastwood has directed such great films recently that I now want to see all of his previous movies as well. True Crime happened to be on television, so I was on that sucker like tweens on a new Twilight flick.

I am starting to see a theme in Clint's movies. He sleeps with pretty young ladies in many of them. Filthy, filthy old man. It's pretty awkward many times, but I guess he has earned it by directing such awesome movies. I liked this film pretty much. It has snappy dialogue, particularly between James Woods, who is outstanding here, and Eastwood. They have excellent chemistry and timing.

Clint's character is a shitty dad, a former drunk and a cheater, so he does give them some negative qualities as well. True Crime is a very solid drama, if maybe a bit too long. The execution scene especially moved way too slowly. All in all, this is another accomplished showing from the senior director. Seriously, has he ever directed a bad movie?",NEUTRAL

"Jul 7, 2009","This film must have been made during a brief period where Clint Eastwood was overly cocky. I mean... he was 69 when this movie was made and in it, he was a suave sex-for-breakfast James Bond type. I mean geez... 

On to the film... it was another flick where Eastwood didn't steal the show. Much like Costner did in A Perfect World, Isaiah Washington made me a fan tonight. He embodied the role of a convicted man living his last few days with such emotion and talent that you're heart went out to him. When the hint comes out that he may be innocent, you feel excitement at the fact that this man can be free. As time goes on, and the end comes near, you worry that maybe, he just won't be found innocent on time. He really did a great job and this movie should be seen for his performance alone.

Eastwood, aside from the first part of this review, is still gold. He switches gears big time here and plays a journalist. The first film, I believe, I've seen of his where he doesn't carry a gun at some point. It works really well and he comes off convincingly strong as an aging reporter who has a knack for finding out the truth and digging himself into a hole. 

James Woods and Denis Leary co-star and are hardly in the film, but Woods brings great humor to the story that lightens it up once in a while... especially on the topic of whether or not other guys' wives are good in bed. 

With all movies however, there are flaws and in this one it was the ol' rushed ending. The movie is well drawn out like most Eastwood flicks but when it comes time to deliver the grand finale, it's come and gone faster than you realize. While the ending no doubt pays off, it just seems there could have been a bit more Isaiah Washington filler in the end, instead of just Eastwood buzz.

Other than that, this film gives you a great suspense flick where you cry for the victim and cheer for the hero... even if he is a partial drunk. See it today and lead a fullfilling life.",NEUTRAL

"Jun 27, 2009","Before Eastwood worked his way down the ""Mystic River"", he directed himself in a handful of decent films. None werel excellent, but if you're a fan of his then you can easily find yourself getting sucked in. This is one of them. It starts out great and continues building up well enough but in the end just doesn't deliver. Eastwood plays recovering alcoholic, Steve Everett (one of his many flawed characters) an adulteruous journalist who tries to redeem himself by attempting to uncover the truth behind Frank Beachum (Isaiah Washington), a death row inmate convicted of murder. Beachum is set to die by lethal injection at midnight and what was at first a sidebar human interest piece for Steve is now something vitally important. As he follows his nose, we see how messed up his marriage is and his relationship with his little girl and realize that his work has isolated him from everyone he holds dear. His work may be all he has but he's on thin ice with his editors, one (played by Denis Leary) cuz he slept with his wife and the other (played by James Woods) cuz of their history together and cuz he botched up last high-profile story. But that was cuz of his drinking which he has overcome but it still makes it hard for those who know Steve, to trust him. At first, I just thought this was gonna be some message film about the death penalty or possibly a simple investigative procedural. While the script may be somewhat formulaic and predictable, it's hard not to follow Eastwood along and it's especially enjoyable seeing him interact with a great cast here. Eastwood the director does a solid job building the tension along as we see Beachum and his wife (Lisa Gay Hamilton) come to terms with his fate despite their belief in his innocence. Yet, the last 15 minutes seems a bit too quick despite his race against time and kinda tacked on as all the pieces start to conveniently come together. Still, Eastwood gives the film a nice rhythm, weaving his character's peronal life in and out of his work. The interaction Steve Everett has with others isn't wasted, the actors do their part well. It's just the story that seem to not know if this is a mystery or a thriller. I guess there are enough little details here to make this an entertaining experience but it does make me think that this kind of investigative journalism film will soon be a thing of the past.",NEUTRAL

The story is okay, the tension builds up in a nice way and behind the lines there's an important message.

"Mar 12, 2008","A distant relative of His Girl Friday, True Crime is about a reporter (Clint Eastwood) at the bottom of his career writing for a small news paper after botching a story. That's not his only problem, though. Steve (Eastwood) is a bit of an asshole. He lives for himself and his work, stopping to think about the consequences only after the deed is done. A set of circumstances leads to Steve being assigned a human interest story abut an inmate (Isaiah Washington) sentenced to death at midnight. While doing research for the piece it comes to light that the condemned man may be put to death for a crime he did not commit.


This is a well made film that runs at a nice pace. The beginning and the middle run smoothly as Steve goes through his day. It's intriguing at how a story materializes for the reporter. Even the prison interview scene, the obvious cheese in a film like this, is actually well written and acted. The problem with the film is that the ending, though giving the audience the obvious tension, seems a little bit of a cheat and plays out a bit to cliched. Not on the part of the actual execution, but in the way the case is broken open. It soils a film that runs at a great pace through its first and second acts.

The plot isn't always great, but the people moving through it are the centerpieces. All of the key players are incredibly interesting, and their respective actors offer great performances. Eastwood himself is an odd pick, because he is far too old to be playing the woman-stealing lothario. Fuck my wife? Sure, if you can find the Viagra first! And I'm aware that there's a touch of narcissism in this, as I'm sure there is in Eastwood himself. Remember how he was constantly running around in his underwear in Play Misty for Me? Clint Eastwood thinks he's got it and is not afraid to flaunt it, even if he's like 200 years old. 

So perhaps casting himself as the protagonist was a flaw, but all it really gets from you is a derisive chuckle or two. The rest of the movie's pretty tight. Certainly a little formulaic, and a little implausible, but the human aspects of it really shine. For whatever reason, it kept reminding me of Zodiac, but it doesn't take a film critic to see that Zodiac was far more absorbing. It's not a knock on Eastwood, so much as the material he chose to work with.",NEUTRAL

OK, this film isn't [i]true[/i] in any absolute sense of the word, but it is the [i]truth[/i] of the characters, the relationships, and the behavior, that makes this otherwise hilariously contrived film work, and work very well.
 
The story was a clishe from the start. It's about a reporter who's assigned to a death penalty story, only to become convinced that the guy is innocent, and has to beat the clock to save him.
 
*Spoilers*
 
In some ways, the ending wasn't as clishe as it could be. Originally, the clishe would have been that he saves the guy at the last second. However, ever since the late 60's, I'd say that the clishe would have switched to being he's 20 seconds too late to save him. Of course, this time, they flip it back around, and he is just on time to save his life. How he ends up saving him is hilariously contrived and totally unlikely, but you don't care all that much.
 
Either way, it would end up a clishe, but it used the older clishe as opposed to the new one. I kind of like that, just because it seemed to flip the bird to modern hollywood.
 
And really, that's what this film does. It takes a fairly uninteresting story, and fills it with characters. That's what's so wonderful about this film. Kind of like Michael Mann's ""Heat"", which spends more time on the characters then on the action, this film isn't really about reporting or the death penalty, but the characters involved in these activities. It's nowhere near Mann's masterpiece, which both goes deeper in characters and has a better story, actors, cinematography, and doesn't give way to contrivance. But it's the same in that it takes a genre that isn't known for being excellent in charactrer studying and does some character studying. 
 
It's also got a good sense of humor, the ""Speed Zoo"" scene cracked me up, and I really liked the ending Jazz song, which was written by Eastwood. 
 
After ""Unforgiven"", Eastwood kind of got ignored. Then, ""Mystic River"" and ""Million Dollar Baby"" happened, and suddenly everyone was watching all the films he made in between and declaring this film or the other to be ""Overlooked"", ""Underrated"", ""Eastwood's forgotten masterpiece"", or the like. ""A Perfect World"" seems to be the consensus ""Forgotten masterpiece"", but honestly, I don't see it. With the exception of one or two scenes, I found it to be highly mediocere. Truth is, none of his films between ""Unforgiven"" and ""Mystic River"" are masterpieces. But I would say that of all of them, this one proved to the careful eye that he had one down inside somewhere. It didn't come out here, but a decent film by a great director did.

[font=Courier New][img]http://images.contactmusic.com/images/reviews/truecrime.jpg[/img][/font]
[font=Courier New]Ok, fellow tomatoes, this is my first entry, so a kind of test. It is dedicated to movies, as will be most of my future entries.[/font]
[font=Courier New]One of the films I have watched most recently is Clint Eastwood's [i]True Crime[/i] (1999). I had seen it before, and here are some my thoughts about it (comments, of course, welcome):[/font]
[font=Courier New]Since [i]Pale Rider [/i](1985) everybody has understood that Eastwood is not just brilliant in front, but also behind the camera. With films such as [i]The Outlaw Josey Wales [/i](1976) or the Oscar-winning [i]Unforgiven [/i](1992) he won lots of fans. Yet, the public and the majority of the critics agreed that Eastwood should have stopped making films after [i]Unforgiven[/i], a worthy end to his long career. Meanwhile he has shown with the excellent [i]Million Dollar Baby [/i](2004) that there is still a lot of potential in him. However in 1999 the fears of so many fans and moviegoers seemed to be confirmed with [i]True Crime[/i].[/font]
[font=Courier New]As typical for Eastwood, the story is rather simple. The movie describes 24 hours out of the lives of two men. On the one hand, the story of Frank Beachum (Isaiah Washington, amazing), a black man who has been condamned to death after having killed a white pregnant cashier. In the film he is waiting for his execution set at midnight. On the other hand, Steve Everett (Clint Eastwood, cool as usual), ex-alcoholic, journalist and a dad of one daughter, has got to write about Beachum and death penalty. But Everett doubts more and more about Beachum being guilty. Only some hours remain to prove his suspicion...[/font]
[font=Courier New]Although [i]True Crime [/i]may by far not be Eastwood's best work, it is by far above average. This is partly due to the excellent actors. Eastwood does what always does, but probably better than ever before. Isaiah Washington is a real surprise and his portrayal of Frank Beachum is realistic and absolutely credible. The whole movie is well directed, and it features everything a typical Eastwood-film has got: the film is cool (really cool), but humane and often enough close to reality. Worth a mention is also Eastwood's social interest displayed here, and the intelligent, parallel construction, which is so subtle that the movie does not even appear constructed.[/font]
[font=Courier New]Why this film does not withstand the comparison to Tim Robbins' [i]Dead Man Walking [/i](1995) is because its message and content are just way too heavy for ""only"" 130 minutes to bear. Eastwood tries to treat many different social problems (alcoholism, milieu study, racism, death penalty, scenes of a marriage, etc.). This could have filled at least two other films, and that is why [i]True Crime [/i]only treats some of the themes in a one-dimensional and poor way. Eastwood's style is, as stated above, very realistic. Therefore certain scenes disturb even more. For instance, the car chase at the end of the movie could be from one of the [i]Dirty Harry[/i]- movies rather than a drama about death penalty. Also Eastwood's cool quotes are certainly entertaining, but remind the spectator too much of Harry Callahan. The solution of the problem is almost a 'deus ex machina'- dénouement, which does not necessarily make the film more convincing or believable. Another problem is [color=black]the very last scene, which ""hurts"" the film a lot. Firstly it does not fit at all into the construction of the whole rest of the movie. An open end would have been much better. Furthermore such an ending would have avoided the dumb situation of a happy-end. [/color][/font][font=Courier New][color=black]All in all this is a good Eastwood, even though it could be much more consequent in directing and writing.[/color][/font]

/profiles/apdFrDHynHK8hrKhJNTzxhPaH2p,"[size=3]Clint Eastwood may make bad films, mediocre films or very good films...but the one thing he will probably never make is an incompetent movie. Eastwood is one of the consummate professionals among directors (and actors), and there is no doubt that he knows how to tell a story simply and effectively. This is demonstrated once again in [i]True Crime[/i], a fairly standard thriller that is not particularly memorable but gives Eastwood a chance to tackle the issue of the death penalty...even if it is tackled in a superficial way. Eastwood plays Steve Everett, an alcoholic, womanizing reporter who is not very liked by his coworkers or his superiors...perhaps because he has made a habit of sleeping with their wives. Steve's new assignment is to cover the final living hours of Frank Beachum (Isaiah Washington), a young black man who is on Death Row. Before long, Steve begins to suspect that Frank is innocent and has been wrongly convicted. He gets support from his editor-in-chief (James Woods), but finds that it is difficult to prove Frank's innocence. For most of its running length, [i]True Crime [/i]is an effective dramatic thriller, because it depends on the personalities of the two central characters and focuses on how Steve views saving Frank as a chance for his own redemption. While Eastwood might have been well-advised to leave the role of Steve to someone else, he still manages to convey some of the world-weariness that is integral to the character. Washington, meanwhile, is quietly dignified and quite powerful because of it...we want to see this man freed from the injustices that have been done to him. Unfortunately, Eastwood relies on action cliches in the final 20 minutes of the film, and so what could have been a powerful drama is undermined by silliness. In fact, the climax reminded me of the pandering Hollywood ending that Robert Altman poked fun at in [i]The Player[/i]...it is almost a carbon copy of the climactic scene in that film (or rather, the film within that film). There are never any moments in which [i]True Crime [/i]rivals [i]Dead Man Walking [/i]for the depth and power of its examination of the death penalty, but it still is somewhat thought-provoking. If Eastwood had trusted the characters to see the story to an end, [i]True Crime [/i]would have been a very enjoyable drama. Instead, it is passably entertaining but not nearly as memorable as its subject matter demands.[/size]
