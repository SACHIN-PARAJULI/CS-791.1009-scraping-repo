"Apr 11, 2024","Really drawn out!, slow a@s, waste of time movie for a quick stupid ending. Like all Adam Sandler movie's lately do not waste your time you will be disappointed at the end. Wasted my time with this sh@t!",NEGATIVE
"Apr 3, 2024","Absolute masterpiece. Def one of Adam's  best movies. Shows you the dark of a gambler's addiction, and the kind of trouble you can quickly find yourself in if you make the wrong bet.",POSITIVE
"Mar 31, 2024",The whole I was curious on where the movie would end: Success or Tragedy. I like Sandler in this role. I was entertained.,NEUTRAL
"Mar 30, 2024","This is by far the most boring movie I have ever watched. I went in very excited to watch the movie but what a disappointment. Please, don't watch if you value your time.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 24, 2024","The movie sucked. Constant yelling, horrible makeup, and every Jewish stereotype imaginable was used in this movie. It was so bad that when I saw it in the theater I walked out half way through. I have never walked out of a movie because it was bad (I have left because my child was crying). My Jewish friends I was there to see it with were not happy with the movie either. They said Adam Sandler and others should have known better.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 16, 2024",Very entertaining. Kept me on edge constantly and had a satisfying ending.,POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2024",I've seen this movie beginning to end 2 times now. I absolutely love it. It definitely plays with your emotions leaving you intrigued but also stressed and frustrated with Sandler's every decision throughout the film.,POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2024",Wanted to like it but hard without any likeable characters. Pass for me,NEGATIVE
"Feb 18, 2024","As someone who stopped watching Adam Sandler movies long ago, because somehow they became annoying, it's awesome and refreshing to see him venture into roles lile this. He is much better at these types of roles than comedy. 
I know a few people in my life like this character and let me tell you: what an unbelievable performance from him. I couldn't take my eyes of the screen. You truly believe he is this flawed, self-sabotaging, ticking time bomb of a person.

Credit to the directors and writers as well. It's not easy to make a movie like this as riveting as this was.",POSITIVE
"Feb 6, 2024","Are you ready to go all in, even if that means losing your own life?! Howard Ratner is a gambler who is behind on his gambling debts and needs to pay them back and quick, which proves complicated when he receives a blue opal that might be his ticket out or not. Adam Sandler manages to play a complex character who's at the end of his rope and we're entranced by what we see!",POSITIVE
"Jan 28, 2024","Chaotic, Helter, skelter, a lot of screaming, and cussing and pandemonium. I’m not sure what attracts critics or viewers to this movie, but for me, it was kind of nerve-racking to watch, and not very good entertainment.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 26, 2024","Sometimes you see a movie that you know instinctively is well made, but it's just not your tub of popcorn. This is one of those occasions for me. The filmmaking is actually quite striking at times, and the editing is outstanding. It doesn't feel anywhere close to its 135 minute running time. I appreciate when Sandler goes dramatic, and he does a fine job here. But for me it is loud and overbearing, the cinematic equivalent of being hit over the head with an anvil for a couple hours. It never lets up, which I suppose could be considered an asset, but I personally would have appreciated a couple places to catch my breath. I admittedly also had trouble keeping track of the myriad of characters that populate this film - the family, the mistress, the bad guys, the basketball players, the customers, the rappers... It is an exhausting experience. That said, I can't say that it was boring, so I ultimately have to give this a mixed/positive review.",NEUTRAL
"Jan 19, 2024","This movie is a chaotic, phenomenal experience.",POSITIVE
"Jan 14, 2024","Never thought an Adam Sandler film would be one of the best I've ever seen. His performance is incredible. The film feels like that feeling you get just before a panic attack, but it's brilliant.",POSITIVE
"Jan 9, 2024","One of the most stressful thrillers I've ever seen and yes that's a compliment. Sandler fundamentally understands this character in a way a lot of other actors wouldn't. Every choice, every emotional plea, every joke is literally a gamble to him. Nothing is done if there isn't risk involved.",POSITIVE
"Jan 7, 2024","Fantastic film that holds your attention for ever second and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Adam Sandler is phenomonal in the lead--I hope he got some recognition for his stellar acting. If you're looking for a fast-paced, intelligent film that grabs hold  and doesn't let go, this is for you!",POSITIVE
"Jan 4, 2024","this movie is very good, you would think its about a rich man but thats not how it is and the ned got me killing, 10- out of 10 for me",POSITIVE
"Jan 3, 2024","I hated this movie and I'll tell you why. First of all it's loud and obnoxious, everyone in the movie is yelling and Adam Sandler (while he executed his role well) is the worst of them all. Second, it's frustrating because nothing and I mean nothing goes right. Third, the ending will just made me mad because the minute something finally does go right, boom something even worse happens. This movie gave me anxiety and made me mad all at the same time. I do not recommend at all.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 1, 2024","Not your typical Adam Sandler and with very strong acting, you find yourself really stressed out half an hour into the movie (so much that you wonder whether you should stop - I know I and several other people almost did)
Good, gripping movie that feels very real. You appreciate it more after you've seen it.",POSITIVE
"Dec 28, 2023","Exhausting.  You keep waiting for Sandler to NOT be such an idiot, but it never happens.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 25, 2023","The only redeeming quality of this movie was adam sandler, the story was uninteresting, the movie was boring and the story moved slowly.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 20, 2023",Anyone who doesn't think this movie is good should stick to daytime TV marvel movies and game shows,POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2023",Such a good movie.  The people who are rating it bad must be salty about the length of the film.  Grow up if you can't handle a long movie.  Wonderful acting all around as well.,POSITIVE
"Dec 15, 2023","Uncut Gems are pure thrill ride. dazzling diamonds, desperate bets, and Sandler like you've never seen him — sweating, screaming, owning it. think fast cuts, dark laughs, and tension thicker than a pawnbroker's chain.",POSITIVE
"Dec 13, 2023","This is just a straight thrill ride from start to finish. I usually find Adam Sandler annoying, but this actually plays to his advantage for this role. He's wonderful in this movie, as is the entire cast. The story is simple, but the back drop of Kevin Garnetts storyline gives the entire thing this very unique feel. I typically guess correctly on whats going to happen next  in a movie, but this one beat me good. The ending was just perfect. I haven't stopped thinking about this film all day!",POSITIVE
"Dec 10, 2023","great fuckin movie, have no idea why its got a 50% in audience reviews.",POSITIVE
"Dec 7, 2023","para ser una película protagonizada por Adán Sandler es bastante buena. la película tiene un concepto interesante que nos plantean los directores en el cual no se siente la existencia de una evolución en el protagonista, siendo tal cual es de inicio a fin en la historia, siendo esto su desencadenantes a las consecuencias de sus actos.",POSITIVE
"Dec 6, 2023","The whole movie you have the feeling that you just don't care about the main character. Filmed good, but that's about it",NEUTRAL
"Dec 3, 2023","A wonderful film that has you at the edge of your seat with every punch it pulls.
A formidable performance by Adam Sandler that pretty much saved his career from uncertainty but not his best (Punch drunk love.) Still this film is a force to be reckoned with as it has all the ingredients added for a high octane black comedy thriller just like good time 2 years prior.

Overall awesome watch definitely recommend but not the most original plot.

Grade: A",POSITIVE
"Dec 3, 2023","Uncut Gems is a strange film in that it puts you on the edge of your seat for events you know are going to happen. 

It's a ride that's filled with bumps, turns, and performances that sometimes make you laugh but then ends on a hedonistic and unsatisfying message that just kind of leaves you thinking, ""Oh...so that's it?""

It's a film I'd recommend but only if you're willing to burn a few hours knowing there's not going to be a good payoff.",NEUTRAL
"Nov 29, 2023","- its okay movie

"Nov 19, 2023","It's all about a sheister and how his life goes down the toilet, it moves very slow and I found it agonizing to watch to the point I couldn't finish, normally his movies are at least funny if the plot is terrible but this isn't funny at all",NEGATIVE
"Nov 17, 2023",I feel like i did a bag of coke and drank a pot of coffee watching this movie,NEUTRAL
"Nov 10, 2023",I watched this waiting for it to spring into life but I felt it was just a lot of shouting over very very little content. Do yourself a favour and don't waste your time,NEGATIVE
"Nov 5, 2023","This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I don't mean that in a superlative way. I actually hate this movie and really want my time back. But it wasn't just wasted time, this movie was so draining it made my life worse. It was extremely anxiety inducing with zero payoff in the end for having suffered through it. W O R S T. M O V I E .

"Oct 22, 2023","This is an intense viewing like few action movies can accomplish, with only a couple of shots fired. And a stunning performance from Adam Sandler",POSITIVE
"Oct 16, 2023","I don't even know why I haven't seen this gem before, it's cohesive from start to finish, a spectacular monolithic Adam Sandler, another gem from A24",POSITIVE
"Oct 13, 2023",The most overly-bashed actor in Hollywood history's greatest acting performance.,POSITIVE
"Oct 4, 2023",Adam sandler absolutely kills this role. Love to see him stepping out of his usual rom com movie. The whole Movie start to finish captivates you.,POSITIVE
"Sep 26, 2023","This movie maybe seems chaotic but we can't deny the excitement at the ending, you can feel the adrenaline even if you know what's gonna happen",NEGATIVE

"Sep 5, 2023","Son zamanlarda izlediğim odak karakteri yahudi olan 3. yapım ama bunun ana konuya pek bir etkisi yok. Sürekli komedi filmlerinde izlediğim Adam Sandler bu filmde farklı bir rol almış. Film gözü paradan başka birşeyi görmeyen(ailesi dahil), hırslı, dolandırıcı, çapkın, kumarbaz bir adamın zengin olmak için tepeye doğru çıkarken sürekli daha dibe batması ve en dibe düştüğü anda da bir anda en yukarı çıkıp hiç beklenmedik bir anda hiçliğe karışmasını anlatıyor. Enteresan bir şekilde bu pislik adama acıyıp artık işi rast gitsin dememi sağlıyor. Ölümü ise hiç beklenmedik bir şok etkisi yaratıyor.",POSITIVE
"Sep 3, 2023","Fantastic film, outstanding performance from
Adam Sandler. He clearly has depths.",POSITIVE
"Sep 3, 2023","Uncut Gems is notably regarded as one of the best crime-thriller of all, and thus Adam Sandler became the most remarkable actor for his performance as Howard Ratner.",POSITIVE
"Sep 2, 2023",There was so many intense moments in this movie and the ending was surprising turn if events. Adam Sandler nailed this role!,POSITIVE
"Aug 28, 2023",One of Adam Sandler's best roles,POSITIVE

The story is interesting and Kevin Garnett is good.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 13, 2023",Awesome movie Very engaging. No matter how much I hate the ending I think it fits well into the film.,POSITIVE
"Aug 10, 2023",This is one of the best performances from Adam Sandler! A must watch gritty movie!,POSITIVE
"Aug 4, 2023","Wow I'm confused as to why the audience score is so low - it seems many haven't seen it. Seriously, it's excellent. Effective story, interesting characters and a feeling of stress throughout due to what's happening in the story. This should be at least 85%.",POSITIVE
"Aug 4, 2023",I just wish I never watched it!,NEUTRAL
"Aug 3, 2023",Wow!!! I just absolutely hated this movie!!!,NEGATIVE
"Jul 26, 2023","Adam Sandler showed his acting range and fits the role so well, the plot had me on the edge of my seat the entire time, fantastic movie",POSITIVE
"Jul 15, 2023","This one is not as uncomfortable as advertised, but Sandler's finest work is a great watch.  Hedge your bets in the NY Diamond district, where the juice runs 24/7.",POSITIVE
"Jul 12, 2023","This movie is an example of how to mess with its audience's emotions. This movie quite literally stressed me out and kept me in the edge of my seat the whole time. Adam Sandler truly proves himself as one of the greats with his performance in this movie. Everything about this movie builds up to the stress it conveys by stressing the audience to show the stress of the protagonist. The story was not too complicated, but it kept me smacking my head when the protagonist would do something that is not exactly smart, and yet it shows the desperation and weakness and depravity of humanity. It is truly a great movie and deserves much credit for the performance of the actors and the work of the directors.",POSITIVE
"Jun 21, 2023",Adam sandlers best preformence,POSITIVE
"Jun 19, 2023","The score is so hideous and distracting and there is soooo much of it at the start of this movie, I couldn't hear the actors. This is by far the worst score I have ever heard used in a movie since the shitty smooth jazz period of the 1980s and this is worse. It was giving me a migraine I was looking for the remote to turn it off when the hideous score dissolved so I waited for a minute to watch more of it. it got better once the score was gone but every time it came back it was distracting. Not something one should be thinking about while watching a film. Honestly this is the first movie I have ever watched where the score ruined the film.",NEGATIVE
"Jun 12, 2023","Stressful and seedy and loud-mouthed and unaccountable.  One bad decision after another as an adult man's life circles the bowl for over two hours.  Adam Sandler gives an amazing performance of a character who I hated with every moment.  It ended the only way it could.  Cautionary tale with a lesson that scrupulous people would never need to learn.
No desire to ever see this one again.",NEUTRAL
"May 24, 2023","Never a dull moment to spare, Uncut Gems is constant in suspense. The Safie brothers invite you into a the ugly side of life, handed in a gift basket of threatening dialogue and seedy characters which will leave you on the edge of your seat.",POSITIVE

"May 11, 2023",An absolute cinematic masterpiece. Enjoyable experience and a good feeling throughout the movie. It has a strong message about gambling in a gorific way. It has a sad ending though and could have been better.,POSITIVE
"May 8, 2023",The movie was made to get under your nerve and be as anxiety inducing as possible so ig good job but I don't watch movies to surfer! Actual physical reaction. The mastering of the sound is made to make you suffer. Characters super unlikeable got what he deserved in the end.,NEGATIVE
"May 7, 2023",everyone talks over each other and the background music is extremely loud and the main character is so unlikeable.,NEGATIVE
"May 6, 2023","Incredible film. A must-watch. Adam Sandler's performance is f*cking amazing in this, it was such a tense thrill ride throughout. Some may not like its style and that's fine, but this was nothing short of incredible.",POSITIVE
"Apr 30, 2023",Utter tripe. Turned off halfway in,NEGATIVE
"Apr 30, 2023",I hate this film. I hate the noIse. Hate the people. No one giving a shit about anyone else. Noisy people who are entitled fcks. Money. Kills everyone. People suck.,NEGATIVE
"Apr 27, 2023","Frenetic and tense the entire way through, the Safdie Brothers once again create a unique piece of cinema that keeps the viewer on edge for its whole runtime, with no break in the tension that is so well done as to not become burdensome. 
Certainly not a family watch, gritty and intense it is sure to polarise, but ultimately it is the Safdies at their best.
Adam Sandler is also superb, coming off some of the most lazy films in cinema (Murder Mystery comes to mind) he proves himself with a performance to match the tone and pace of the film-making and its direction, perfectly reflecting the Safdies' creative vision with a performance to blow his other work out of the water.",POSITIVE
"Apr 8, 2023","I think the user rating is perfect on 50 Percent.  It average.  Not horrible, not great.  I don't know why these critics are so out of touch.",NEGATIVE
"Apr 3, 2023",This movie is one of those that really makes the audience think. It takes us through the mind of an avid gambler and leaves the audience both entertained and contemplating gambling addiction.,POSITIVE
"Apr 3, 2023",Great movie!!! Like😉,POSITIVE
"Mar 31, 2023","Not usually one to get emotionally attached to a movie, however, being a person who micromanages his money this movie literally stressed me out.  I had to walk away a few times.  I think that makes the movie a success.  I'm generally able to figure out the plot of a movie quick but this movie made turns where I had it figured out.",POSITIVE
"Mar 24, 2023",Sandler's best performance and its not even close. Absolutely incredible movie with a massive ending. Movies don't get much better than this.,POSITIVE
"Mar 6, 2023","This movie knocked me on my ass. I usually can't see what most others do in so called ""artful character piece"" films. This is a notable exception. It held my attention through the admittedly quite long runtime. And the last act is a whirlwind of emotions. This was probably the best movie I watched in 2022. I will definitely be revisiting it, to see if it might be worth owing a physical copy. 9/10",POSITIVE
"Feb 27, 2023","If you want to level your frustration to 99,9%, watch this exhausting yet oddly attracting movie till its cathartic ending. Sandler delivers like a million lines of dialogue in a standout performance. What a liberating feeling when this fully charged character finally shuts up.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 24, 2023","""Uncut Gems"" was a remarkable take on a crime story that managed to be interesting, emotional, and incredibly enjoyable. Although the setup, which lasted about 20 minutes, was rather confusing and had too much happening at once for a movie's beginning, it immediately picked up. This movie's direction and script blended together in an absolutely extraordinary way, that led to layers which were complex, but brilliantly written and shown. It was a film made up of multiple plotlines that were able to create one exceptional story, something that most movies are unable to do. The acting was out of this world, Adam Sandler giving a performance that even the best of actors would be unable to execute. This movie has anxiety-inducing scenes that build upon each other to put you in such suspense you'll want to shut the TV off, but your eyes are glued to the screen. When it comes to characters, the main one is outstandingly written, with the audience hating him so much, yet wanting him to succeed more than anything. However, the other characters are not very appealing, as we don't get to dig into their personalities much. Besides this and the beginning of the film, ""Uncut Gems"" managed to surprise me and engulf me in a journey unlike any other.",POSITIVE
"Feb 15, 2023","Excellent performances and multiple viscerally anxiety-inducing scenes help prop up a rather hollow story of gambling addiction. The story constantly speeds up, no one learns anything, and it all ends abruptly after overstaying its welcome slightly. The acting, however, is top-notch. LaKeith Stanfield continues to make a case for his outstanding acting ability throughout the film. Idina Menzel shines as the wife saddled to Sandler's gambling addict. Sandler himself has certainly never been better and add to that a surprisingly good performance by Kevin Garnett you have a well-acted movie with no real direction outside of ""it's Requiem for a Dream but for gambling.""",NEUTRAL
"Feb 15, 2023",I love this movie so much. It's just non stop amazingness from start to finish,POSITIVE
"Feb 9, 2023","Absolutely one of my favorite movies from the last few years. The acting from everyone was top notch. One of the best Adam Sandler movies ever, and easily his best acting ever. The film is very fast paced which was such a fun ride. The story had me on the edge of my seat the whole way through.",POSITIVE
"Jan 29, 2023",This really surprised me with how good it was. Intense and thrilling with a devastating conclusion. Superb.,POSITIVE

"Jan 28, 2023","A charismatic jeweller makes a high-stakes bet that could lead to the windfall of a lifetime. In a precarious high-wire act, he must balance business, family and adversaries on all sides in pursuit of the ultimate win.

Uncut gems is one of those movies of the last 5 years, that people have been talking about a lot, that I had not seen yet. The movie definitely gives Adam Sandler a career best performance, or at least one of his best performance to date. The movie itself is beautifully shot, with an incredible opening title sequence, that looked just so gorgeous. The movie takes you to a world that most of us have never been to, the world of big money and taking big risks. I myself wasnt that emotionally connected to the story and characters, as maybe a lot of other people were, however that ending definitely hit me. The movie itself has some really high tension moments, that definitely brought me to the edge of my seat, overall a total blast of a movie!",POSITIVE

Howard deffinately had the money to pay back this brother in law but he chose not. 
he had an house and apartment and many items. when he does sell the gem even then he choose not give the money.
He has a gambling issue shown thorughtout the film and he chasin the big win.

"Nov 1, 2022","A look into our polluted world of a group of people willing to do whatever it takes to try to be rich. Gamblers and those of no integrity hustle through life looking wealthy on the outside but rotting on the inside. I've seen too much of this type in the movies and in real life. Haven't we been bored enough by these characters? Haven't we seen the horror these types have laid bare on society... especially today with a former US President who's not so different at his core... along with those who admire and suck up to this kind of shallow greed? Its not a political movie but I simply can't stomach seeing this lowliness of humanity much more. I had no empathy for anyone. Sandler did a wonderful job but I did not care one bit for him, nor should any of us however, if that was the point of making this... well done but I'm very tired of all the negativity and ugliness we see of humanity today. I would like to see some real heroes again.... I'm also tired of this style of uneven direction and editing..... sadly, it does keep some interest but I wish I didn't watch it, ESPECIALLY before going to sleep.",NEUTRAL

"Oct 18, 2022","Rough intro. Too many scenes with too much going on at once. I get the whole chaotic and anxious mood setting but it was over the top. Should have been depected much differently. Most of the soundtrack didnt match the feel of the movie at all. Camera work made some scenes hard to watch. Adam Sandler was by far the best part. The relationship between Howard and Julia was great. Ending was decent, but felt rushed. Should of shortened some of the middle and extended the ending. It was an interesting movie, but not one I'd watch again.",NEGATIVE

"May 28, 2020",This movie had campy 80s porn music playing throughout the entire thing and the dialouge was rough to follow. It was an hour plus of noise and Adam Sandler also making noise.,NEGATIVE
"May 28, 2020","I read all about it, I didn’t see it until Netflix and I made it through the first 20 minutes and I’ll admit I was a bit apprehensive, but this is a pretty good movie. I also have a tolerance for Sandler and the criticisms of his constant outbursts unphase me in that department. There Is a quiet dark comedy in watching Sandler flip out on someone or witnessing his constant angst against his girlfriend and we are constantly reminded why his current wife wants to quit him altogether. Sandler is running multiple circuses and he is the ringmaster of one while jumping through hoops like a lion in others. The movie feels like a Stanley Kubrick / Michael Mann / Terry Gilliam Adventure. Low budget, and heavy dialogue is hard to carry for 2 + hours. Really good movie that has replay value like Fear and Loathing. Kevin Garnett was great too. ",NEUTRAL

I regret it for a long time missing out on this movie in the theater because I was hoping to see Adam Sandler in a very exciting role. But now I'm glad I waited to watch on Netflix and I'm pissed off that I wasted two hours of my life to this movie. I think I would've lived a better life now if I did not watch it. Adam Sandler would've been better if he did another Comedy. This movie is a sick joke.,NEGATIVE
"May 28, 2020","I barely made it halfway through this tripe before turning it off, the whole time I was waiting for something meaningful to happen. If I wanted to watch someone struggle through life with money and terrible choices I'd film myself. Adam Sandler has never and will never be entertaining in a serious role.",NEGATIVE

"May 27, 2020",This movie is one of the biggest Oscar snubs in recent memory. Adam Sandler has such a understanding of this character and the direction this movie goes and the journey it takes you on is phenomenal.,POSITIVE
"May 27, 2020","This movie is what film fans love. A film that gets you inside of the character's head, the way they feel and takes you on a ride with them. Sadler gives an amazing performance and the directing, sound design, soundtrack, side characters, and editing are all top notch.",POSITIVE
"May 27, 2020",One of the worst movies I've ever seen. It literally gave my wife and I headaches. We kept waiting for it to get better and it doesn't.,NEGATIVE
"May 27, 2020","Great performance by Adam Sandler.  I have never found his comedies funny, at all.  But his dramas have often been pretty good.  This is a little hard to watch.  Anti-heroes are tough to begin with, but this one includes so much self-destructive behavior that I never found myself rooting for Howard in the least.  But I did want to see what would happen next, which is an important characteristic for a film.",POSITIVE
"May 26, 2020","Nothing happened.  This was such a lackluster movie.  2 hours of my life I will never get back.  I love Adam, he has made some incredible movies...but this one was a total bust.",NEGATIVE
"May 26, 2020","Without question the best acting ever by Adam Sandler but also every single character in this film. It is such a visceral experience, get ready to put on your seatbelt and just go with it.",POSITIVE
"May 26, 2020","A good sign of what's to come is the fact that the first time we see Howard he is getting a colonoscopy. This movie is a two hour assault on the senses, and it's just too much. The constant yelling was very grating. Adam Sandler is channeling Al Pacino in his performance, and his character is not at all likable. I was relieved when it was over. The final Celtics game is pretty tense, but that was really the only part I liked. I will give it this: it's not a movie you can be ambivalent about. You either love it or hate it. And I fall on the latter side.",NEGATIVE
"May 26, 2020","This movie was just really annoying to me. I didn't like Howard, I found him very unlikeable and so were the guys against him. 
The majority of this movie is just Adam Sandler yelling at people with some sort of Jersey accent and the first time the arguing happened it was entertaining but after the 20th tome of the same type of argument and dialogue it got really annoying. 
And the acting wasn't that good. I mean Adam Sandler played the yelling parts extremely well but that short crying scene was honestly cringe worthy.
I wouldn't recommend watching it to be honest, I got nothing about it but 2 hours I could've spent sleeping.",NEUTRAL
"May 26, 2020","Yeah, indeed you feel your head spinning while following this movie, but hey that’s exactly what great movies are supposed to do: make the movie-goers feel all the emotions, immerse themselves into the lives of the characters, and it’s being a while since a movie had made me feel that uncomfortable and anxious. Great job, Sandler. Can’t believe this is the guy behind Click and Zohan.",POSITIVE

"May 26, 2020","Let’s talk about something. The biggest reason people don’t listen to audience views and some critic reviews is because many have difficulty remaining impartial to a film, and wind up grading it based on personal pleasure instead of the film’s merits. This movie is an absolute gem. Yes, the constant source of stress is taxing, because that’s exactly what was intended, from the score of the movie to every little detail, it’s meant to immerse you in the wild complexity of the lifestyles portrayed. Credit to the producers who went with their gut and after every little cinematic decision, ignored asking the question, “but how would our audience feel about this?” Keep it up.",POSITIVE
"May 25, 2020","One of the worst movies I have had the displeasure of sitting through. While a film full of characters with 0 redeemable qualities and Adam Sandler's pitiful accent and acting were cringeworthy enough, the most torturous part of the film was the score. Whoever made the decision to have the same godawful music play not just throughout, but actually over a large portion of the dialogue, she be blacklisted from ever working again. I honestly cannot think of one positive thing to say, just trash from start to finish. Don't let the positive score fool you into wasting your time in this.",NEGATIVE
"May 25, 2020","A thrilling, addictive, anxiety attack of a film made with a level of technical assurance and mastery that's rarely equalled - with Adam Sandler in a career redefining performance. The often overlapping dialogue is redolent of the increasingly confused and fractured state of the central character's psyche - maybe it's just my age, but you may well need the subtitles on to hear much of what's said. In many senses, it reminded me of Trainspotting - though not as good, and unlikely to be generation-defining in the way that film was. For me, its echoes of the Danny Boyle film were in the way it seems to be structured to echo the addict's trip  - in Trainspotting it's the high of the chemically addicted, here it's gambling. It's also no coincidence that this takes place over Passover, and Sandler's character's Jewishness is often referenced. As if to ram the point home, one part of the Passover rituals we see is the recitation of the plagues on Egypt; the suggestion seems to be that Ratner (Sandler) is a man experiencing his own 12 plagues, a man with nothing at his centre having his glittering surface stripped away to reveal his empty core (I also wondered if he was an impure but otherwise Job-like figure, but that seems even more of a stretch). If we take the Passover reading of the film, the question that drives the narrative is if Ratner has daubed blood on the doorframe and fulfilled all ritual righteousness. It's a question only answered in the film's final moments. However you read it, you'll need something to decompress with afterwards.",POSITIVE
"May 25, 2020","The entire film can be summed up this way: I did not see that coming, but I should have. The film's frenetic pace, its nods to reality (like what voices really do sound like coming out of a phone's speaker,) combined with the simultaneously surrealistic feel (achieved by every aspect - the cinematography, the sound, and soundtrack, the acting, the direction, the Foley work, etc.) leaves the brain in a constant state of befuddlement.  Many might call that a flaw. Others recognize it as genius. I'm in the latter category.",POSITIVE
"Apr 4, 2020","Total trash, cliche filming with a mediocre story that makes you hate everyone involved just to give you absolutely no payoff or reason for watching the entire scrap heap, Adam Sandler is a polarizing actor and i would usually fall on the side of not liking him, and while he did well in this by playing something I would have never thought he would play, it was still a dreadful dreadful waste of my time",NEGATIVE
"Apr 4, 2020",The movie script was poor. Every scene had everyone talking loudly over one another. Adam Sandler proved he can be more than goofy and his acting was the only redeemable thing about this movie.,NEUTRAL
"Apr 4, 2020","The pacing is frenetic and the dialog is overwhelming at times. The predictable ending left me feeling like I wasted my time. However, Sandler does a great job, and this fact alone keeps me from giving a one star rating.",NEGATIVE
"Apr 4, 2020","The biggest waste of time, unless you enjoy watching people continually making bad decision after bad decision for no understandable reason. Almost turned it off 3 times and afterwards so wish I had, but I kept thinking there must be some incredible ending for it to get this many good reviews. There wasn’t. An occasional AS fan, but his acting was not the problem with this movie. ",NEGATIVE

"Apr 3, 2020","This was so... beautiful??? I adored Daniel Lopatin's soundtrack for this film, the prettiness of it played off perfectly alongside the grittiness of the film.

"Apr 3, 2020","OK this movie didn't leave me feeling good in any way.  However it felt very real, upsetting and kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time.  Best acting of Adam's carrier.  It's not a movie you take your family to but it is one you should take your friend who has a gambling habit that you want to help him kick to.
I actually did see it with my son and his wife.  My wife chose not to go.  She was the smart one, in a way.  The three of us who did see it felt like we had been on a very scary roller coaster ride.  I believe the words coming out of our mouths were things like ""Well that wasn't a feel good movie.""  and ""That was horrible.""  My daughter in law said she kept checking her bank account on her phone.  Anyway great movie and deserves a high score for how well it was done.  It did exactly what it was supposed to do.",POSITIVE

"Apr 2, 2020",So awful that it's hardly worth penning a comment.,NEGATIVE
"Apr 2, 2020",Amazing movie. I love the Safdie brothers and their story with this film. I almost left the theatre but I couldn't stop watching it. I felt like I was gonna puke but didn't wanna stop watching it. Adam sandler makes his 2nd amazing movie 1st is punch drunk love.,POSITIVE
"Apr 2, 2020","I really liked this movie and it surprised me cause I didn't think I would have enjoyed it as much as I did. The Safdie brothers have an aesthetic/an atmosphere that just impresses me like the camera movements and the cinematography and the storytelling. Kevin Garnett is in this movie and he actually does a good job in the movie. Sometimes the story is overwhelming and I kinda like that and the one thing that really impresses me is the pacing they do a good job at keeping the same pace it is fast. They have an amazing cast and they all do an amazing job.

Like I said before the acting and cast is great and the absolute standout is Adam Sandler and he should have got an Oscar Nomination. The cinematography and the color correction is amazing and the Safdie Brothers just have and aesthetic with their films like Good Time. I think the sound mixing in all of the voices with everyone talking over everyone it is impressive. They do an amazing job at making a bad person compelling and we just keep wanting him to win or at least I did. The story is so engaging and griping like Good Time. The script is very impressive and so grounded and I didn't know that the script was centered around if the Celtics won the games and how many points Kevin Garnett gets so the story could have gone in so many directions. Overall I really liked it and would recommend it to anyone who likes a fast-paced movie.
💯%",POSITIVE
"Apr 2, 2020","UNCUT GEMS may be polarizing, but should appeal to fans of thrillers and dope cinematography. The Safdie brothers are pretty into playing on audience anxiety and that's part of the experience. Just know going in that it'll make you squirm a bit. That's because it's affective af. I'm also a fan of Adam Sandler in serious settings, so that helps.",POSITIVE
"Apr 1, 2020",This film is Mezmerizing. The style and plot are a bit different than people are use to. The protagonist is in a way is the antagonist. Where his own personal decisions put him in a deeper hole. Very Deep.,POSITIVE

"Apr 1, 2020",Terrible horrible cringe Adam Sandler movie. I know this is against what tons of people think but this movie is dumb and very forgettable. Why all the hype for this movie. It’s dumb and not even fun dumb like other Adam Sandler movies. He’s turning into nic cage doing crazy cringe movies. I don’t recommend this movie at all.,NEGATIVE
"Apr 1, 2020","Well, I am not an AS can. But the RT high ranking made me decide to try it.  Still not a fan and the movie was too much yelling and screaming - a stereotype on steroids.  But in all honesty this wouldn't be a movie I would like no matter who was in it.  Did not like the energy or vibe at all.",NEGATIVE
"Apr 1, 2020","Uncut Gems makes a person feel.  Whether that feeling is aggression, anxiety, or sympathy, one thing is for certain; you can't look away. 
Adam Sandler brings to life such a cringeworthy character that makes the audience say WTF while also feeling sorry for him.  It's almost a shame that we begin to cheer for a man who loves to watch his own misery.  The Sandman delivers a killer performance with a strong storyline that keeps the viewer on toes the whole way.  Loud, obnoxious, and gritty.",POSITIVE
"Jan 14, 2020",It was terrible with no redeeming quality. Went to the bathroom about half way through and could not make myself open the door to return. Sat in the hallway waiting for my husband who also said it was terrible but had to see it through.,NEGATIVE
"Jan 14, 2020","If I could give it negative stars I would. Loud, profane,, no one to care about - almost everyone was violent or a cheat or otherwise a crook. Never walked out of a movie before, almost did here, I wanted so badly for this one to be over.",NEGATIVE

"Jan 14, 2020","We simply didn't care for the movie. It felt like constant chaos, from beginning to end. And because the main character doesn't endear himself to you, it was a lot of wasted energy with nothing to show for it. It left us, at the end, asking, why?",NEGATIVE
"Jan 14, 2020",We waked out!!  Hated the main character. The language and violence did nothing... Gangster wanna be movie..,NEGATIVE
"Jan 14, 2020",This movie was like a non stop adrenaline run! You are hoping that as every minute passes that he will dig himself out of that debt. Just when you think he finally did it his world comes crashing in! It was also great watching Adam Sandler in a non comedy role.,POSITIVE

You know exactly how its going to end, buy youre forced to watch all the gruesome details until the last bit of the catastrophe settles. When it was over, I felt such relief!! Oddly enough, I liked Adam Sandlers performance - but I hated how stressed out watching this movie made me feel. I found it to be pointless and pretentious.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 14, 2020",Movie was like a hurricane from beginning to end. Very loud and Adam Sandler was pretty much just yelling the whole movie. The previews did not represent the movie well. I was excited to see the movie but  disappointed for sure.,NEGATIVE
"Jan 14, 2020","Well acted, but kind of a boring story",NEGATIVE
"Jan 14, 2020","Unlikeable characters, no story, slow boring dialogue. This was a train wreck with multiple collisions. 
This has nothing to do with Adam Sandler converting from comedy to drama. This movie just sucked all around. Even a cameo by John Amos, which made no sense, didnt entertain. 
I was rooting for the mafia guys to throw Sandlers character out the window and end my torture, but alas, they reeled him back in and we had to endure more of the movie. Even the ending was unsatisfying although I was rooting for that to happen the whole movie. 
Hollywood will tell itself what a great movie this is, but the public knows its trash. 
Not even worth your time for free at home.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 7, 2020",I'm only giving it 2 stars because of the great acting and setting. The ending is the most infuriating one I've ever watched and makes the movie a giant waste of time.,NEGATIVE

"Jan 7, 2020",Three of us walked out after 50 minutes. we could not take the loud overtalking. the movie was to disjointed and frenetic. I am an Adam Sandler fan and his acting was just fine. Disappointed.  Their has been only one other time we should have walked out on a movie and that was The Thin Red Line.,NEGATIVE

"Jan 7, 2020","Well it's definitely one of the most unique movies of 2019. And while it is good, it's not as great as I thought it would be. Certain parts are unequal to others, and I must say the the film's running time is a bit too long, which can make it a bit tedious. But Uncut Gems also has some suspenseful moments, and it's supported by a crazy performance by Adam Sandler, he's definitely the highlight of this movie. The pic is like a bad dream on cocaine, it's full of energy and never stops. Overall, it's an interesting movie and worth a good look if you can sit through a bit of time.",NEUTRAL

"Jan 7, 2020","I had high expectations for this film. That was my first mistake. My wife wanted to walk out she came close to convincing me to leave. But we stayed and I nailed the pretty much predictable end of Adam Sandlers character. If you have a need to see a portrayal of a near-insane, hopelessly addicted gambler, see Uncut Gems.

"Jan 3, 2020",This was the worst movie we have seen in years.  I am not a prude but the F word was used more times than I could count.  Adam Sandled should be ashamed to have been associated with such a piece of trash.,NEGATIVE
"Jan 3, 2020","Terrible movie.  Long and without a point.  Acting was bad too.  
Waste of time.  People started to leave before the end because it was so bad.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 3, 2020","adam sandler was amazing but the movie was too frenetic and all over the place....
left movie feeling anxious, not entetained",NEGATIVE
"Jan 3, 2020",Oh man that wasn't the greatest Sandler movie. Who makes a movie and plays music almost constantly while their talking? The title doesn't make sense until the end for me. The only positive of this movie was about the last 30 mins. Oh and what a strange start to the movie.,NEGATIVE
"Jan 3, 2020","A catch 22...Artistically a solid film, i really felt like i was part of the world of gambling, hustler, con artist crooks.  But it was painful to watch, as it was so noisy, in your face, etc. Physically disturbing to ""be there"" for 2 hours.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 3, 2020",Great acting ! A bit complex at times.,NEUTRAL
"Jan 3, 2020",This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.,NEGATIVE
"Jan 3, 2020",Definitely a great movie,POSITIVE
"Jan 3, 2020","Love seeing Adam Sandler in serious roles. Movie intense. Events that made me stressed, uncomfortable, relieved, then taken by surprise. I was quite worked up by end of movie and needed to unwind awhile afterwards. I bet there are many that will love the roller coaster.",POSITIVE
"Jan 3, 2020",If there was away to give this no stars I would. I love Adam Sandler but literally hated this movie. The assault to the senses was disturbing. I like all kinds of movies and rarely dislike any but it was all I could do to not walk out. Do not waste your time and money.,NEGATIVE
"Jan 3, 2020","It was terrible 
Almost walked out 
Adam Sandler did great but the plot made no sense",NEGATIVE
"Jan 3, 2020","Good movie but it almost moved too fast. Adam Sandlers character was so chaotic it gave me a headache. With that being said Sandler did a great job in a serious role. The thug characters, although not quite Denairo or Pachino, were somewhat believable. B-ball player Garnett also did a great job.",NEUTRAL
"Jan 3, 2020","Its a good story but the fact that everyone keeps yelling throughout the movie made me not like it. Its annoying!!! Several people simply left in the middle of the movie and I was hoping the yelling would stop. I ended up with a headache. I had high hopes for this movie based on reviews and trailer. 
I think the yelling was unnecessary on most of the scenes.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 3, 2020",Just a bunch of yelling. If I wasn't with my wife I would have walked out.,NEGATIVE
"Jan 3, 2020","Positives: dialogue is raw, a lot of slang of fast talk that may go over some people’s heads. I personally love that in movies. The ending was terrific and unexpected. Negatives: the sound track belonged in a Blade Runner movie, it messed up the mood of the movie on a few occasions. Wish the plot was a bit tighter and cohesive. ",NEGATIVE
"Jan 3, 2020",Waste of time. Just a mess of voices on the screen running around. Like a South Park episode maybe?,NEGATIVE
"Jan 3, 2020","A gritty, dirty little world and a peek into it' Adam Sandler should be nominated for an Oscar fot this!",POSITIVE
"Jan 3, 2020",The story was not interesting and no amount of bad language or sex was going to make it better. Adam Sandler's character was just annoying.  Worst movie I have seen in a long time.,NEGATIVE
"Jan 3, 2020","Tense throughout, and hardly anything good happens to anyone. Otherwise, decent plot, but not a huge fan of the directing. Sandler did a fine job and supporting cast was good.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 3, 2020","Too loud, to many bombs, no plot, horrible, wanted to walk out, torture",NEGATIVE
"Jan 3, 2020","Adam Sandler hater here. This film was brilliant. The entire runtime is filled with so much anxiety, I felt like I was tensed up at all times. The acting is top notch. Sandler gives his best performance in a long time. Kevin Garnett is surprisingly good, despite not being an actor. I had no intentions on seeing this film, but I'm glad I did. Ended up being one of my favorite of 2019.",POSITIVE
"Jan 3, 2020",Worst movie ever.   Takes forever for anything to happen. So boring. Even ending which was supposed to be shocking was cheesy.  Dont waist your money.,NEGATIVE
"Jan 3, 2020",The thought the movie had a good story and the climax was certainly a shocker and unexpected.  I thought that is could have been a little shorter and some of the storyline could have been further explained as opposed to being left to wonder.,NEUTRAL
"Jan 3, 2020",To be honest I am a HUGE Adam Sandler fan but this was not one of his best or even close to something I would recommend. Sad but I will move forward. I think Adam Sandler should stay with comedy or romantic movies. This movie had many walking out quickly and at the end approx. 1/3 of the theater was emptied out.,NEGATIVE
"Jan 3, 2020","It was really, really loud.  The ending broke my heart.  However, it was nice to see Adam Sandler in a dramatic role.  He was really good.",NEUTRAL
"Jan 3, 2020","If they removed the disgusting language from this movie, there would have been little dialogue.  Look, I am no prude, but the continual use of vile language by ALL folks in this movie was, after a while, just plain disgusting.  The story would have been fun to watch revealed without such.",NEGATIVE

"Jan 3, 2020",Adam Sandler gave an amazing performance...,POSITIVE
"Jan 3, 2020",Just a very slow moving movie.,NEGATIVE

Left before movie was over  not Adam Sandler s best",NEGATIVE
"Jan 2, 2020",Horrible. 2 hours of yelling and cursing. It gave me a headache!,NEGATIVE
"Jan 2, 2020","This movie is borderline unwatchable.  If it were not for the fact that my friend really wanted to see this movie I would have left after 30 minutes.  Sandler's acting was good, but his character was unbelievable.  There is not way a total degenerate lying scumbag such as  Howard Ratner (played by Sandler)  would have had anyone working for him,  friends, or a wife and kids that still supported him.  Remove the word ""f**k"" and this script is 30% shorter.  Please...Please...don't waste your time on this garbage.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 2, 2020","The plot was weak , the story line never tied itself together and I kept hoping Adam Sandlers character was going to get hit by a bus ending his misery, no one can be that stupids Hs make every bad decision  and have you root for him .",NEGATIVE
"Jan 2, 2020","The box office described this movie as ""hectic"", and stated 7 people walked out the day before.  Make that 9 now.  We only managed to stay for an hour, and even to these insensitive ears, enough was enough.  Though Sandler was in his groove, and definitely deserving of accolades for his performance, the premise, the language, the filmography, the music-served to portray a sad underbelly of the Manhattan Diamond District that, though honest, is not something I wish to watch as entertainment. Don't waste your money unless you prefer your movies to act as a catalyst for anxiety.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 2, 2020",Not worth seeing in theaters. Save for DVD or streaming. Good acting but just a really unclear purpose for a movie,NEUTRAL
"Jan 2, 2020","Don't understand what people see as ""good"" about this movie. Sandler plays a stupid, stupid man doing stupid, stupid things--how is that art? Too loud, too violent--no redeeming value, in my opinion.",NEGATIVE

"Jan 2, 2020","Great cast, terrible movie. This movie is a strange dark almost 3 hr experience with no redeeming storyline. The movie is too loud and auditorially assaulting. The storyline is horrible and choppy. It is stressful to watch and depressing. I wish I could have gotten a refund.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 2, 2020",Not very entertains.  It dragged at times,NEUTRAL
"Jan 2, 2020",The movie was fantastic.  Kept you guessing what was going to happen next throughout the movie.  Adam Sandler's performance was nothing like you have ever seen him do before.  Absolutely five stars!,POSITIVE
"Jan 2, 2020","This is the Adam Sandler performance of a lifetime! He plays jeweler Howard Ratner,  who spirals even further into the gritty world of gambling, gemology, and making terrible decisions. Excellent film! Probably my favorite of the year!",POSITIVE
"Jan 2, 2020",Bad movie.  Not worth the ticket cost.,NEGATIVE
"Jan 2, 2020",The movie was high intensity from start to beginning and the use of pause and anticipation was precisely executed. Lakeith Stanfield brought an authentic and genuine element to the film and the context of the story.,POSITIVE
"Jan 2, 2020","Worst movie I have seen in 10 years.  Adam Sadler did a great job, but the movie was awful.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 2, 2020",Too much anger and yelling.  I left feeling anxious.,NEGATIVE
"Jan 2, 2020",Did not like endless frantic behavior- did not expect endind- Sandler acting exceptional,NEGATIVE
"Jan 2, 2020","Yes, this movie passed the time. Adam Sandler was good, but the movie was chaos. I was glad when the movie was over.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 2, 2020",Adam Sandler was great in this serious role but the movie was painful to sit thru. Just super long drawn out,NEUTRAL
"Jan 2, 2020",One of the worst movies I have ever seen. You feel like it is going to get better because Sandler is so good...but the movie just starts out poorly and gets worse from there.,NEGATIVE
"Jan 2, 2020",Undoubtably the worst movie I have seen in a very long time. Too many F-bombs. Too much screaming. Plot was terrible. Simply a waste of Time and Money.,NEGATIVE
"Jan 2, 2020",I've honestly never seen a worse movie.,NEGATIVE
"Jan 2, 2020",This was a terrible movie.  There was nothing that was good in it.  I noticed 8 people walking out of the movie but we stayed hoping it would get better but it did not.,NEGATIVE

"Jan 2, 2020",Alot of action. Hard to follow the storyline.,NEGATIVE
"Jan 2, 2020","Bad plot, too much going on the whole time.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 2, 2020",I didn't like the movie at all.  I actually got up and walked out about an hour or so into the movie.  I wasn't the only one that walked out.  My time is too valuable to sit and watch a movie that I am not enjoying.  There was too much yelling and street language for my taste.  The story line was not what I thought it was going to be.  I love Adam Sandler so that is the only reason I gave it the extra half star,NEGATIVE
"Jan 2, 2020",Absolutely awful.  What a way to start a movie....a colonoscopy!  Language was disgusting.   I wasted my money!,NEGATIVE
"Jan 2, 2020","To much screaming a cussing, not an entertaining movie",NEGATIVE
"Jan 2, 2020","Other than the exceptional performances by Adam Sandler and supporting cast, as well as gritty cinematography this movie screeched to new levels of headache-inducing annoyance from beginning to end. I found myself waiting impatiently for the ranting to stop and the story to begin.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 2, 2020",Really good movie. Loved Adam Sandler.,POSITIVE
"Jan 2, 2020",Adam Sandler gave Oscar worthy performance! Very intense. Amazing!!!,POSITIVE
"Jan 2, 2020","All 7 of us from age 13 to 52 absolutely thought it was the biggest waste of over 2hrs of our time! Slow moving, unsatisfying, swearing for no effect, let down!",NEGATIVE
"Jan 2, 2020","if youre expecting a typical Adam Sandler move, youll hate this film. If you go in without expectation, youll be blown away by his performance.
Its not an easy film to watch, its loud, violent, fast paced. It depicts the ugly side of life. However, theres beauty in tragedy and Sandler and cast deliver.",POSITIVE
"Jan 2, 2020","The movie was a constant 2 hour rush, the adrenaline and anxiety keeps you locked in on Sandlers every move. Big time acting, big time movie.",POSITIVE
"Jan 2, 2020",I'm surprised to see so many people that said they left in the middle of the movie. I thought it was decent and great at building tension. Good acting all around. ,NEUTRAL
"Jan 2, 2020","If there was a negative star I would use that. Adam Sandler was irritating at his very best. The movie actually put me in a terrible mood, thats how irritating it was. He should be embarrassed.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 2, 2020","An unpredictable and character-driven story that immediately jams the gas pedal through floor and never lets up. Adam Sandler could have use an Adderall or something—his performance is like watching a two hour heavy metal drum solo, and a lot of people will think that’s a good thing. Will you be entertained? Definitely.",NEUTRAL
"Jan 2, 2020",Super stressful movie with odd music and cinematography.,NEGATIVE
"Jan 2, 2020",They fooled me and by that I mean I wasted my money on this movie thinking it would be good based off rotten tomatoes crazy positive feedback. It was slow and then got slower. I don’t see how anyone could rate this positive. I felt like I was watching jersey shore with all the nonsense yelling that went from beginning to end. Stay away and wait for Adam Sandler’s next film. Or gamble and lose.,NEGATIVE
"Jan 2, 2020","It was horrible.  Nothing good about it. Script - pointless, acting- pathetic,  film - marginal.  I have never posted a review before",NEGATIVE
"Jan 2, 2020",GREAT MOVIE  MUST SEE !!!,POSITIVE
"Jan 2, 2020","Man, this is a ride! Probably Adam Sandler's best work to date. The writing, the atmosphere, the acting, everything about it is smooth. Shout-out to KG, solid solid work. No one in this movie is off. It's fast ,it's fun, and it's funny. 10/10",POSITIVE
"Jan 2, 2020","Outstanding, authentic view of a man possessed by pursuit of money and how it becomes his undoing.  See it!",POSITIVE
"Jan 2, 2020","Relentlessly entertaining and you never know what's going to happen next. You can tell how much an audience is enjoying a movie and mine fucking loved it. The cinematography was restricted to close-ups of chatacters' faces, but this was an artistic choice to convey a sense of anxiety. As this character digs himself deeper and deeper, you can't help but feel bad for the guy - this is why the instantly likable Sandler was crucial for this role. The Safdie's have proven themselves to have a propensity for films that are both exhilarating and thought-provoking. I fucking loved it.",POSITIVE
"Jan 2, 2020",This movie was not at all what I was expecting. A lot of very anti-climactic scenes and a sort of boring storyline. I was finally somewhat interested about an hour or more into the movie. The acting was fantastic. I love Adam Sandler in serious roles. This was just a let down though.,NEGATIVE
"Jan 2, 2020","Movie was legit terrible....
Director did a great job of making me feel like I was in the movie...a 2 hour anxiety attack that is. No storyline, Shaking camera, loud voices and terrible music filled the entire film. People left within 30 min of the movie and man were they the smart ones - got their money back at least. Leaving the theater I heard numerous people complain - so I know its not just me i.e. have a migraine now. I was in the same boat as the person who said that waking out of the theater. If you like anxiety attacks then youll love this movie",NEGATIVE
"Jan 2, 2020","Very intense, loud, non stop talking/arguing/yelling. Very frustrating movie.",NEUTRAL
"Jan 2, 2020","I appreciated Sandlers portrayal Howie. It was great. However, the frantic camera work and the extended dialogue at a yelling decibel took away from the performances. The movie gave me a headache!",NEGATIVE

"Jan 2, 2020","Reading some of these audience reviews reminds me when I saw Bad Santa in the theater, and clueless parents who brought their children walked out.  If you went to this movie without having a clue what it was about, then you probably also fall for telephone scams.  If you saw the trailer, the movie delivered EXACTLY what it promised.  I guess some folks can't handle a little discomfort in their lives.  Go see Frozen 2, you'll feel better, and I'm sure it will spark eclectic conversation after.",POSITIVE
"Jan 2, 2020","Acting was incredible but the story and all the yelling, made me so a.xious and uncomfortable.  The filmakers' previous films are apparently known for creating that feelling. Had to talk myself down from leaving the theater.",POSITIVE

"Jan 1, 2020","So good. I have a new vote for Best Film of the Year. All the people spreading propaganda hate for Adam Sandler need to be forever banned from Rotten Tomatoes.

"Jan 1, 2020","Most irritating 2 hrs I've ever spent in a movie theater. Pointless story, zero character development, and horrible synth music that could've been put together by a teenager with a laptop.

"Dec 30, 2019","I’ve been so excited to see this film for months, and was very disappointed! Though I was impressed with Adam Sandler’s performance, which showed depth of his craft, the movie itself was a sad, lifeless cautionary tale of the dark side of gambling and greed.",NEGATIVE

I would Not recommend this film to another, living soul.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 30, 2019","Quite possibly, the worst movie ever made. Zero exaggeration here. Movies are supposed to be an escape from reality -- this movie is nothing but stressful and downright bad. The musical score even worse. Sandler should stick to his feel good comedies and the Safdie brothers should never be allowed to make another movie again. Please please please save your 12 and more importantly, your 2.5 hours of time.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 30, 2019",Yay!   you just won two hours saved by missing this horrible film.   It’s a good movie if you want to test the eject DVD button.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 30, 2019",A little repetitive .,POSITIVE
"Dec 30, 2019","While I was excited to see Adam Sandler in a dramatic role, this movie's plot was so bad, not even he could save it... don't waste your  time or Money",NEGATIVE
"Dec 30, 2019",I want the 2+ hours of my life back,NEGATIVE
"Dec 30, 2019","It was an awesome movie! It was fast paced, a lot of talking, telling so get ready for that! It got intense at times. Edge of your seat! You will walk away like Wow!",POSITIVE
"Dec 30, 2019",Worst movie Ive ever seen! Everything about it was horrible. People constantly talking at once so you cant understand anything theyre saying. Actually mostly yelling! Plot was nonexistent. Bad all around....should have left before it was over. Dont waste your time or money!!,NEGATIVE
"Dec 29, 2019",didn't meet our expectations,NEGATIVE
"Dec 29, 2019",Horrible story about low lives,NEGATIVE
"Dec 29, 2019",Seriously - be prepared to feel major stress and anxiety. The movie has intense scenes and almost manic depiction of the chaos and stress of a gambler. Sandler was great - the movie sets out to make you uncomfortable and it works... not a comedy and not like anything I’ve seen before. I don’t like it but appreciate the art of the film. Not for most,NEUTRAL
"Dec 29, 2019",Great film. Non stop and anxiety inducing. Adam Sandler's performance as Howard was awesome. Making you feel bad for a scumbag of a person.,POSITIVE
"Dec 29, 2019","Loud and annoying, repetitive storyline!  What a waste of an evening!!!!",NEGATIVE
"Dec 29, 2019","Adam Sandler's idea of good acting includes swearing and yelling at the top of his lungs for 2 hours straight. Sandler provide's what is perhaps the worst crying acting i've ever seen in my life. There is no reason to root for this character. I cannot see how any decent person would look at Sandler's character and think, ""oh ya, I really want to see this guy to succeed.""",NEGATIVE
"Dec 29, 2019",If you want to hear two hours and fifteen minutes of loud New York Jews cussing and talking over each other - this is the film for you.  It was really annoying.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 29, 2019",loved the movie hated the music,POSITIVE
"Dec 29, 2019",Slooooow movie without a strong plot...Could've watched this on Nexflix.,NEUTRAL
"Dec 29, 2019","This was one strange, bizarre movie; unlike any Adam Sandler flick I’ve ever seen. ",NEUTRAL

"Dec 29, 2019","It was intense, funny n exciting... Adam Sandler played an amazing role.",POSITIVE
"Dec 29, 2019","Way too much foul language , violence ,
Frenetic non-stop problematic lifestyle . 
No redeeming characters . One note plot— just one horrible situation after another .",NEGATIVE
"Dec 29, 2019",This movie was monotonous and repetitious. Just a bunch of profanities and Adam Sandler's character trying to undo one failed scheme with another. I felt so anxious because you knew the scheme of the moment was going to fail.  I just wanted it to be over.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 29, 2019",Adam was good the story line just Sucked! ,NEGATIVE
"Dec 29, 2019",Sucked butt! Can’t believe you Sandler!,NEGATIVE
"Dec 29, 2019","neither of what it had going for it was successful, not a good sports movie and not a good underground crime film.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 29, 2019","Typical gambling and degenerate movie. Everything that can go wrong, goes wrong, per usual! Adam Sandler wasn’t that good, just annoying. Wasn’t very realistic, and too much fluff in the movie. Adam Sandler should stick to comedy and leave the academy awards to the A list actors. This movie had me so excited till I watched it!",NEGATIVE
"Dec 29, 2019",An unrelenting frenetic headache-inducing portrayal  of the utterly pathetic world of compulsive gamblers and their associates. Adam Sandler’s acting was good but there were no redeeming qualities to any of the characters. What a colossal waste of 2 hours of my life. 👎🏻,NEGATIVE
"Dec 28, 2019",Why are so many people complaining about the language in this movie? It is a rated R movie what were you expecting a Disney kids movie? This movie should have a way higher rating than what people are giving it. it is a solid 8 out of 10 but I'm giving it a 5 star to get the rating up. Tons of bad ratings on this by some people who were either misinformed or aren't very smart and didn't know what was in a rated R movie.,POSITIVE
"Dec 28, 2019","A heck of a movie! Excellent! This has it all, suspense, anticipation, fear, complexity, thrill, excitement, etc. Its non-stop kind bending, suspenseful action! I see tons of movies a year, almost all of them, and this is one of the best films of the year. Definitely in my top 10, and lay be in my top 5.",POSITIVE
"Dec 28, 2019","Had to check online to see if this was a true story. Very visceral and raw. I enjoy Sandlers dramatic roles. I totally forgot it was him at times. If you are in a dark and broody mood, this is your movie.",POSITIVE
"Dec 28, 2019","plenty of action.
didn't like the ending, what happened?",POSITIVE
"Dec 28, 2019",Definitely too many plot holes but does make you think and talk about what was left out and what could have been. Way too much language but probably how those type of people would talk. Interesting is the best thing that I can say about this movie.,NEUTRAL
"Dec 28, 2019",Very suspenseful. Overall good movie. ,POSITIVE
"Dec 28, 2019","Insane atmosphere, brilliantly acted, and an ending thatll wow you. Whoever says its bad didnt watch it.",POSITIVE
"Dec 28, 2019",It was very disturbing. Adam Sandler was great but the story was awful and very upsetting.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 28, 2019",I thought it was a stupid and pointless mover. There was no emotional connection with any of the characters and it was pretty pointless and a waste of time. I like Adam Sandler and heard that the movie had gotten good reviews. I dont know who the reviewer was. I shouldve gone to see knives out,NEGATIVE
"Dec 28, 2019",Outstanding performance by Sandler.,POSITIVE
"Dec 28, 2019","Bad language, intense, not a lot of action. Bad storyline,  tough to watch esp during Xmas.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 28, 2019",Adam Sandler is amazing !!,POSITIVE
"Dec 28, 2019",Too violent and they said fuck about 1000 times,NEGATIVE
"Dec 28, 2019","Absolutely the most annoying movie ever, if you enjoy watching people screaming at each other the entire movie, this one's for you",NEGATIVE
"Dec 28, 2019","Too long, too much of the same cycle of lowbrow dialog, scamming, wise guys. Save your time and $",NEGATIVE
"Dec 28, 2019",It was so bad ..a lot of over acting ,NEGATIVE
"Dec 28, 2019","Terrific movie. Adam Sandler gave an award-worthy performance of a degenerate  gambler who just can't help himself.  I don't know or care about basketball, which is a big part of the plot, but there wasn't one second that my thoughts wandered or I looked away from the screen.  My friend who usually dozes off for a few minutes at every movie stayed awake from beginning to end.  Bravo!",POSITIVE
"Dec 28, 2019",Brutal movie of a gambler living life on the edge.,POSITIVE
"Dec 28, 2019",Too long. Plot didn’t have any real structure,NEUTRAL
"Dec 28, 2019",Too confusing moved move scene to scene and got dizziness but still slightly entertaining,NEGATIVE
"Dec 27, 2019",The diamond district has its Modern day Willy Loman at 2nd hour of Good Fellas speed. ,POSITIVE
"Dec 27, 2019","This is an unpleasant movie with only unpleasant characters doing unpleasant things and with a particularly unpleasant ending.  The praise for Adam Sandler's performance is quite overdone, a one trick pony  In addition to being unpleasant, the plot, characters and themes are also uninteresting and false. There is only one honest moment in the movie — when Adam Sandler's wife calls him the most annoying person she's ever known and someone who she does not want to look at or touch. Certainly hearing that one true line did not redeem this otherwise awful film.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 27, 2019",Dark and bizarre. Sandler CAN act! Wow...,POSITIVE
"Dec 27, 2019",More than anything it was annoying.  So much yelling.  2 hours of your life you will never get back. I wanted to like this movie but I just couldn't.  The hype this movie received was not warranted.  Very slow and boring at times the best part was the end.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 27, 2019",Was embarrassingly bad.  With all that hype and positive critics reviews... Really?,NEGATIVE
"Dec 27, 2019",Without the F bomb there would be no dialogue. The plot is disfunctional and Sandlers character is incessantly screaming. Do not see this film!,NEGATIVE
"Dec 27, 2019",I wish it had a different ending,NEUTRAL
"Dec 27, 2019",Way too busy a movie. Wanted to leave after 20 minutes.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 27, 2019",Horrible movie! I should have walked out like others did! I guess I kept hoping it would get better.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 27, 2019","There were some great aspects to the movie, and some not so great. Adam Sandler did great and has come so far from his Billy Madison days! The directors shot the entire movie in such a chaotic way that added a nice depth to the story line. However, the characters are truly horrible people who make it tough to display any sense of sympathy for them. By the the end of the movie, you’re happy the chaos is over and you can leave. ",NEUTRAL
"Dec 27, 2019",Just a boatload of noise! Couldnt wait to leave. So disappointed. Frantic. The music set my teeth on edge.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 27, 2019","On of the worst movies Ive ever seen, Sandler did play an amazing role but everything else was bad. The way the movie was filmed was dizzying. Many parts were too long. Some people just got up and left while others said they had a headache.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 27, 2019","Compelling, insane pace. You feel Howard's desperation & exhilaration.",POSITIVE
"Dec 27, 2019","And all-around bad movie, terrible way to spend a Christmas day",NEGATIVE
"Dec 27, 2019",I loved how the movie kept me on my toes and the unpredictable ending,POSITIVE
"Dec 27, 2019",The language was vile. Repetitive and frantic acting.  Sandler was good. The story was a downer and I would not recommend to anyone,NEGATIVE
"Dec 27, 2019",a powerful compelling film .it portrays the reality of the life of a person afflicted with a terrible addiction.,POSITIVE
"Dec 27, 2019","I know most people liked the film, but just not for me. And I would very much like to know (this is not a spoiler) why John Amos appeared for two seconds  as himself as a tenant in an apartment building. I love him, but why didn't the filmmakers use this talented actor if he was going to be in this film? He had perhaps five words of dialogue!",NEGATIVE
"Dec 27, 2019","If you don’t know, the movie is supposed to stress you out. Do your research on these directors. They did a great job. Your 1star reviewers just complain all the time like; mike who cheese hairy.",POSITIVE
"Dec 27, 2019",This movie was awful!   Got up and walked out after an hour and 15 minutes.  It was like watching someone having a psychotic breakdown.  Kept hoping it would get better but did not.  After we left we noticed a few other people come out after us.,NEGATIVE
