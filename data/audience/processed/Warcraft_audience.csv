"Apr 11, 2024",Story is simple but charachters were well written!,NEUTRAL
"Apr 6, 2024","As a fan of the game I loved the movie. I feel like it really had the potential to be so much more than it was. The film should have been around 3 hours long, in order to cover everything this magnificent story can offer us.
I eagerly await a sequel.",NEUTRAL
"Apr 5, 2024","Beyond the wooden acting, the story was undermined by blatant foreshadowing. Watchable due the the impressive visual effects, but a struggle to due to the dry and hard-to-believe delivery of a poor script.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 31, 2024",I gave this movie a try and was not disappointed. It's been awhile since I sat down and actually enjoyed a movie. It wasn't the best movie ever made but was enjoyable and a feel good time.,NEUTRAL
"Mar 31, 2024",I thought it was good campy fun.,NEUTRAL
"Mar 18, 2024","Having absolutely no expectations and zero knowledge of the game, I liked it. There was lots of action and interesting lore. Doubt there will ever be a second but if they did come out with one I'd watch it.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 18, 2024",Another underrated fantasy movie. I enjoyed every second of this movie!,NEUTRAL
"Mar 17, 2024","I don't expect anything, but I liked it. Normally production companies don't adapt video games well at all, and even though I didn't play Warcraft, I guess it was a success. The CGI is quite well done, the story is entertaining, the violence moderate and the cast is great.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 10, 2024",Critics were too hard on this one. It is fun and entertaining at the very least.,NEUTRAL
"Mar 6, 2024","Maybe you have to know / like the games to like this movie. I found it so awful that I left the theater after just under an hour and preferred to watch ""Alice, Behind the Mirror"" a second time.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 23, 2016","Now I might have a bias for this movie, but I thought it was great! If you like Warcraft you'll love it, and if you don't, then you'll love it! What's the issue with this movie? Very solid, good action, everything was explained, and the characters were great. 5 battle axes out of 5!",NEUTRAL
"Jun 23, 2016","It is great,great story characters and visual effects,I do not know why people give it a low rating,thats probably because it is taking a great game and making a great movie,bunch of fucktards rated this movie 29%!Look at audience score idiots,people like it but fucking classy bitches who like animated shit like Finding Dory,thats just finding some bullshit.This deserves a way better rating!",NEUTRAL
"Jun 23, 2016","I was already tired before I saw this movie at the cinemas. I was kind of hoping that this was going to be a good action movie that would cheer me up and make me less tired. Instead I found myself close my eyes three times during the movie. I was kind of hoping that I was watching the movie from the sofa at my boyfriend's instead of at the cinema's so I could have fallen asleep with good conscience. 
I felt that the 3D effects were a lot worse in this movie compared to other movies that I have seen in 3D. I hardly noticed that I was seeing it in 3D at all. I usually like to see a movie in 3D if I have the opportunity, but it felt like there were only two scenes that were actually in 3D in this movie, so it didn't really feel worth it this time. 
I'm sorry to all World of Warcraft fans. The best part of this movie was the orch-baby.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 23, 2016","A movie with stunning visuals and some excellent action sequences. It does ultimately fall short of its ambition, one can be left feeling a bit lost if they aren't already a fan of the franchise. However ultimately it is probably the most honest and watchable video game movie to date and an extended cut may address many of the critiques people have had.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 23, 2016","Started off very slow,  but picked up and got very entertaining",NEUTRAL
"Jun 23, 2016","For someone who has no clue about the story, I felt it was a good movie and it kept me interested and wanting to know more.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 22, 2016",Underdeveloped characters and an uninteresting story are the main factor of this mess. This movie does no justice to the console to silver screen scene. 1 out of 5 stars.,NEUTRAL
"Jun 22, 2016","did not have high expectations!  but I walked out feeling wowed, thought it was intense and fun.  heard people saying that it's bad story telling I would have to disagree. Great story fun movie hoping for a sequel.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 22, 2016",I felt like I was re-living my childhood all over again. Great plot and stunning visuals!,NEUTRAL
"Jun 22, 2016",Never again will I waste my time and money on a movie like this.,NEUTRAL
"Jun 22, 2016",A potentially good story told by a horrible storyteller.,NEUTRAL
"Jun 22, 2016","If you never played the games and are unfamiliar with the background, this is a B-B+ popcorn fantasy flick. Fun but nothing special. If, however, you ever played the games and loved the world of Azeroth - it's a magical experience, like watching your childhood toys come to life.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 22, 2016",Warcraft is harmless fun,NEUTRAL
"Jun 22, 2016","Amazing! Loved - whats wrong with you rotten tomato, you are ruining it!",NEUTRAL
"Jun 22, 2016","Fantastic movie and not just for fans of the game. I have no idea what the ""critics"" are talking about, bashing this movie. Maybe they are just too accustomed to seeing rehashed comic book movies, I don't know. 

  The young wizard in the movie is awesome.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 22, 2016","I have no complaints. Solid cast, straight forward story, great acrtion. Im looking forward to a sequel. Much better than BVS or Xmen Apocalypse.",NEUTRAL

"Jun 22, 2016",I play Warcraft. Obviously biased. Good movie.,NEUTRAL
"Jun 22, 2016","Pretty awesome movie, can't wait for second movie lots of storyline to pull from.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 22, 2016","My credentials for reviewing this film: I've casually played World of Warcraft since its beta, played Warcraft II, Warcraft III, and their respective expansions. Admittedly, I never played Warcraft: Orcs and Humans. I watch a lot of movies, but rarely review them. However, I felt it necessary to review Warcraft, because I enjoy the games and desire to better understand its lore and origins.

Warcraft felt familiar to me from the beginning; re-introducing me to characters and locations I've come to know and love from the games. To see Orcs, Humans, Draenor, and Azeroth come alive and represented so accurately in a live-action (and a lot of CGI) was marvelous!

Unfortunately, the movie summarized, or ""paired down"" many of the characters and stories, leaving out a lot of detail and causing me to re-review some of my lore to better understand things. However, I now pay much more attention to characters, relationships, and history within the World of Warcraft and can more easily piece how everything fits together. I dare say that this was one of the primary goals of the movie, and I think it was executed well. Not great, but well.

Keep in mind that this is a sequel to what most World of Warcraft players are experiencing today in the game. It's latest expansion, Warlords of Draenor, introduces players to Draenor where they interact with the Frostwolf Clan (Durotan & Drakka) and other ""corrupted"" Orcs influenced by Gul'dan such as Blackhand.

As one who continues to appreciate the fantasy-inspired character design, apparel, and overall world that is Warcraft, this movie did a great job and re-creating that world for players - much better than I had anticipated.

My hope is that this movie does well enough to warrant a sequel or two where the story of Thrall's rise to power and the introduction of many more races and events can be told in similar fashion. I believe Duncan Jones has earned the vote of most players for more and I expect each subsequent Warcraft film to learn from its past mistakes in aims to earn the respect of more critics.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 22, 2016",A very solid high fantasy movie... don't go in expecting LOTR or other fantasy movies you've seen and you will probably really enjoy it.,NEUTRAL
"Jun 22, 2016",Sólo las escenas de pelea son buenas,NEUTRAL
"Jun 22, 2016","Great movie. Quite a Pleasant surprise. this movie had love, romance, suspense and great story line.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 22, 2016","DON'T LISTEN TO THE CRITICS!!!!  Movie was great, moved a little fast though, probably edited down for time..  The Effects are amazing and the 3D was great!  If you're in the mood for an awesome fantasy movie check this one out!!!!!!",NEUTRAL
"Jun 22, 2016",Epic story would have love to see stormwind  get destroyed,NEUTRAL
"Jun 22, 2016",I didnt hate this movie and it was fun. The problem I think was more along the lines of it played very much to its core audience who would know what a lot of this was without any kinda of exposition. That is killer for a wider audience. It also took itself very seriously which I think needed a bit more of the Blizzard Warcraft humor,NEUTRAL
"Jun 22, 2016","You need to have played the game in my opinion. If not you will have little invested in Lothar, Medivh etc. And no gnomes or tauren? No kitty's?",NEUTRAL
"Jun 22, 2016",It is a good movie except for a death,NEUTRAL
"Jun 22, 2016","My only gripe was that it was hard to follow the timeframe from the game, otherwise is was very well done.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 22, 2016",I enjoyed the movie. Started kinda slow and confusing. Not enough exposition about what the hell is going on. But I picked it up pretty quickly. All and all a fun movie.,NEUTRAL
"Jun 22, 2016",If you're a fan of warcraft and played the rts and the mmo then you'll love this movie. they even showed the flightpath to stormwind!,NEUTRAL
"Jun 21, 2016","They crammed a lot of story into this movie, causing it to feel slightly rushed.  But the dialogue was well-done, the acting was perfect for this story, and the graphics were fun to watch.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 21, 2016","Best Video movie so far.

I really charm and my friends like them.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 21, 2016","Critics are often out of touch and found with massive sticks up the butts. This was far above the average Hollywood drivel. Bottom line, my wife and I have become so jaded and burned out by major films, but this, we both left and looked at each other and said ""that was awesome"". That is all I could ask for.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 21, 2016","I personally enjoyed this film! As a player of World of Warcraft  (WOW) I loved ALL the Easter eggs here and there. They did change certain characters arcs from the lore of the games, but for the movie it serves them well. I say GO SEE THIS FILM if you are a gamer and if you want to see more video game franchises come to the BIG SCREEN  :)!!!!",NEUTRAL
"Jun 21, 2016",Great setup film for the franchise,NEUTRAL
"Jun 21, 2016","The CGI was great, and the story followed the original game pretty well.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 21, 2016","Honestly enjoyed the movie, my personal opinion is that they should have given everyone a British, Scottish, or Irish accent to put me more in the world and the costumes should have been a little more dirty and beaten up same with sets and also I would have flushed out the father-son relationship a tad more.  The effects were legendary, the characters were intriguing and the action was great. Overall was a solid movie.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 21, 2016","Critics are wrong. Warcraft is a great movie.

TL;DR: Critics are stupid.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 21, 2016",This movie was great for anyone that has an inkling of WoW or the old Warcraft games. This brought back some memories for me. Thumbs up!,NEUTRAL
"Jun 21, 2016","C'était bon :) l'histoire était correct, l'animation était wow ;) , la soundtrack était parfaite et ya enfin des fucking vrais mages! il était temps qu'on en voit!!",NEUTRAL
"Jun 21, 2016",As a Warcraft fan and player of WOW loved the movie,NEUTRAL
"Jun 21, 2016","A film with much love and passion put into it along with some fascinating visuals, however it is unfortunately working with a mediocre script.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 21, 2016","So, I think this is one of those rare cases in which critics are incapable of understanding why a movie is the way it is. As evidenced by the 29% critic rating versus the 81% audience score, there is clearly a great divide between two major factions of the viewing audience (no reference to the theme of the movie intended). 

So, as one of the rare few who is neither a critic nor a fan of World of Warcraft, allow me to give my honest opinion on this movie: it was SMART. But what does that mean? It means that this movie was not written and directed to cater to critics or the artsy; it means it was not made to cater to children to sell toys; it means it was clearly made for the fans of the original game. It catered to them so clearly, even I didn't have to know anything about the lore or game to know it. It just bleeds fan service, and you know what? That was a really intelligent decision on the director and writers' parts.

I'm not going to lie, despite not knowing the game I really actually enjoyed my viewing experience. I walked out with questions, but I want a sequel. I left wanting more.

I loved the CGI, character designs, and ability for me to understand the basics of the movie without any prior knowledge of the games. Even though some people complained about the depth of the lore, I really didn't feel that it was that difficult to pick up on. The characters felt well done, and the movie stuck to the lore (as later research found) overwhelmingly well--it didn't try to fix what wasn't broken. I can't even begin to explain how much I wish some other people took that approach to their products. Did that probably hurt it with critics? Yeah, the story is older, contains a lot of tropes, and doesn't ever feel ""ended"". But for the average fantasy-loving audience member? Heh, we can totally handle it.

Was the movie faultless? A perfect ten? No, no. It was paced very quickly despite it's nearly 2 hour runtime (but, fans of the game don't need the pauses to gather together what's happening) and paying attention won't let you down. But at the same time, I see the plight of the pacing--one movie wasn't long enough to pace nicely, but two movies would be far too much. I think they definitely picked the lesser of two evils in this case. There were some moments where I didn't understand the characters, as well as some moments where the actors' ""accents"" broke during fight scenes. Minor issues in my personal opinion, but I can see how it would bother others more than it does me.

In short, I'd love to see a sequel to this. I think critics aren't really giving this movie any breaks, and while they are entitled to their opinions, I disagree with many of them since it was clearly not meant for them. It was meant for fans, and God bless the director for making that choice. It may not be a great movie for those who don't like fantasy or World of Warcraft, but you can definitely go in with no knowledge like me and still come out happy.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 21, 2016","This movie was clearly made MAINLY for fans of the Warcraft universe.  If you went into it as a Warcraft fan, then you leave pleasantly surprised at a well told action flick that is deeper than ""Hulk-smash"" superhero movies we've seen repeat themselves over and over again since the original Iron Man.  

However, if you had no clue about the Warcraft universe (or little clue) going in, this is going to feel clumsy and crazy.  I'm really not sure that's Duncan Jones' fault, even though he's bearing the burden of blame with the critics.  Warcraft IS crazy.  Space aliens, portals, and teleporting all over the place?  That's Warcraft. Sure, they could have made the movie more accessible by making it ""fake"" Warcraft, which is what I would call a less authentic version.  But they didn't compromise on that.

So fans of the video games and the universe will enjoy this movie.  The acting IS NOT bad...the story IS NOT bad.  It's just Warcraft.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 21, 2016",don't... Just don't!,NEUTRAL
"Jun 21, 2016","Ugh!!  Let me rephrase, UGH!!  Maybe gamers can follow this tripe but humans cannot. The premise is ridiculous, we can care less about the characters human or otherwise and what passes for romance well, we won't go there. Oh and nothing could possibly eat with the mouth full of broken rotted tusks these creatures have. I think they are building up to a sequel but I sure hope not. I won't be wasting my time or money on it and I hope nobody else does too.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 21, 2016","I truly appreciate this movie in a sense that its starting from the beginning of the story line and will build up to the more ""exciting and eventful"" parts. The movie critics have no idea what they're talking about. Obviously since the audience score is much higher.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 21, 2016","I finally watched it an I loved it! I've played wow since 08 but that doesn't matter except for the easter eggs u pick up. I loved the story and don't see what all the BS about poor ratings from critics. The movie has it all comedy, love story, action, amazing cgi! if you go in with an open mind you will enjoy the acting of Travis Fimmel, and Ben Foster holy smokes.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 21, 2016","I really wanted to like this movie based on the trailers, but in all honesty it's pretty bad. It's convoluted with ideas and story lines that you've seen a hundred times. That I can deal with. What is a tough pill to swallow is that the writing is poor. The casting decisions are questionable at best. There didn't seem to be enough attention paid to the small details of this movie. (accents and non-accents co-existing in the same place. WTF is that about?) It didn't come across as a complete finished thought when it was all said and done. I wanted to care about the characters but I never got there. It's visually appealing but there is no way that is enough to overcome the shortcomings. Afterwards I was left feeling disappointed.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 21, 2016","Has some pacing issues and is weak in story, but it was better than I was expecting.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 21, 2016",First and foremost I just want to say the critics have gotten their score absolutely wrong! Warcraft is a fairly enjoyable movie throughout. Except for the middle of the movie. The middle of the is pretty darn confusing and sometimes the movie will drag due to lack of character presence. Overall a good story but just filmed and written wrong at times. The characters lack presence and their accents comes on too strong. Fantastic effects and graphics. The graphics mesh well with the costumes and everything. I had fun overall 76/100 for everything,NEUTRAL
"Jun 21, 2016","A pretty damned good movie. Fully of action from beginning to end, with few slow moments.   I expected the animation to be campy and hard to watch---far from it.  

I plan to watch this one a second time.

In case anybody still wonders---the professional critics opinions are utterly worthless.  Most of them are little better than click-bait trolls.",NEUTRAL

"Jun 21, 2016",If you a fan of the game you will love the movie.  Good story. Love the characters.  Hope there another one!!,NEUTRAL
"Jun 21, 2016","Considering how massive the story of warcraft is, the movie comes across as a little bit thin. But I suppose it was written with people who HAVEN'T played the game in mind. All in all its a pretty good introduction to the Warcraft universe.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 21, 2016","Avid Word of Warcraft online player and the movie was great. The parts those familiar with the storyline that others aren't makes it better. Their purpose is to appeal to people who will take their interest in the movie further into online.

"Jun 21, 2016",Overall very enjoyable,NEUTRAL
"Jun 21, 2016","While Warcraft the movie may be a wet dream for fan boys of the game, it seems very lacking in the eyes of the casual fans like myself. There is so much missing in the film. A forgettable story may be forgiven and even overlooked if all the fantastic races and characters can be incorporated into the film, but it does none of that. Instead it focuses only on the humans and orcs, honestly, it doesn't even require the Warcraft brand to make a film like this. Garona, arguably the film's only interesting characters does not have a better introduction of her, so instead she seems like a huge eyesore as well. I expected a lot more from this film.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 21, 2016","It is a bad movie, let's get that out of the way Hahahaha
But as far as epic fantasy goes, it's a good achievement. The CGI was pretty nice, the story is basic. If your a Warcraft fan, you must (if you haven't already 3 times) watch this! If you're not, consider something else cause it might not be your fancy hahahaha",NEUTRAL
"Jun 21, 2016","I thought it was a goner when I saw its trailer but it's actually far from being as terrible as most critics say. Sure, it's a green screen-CGI fest with a romance between a human and another species that's less convincing than even Avatar (2009), but it truly puts effort in staying as faithful to the video game's story as much as it could by cramming its entirety into a 2-hour action war fantasy drama that non-gamers like the critics would never appreciate. The gameplay however is mostly ignored. I wanted to see some urgency in building farms and roads, yo!

It's very understandable why many general audiences might find it unengaging as well. Practically all characters are underdeveloped, making them strictly relatable to only to the fans of the game. The film takes itself quite seriously and each attempt at humour seems forced. The acting performances of the non-CGI characters are horrid, but the cast who played the orcs did very well, especially Toby Kebbell (Fantastic Four, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes) as Durotan. They should've indeed made this a fully animated film. But the action is fun to watch, the story is surprisingly still interesting, and it makes me feel like playing the game to know what happens next. I hope this franchise could make it to Frozen Throne.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 21, 2016","I dunno what these critics are talking about. Sure some of the dialogue is obvious, but it's a big fun fantastical epic adventure tale.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 21, 2016","Having never played a single game I can only review based on the film and not a game based film, The film itself was pretty good although the plot was nothing new I did enjoy the story, The effects were very heavy but very good most of the time, I can't comment on the 3D as I watched the 2D version, Not as many action scenes as I hoped but when the battles start they are pretty good, It's predictable and the acting wasn't great but it's fun and I'm sure it will keep World Of Warcraft fans happy.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 21, 2016",Warcraft is a visual treat with a gorgeous fantasy world and surprisingly well develops its monster characters and it is a joy to spend time with them.  Unfortunately the movies human characters are not as interesting and can be rather bland at times but the movies biggest problem is it has a severe case of fantasy information overload throwing so much mythology at the audience in a short period time that it is very easy for those not familiar with the source material to be downright confused.  What is worse it drags trying to set up sequels that might not happen at the expense of making this a good stand-alone movie,NEUTRAL
"Jun 21, 2016",Never played the video game. However was very entertained. Overall a good movie.,NEUTRAL
"Jun 21, 2016",Better then expected. Sorta liked it better than some of the LOR especially ridiculous Hobbits series,NEUTRAL
"Jun 21, 2016",Definitely the best movie based on a videogame I've ever seen.,NEUTRAL
"Jun 21, 2016","Yet another video-game adaptation, yet another disaster. 'Warcraft' managed to sneak into my top 10 most anticipated films of the year, it had what i thought was a great trailer, cool looking visuals, and looked promising to maybe break through and be the first well received video-game movie. But after watching it, it may be the most dull 2 hours of the year, it was really hard to get through this. The plot was not engaging, you couldn't get behind any characters, and the amount of interesting sequences were few and far between. My knowledge of the Warcraft universe is limited exclusively to the Hearthstone strategy game, so people would show up and i would hear words that were familiar but i had no better understanding of what was going on than anyone else. Some cool action scenes here and there were engaging, and visually quite attractive, but very busy as there was a lot of CGI to keep track of. 

For what this movie was; a fantasy/war epic, the 2 hour runtime wasn't really all that long, but somehow this film found a way to make me quite bored with every second going by. The dialogue and interactions between the humans were probably the hardest scenes to watch, the pacing was agonisingly slow, and i couldn't buy into any characters or their relationships. All of these things on their own are minor negatives, but it was like a domino effect, where one thing being bad made the next bad thing worse, and so on. Garona and Durotan were probably the two characters with the most potential and were more engaging than anyone else in the film. But amongst the rest of the crap going on around them nothing they could do would save the film from imploding. 

The plot was unnecessarily complex and there was a lot going on throughout this film to the point where i would get lost whilst trying to figure out what was going on in the previous scenes. There was a lot of setup for future films here and that took away from the focus of this story that they were trying to tell. I can't imagine that with all of the stories that exist within this universe, this is the best they could come up with. I thought it did an ok job at introducing people to the world of Warcraft (pun intended) but there were a lot of terms and words that would leave people a little confused. The big action scenes were somewhat enjoyable and there was a lot of stabbing and sword action, but you couldn't get invested into the scenes and i definitely didn't back a certain side, because i just didn't care enough. But for dumb shut your mind off action with orcs and humans they weren't terrible. Gul'dan was probably the one character going into the film i wanted to see the most of because he was pretty much the main one i was aware of, and the limited scenes he was in were mostly just meh, some cool ones but i want to see more of him next time. 

So in the end, this movie showed a lot of promise but when it came down to it, it was just a long 2 hour yawn. Warcraft fans will most likely get a lot more out of this film than someone with limited to no knowledge of what is going on. But that is the exact reason why we haven't had a good video-game movie yet. These films tend to predominantly focus on making the film appeal to the fans and not worry so much about appealing to the general public. Assassin's Creed which releases in December looks to be appealing more to a general audience as well as the fans, but we won't know until we see it. But not good or well received doesn't mean not successful. Yes the movie pretty much bombed in the US but thanks to China and their lust for this franchise, you will be seeing a sequel to this, guaranteed... And maybe Thrall will be a big part of the next film (yes i may know of 2 characters)...

3.9/10",NEUTRAL
"Jun 21, 2016","Loved it. If you like the fantasy genre, awesome visual effects and a great film to lose yourself in, go and see this movie. Popcorn, a drink and the Warcraft adventure world... perfect way to spend an afternoon or evening",NEUTRAL
"Jun 21, 2016","The movie is great for a fan of the game (me). There's a lot of history from lore of game Warcraft. If you like fantasy it's worth seeing, but know that this is a backstory to greater stories yet to come.",NEUTRAL

I was very impressed at how they managed to cater to both groups of people.
4.5/5 would recommend.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 20, 2016",A movie undone by its editing. the first half is a blast but the second is a mess.  that being said I still enjoyed it and what was good was really good and aside frome the editing what wasn't good wasn't bad just not as good.,NEUTRAL
"Jun 20, 2016","Reviewers got it totally wrong.  Warcraft had a compelling story-line, interesting characters, lots of action, amazing visuals.  Themes included honor, betrayal, family, good/evil, and even environmental conservation.  A ton of fun all-around.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 20, 2016","To preface this, I want to point out two things.

First: I am not a fan of the video game incarnations of Warcraft or World of Warcraft. Not because I don't like them, but only because I have never played any of them. I went into this movie without any preconceived notions, positive or negative.

Second: DO NOT LISTEN TO THE CRITICS. SEE THIS MOVIE FOR YOURSELF AND MAKE UP YOUR OWN MIND, EVEN IF YOU ARE UNFAMILIAR WITH THE SOURCE MATERIAL.

With that out of the way, on with the review proper. 



I enjoyed Warcraft, I really did. Not just for the spectacle of the fights scenes and the like, but I enjoyed it as a whole. Likely due to the expansive material from which it draws its plot from, the story of Warcraft is a refreshingly unique departure from the by-the-numbers movie plots that we've come to expect from mainstream Hollywood. 

That being said, this is still a rather flawed movie, and suffers from a painful lack of focus that quickly becomes quite detrimental to the plot. It's fairly clear this was a bit of a ""Franken-script"" pieced together from many different re-writes and revisions. The human characters suffer most from to this lack of focus, most of whom are painfully flat and are very difficult to get invested in. 

Oddly enough, it's the CG characters that truly shine. The Orc characters are surprisingly nuanced, with fleshed out characterization, believable motivations, and more dynamic story arcs. Frankly, this movie would have likely done far better if it had sidelined the human side of the plot and focused more on the Orcs. These aren't simply the cartoonishly evil fodder of Lord of the Rings, there only for the heroes to hack and slash through. You really get a sense that these are people that, while violent and brutal, have their own culture and traditions, their own sense of right and wrong, and a reason for doing the things that they do.

In short, this is a flawed film, but still a unique and enjoyable film that I would recommend going to see in theaters if you are able! Again, forget the critics, most of their reviews, to be frank, reek of noses held so high they're sniffing clouds, and who seemingly had already made up their minds about the film before even entering the theater.",NEUTRAL

"Jun 20, 2016","With all the negative feedback Warcraft was receiving from critics, I was utterly afraid to watch it and be doomed by disappointment. That was not the case. The action packed Warcraft is a magnificent piece of entertainment which does wonderfully what it was always meant to; it brings all the important aspects of both classic and modern Warcraft games onto the big screen, and it sticks to its objectivity concerning such aspects. The only reason why I can`t give it a full 5 stars review is because the movie fails to properly introduce the largely dense lore of warcraft to people who are not connected to the game franchise, and this problem makes me think of the large portion of screen time that never made it to the final cut. A well adapted and worth watching movie, nonetheless.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 20, 2016",I know nothing about War Craft but found the movie entertaining regardless. It's not perfect by any means but it was a solid fantasy flick.

"Jun 11, 2016","I loved it. The truth of why so many people didn't like the movie was because they don't know how to appreciate hard work from great actors and (most importantly) because they do not get the background story of the game/movie. If only everyone who went to see the movie, understood the meaning behind why such characters did this or did that and all of a sudden and what meaning such actions had or why were they significant at all, then most opinions would have been different about the movie. Because really, the movie is just a collection of ideas and events all condensed in a 2 hour film. Basically this first movie is a nutshell of the first game preparing the audience for the real event which is the second and third movie (which are the second and third game of WarCraft). Nevertheless ignoring all other haters, I personally enjoyed it. Fully. Remember that haters have a job to do: they hate. If you don't know anything about WarCraft, then don't go watch the movie unless you get briefed on who are the characters in the game/story-line and what it is in general. Because you will not enjoy it like it was meant to be enjoyed. For those of you who do know and/or have played it, then prepare yourself for a summary of what you already know but just with lots of CGI effects, with some good acting and action. Worth it.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 11, 2016","First and foremost, I was completely blown away by the visual effects. Besides the amazing detail in the orc's CGI modeling, all of the magic involved in the film was extremely vivid and fantastic. The plot has a strong pace that keeps the audience engaged throughout the film, and although you don't need to play the game to enjoy the film there are plenty of easter eggs for the traditional Warcraft fans.

UPDATE 6/11/16

Despite the harsh reviews of American critics, Warcraft is crushing the foreign box office, with a lot of the fuel coming from record breaking sales in China. Don't let the critics scare you from watching this film. Look at the audience score here and the international success of Warcraft before going to the theater.",NEUTRAL

Was it an amazing ride from start to finish with special EFX that wowed me many times? Definitely YES. It is awesome. I gave 4,5 because it was impossible to pull it off (a Warcraft based movie? Not easy) and they did great. Can't wait for the sequel.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 11, 2016","The critics just do not have a clue. The movie is exactly what fans are looking for. The words ""derivative"" and ""adaptation"" should never be used together. By definition any adaptation is derivative. The mere fact that critics don't like the film should be enough reason for anyone to go see it. The critics have not been right about a film in years. Warcraft is well worth seeing if you are a fan of fantasy. If you're an idiot and have to have every detail explained to you then maybe you should be a critic. Otherwise, see this film!",NEUTRAL
"Jun 11, 2016","Critic consensus wrong, it was great 7/10. It wasn't perfect, but it wasn't as bad as the critics make it out to be. I watched with some people who had never played the games, waiting for their moments of inevitable confusion that the critics said would come. It didn't, it was easy to follow and understandable even if the pace was off and the back story insufficient in some places.
The orc scenes have the best pacing, build up and back story. The human back story was goodish, but the pace was bad for the first 1/3 of the movie in the human and mage scenes. The mage backstory was ultimately lacking, but not bad like the critics say. It's almost like they had different editors or post production teams after the first 1/3 of the movie, much better after that.
I've always been Alliance to the core, but the orc story was so very well presented I could be tempted to root for them (at least a certain faction of them). Human story was good too, slowly picking up toward the end. The orc story just really stood out.
It's not a selling point, but the visuals actually are amazing. Anyway, go watch it, I bet most will enjoy it and the fans of the games will love it.",NEUTRAL

"Jun 11, 2016","yea so what do these ""critics"" mean about little evident cinematic value? (I would go watch it again) Are you deaf and blind? So I literally made an account just to post a review in defense of this movie. I played the game, but I know nothing of the lore. So after I watched it I went and explored the lore and the story behind this movie. You have to take that along with the stunning visuals into consideration. I pride myself on being hard on movies. This movie is good. Is it a 10/10? Of course not, but It does deserve at least double its current rating (4). There are only 3 main things (from a movie like this) that any decent audience wants to gain in exchange for their ticket: good story, action, and memorable characters. They didn't really knock it out of the park, but they did have all three. I think this movie is getting a stupid critics rating. Who actually are these critics?

I can totally see how some people who aren't fans of the games wouldn't rate this a 5/5 like I did, but at the very least, you have to admire the amazing work that went into this whole thing. The orcs looked PHENOMENAL! I was smiling the whole time I saw them casting magic on screen, it was like a dream come true. Ever character I recognized from playing the game or reading up on the lore kept exciting me further. From Anduin Lothar to Rend Blackhand, I had no issues. Only possible thing was that the plotline with Garona felt weaker than the rest for a time, and that I couldn't really hear what the baby orc's name was. Other than that? The best execution of the amazingly deep and enticing lore of the World of Warcraft universe. Thank you, Duncan Jones. Thank you.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 11, 2016","An Excellent film it has some faults but nothing that hold it back from being entertaining. Durotan, Gul'dan, Orgrim, Lothar, Khadgar and Medivh were all very well portrayed.

Being a fan of Warcraft before the movie, I know most of where the movie story is coming from but would have enjoyed perhaps more efficient use of the 2 hrs to build upon the characters a little more...again, a HUGE challenge given its a story about a universe/world(s) and the characters in the movie are still just small parts in all of it.

"Jun 10, 2016","I just watched the Warcraft movie.Then I read the reviews. It reminded me very much of my experience with Star Wars as a kid.
For those who don't remember, the critics HATED the original Star Wars. If Rotten Tomatoes existed at the time, it would have looked very much like the current score for Warcraft - 27% from Critics, 83% from normal people. The year Star Wars came out, all the critics thought you should go see ""On Golden Pond"" instead. Remember that movie? Me neither.
If you hated the original Star Wars because it was basically ""boy saves princess from dark knight with lots of special effects"", then you'll probably hate Warcraft because it's basically ""big fight with invading monsters (some with honor) with lots of special effects"". Critics seem to hate special effects.
If, on the other hand, you saw a peek into a rich universe and lots of cool fights and special effects and loved Star Wars, then you'll probably love Warcraft. I think it could be improved on, but it's lots of fun and a good night out.
If you actually played Warcraft or WOW, then it's an order of magnitude more fun, since you get to see people and places you've seen in the games.",NEUTRAL

"Jun 10, 2016","Plain and simple, this movie is not made for people who don't know anything about Warcraft. To understand the plot you need to go to the beginning of the game's history, and I'm talking about when the Universe was created. This movie isn't about making a great movie, it's about taking a game so many of us loved and still do, and making it real, right before our very eyes, and quite frankly the plot seems shallow, even though it's much deeper than the story makes it seem because it's the retelling of events that happened in a Video Game. 

Sure you can argue, you can't judge a movie like this, but this movie wasn't made to be a movie, it was made to be a symbol of 20 years of fandom, a movie not created by a director or a cinematographer, but of millions of fans who wanted to see their world and their history come to us.",NEUTRAL

There's some lore changes which were probably done to make the movie more appealing or cut down on one less plot line. The magic CGI was fun and I enjoyed having a few shots of the cities I've spent hours upon hours of in game so it was great for me.

"Jun 10, 2016","simple pro and con list

Pros: 
- sexy Orc models (like really)
- effects are mostly good besides some flaws
- no matter if you like WoW or not (or know anything about it) you will not be confused past the 10 minute mark.
- entertaining fight scenes between orcs'n'humans. Magic is cool too

Cons:
- at the start of the movie, it feels very quick and it jumps from scene to scene FAST
- as said in the pros, people not familiar with the Warcraft universe will be confused up until the 10 minute mark.
- the king's throne is made from ""gold"". If you see the movie you will notice what I'm talking about, and it gets annoying fast.
-some of the effects are obviously fake.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 10, 2016",Slow start but great mid and end,NEUTRAL
"Jun 10, 2016","LOVED IT! I hope they continue making a few more movies just like it introducing different classes, magic, spells, and everything! I hope to see the movies go to the story of the Linch King! That would be awesome!",NEUTRAL
"Jun 10, 2016",Awesome film.nobviously non of th she critics should be trusted. Never played the game. Had no expectations of this being a good film. Very surprised the story was captivating and the action was done right.,NEUTRAL
"Jun 10, 2016","Tries to do way too much, and the result is it's a confusing mess of characters with way too much exposition. The parts following orcs, and in particular Durotan, were actually pretty good even if their backstory was fuzzy. Any other race, but in particular the humans, is extraordinarily dull and even more confusing.

The effects on the orcs and for the magic were actually quite well done, but the backgrounds and some of the secondary creatures was less convincing, and almost plastic. The climax introduces two or three plot holes.

I was confused through most of this, as I felt I needed a manual in front of me to explain what was happening, and as a result I was bored. I really only cared about the one character, Durotan. Generally, it needed a more focused story. Some characters and locations appear, only to never appear again and thus contribute nothing to the story. My understanding is that those familiar with Warcraft lore can enjoy it despite it's flaws. Those like me who are unfamiliar with it, however, will be completely lost.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 10, 2016",Great CGI. Good movie. Story needs a little work,NEUTRAL
"Jun 10, 2016","If you played the games, you will laugh and cry and tear up with goosebumps. No doubt the last decade or two of Warcraft has been done justice to. 

What is really special is for those who have not experienced Warcraft before. I saw the movie with a large group of  Warcraft newbies (I estimate, based on laughs at inside jokes and references in the movie, that maybe only 25% of the theater were Warcraft vets), and there were claps at more than one point in the movie. My best friend was gripped with Garona's storyline, and surprised by the the many twists the movie took that were far from the typical ""good guy beats bad guy after a close call""  storylines you see today.

Beast measurement: tons of applause at the end. Including everyone I knew who had no background with Warcraft. 

I honestly don't understand what critics saw...",NEUTRAL
"Jun 10, 2016","Very much enjoyed this movie. Took a bit of effort to separate myself from my long-time, on-off love affair with WarCraft, but I'd say the movie is excellent for what it set out to do. That is, it did a great job at capturing the essence that was WarCraft: Orcs vs Humans - the first RTS game. Its certainly not up there with the likes of The Avengers or Winter Soldier, but WarCraft (hopefully) has a good start to a saga of films based in Azeroth. Will definitely get on BluRay, especially if there is a Director's Cut (there were certainly plenty of times the film felt like it was missing scenes).",NEUTRAL
"Jun 10, 2016","I'm picky about my Warcraft lore, and some people have no clue about the lore, so take those reviews with a grain of salt. Visually the movie is amazing. Seeing Stormwind, the Dark Portal, the tower of Karazhan, the (now floating) city of Dalaran on the big screen is a great experience. The Orcs are done very well considering that we are used to seeing them in cutscenes.

The plot moves quickly and might be a little hard to follow if you don't already know the characters, but they establish the basics to move forward. Most of the plot points are covered, though some are ret-conned to fit a more ""cinematic"" story. 

This is a decent movie that does the world it's set in justice, aside from the weird ret-conned plot points near the end. It makes me excited for more Warcraft stories to be adapted into movies in the future. My recommendation is to go and see it if you like Warcraft, so we can hopefully get more awesome stories onto that big screen.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 10, 2016","As a Wowzer, the movie was bearable and I look forward to seeing a sequel. As a moviegoer however, the movie was pathetic. Lack of narrative, lack of character development, lack of depth in plot, lack of proper editing, lack of everything.

Wowzer: 3/5
Movie fan: 2/5",NEUTRAL
"Jun 10, 2016",Loved it. It brought me back to Azeroth again.,NEUTRAL
"Jun 10, 2016","I went into this with an open mind. As an avid Warcraft player and WoW player, I thought I'd ignore the critics & propagandists and see it.

Unfortunately, I was disappointed, but I can't say I didn't expect it. Typically it follows the first war (warcraft 1) and does it with a pacing so fast you don't even learn character names until 20+ fucking minutes into the movie. Seriously it's one of the movies biggest issues; the pacing is all over the damn place. 

Let's talk about Action scenes and effects, because while the effects are pretty cool, the action scenes are a fucking joke. You have this big scary race invading your planet. They're gigantic, strong, and really bad at fighting. So bad that every scene is like watching the Orcs stumble into battle for the first time only to get their ass kicked in nearly EVERY scene-- even the last scene doesn't even attempt to make them look or feel intimidating at all, even in fighting (unless they're female Orcs, who happen to be much better at it then the majority of males in the army). There's a scene towards the end where Anduin has to fight.. I think Blackhand... and the fight is over in literally 5 seconds with Anduin one-shotting him. And all of the orcs are just like ""WOW HES SO COOL"" 
Fucking pathetic. You couldn't even make the big bad guys THREATENING.

What a joke... Adding to this glorified mess is the over-abundances of story-lines. Seriously it's one of the most confusing movies you'll ever watch because there's so many running plot-lines. It's a classic example of cramming WAY TOO MUCH into one movie! The orcs take over towns, by the way. Of course you never actually SEE any actual in-town fighting, or in-town takeovers, just off-screen stuff complete with a few random Arial shots of towns burning/smoking. Lame. 

Did I mention even the ""fel-infused"" orcs suck? They die in like one hit, and apparently mages can just instantly kill them, making them even LESS threatening then the non-infused ones. What the fuck. Fel made them untouchable in battle in the original warcraft storyline, and gave them even more incredible strength until its power declined. Oh yeah, and stormwind doesn't get destroyed. Way to puss out, Blizzard.

Are you a fan of Doomhammer? Well, Orgrim betrays his best friend, and apparently Garona enjoys fighting along side the humans, and hates wanting to kill King Llane, unlike the original storyline...  but why make Orgrim less likeable? what is the point. He is a fan-favorite orc and if you're going to change characters on a whim, why take a big shit on your fans and make him do something like that? You ruined him in WoD, you almost made the same mistake here but realized it towards the end. +0 points. Garona is apparently immune to being evil now, I guess because she's female. all of the female orcs in this are great, likeable characters who seem to share almost nothing in common with their male counterparts--it's just sloppy writing which hints at a narrative being pushed.

Is there anything I actually liked? well, I guess the humanizing of some of the Orcs was ok, but the designs they went with just seem... odd. They look more like Ogres then they do Orcs (being very fat instead of very muscular)

Regardless, if you like Orcs/Horde lore, you will most likely hate this movie. If you have no bias or you are biased to the alliance, this movie is for you.

"Jun 10, 2016","I'm incredibly surprised at all these scathing reviews of the film, from critics who literally never even watched the movie (yeah thats you Forbes).

And in all honesty I think more critics need to give this movie its due and stop jumping on this hate bandwagon just because its the popular thing to do. Never have I seen such a divide in opinion from the so called critics to the actual audience.

I've recommend this movie to everyone I know and the only flaw I they could find was it was a little fast paced. But considering all the movie events technically took place over several years in lore, that was understandable, and it was obviously the studio's plan to try this method to catchup the newer audiences to the sequel's, which I look forward to.",NEUTRAL

BUT as a person who has enjoyed Warcraft 1-3 and played WOW from Vanilla to Warlords of Draenor, I really enjoyed all the familiar places and attention to detail.  Right down to the different colored roofs in Stormwind.  I would have loved to see more Dwarfs, the characterization was funny and great!  Thank you for Travis Fimmel.",NEUTRAL

More importantly, it got my wife interested in learning a little more about the story of Warcraft, which I consider to be a big win.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 10, 2016","Made for fans of the series, but tries to include outsiders.  I think the only issue is that it's hard to portray the rich lore of Warcraft in a movie to people that have no idea what they're going into. The novelty doesn't wear off for those into the lore, and for those that aren't it's just another action fantasy.",NEUTRAL

It was not only not bad, as of now it is my favorite movie I've ever seen.  Sooooo Good.  I will go see it again tonight.  Lothar was amazing.  The orcs were amazing.  The mages were amazing.  Everything was amazing.  Please do not listen to the stuffy critics who bash this because it's not Harry Potter/Lord of the Rings(it's not supposed to be.  It's WARCRAFT!!)

"Jun 10, 2016","I loved it! This movie is so unique and stands apart from the rest, I enjoyed every moment. The only complaint I have is that throughout the beginning, the scenes do not last long because they switch very often. May be hard to follow for some if you're not paying attention as it's very fast paced... Gotta stay engaged! You can tell that Universal Pictures had cut out 40mins from the movie, and it makes it very obvious because it feels like something is missing. Either way it was a fun ride like no other and all my friends who didn't know anything about the world of Warcraft  loved it, and it was a perfect set up for a sequel/trilogy :)",NEUTRAL
"Jun 10, 2016","This movie has everything I wanted to see from a Warcraft movie. The characters were very well done and mostly true to the lore, Lothar was amazing, all the actors did a great job portraying their characters. 

I can see how people unfamiliar with the Warcraft universe might struggle with the plot and characters, because a lot of information is assumed. Then again, from a player of the games, I'm very happy they didn't waste time introducing characters and locations and plot, because I already know who everyone is based on their actions and armor, and I know where they are and why it's so important. For me, the plot moved along at a great pace and it never felt stale or contrived. The action was great, the CGI was amazing.

It's definitely a movie made for Warcraft fans, and it lived up to every expectation I had, and exceeded many of them.",NEUTRAL

"Jun 10, 2016","Warcraft actually was not that bad. I enjoyed it having been familiar with the series and some of the lore. 

It had a plot to follow. Characters and motivations that were logical  and believable. Great visuals. There were moments of humanity that made me have feels. There was a fair amount of humorous points. There a couple points where I was surprised and wow-ed. 

That being said it is incredibly easy to get lost in the movie and what is going on, some of the larger implications within the universe. If you aren't careful or get a bit distracted you can be misplaced in the story and be unsure of what the heck is going on.

"Jun 10, 2016","Warcraft's biggest issue was the amount of lore they are working with. The movie hit the ground running and just assumed the audience would know the characters. For a seasoned player it was no issue but we brought a few people that were new to the franchise and they felt lost and disconnected from the movie. The director spent no time developing the characters for a new audience and therefore people new to Warcraft had no emotional investment in the characters the rest of us have known for years. This is probably the reason for the critics panning the movie. This felt like more of a part of a movie than a stand-alone title, which is fine by me... I am ready for a Warcraft trilogy as long as the director takes some time to develop the characters more. Again, the director is in a tough spot: Either make the movie to canon and alienate an audience new to the franchise (as there is so much lore to explain) or bastardize the story and risk pissing off your core base of fans. It may have been a bit better to par down the info a bit as the pace of the movie was a bit too fast but all in all it was a decent movie. Much better than the terrible reviews the critics gave it.",NEUTRAL

"Jun 10, 2016","I loved this movie. Most big scene movies shy away from fantastical powers because they fear it might alienate the average person. Most super hero movies for example are turned way down low from the comics. Well not this movie. Magic is everywhere and it's the front and focus of it. Unlike some movies where Magic feels weak and it almost seems better to grab a sword or a gun, this movie made magic strong and powerful. The plot moved at a brisk pace which some people complain about, but I love. This was no Lord of the Rings were you spend 20 minutes on montages of people eating and walking. This was constant plot. You couldn't cut a single scene without losing something important. I also loved the fact that the movie was well lit, I was never complaining about shadows hiding things, and every battle was well lit with out SHAKEY CAM! I hate shakey cam. This movie was great.

"Jun 10, 2016","Went into the Warcraft movie with fairly low expectations. I thought it would be a 'seen the trailer seen the film' affair. It was so much more.

For those that don't know, there is a series of books/lore behind the game means there will and can be a lot of sequels. If you ever played wow or still play GO SEE THIS MOVIE.

"Jun 10, 2016","This movie is fan service, that is correct. So, whats wrong with it? There are millions Warcraft die hard people out there, they finally got something done for them and gaming community as a whole. Critics constantly compering it to Lord of the rings, How? You see any lords and rings in this movie? The plot is completely different! And don't get me started with Lothar being Aragorn copy. Again its different story.

Imagine this was realised before LOTR. Most reviewers out there would be confused with nothing to say? How many of you knew the characters from the Tolkien books and their story line before seeing the movie? 
Warcraft Is the new franchise and I'm hoping will do well enough so they can do sequels with more fun stories that happening later in the universe.

The CGI is spot on and in my opinion the best portrait of Orcs in the history of cinema, also casting spells and magic... Even LOTR did lousy job wit special effects showing magic   

The only faults in here are: 
-Pointless and rushed love plot. The movie would do just fine without it. With saved time they could have create more build up for next one with Thrall as a main hero, and forming of the alliance instead of 30 seconds given to the actual event.
- Working with less characters. It can be overwellming to deal with 8+ important main characters. 

Although for anyone that is familiar with the lore it was no problem with remembering the characters. All you have to do is read ONE 50 PAGES COMIC BOOK! to know whats going on. Or find on youtube great explanation of the story Nobbel87 ""The Story of Warcraft - Full Version [Lore]""

 Most people I know that watched the movie not knowing anything about universe, told me that they remember the faces rather that names, and its fine. Not perfect but its fine.

I loved it. I don't understand critics who review movies based on other movies that has nothing to do with the subject at hand. They sound like amateurs doing that. And good Critics actually are pointing out good story behind this movie which is not only about war and craft. Like well known and  respected Mark Kermode did. Go watch or hear what he has to say about it.

Go see it. Trust anonymous guy on the Internets, next one will be even better.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 10, 2016","This movie is based on the original RTS (Real Time Strategy) game Orcs and Humans.  Not the MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game) Wold of Warcraft. 

The CGI was the best I have ever seen. It was quite frankly groundbreaking. For a high fantasy film this needed to be top notch. I can assure you, got the job done. 

My only criticisms:

Character Development - I wish there was more time to flesh out the characters rich back stories. I would have liked to see how Gul'dan got his fel powers for example. 

 Length & Pacing - Warcraft is a massive universe with amazing stories. I felt this movie could have been longer. Doing so would have allowed for better pacing and more story. It was said that 40 or so minutes were cut from the film for the big screen. A directors cut of the Blu-ray release was teased should this be successful. 

All in all I'd give this film a 7 out of 10. If you like fantasy, action, and/or video games, don't let this one pass you by. If you have played any of the Warcraft games, including World of Warcraft, there are plenty of easter eggs to be seen! While this film is not perfect, It has all of the building blocks to become a great franchise on the big screen!",NEUTRAL

"Jun 10, 2016","Went to see this movie as an avid World of Warcraft player. The visual effects were stunning and exactly something you would expect from blizzard. Though the story fails to fully match the lore, from a movie stand point it's beautiful. Without spoiling the movie my only complaints are Gul'dan toying with some guy, a visual effect of a spell, and a sound in the movie wernt quite on the mark. 3 very minor details that don't last very long but are hard to miss. All around Warcraft, World of Warcraft, and book reading lore fans will love this movie. No movie can perfectly tell stories in books but it gets the point across. I highly anticipate a sequel and hope to see more races next time around. Lok'Tar Ogar!",NEUTRAL
"Jun 10, 2016","Although the plot is a bit confusing, it executed well in the end. The story focuses on so many main characters at once that it seems confusing and utterly frustrating. However each of the characters have their own roles to fulfill that are like small pieces of puzzle trying to form a huge meaningful canvas and in the end that canvas was not half bad. This movie is for everyone. You don't have to play Warcraft in order to understand the plot and what it is aiming for. It's just like any other fantasy movie but with orcs instead of Robert Downey's cheesy punchlines. For those that actually plays Warcraft, they get to experience their characters in a nice 3D movie that foretold their lores. For those who doesn't play Warcraft (Like me), they can still enjoy it without having no knowledge of the game whatsoever. I think Blizzard executed this so well, they aim for all audiences instead of just Warcraft players. 

For me it's a 6/10",NEUTRAL

I was really afraid when I saw that Blizzard made the film about a game. I remember the terrible movies of Uwe Boll and I believed that all films about games are failure. And when I saw this masterpiece I was suprised. It was awesome movie with interesting characters. I don't understand why critics hate Warcraft. Of course they are proffesionals but usual viewers and these critics are people and I don't understand why critics hate this film and viewers love this movie. Aaand I didn't find big mistakes. I really love this film, my friends love this film, youtubers mostly love this film, warcraft fans love this film BUT only critics hate this film. I think that it smells like bribe. This film was made for fans not for Oscar, not for critics. It was made with love by fans for fans and for new viewers who will become new fans of this universe.

"Jun 10, 2016","Personally I say ignore the critics.
What I saw I liked, not gonna say the movie is perfect but it is far better than what the critics make it out to be.

Being versed in the lore of the games it was quite refreshing to see an adaptation that catered more to the fans more than to the general public. But that's not to say those who are unfamiliar with the franchise will be unable to enjoy the film.

The film also doesn't baby the audience with explaining what the world is or how it works, it explains only what is needed and trusts the audience the be smart enough to figure out the rest as it goes.

"Jun 5, 2016","Look I had literally no expectations for this thing and I was still disappointed with it. It's worst sin of all is that it thinks you should already know everything about this world and its lore and I had not a single idea about anything in this world and I was so confused throughout the entirety of it. I thought that I would be fine because I figured it would explain everything that's going on, but no. I was lost from the start and barely knew what was going on all the way until the end. Its overstuffed and crowded to a point where I thought about turning it off because I was so lost. It's visually stunning and wonderful to look at but all that can't compensate for an extremely underdeveloped plot, thin characters i didn't care about and a terribly written, confusing script. It's not as horrifically awful as I had feared, but I still didn't like it at all. The acting is wooden and laughably bad, along with its thinly written characters that I didn't care one bit for and it's waste of a talented director. This one just wasn't for me at all.",NEUTRAL

"Jun 5, 2016","I watched Warcraft movie a couple of days ago and I gotta say, it is a mixed bag.

It is much better than I thought it would be, but it ain't fantastic either.
The cgi, voice acting and animation on the orcs are really good. As someone who have played the games there where plenty of locations, characters and other things in the background that I recognized. The weakest thing in this movie is the human actors, some of them are fine, but there are a lot of hammy/cheesy acting. 

I feel it would have been better if this was a fully animated movie, considering the great job they did on the orcs.

Story wise it is very mixed. They changed/redconed a lot of things from the original story, some characters where just added to give an emotional response and some plot points are completely unexplained. I only knew what was going on because I knew the original story, but I think some events might get people to say ""where did that come from?""

That being said, I do think it is a good movie and one of the best video game movies to date.

I think for people who have played the games and know the story it is an 7/10.

"Jun 5, 2016","I went to see Warcraft with my girlfriend; we had totally different perspectives on the source material when watching this film. She could not be less into computer games, especially World of Warcraft, which I have tried and failed to get her addicted to as I was. I however am a complete nerd and knew all of the lore, and I mean all of it, before even going into the cinema. We both loved it. The style of the cgi, the story, the fights, the actors, everything! We both say totally engrossed for two hours, me nerding out massively, her jumping and laughing and experiencing the sadness as the story played out. Duncan Jones has done a fantastic job at adapting the source material, which is especially good when you consider that said source consisted of a computer game with let's say not quite the deepest of plot lines! I would say it is the best 3D film and computer game adaptation I have seen to date, and both my girlfriend and I cant wait until the next one comes out! 
Oh and just as a side point, at the time of writing this review the film had a poor review rating on rotten tomatoes. In response I would say look at who has given the poor reviews and look who's given it what it is rightfully due in my opinion. This kind of film needs and open mind in order for you to enjoy it, and it's definitely safe to say that the people who have reviewed it poorly have not given the time and thoughtful approach that this film deserves, much to their own loss.",NEUTRAL

The first half of the movie felt as though I was meant to know who these characters were without much introduction. As a result I never truly got to know them so couldn't truly care for the fate of these characters. However the final third when the magic was ramping up and the 'bad guys' were showing their power a switch flicked in me and I really got engaged with the action and hint of politics in the background and it left me really wanting more. I just hope that the open ended finale doesn't come back and bite them in the ass.

"Jun 5, 2016","*Spoiler alert ahead - Proceed with caution*

Maybe you have to have played this game to appreciate everything this film offers. Having read the more negative reviews, it seems a lot of people simply didn't appreciate the things I did which made the whole film incredibly enjoyable for me.

Perfect story to do as a 'Beginning' . The orcs first foot into Azeroth. They were one of the four first horde races when World of Warcraft came out and Orgrimmar is the main horde city, so it's a pretty relevant to hear their story as world history goes..
They did have to cram a lot and jump the story along a fair bit so it did seem to move along at a canter but they did have a dark titan forcing things along from the sidelines I guess and it was all about WAR!
 However, if you want to fill in the gaps - wowwiki is the best place lol 
There's so so much lore!  and so many influences and sides affecting each story. It's like Lord of the Rings. 
The story isnt as rich without the books and appendices.

 Medihv transforming into Sargeras was a great moment, hinting at a larger story.
 Not sure they actually mentioned the name in film and was the old lady Aewgynn, Medihvs mother?
 Sargeras - he's the key to it all, the reason behind everything.
Sargeras-corruption- destruction- death. Orcs had no chance ;/ 

 LOVED the use of polymorph and teleport. 
-  Teleport spell ( for non gamers) is a mage class spell.. in game was a very lucrative trade skill.  Players could make a decent ingame living selling teleports back in vanilla and mages always got a spot in party for their polymorph ability. 
 The teleport was so nicely done from the runes to the pop! The flower to Garona maybe a hint of a relationship? In some lore they have an affair and a child.

- Kharazan, Ironforge, Stormwind and the beautiful floating Dalaran were just a sharp inhale from me when i saw them onscreen . So impressive in game flying over as a player and looked equally so on screen. Very exciting to see!
They were spot on with the geography.

- Orcs and their armour was so beautifully rendered. Each one had its own personality. CG didn't bother me as much and it usually does. The orcs fell or otherwise looked unbelievable, the detail astounding. The dire wolves - omg, so well done. 
I also appreciated all the weaponry. A lot of makers put blood sweat tears and huge pufs of love into those items and it showed. That little dagger of Garonas was stunning! 
Like I did ingame, I loved all the little details - the rings on Durotan's teeth, the library books at kharazan, the town square in Stormwind.

The effects of magic use look exactly how i'd imagine is I could cast Lightning Storm or Fireball. Equally Gul'dans necromantic magic was horrific but so nicely done.
The fel changes to the orcs, their bloodlust was so creative - Blackhand's especially.

Nice little touches with the murloc getting a cameo and the gryphon coming into land at Stormwind flightpath.

i hope that there is ultimately a positive reaction to this film - It would be amazing if they made another. The lore is abundant with such great story arcs - Sunwell and Kiljaden!! Can you imagine The Isle of Quel'danas and all the bloodelves. Shiny!
Well done to the cast who despite the great amount of CGI involved managed to keep it real and to Duncan Jones who obvioulsy raids - amazing job! You did justice to the game and made an awesome film!

going to see again! looking for mechanical harvester golems that are apparently in the fields. woooot! :D
5/5 from me!!",NEUTRAL
"Jun 5, 2016","If you haven't heard of Warcraft or played the games before you won't like it, but if you did it - was amazing. It was better than I expected and had a nice ending hinting towards a second movie, I hope they go ahead and do another one. That's what I like about it, it was made for the people who asked for it for the last 10 years, they didnt ruined it by casting Megan Fox, The Rock or any other of the ""blockbuster"" actors so they can attract new audience and all the actors in the movie  did a great job. That;s why the critics slam it and the audiences love it.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 5, 2016","Two hours of harmless nonsense, but far from a waste of time. Gritty and gripping it ain't, but it's well cast and perfectly paced so there's never a dull moment.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 5, 2016","Does this movie have flaws? Yes.
Is it better than most movies out right now? Hell yes.
A powerful story involving two opposing forces working together to overthrow an evil leader, with a love affair, badass monsters, and more.
The movie shows us Night Elves, Dwarves, Humans, Draenai, and even griffons!
Stop comparing this movie to others and let your mind go in the fantasy, and you will have and good time.
First time in a LOOONG time that I walked out of the theatre (let alone even go in) happy with the message and story of a movie.
Definitely a 8/10 or 4/5 for sure.
Paid critics are the worst, ignore them and make your own opinions.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 5, 2016",I'm a big fan of warcraft it touched me when I was a child. I remember playing warcraft 2 with my big brother. Ever since then I've kept up with the story and read several books especially pertaining to the beggining. As a fan I think there is much needed improvement. The movie ran too fast and literally took two books worth of information and shoved it into one film. This was hard to swallow and I really want this movie to succeed. You can tell this movie was made with love and it really wanted you to connect with the characters. However I believe to effectively do this more time should of been spent on prepping the movie to open up these big events. However understanding that there may not be enough time or maybe there was too much pressure in cramming it all together. As a fan I accept that as much as I wanted this movie for me I believe it is more directed towards those who don't know and love the franchise. I hope people like this movie and I personally want to stand behind to hope for more developed and enticing movies just as blizzard has done with their books and video game story and lore.,NEUTRAL

"Jun 4, 2016",Loved it. Although it did seem a bit rushed in the beginning.  I would have liked to have seen a bit more of Durotan and what led up to going through the portal.,NEUTRAL
"Jun 4, 2016","Wow, this was the best movie I have ever seeing!!! 
Don't let all these stupid kids that didn't even play the game rating it low because they are stupid and can't understand the beautiful plot of Warcraft. 

I have played all Warcraft games since Warcraft II, but even if I didn't have played them all I would still have enjoyed this movie. If you like The Lord of The Rings, then you will feel in love with Warcraft movie.

There are plenty of action scenes and amazing CGA's and especial effects, probably the best ones up to the time of this review.

This movie is definitely a 5 STARS movie and deserves to win many Oscars. Remember, people that are rating it low are simply ignorants that are trying to fit in the Warcraft community, but they can't simply because they suck. So they try to blame it on the movie, or on anyone else but themselves for their lack of knowledge and appreciation of an EPIC movie.",NEUTRAL

"Jun 4, 2016","This movie was refreshing to the time of release because it isn't a damn superhero film. The CGI was the arguably the best thing along with the beautiful acting, the characters were gorgeous and I adore the creation of them, everything flows astonishingly well although the scenes in the trailer (obviously) didn't seem as epic as they did in the trailer which led up to a minor disappointment. As someone who isn't a World of War craft (Video Game) I understood this very well, the lore does take up what seems to be the first quarter and although felt slightly dragged was told marvelously.",NEUTRAL

"Jun 4, 2016","Pelicula sin alma, rutinaria, con exceso de efectos digitales, violenta pero sin sangre, y con actores tirando a mediocres.

"Jun 4, 2016","is a good movie, do not know if and why I am a player of World of Warcraft, but the movie is very good, have commented on not much appear the other races, or the lack of information however, is how the original story and all It will be resolved in the upcoming sequels I believe",NEUTRAL
"Jun 4, 2016","Great movie and very enjoyable, i heard that 40 minutes were cut from the movie and will be saved for the DVD release, i think some parts could have done with a little bit more background info. The pacing is a little off but i think thats mainly due to the 40 minutes that were cut, all in all it was very enjoyable and i hope the movie does well enough to see a sequel! Alot of critics are comparing it to LoTR and the main character being compared to Aragorn even though they do not share any similarities what-so-ever, the CGI was very good especially on the orcs.
Even if you dont like World of Warcraft or never heard of it its still a good watch and ill be definitely picking up the extended edition if it gets released!",NEUTRAL

"Jun 4, 2016","I don't think this is a bad film. Being a hard-core fan from the games (WC 2 & 3) and played WOW for couple of years, I really love the film. Perhaps, the changes they made in the film was too drastic (I especially hate how they portrayed Medivh in the film) so many people felt off about it. If there is no future for a next WC film, I really hope someone would pick it up and made it into series. Netflix, HBO or something... please!!!",NEUTRAL
"Jun 4, 2016","What is happening says more about critics then the movie itself. Don't expect them to be able to tell a masterpiece from garbage, they never did.
Need to jog your memory? Here's a list of movies that critics bashed upon release, I'll leave the conclusions to you:

- *Citizen Kane* - ""I thought the photography quite good, but nothing to write to Moscow about, the acting middling, and the whole thing a little dull...""
- *Psycho* - ""Gimmicky""
- *Metropolis* - ""It is a technical marvel with feet of clay, a picture as soulless as the manufactured woman of its story. [...] despite the fantastic nature of the story, it is, on the whole, unconvincing""
- *2001 - A Space Odissey* - ""sluggish, pretentious and artsy fartsy
- *The Shining* - ""the adaptation makes little sense"", ""massacres the original vision set forth in king's novel"" (it even received 2 razzies nomination for worst director and worst actor)
- *Apocalypse Now* - ""Apocalypse Now is a dumb movie that could have been made only by an intelligent and talented man.""
- *All about Eve* - ""Its highly polished, often witty surface hides an unenterprising plot and some preposterous human behavior.""
- *The Wizard of Oz* - ""I sat cringing before [...] The Wizard of Oz, which displays no trace of imagination, good taste, or ingenuity...[...] I say it's a stinkeroo.""
- *The Godfather II* - ""It's a Frankenstein's monster stitched together from leftover parts. It talks. It moves in fits and starts but it has no mind of its own.""
- *The Big Lebowski* - ""meandering, pointless, amounts to nothing""
- *Fight Club* - ""Rebel without a cause""
- *Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas* - ""simply unwatchable""

other honorable mentions:
- Blade Runner
- The Rocky Horror Picture Show

AND.... (drum roll)

- *STAR WARS* (1977) -
""I sincerely hope that science and scientists differ from science fiction and its practitioners. Heaven help us if they don't: We may be headed for a very boring world indeed. Strip Star Wars of its often striking images and its high-falutin scientific jargon, and you get a story, characters, and dialogue of overwhelming banality, without even a ""future"" cast to them."" [...] ""O dull new world! We are treated to a galactic civil war, assorted heroes and villains, a princely maiden in distress, a splendid old man surviving from an extinct order of knights who possessed a mysterious power called ""the Force,"" and it is all as exciting as last year's weather reports.... Why, even the most exciting fight is an old-fashioned duel, for all that the swords have laser beams for blades....""

I think this can be enough to get the idea, now go watch the movie and decide for yourself.

As a side note, I can see how those who are not familiar with the saga universe could fail in grasping its value, and could feel bewildered, and could scorn it as ""random bullshit"", but that's not the case, quite the opposite, Duncan knows what he's doing.
For those unfamiliar with it, you need to know that the Warcraft games are a kitsch mishmash of Tolkien, Dungeons & Dragons, everything that's fantasy and sci fi and comics...you name it. All with really exaggerated and over the top aesthetics. Nonetheless it has some ""magic"" quality that hooked million of us and made us dream. So no point in complaining about the ""unrealistic armors"" or the ""derivative"" nature of it and other stuff like that. That's Warcraft, and Duncan nailed it with astonishing skill.
I also believe the two really dense hours of running time are not enough to clear the nature of what is being presented (characters and motives) to newbies. What you can see as newcomers is just a glimpse of what's coming, but if you can trust the director, you're gonna enjoy it (I suspect that the 40 mins of footage that were cut out could help newcomers even more).

Warcraft is not perfect, it has flaws (like many movies we now regard as masterpieces), but it is an impressive piece of work, it's innovative, it has a soul, it's hugely fun. It's clearly just a setup for what's coming next, and I can't wait to see the rest.

btw... extended edition now!!! ;)",NEUTRAL

"Jun 4, 2016","Fuck you CRITICS! This movie 10/10 
No play Warcraft? NO CRITIC THIS MOVIE!",NEUTRAL
"Jun 4, 2016","Is this the movie that breaks the videogame-movie curse? YES.
Granted, it has not the best reviews from the critics, we'll get to that later, but it is the very first videogame movie that understands the franchise, knows what made good the games, and does a really beautiful job bringing it to the big screen, with a more realistic tone, but maintaining the ""exaggerated comic-look"" of the games. 

As a fan, the attention that they've got in the details is something to praise, I have never seen a movie where I was fascinated in almost every shot, because I saw this location, or this character in the background that it's not important in the movie but in the lore it is, this legendary weapon and, of course, this murloc.
Aside of that, it's a really solid movie. Easy, not the most intrincate plot (tough it has its twists and it is a really good story), pacing problems (40min were cut, hopfully we'll get that in a blu ray release), and flat characters, but that's not a bad thing, it's something that works for the movie, and again, for the franchise. And those are really good characters that you'll love, specially the orcs Durotan and Orgrim.

Visually, what Duncan and his crew did is something you have never seen, even more advanced stuff than Jungle Book in my opinion, and this makes this fantasy characters called orcs alive and believable.
Why then it has recieved so many bad reviews? I guess that it's because it's a really polarizing movie. The movie is what it is, it has its genere, it has its tone, and if you don't buy that there are this creatures called orcs, that there is this femle half-orc half-human, that humans can cast spells out of their hands, and that there are flying gryphons, you are absolutely not going to like this movie, not because it is a bad movie, but because it's not your cup of tea, same way I would'nt like any horror movie as good as it may be, because I don't like the genere.

To sum it up, this is a movie that if you ever liked warcraft you absolutely want to see, and if you like fantasy or war movies, you'll definetly have to check it out.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 4, 2016","As a fan of the Warcraft franchise I am biased; although it makes me aware of the cliché plot of the games and their esthetics and tone.

Taking that into consideration I thought this movie to be a good adaptation of the source material and a nice setup of the Warcraft universe.

The exposition is often clumsy, but it gets the job done of explaining the background of magic and fantasy;. some of the dialogue is pretty bad, but in general it doesn't remove from the experience. I quite liked the way the the different languages spoken by orcs and humans were handled.

I found the CGI immersive and the interactions between animated orcs and real-life humans convincing. The scenery is great and the fight scenes are great fun to watch.

In the end I hope we get more of this, as it was a very enjoyable experience, despite its flaws (which in part were due to having to set-up the story and won't be as important in a hypothetical sequel).",NEUTRAL
"Jun 4, 2016","Warcraft had massive expectations to be the first good video game adaptation. Whilst it could've been better, the result is actually an enjoyable fantasy flick. Some of the lore is explained, some are more ambiguous to those who aren't familiar with the world of Azeroth. The visual effects are outstanding, however the acting is so-so. Having never played the game, I can say this is a good entry for what could be a big franchise.",NEUTRAL

I know nothing of the game as i've never played it, so not sure whether being a fan of the game would have helped me through the first half better?
The second half was good fun, lots of action, beautiful visuals, and incredible sound! Felt like a homage to George RR Martin in places, in that certain outcomes were rather unexpected.
Cast was kinda interesting, Dominic Cooper was really miscast, he was the weakest element of the film for me. 
Overall, very much flawed, but i still enjoyed it. It certainly is the first part of a bigger story, so i hope it does well enough for a sequel!",NEUTRAL
