"Feb 27, 2024","The movie is constantly turning fantasy conventions on their head (the ""chosen one"" is a baby girl, but the ""chosen one"" is basically a McGuffin, the title character/central hero of the story would typically be a sidekick, Kilmer would typically be the hero but he's the sidekick, etc.) While its visuals have held up remarkably well.",NEUTRAL

"Dec 6, 2023",One of the classic childhood fairytale memories. First Val Kilmer movie I saw.,NEUTRAL
"Dec 5, 2023","It's Solid. I can see why someone would be really nostalgic for this if they grew up with it but also it's well done to boot. Warwick is the best thing and is likeable and charming. Everyone else does a solid job also. Kilmer can be a little weird and out of place every now and than but he eventually comes around and settles down and the two little guys can be a bit annoying also as the comedic relief. The villian isn't bad but I wish there was more focus and interaction between her and our heroes throughout besides the end. The music and cinematography are really good and are the highlight. There is amazing sweeping shots and really good effects throughout of all varieties. Sometimes it can be a little shotty but overally they are really clean. The editing and pacing are solid too. This can start a bit slow but once the action starts it's thrilling and a lot of fun. The main issue that holds this back from standing with contemporaries like The Princess Bride is it is VERY cheesy, senimental, and campy at times in the acting and over the top moments. Which are fun still. On paper this should'nt work as well as it does, but the overloading of charm and passion shines through. You can feel the love in making this and its chessiness is what gives it it's own identity. Also, I do wish there was perhaps a bit more characters besides Kilmer and Warwick to flesh out the adventure a bit more. If I was a kid watching this I'd probably love this a lot more which this is clearly aimed at. As it stands anyone who loves adventures, fantasies, any actors in this, the director, or grew up with this should check this out.",NEUTRAL
"Nov 2, 2023","Fun to see George Lucas' style on another movie! Yes the storyline is ‚Äògeneric' and doesn't say much below the surface level, but it's a solid story that is easy to watch. The winning aspect of this movie is the loveable characters, they draw you in and are easy to root for.",NEUTRAL
"Sep 6, 2023","Some magical beings show up at times with no explanation, but that doesn't stop this from being a really fun movie. Warwick Davis and Val Kilmer are hilarious together.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 25, 2023","Slowish and taking itself a little too seriously, like most fantasy of its period, but entertaining.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 12, 2023","Willow more like Willno, it's alright I guess",NEUTRAL

The angel was spectacular. 

It was a bit long but it's a really good story.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 17, 2023","Ron Howard's finest Work in my opinion. A PERFECT Fantasy Adventure. I love how Willow's friend Migosh stayed with Willow, when everyone else from his Village would not. A good lesson in Loyalty and courage, seen it several times and I'll see it MANY more!",NEUTRAL
"Jul 16, 2023","Willow had a budget of 35 million dollars and since its release, it has made a portion of that back.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 4, 2023","4.5 is probably more than this movie strictly deserves, but I'm a sucker for the fantasy genre and Val Kilmer was so infectiously likable that I had to give it another .5 stars.",NEUTRAL

"May 25, 2023",This is an amazing classic I overlooked for far too long,NEUTRAL
"May 24, 2023","Fun fantasy fluff. The characters aren't deep, and the plot isn't complicated, but it has nice sets/costumes/effects for its time...and is just fun! If you want a fantasy that doesn't get ""too dark"" or Too nerdy"" this is just right.",NEUTRAL
"May 24, 2023",THIS MOVIE FREAKED ME OUT AS A KID AND YET I STILL LOVE IT.,NEUTRAL
"May 21, 2023","Willow wasn't one of Ron Howard's biggest critical darlings but it did grow enough of a fan base in the last 35 years as far as fantasy-adventure pictures are concerned This was a big deal for vertically challenged actors and allowed Warwick Davis to get his first starring role ever since he started out in Star Wars Taking place in a magical land run by evil Queen Bavmorda she tries to kill a young baby destined to overthrow her The baby's mother dies and the mid wife smuggles the child out to safety but is lost in the river The child ends up in the hands of a small man named Willow Willow lives in his dwarf village with a family and many others He's an aspiring magician hoping to master his skills and he finds out the secret of the baby and her importance Willow is then set on a quest to deliver the child to a powerful enchantress and hopefully defeat the queen with the help of a wand The queen's daughter Sorsha is tasked to hunt the child down, while Willow runs into a disaffected warrior named Madmartigan Willow still has to master his skills so he's not the best at it, he even accidentally casts a love spell over Madmartigan which of course causes a hilarious rift between him and Sorsha The film is steeped deep in fantasy with witches, fairies and dragons The pacing is pretty lackluster in this as it doesn't follow its own urgency At best the plot is generic as it's been done better But it's nice to watch Warwick Davis and Val Kilmer bounce off each other The effects aren't spectacular but fit with a fantasy film of this caliber There's nice character designs and it'll provide escapism for kids seeking a sword-and-sorcery diversion 'Willow' and its sequel tv series has a charming hokey ness to it all and make high fantasy goofy",NEUTRAL
"Apr 29, 2023",A wonderful adventure with heart. It was great sharing this with my own children.,NEUTRAL
"Apr 27, 2023","This is one of those movies  which pulls off the Gilbert and Sullivan trick of subverting the form whilst reinforcing it. 

Yes the overall story is quote unquote ""Generic"",  but its the performances that really bring this story to life.  Val Kilmer brings the lovable rogue Madmartigan to life, whilst Warrick Davies (with hair !!) plays the eponymous hero with great enthusiasm and energy that was lacking in the reboot. 

In a 'generic' retelling it would have been Madmartigan who was the main character rather than the sidekick,  but subverting the form by having that role go to someone who would normally serve as the Hero's conscience (in effect Davies plays both roles) brilliantly subverts the form and reinforces it at the time. 

It plays well to Tolkien's view that it is the small things that enable us to resist great evil. Yes the CGI is laughable by 21st Century standards but it works well with the a great cast who really brought the story to laugh.",NEUTRAL
"Apr 19, 2023","Fun movie. A not too serious fantasy from 1988, so don't expect it to be anything near as good as a movie from 10-20 years later. However it's still enjoyable and funny. 

Modern critics on this site panned it for stealing from Harry Potter, apparently they don't know that this came out before Harry Potter was published. I'm not sure how one can be a professional critic without even knowing the dates that major influential works were published, it voids any review they give on an older work. 

It would be like accusing Dune of stealing from Star Wars or Lord of the Rings of stealing from Harry Potter, you just sound incredibly uninformed when you do that.",NEUTRAL
"Apr 17, 2023","Great movie, probably not good reviews because too many morons that only like super cheezy and generic movies rate things here.  I guess I have to start reviewing or be at the mercy of idiots.",NEUTRAL

"Mar 11, 2023","Willow no est√° mal, es una pel√≠cula bastante entretenida, aunque siendo un film de fantas√≠a, hubiera quedado m√°s atractiva con m√°s efectos especiales, aunque los que se ven aqu√≠ son aceptables. La historia est√° buena, la banda sonora tambi√©n y el elenco. Val Kilmer es lo mejor de la cinta con su personaje bien descarado y divertido a la vez. El protagonista Willow es algo torpe, lo cual hace dif√≠cil que √©l tenga que ser el h√©roe de la historia, pero es un personaje entra√±able y merec√≠a ser aprovechado al m√°ximo. No puedo decir que Willow es una de las mejores pel√≠culas de fantas√≠a que existen, pero es un cl√°sico de culto interesante para los amantes de la fantas√≠a. Mi calificaci√≥n final para esta cinta es un 8/10.",NEUTRAL

"Feb 24, 2023",Great movie. I just watched it with my eight year old and told him how I watched it when I was eight years old. We both loved it. Sad that they made such a horrible sequel last year but the original was just brilliant.,NEUTRAL
"Feb 9, 2023","So I watch this film for the first time, and it is corny as can be. I thought it was just a corny, lovable film, it has a lot of depth and a lot of entertaining moment. But it has a lot of corniness and cheesy aspects of the film. It's a film that I would watch ones which I did, and I probably would never watch again. It's not a bad movie. It's just not enjoyable all the way through.",NEUTRAL

"Feb 6, 2023","A great classic which I've seen many times.  But it's not perfect.  As the two Brownies can be very annoying.  Plus some of the effects are good but not perfect, lastly some shit humor.  Which I can always do without.  But like I said, it is a classic and worth checking out.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 2, 2023","Ah, 80's fantasy movies, how one can not love them? But let us not be blinded by our nostalgia for that kind of movies (which is currently strongly on the rise), let us see ""Willow"" for what it is. I've seen it recently for the first time, so I have no nostalgia for it and can judge it without that nostalgia. And what I see without it is a movie that is quite strange. And by that I don't mean Jim Henson strange, like in ""otherworldly"", but that it is all over the place ‚Äì inconsistent in themes, in pacing, in character design... Sometimes it is hard to grasp what was the intention of a given scene, even when you know what precedes it and what comes after it. It seems like this movie was directed by three different persons, it really does. But it is not devoid of charm and the production design is also at least acceptable. It didn't bore me, so that's a plus. But there are far better 80's fantasy movies than this one. Shame I've already seen them all...",NEUTRAL
"Feb 1, 2023","Great Fantasy. Greater than the Tv Show for sure. The Tv Show really disappoints on numerous amount of times and levels. This was straight fun, fantastical,  magical, and actually made with love and care. The Tv Show was made for the bants.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 1, 2023",This is just another example of why the film industry and the audience are completely on opposite sides of what a good film actually is. With a smash of 52% from critics and like 90% from audiences. This film is amazing! Subtle and exciting! The kind of movie people get married to each other after it's over! There was something about George Lucas in the 80's. He made movies like you were reading the book. Directors try to hard or focus too much on unimportant things and forget about the plot and characters. Stick to the feel and story stop making things to surprise us. People want purpose and good writing like Willow the first one not the other one.,NEUTRAL
"Jan 31, 2023",The writing and music will absolutely date this. Rule of thumb is never put modern music in a show that supposed to be set in a fantasy setting. Definitely feels more like you're watching an older sci fi fantasy like hercules or xena than an epic adventure.,NEUTRAL
"Jan 30, 2023","I grew up watching this movie and I still love it as an adult. It's a wonderful blend of humor, action, and adventure, with plenty of heart, imagination, and an amazing musical score. Warwick Davis and Val Kilmer are both great in their roles, and the special effects are still impressive to this day.  It's one of my favorite movies of all time!",NEUTRAL

"Jan 21, 2023","A fun movie that still has that 80's charm because of good acting. directing and script.

If you want to know if something is good, look at the audience score and ignore ""professional"" critics.",NEUTRAL
"Jan 18, 2023","Watched it for the second time, since i forgot what it was about, and enjoyed it sososososo much! It's so funny and quirky and just not your typical fantasy movie. I can't see all those LotR copies anymore! Really suggest everyone to watch it",NEUTRAL

"Jan 17, 2023","Nice fresh fantasy show, it's modernity is visible but it really enhances the all show without being out of place. The relationship between Kit and Jade feels real and in line with the story. The finale had a nice twist and I hope for more seasons.",NEUTRAL
"Jan 16, 2023",A redone classic. I love it the more I saw. The character all had a good back story that kept me excited. I wanted the hero's to do good and didn't want to see any die off. I loved the whole journey through the season. I really like the wardrobe and weaponry. I thought it was hilarious at moments and magical when needed. I loved the original movie I probably watched it every day as a kid and I'm very excited to see more of my childhood favorite and I think with this newer aged take my kids will now enjoy it as well. I'm very excited to see my favorite actor Warwick Davis be a yet another fantasy genre movie. I always say you can't make a good fantasy movie with him in it.,NEUTRAL

"Jan 8, 2023","Overall, the decade-old picture Legend from the fantasy genre is equally as influential as Willow is now. It laid the way for subsequent fantasy epics and is a more than respectable movie on its own. It's definitely worth a look for any genre enthusiasts.",NEUTRAL

"Jan 7, 2023","Willow is a good example of why you shouldn't listen to movie ""Critics"".",NEUTRAL
"Jan 7, 2023","Now I don't think Willow is the best fantasy film ever made(a three way-toss up between Pan's Labyrinth, Edward Scissorhands and The NeverEnding Story) nor is it the worst(Dungeons & Dragons). It does have problems, but I thought it was entertaining.

My first problem is Warwick Davis, now his title character is a very charming and likable character, but Davis's performance is somewhat uneven. At first it is uncomfortable and bland, then as the film progressed he got better as we got to know the character better. Another problem is that the special effects are a little dated especially the beast with the two heads. My final flaw is that there are one or two scenes in the middle half that felt a little forced.

However, thanks to a quirky, funny and honest script, it is actually entertaining. You may argue that the film is too long, and that the plot is unoriginal and formulaic, but the film does move quickly and a lot happens. The scenery, cinematography and costumes are also really nice to look at, maybe not as stunning as other fantasy films such as the Lord of the Rings movies, NeverEnding Story or Legend(which has one of the most exquisitely rendered forest sets I have ever seen on it) but it at least looks nice. The score by James Horner is also really pleasant though Horner has done better(I still bawl at the main theme for The Land Before Time), the main theme is definitely memorable and is surprisingly not generic. The direction from Ron Howard is good, and the acting is decent as they bring alive somewhat interesting characters. Davis is uneven as I have said already, but Joanne Whalley is alluring as Sorscha, while Val Kilmer does really well in a flashier and darker role with some good lines. Rool and Franjean are the funniest characters, and it is a delight to see Billy Barty again. However, Jean Marsh steals the show as Queen Bavmorda, her performance is the epitome of sheer evil.

Overall, flawed but decent fantasy film with some interesting elements. 7/10 Bethany Cox",NEUTRAL

There are some very funny moments between the characters that made me burst out laughing. I see it more as a comedy in a fantasy world. I'm not analytical about this particular movie, I just know that I had fun watching it, and that's what counts.

"Jun 18, 2013","An unexpected hero must find the fortitude to protect an innocent child from falling in to the clutches of the evil Queen Bavmorda in the fantasy adventure WILLOW, from 1988. Ron Howard directs based on a story by George Lucas, which centers around the unassured dwarf, Willow, as he selflessly crosses miles of treacherous terrain and faces countless foes with the aid of a few unlikely allies. Despite his small stature, Warwick Davis becomes the embodiment of strength and courage as his journey transforms him into an honest hero. Val Kilmer stars beside him as the loud-mouthed thief, Madmartigan, who is given the chance to betray his instincts and fight for good. He is enjoyable, as well, if not overly eccentric. It is Jean Marsh that steals every scene, however, as Queen Bavmorda, the center of evil and corruption in this otherwise peaceful world. She is more frightening than any of the disfigured monsters that roam her wretched kingdom. The path to Tir Asleen presents many dangers, which are brought to life through the creative costuming by Barbara Lane and Industrial Light and Magic's Oscar-nominated effects. Each of the stunning exteriors transport us to a mystical world where these things can truly exist. WILLOW is undoubtedly a classic in the genre, and one that is filled with fantasy, adventure, and heart.

"Jun 12, 2013","3: It's amazing how much one can forget about films they saw years and years ago.  Much of Willow seemed pretty new to me, which I suppose isn't that surprising as it's possible I haven't seen it in about 25 years.  I may have only seen it once though, so despite the fact I remember enjoying it, it didn't stick with me apart from an illusory concept of a fantastical film in a world not entirely unlike that of LOTR, The Labyrinth, or The Neverending Story.  It is very 80's.  Ridiculously so.  It always blows my mind when people speak of the 80s as a great decade for film.  It is more of a black hole with a few bright spots for me, but I can of course understand and appreciate why many fondly recall what they grew up with.  Interesting film that has held up pretty well over the years even if it will always remain firmly planted in 1988 (i.e. it is does not have the sort of timeless quality that some of the best pictures do).",NEUTRAL

"Mar 19, 2013","There was no greater decade for fantasy films than the 80's, and Willow still holds up as one of the best!  Ron Howard really started to show what a brilliant director he'd become with this flick.  It does borrow a few elements from Lord of the Rings, the first act is a little too long, and it's always predictable...but Willow remains such a great, and well-deserved, classic thanks to the performances and amazing locations.  Okay, and it has awesome action and effects too.  Warwick Davis carries the movie extremely well, Val Kilmer still acts like he gave a shit about the movies he was in, and Jean March is just the perfect villain for these types of movies (still terrifying in Return to Oz).  Willow is one of the few movies that's just as good, if not better, than you remembered as a kid.  And if you get the chance to see Willow on Blu-Ray you'll be blown away.

For all it's faults, Willow makes the attempt at taking us down a path that isn't full of explosions and non-stop action, and attempts a journey driven by story and enhanced by cgi, rather than relying only on effects. Perhaps it fails in many of its attempts... but I'll take that any day over the every day dross pushed out by the current hollywood, the 5 minute action packed blockbusters that stand on their effects and hope no one notices the lack of acting and plot.",NEUTRAL

An hour 20 minutes to go and NO DRAGONS?!? Who made this movie??? That is one expressive baby, tho.

"Apr 29, 2012","Willow is a movie that really gets overshadowed by other much better Fantasy films of the 80's (The Princess Bride, Labyrinth) but still manages to be a fun gem of a Sword and Sorcery movie. 
 
This movie follows a Nelwyn (Dwarf) sorcerer-in-training named Willow Ufgood (Warwick Davis) who is tasked in protecting a small baby prophesized to defeat and evil Queen named Bavmorda (Jean Marsh). He must leave his small village to embark on this quest.
 
Along the way, Willow meets an interesting cast of allies including the down on his luck warrior Madmartigan (Val Kilmer), the Queen's daughter Sorsha (Joanne Whalley), an old wizard named Raziel (Patricia Hayes) and two Brownies named Vonkhar (Phil Fondacaro) and Rool (Kevin Pollack), an almost fairly like race of little people. 
 
I think this film is lacking in the whimsicality of the actual fantasy world. Look at more recent imaginings like Lord of the Rings (Peter Jackson) and you will see what I mean. The actual world just seems devoid of life. Good performances from Davis and Kilmer make this film quite interesting, but can't save it from it's rather slow paced plot. 
 
The film's highlight for me is the soundtrack (James Horner), which in my opinion is really underrated. Not even an academy nomination? They really dropped the ball in my opinion.  
 
Overall a decent fantasy film, and I can see how many people would love it. For me, it's a fun watch but nothing to write home about. 3/5.",NEUTRAL

No one will ever confuse him with James Stewart but even he had to be embarrassed by his performance as Madmartigan. Willow played more like a Princess Bride ripoff and it failed miserably.

Watching it now I can say that it still holds up nicely, although it's definitely catered more towards children then adults.  Val Kilmer is the one noticeable star and he does a great job playing the self-proclaimed greatest swordsman who at first seems a lot goofier than he is skilled.   Willow is the main character who is a reluctant dwarf that has to deliver a baby who has been prophesized to be a future queen.  Together they travel the land and become more and more invested in the baby's destiny as they're hunted by an evil queen's army.  This movie is a lot of fun to watch, especially the unique take on a love story between Val Kilmer's character and the fiery red headed princess who is the evil queen's daughter.  George Lucas wrote this story and Ron Howard directed it.  A great team for a fantasy adventure like Willow.  8/10 from me.",NEUTRAL

"Feb 8, 2011","""THIS ONE COMES UP SHORT""

by Dane Youssef 


This one wasn't much when it first came out. The budget was extravagant and the box-office returns just barely covered the big fat price tag. And as measly as a movie as this was for it's day on it's own merits, it's dwarfed even further by the immortal ""Lord Of The Rings"" saga. 


""Willow"" is the film the impish Warwick Davis is renown for his participation in the never-ending Horror-movie stories, the ""Leprechaun"" movies. 


This was his first lead role and he brings a likeable and earnest charisma to the role instead of just trying to be little and cute like so many child performers and other midget actors. Thankfully, he proves himself as to be more than just a cheap gimmick like so many other ""bit-players."" He allows himself to really give a true performance and the film itself doesn't go for the cheapest of shots with any of the height of it's little people. 


As a filmmaker, George Lucas is and has always been a homage-payer. He's one of those filmmakers who always tries to re-make those old films he loved during his own adolescence. With space operas: ""Star Wars,"" With Matinee Adventure flicks: ""Indiana Jones,"" With futuristic sci-fi adventures, ""THX 1138."" 


And now with ""Willow,"" he attempts to do the same for the sword-and-sorcery genre. 


Notice I use the word ""attempts."" 


The whole universe is derived from the whole medieval sword-and-sorcery genre. And it's a full bar and buffet smorgasbord here: We've got ""Lord Of The Rings,"" ""The Story of Moses,"" ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarves,"" ""Sleeping Beauty"" and ""Gulliver's Travels"" just to name a few. 


Val Kilmer is pound-for-pound one of the great heavyweight champion actors from here to Timbaktu. Perhaps even Pluto. But he even he and the rest of this considerable cast can't make it's movie as special and magical as it's title character is supposed to be. 


The 20th century and the 21st saw few better thespians. He truly delivered an Oscar for his re-birth as Jim Morrison in Oliver Stone's ""The Doors."" 


Here, anyone could have done the same job he does. It's his most unremarkable performance to date. They didn't need the great Kilmer for this one. 


Any stock actor with a Screen Actors Guild card or with one year of high school drama class experience could have done as good a job. 


Jean Marsh does a good job as Queen Bavmorda, but just about any random British actress on the planet could have done the same and gotten the same results. 


Sadly, this one just stands toe-to-toe with the He-Man ""Master Of The Universe"" movie from 1987. 


Even though Ron Howard Opie Cunningham was at the helm for this one, just about any hack with access to a tripod (that tilts low) could have done the same and gotten the same results. 


The real problem with ""Willow"" is that it's totally unremarkable. It's about a likeable little guy with a big heart for his family. He has a magical gift and uses it to make a name for himself. He meets a great warrior with a shady record who may find love along the way. 


They do battle with a wicked queen who happens to be a powerful witch with a great army, a two-headed dragon, a menacing lieutenant General who wears a mask scarier than his own face, yada yada yada yada. Do you even care? 


There are two little like the 3-inch tall people in ""Gulliver's Travels"" called Brownies named Rool and Franjean with helium voices and ethnic caricatured French accents that would have been considered embarrassing in the '30's. They irritate and confuse, but never amuse. Unlike R2D2 and C3PO or Marcus Brody, they never provoke as much as a smile. 


Lucas planned for this to be something of a series saga of films. But since this one barely made any return whatsoever, Lucas wound up scrapping the film ""trilogy"" and continuing the story in books. Hey, anyone out there ever actually so much as read a copy of the continuing ""Willow"" story? 


With ""Star Wars,"" ""THX 1138"" and ""American Graffiti,"" Lucas swung for the fence like a dominant male gorilla. He pulled out all stops and then some. This one is on-par with your average episode of a Saturday Morning TV series, even for the day. 


With Lucas' legendary ""Indiana Jones"" saga, we all remember one key gruesome scene in each movie---like the ""false grail"" scene in ""Last Crusade"" or the ""Ripped Heart"" in ""The Temple Of Doom."" In ""Willow,"" there's a similar sequence inspired by the ""Bay Of Pigs"" from the Greek tales of ""The Iliad and The Odyssey."" 

Lucas story pretty much recycles the whole outline plot of the ""Star Wars"" saga (episodes IV, V, and VI). Unfortunately, Lucas and Howard don't really feel like they're trying to have the last word of the genre as they did in many of their earlier efforts. 


You can see anything just as good and inspired/thrilling/etc. every Saturday morning on just about any network. 


Unlike ""Star Wars,"" ""Indiana Jones"" or ""Cocoon,"" this is not a product of theirs that defines the genre it's from. 


And what is it with the baby Elora Danan? She's so much of the damn plot and yet, all she does really is smile and cry on cue. There are babies in diaper commercials who have characters with more depth. 


I like the two-headed dragon. It doesn't look like the traditional fire-breathing dragon. It hardly even looks like a serpent. This one is kind of inspired. As a change of pace, it has more of an ugly look to it with long and furry serpent necks, almost like an ostrich. It's really weird. 


Although, it's one of the few inspired touches in this routine medieval epic. 


It's a Lucasfilm Ltd. production, so the special effects are (as it goes without saying) in the Oscar nomination territory. Enthralling for the day, some even by today's standards still shine. Lucas has made a bigger name for himself as a innovator of special effects than as a filmmaker. 


While it was a defining role for actor Warwick Davis and it employs more midgets and dwarves than any other production (and respectively), for anyone else, ""Willow"" is never anything special, nor does it attempt to be. 


Even for it's day ""Willow"" was unremarkable. Seriously, how many tales of swords, sorcery, kings, queens, dwarves, dragons and trolls had we seen in movies, TV shows, books, fairy tales and what-have-you before this came along? Yet another case of, ""Too little, too late."" 


Nearly 20 years later, that old axiom proves even more true.

I'm not sure how old I was when I first saw this movie, but I know it was another ""You've never seen [i]Willow[/i]?""  I get these occasionally, and they're almost without fail the most controversial reviews I write.  My readers, all six of you, are never happy when I go against their childhood delights.  There are people who still haven't forgiven me for not liking [i]The Goonies[/i].  Who never will.  And it is true that there are movies that are . . . of a certain age.  If you see them when you are eight, you will love them, and if you don't, you don't see what the fuss is about.  Of course, we've also established that there are movies you have loved when you are eight that turn out to pretty much suck, but I think still watching it for years and years, every chance you get, tends to mean you won't discover how bad they are.  I don't know, but it's at least a working theory.

Willow Ufgood (Warwick Davis in an almost entirely non-makeup role) wants very much to be a sorcerer, but he doesn't trust his instincts.  Anyway, one day, he discovers an infant (Ruth and Kate Greenfield) floating downstream.  Unbeknownst to him, she is Elora Danan, destined to take the throne from the Evil Queen Bavmorda (Jean Marsh).  Bavmorda knows the child will be born, and she knows the birthmark the child will have.  So the baby is born with a birthmark, and Bavmorda tries to kill her.  Quite simple, really.  Or anyway it would be, but someone (I can never remember who) puts the baby on said raft.  All Willow knows, though, is that the girl is a daikini, the movie's word for a full-size human.  She belongs with other daikini.  And so Willow embarks on a series of adventures with the baby, helping her along with her destiny.  He has to protect her from Bavmorda's daughter, Sorsha (Joanne Whalley), and General Kael (Pat Roach).  He encounters Madmartigan (Val Kilmer), a ne'er-do-well who does well.

Actually, when I first watched the movie, I thought his name might be Mad Martigan.  Like a title.  We first encounter him in a crow cage, sentenced to death for reasons which really don't matter to the plot.  He is not a happy, fun person.  He is interested in himself, and he only slowly gets entangled in this whole save-the-world mission.  This, as so many other examples in the movie, is part of a Standard Plot Device.  Okay, it's really hard to do a quest without relying on them.  Joseph Campbell was able to write that stuff for a reason, and of course filmmakers have been borrowing from him ever since.  There's only so much you can do beyond that.  Our Hero has to be without honour in his own country before he sets out, and he must return covered in glory.  The sequence of events has a little flexibility in between, but not all that much.  And so Madmartigan is one step on the road.  The trickster.  Being mad?  That wouldn't be out of character for the archetype.

I will say that the movie does a pretty good fantasy setting.  The Nelwyns, Willow's people, live in a village not unlike the thing we picture, when we picture villages.  The castle is your standard High Fantasy Castle of the Wicked Monarch.  I will admit that the crow cage is unexpected.  Especially since it's made explicit what is destined to happen to Madmartigan in it.  After all, the word ""crow"" is right there.  We don't like to think of crows as carrion-eaters, but we know they are.  Or at least people who know things about crows do.  The costumes are pretty good.  But that's the thing; pretty good is really what I have to say about the movie, and that's a modifier which means ""not particularly,"" at least in this context.  Not terrible, but not outstanding.  For some reason, it caught the public perception of a certain section of a certain generation, but if it hadn't, it would have just gone away.  There's nothing really special about it.

Oh, except a few gratuitous digs at the critics.  After all, the evil general [i]is[/i] named Kael, and while it's unconfirmed, there's really no way he isn't named after Pauline Kael, one of those names you know if you know anything about film criticism.  And you have to know even less to notice that the terrifying two-headed dragon is named Eborsisk.  (Really?)  It's not quite as blatant as [i]Lady in the Water[/i], but it's as though the movie is designed to poke fun at the critics, which is almost a sign that Ron Howard knew he wasn't exactly making [i]Citizen Kane[/i], here.  In general, movies which do that aren't terribly good.  Remember that the mayor and his assistant in [i]Godzilla[/i] are also Siskel and Ebert.  (Roger said he thought he'd at least be eaten or stepped on.)  I think this may be because good movies don't really need to step out of their planned worlds like that.

Not the screenplay or the direction mind you; that was mostly Ron Howard. Still, if you've obsessed over the space adventure masterpiece that is the original Star Wars franchise, there are similarities: a rugged thief who doesn't want to help the singular hero on a noble quest, who uses powers he's never heard of, all to destroy a evil entity locked away in a dire location. Right, an original concept. Props go to Val Kilmer for playing a charicature of Han Solo, Warwick Davis for bringing little people to the silver screen, and that baby who played Eleonora.

The only good thing is thier screen time is not that vast. Overall if you like your fantasy films this should keep you very happy,NEUTRAL

"Jun 13, 2010","A fun little fantasy movie (yes, in the fact that it has midgets galore), this is very much the Lord of the Rings story that never was. A lot of the characters and themes are similar, with a touch of George Lucas to make it a little bit more interesting and unique. I don't think there has ever, in the entire world, ever been such a large gathering of midgets. I have never seen so many of them on screen, it's bigger than the Wizard of Oz. It's like seeing the Shire, but with non-normal looking small people. It's really something to stand back and be amazed at, George Lucas sure made some friends when he did Ewoks. Val Kilmer is at his best in this, he is the most trigger-happy and funny sword champions of all time, even in league with the Highlanders. There's also an extremely racist made up term for midgets called ""peck"", enjoy using that and getting street tackled.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 9, 2010","Very dated, but still a good watch. Davis is wonderful and fun to enjoy. Kilmer enjoys a good bit of bare chest and long hair but nicely done.  Youngsters can still find the fun in this movie - but as stories go it is a dead end.",NEUTRAL

"Apr 5, 2010","A baby comes into the care of the elvish Willow Ufgood (Warwick Davis) and his wife, Kaiya (Julie Peters). The infant bears the birthmark of the one prophesied to come who will put an end to the tyrannical rule of the evil Queen Bavmorda (Jean Marsh). But the Queen, too, knows of the prophecy and is seeking the baby bearing the telltale mark. For the sake of his village, as well as the safety of the child, it falls to Willow to transport the baby to a safe haven beyond the boundaries of his land and the reach of Queen Bavmorda. So Willow sets out upon his journey, and along the way finds an ally-- maybe-- in the person of the self-proclaimed `World's greatest swordsman,' Madmartigan (Val Kilmer), and together (sort of) they embark upon an adventure that will ultimately lead them to a final confrontation with the evil Queen herself.

With some help from George Lucas, Ron Howard delivers this highly imaginative tale-- which bears that unmistakable Lucas touch-- with a touch of magic of his own. A showcase of special F/X-- it pioneered the `morphing' technique so vital to the success of films like `The Abyss' (filmed one year after this one) and `Terminator 2: Judgment Day' (1991)-- it is nevertheless decidedly not a `special F/X' movie. The F/X, though a big part of the film, to be sure, do not supersede the story. And because of that, it makes that necessary emotional connection with the characters possible, and takes the whole film to a higher level. A big part of what has made Lucas and Howard so successful, in fact, is that innate ability of being able to tap into the humanity of any given story (With Lucas, for example, his `American Graffiti' and even `THX-1138,' and Howard's `Parenthood,' `Night Shift' and `Apollo 13') and knowing how to convey it to their audience. It's the difference between being a true filmmaker, and just someone to whom an opportunity is handed who simply hasn't the insight or sense of human nature to know what to do with it (Like Adam Shankman with `The Wedding Planner,' Jeff Franklin's `Love Stinks,' Nick Gomez with `Drowning Mona' or Peter Ho-sun Chan's `The Love Letter.' All movies that suffered greatly because of their director's inability to do what Lucas and Howard do so proficiently and seemingly with facility).

In the title role, Warwick Davis does a good job of bringing Willow to life, as does Val Kilmer in the flashier role of Madmartigan. Joanne Whalley does a decent turn as Sorsha, daughter of the evil Queen, but is overshadowed by the deliciously sinister rendering of Bavmorda by Jean Marsh, whose wickedness is shamefully delightful.

The supporting cast includes Patricia Hayes (Fin Raziel), Billy Barty (High Aldwin), Pat Roach (General Kael), Gavan O'Herlihy (Airk), David Steinberg (Meegosh), Mark Northover (Burglekutt), Kevin Pollak (Rool), Rick Overton (Franjean) and Maria Holvoe (Cherlindrea). With an intelligent screenplay by Bob Dolman and original music by James Horner, `Willow' is an entertaining, enlightening film, rich in characterization and metaphor, with a subtle message and a moral that unobtrusively makes a statement about diversity and the value of an individual's contributions to the society of which he is a part; as well as the fact that one person can, indeed, make a difference. Visually stunning, too, it's a transporting experience truly filled with magic, and a journey definitely worth taking.",NEUTRAL

"Jan 8, 2010","Someone Give Warwick Davis More Work!

Story:  This is the archetypal David and Goliath style story of a little man (literally) vs. the big bad.  It's also the quest style of fantasy story.  It has more than a few similarities to the Lord of the Rings, not to mention some parallels with the story of Moses from Bible, but it does it in it's own way.  All around, aside from some startling badass decay, which we'll explore in the acting section, the only real complaint I have with the story is that the ending is not terribly self explanatory.  Whenever I make someone watch this movie for the first time, they always turn to me and ask, ?What just happened there?? and I do consider this a failure on the part of the movie.  They could have explained it after the fact.  B

Acting:  Val Kilmer is my favorite actor, largely because of this movie, Tombstone, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Spartan, and At First Sight, and while he's really, really good in this movie, I don't understand why he and Joanne Whalley got higher billing that Warwick Davis.  Warwick is in nearly every shot of this movie, he's the titular character, and he really was the meat the holds the movie together.  I guess it was a marketing decision.  Anyhow, Warwick is awesome in this movie and really needs to be given more to do than be a side character in every Star Wars, Harry Potter, or odd ball fantasy movie/miniseries that comes down the pipes.  Don't believe me? Watch Ray.  He's in it, he's a little man, and it doesn't matter.  It doesn't impact the story practically at all.  He gives a strong performance and it works.

Anyhow, back to Val.  Madmartigan is probably the loudest, most animated character that Val has ever played, which is cool when you consider that he usually plays very thoughtful, understated characters (like his Ice Man character in Top Gun).  He sort of plays this movie's version of Han Solo, the skeptic, smart mouthed fighter.  His character does experience a certain level of badass decay as the movie approaches its climax, as he loses his smart mouth in favor of being the generic, noble warrior character.  To a certain extent, this understandable, but I would like to have seen him retain more of his personality.  That said, his sword fight with Pat Roach more than makes up for this.

Madmartigan may experience badass decay, but not nearly as badly as Sorsha, the character played by Joanne Whalley.  She starts out tough as nails with a strong personality.  She's got a sword that looks like pain harnessed in steel form, and she's here to kick your ass... until she falls in love with Val Kilmer.  After this, she barely gets two lines in for the rest of the movie and also devolves into an idealized sort of warrior woman.

However, I think the real star of this movie is Jean Marsh.  Queen Bavmorda is evil and powerful.  She's knows magic spells to kill you in many painful ways and a enough of a lacking conscience to use it.  When the Nostalgia Chick listed her top lady villains, I was quite disappointed to see that Bavmorda didn't make the list when the wicked witch of the west from the Wizard of Oz did (I realize that I'm about to utter blasphemy, but the witch didn't do anything in that movie except laugh in an over the top manner.  Oh, and she used flowers to put people to sleep and employed an hour glass of doom, oh the horror!) Her acting is almost over the top, but not quite.  She hits her note perfectly.  

Lastly, they got the cutest, most expressive baby in the world to play Elora Danan.  She smiles and laughs at all the right times. B

Visuals:  This movie was really revolutionary at the time for raising the bar on visual effects with the whole process of morphing.  The special effects hold up to this day and look better than a lot of digital effects you'll see on a Sci-Fi (or is it Sy Fy?) channel original.  Also, may I say that Nockmaar castle is the most evil looking castle ever (sorry Orthanc and Barad-dur).  I realize that sixty percent of it is a painting, but seriously I love the look of that castle.  A

Sound:  The music in this movie is beyond epic, although I know I heard the same music in an ad for Disney's the Three Musketeers, so I don't know who borrowed it from whom.  Whatever, it works in this movie.  The sound effects are awesome, they completely compliment what we're seeing on screen.  A

Overall:  This is one of my favorite movies from my childhood, not to mention my favorite NES game.  I probably drove my parents crazy between the two of them.  However, this is one of the few childhood memories that held up over the years.  I definitely can't say the same for the Thundercats.  B

It was, however, a decent story told with decent techniques.
Similar to Gilliam's Jabberwocky, Willow's visuals are grimy and dirty, and it tends to play well with the story. The story, about a young dwarfs' belief that he has an inherent skill of magic about him, is a decent one. Willow is a magician, but only one by slight of hand. When he's put up to the test of proving himself in front of the whole villiage, he fails, but is told that he is to go on to greater things and greater magic. When the villiage is in trouble, it's up to him to save the day, and rightfully he leaves his family behind to find himself. Cute, but long, still a decent movie.",NEUTRAL

"Aug 25, 2009","I remember growing up with this film and never tiring of it. Even now that I see it today, it still has that same effect on me. Val Kilmer plays a reckless, but talented swordsman named Madmartigan who always seems to get himself into trouble; but, he does have the charm and mindset to avoid even his most dangerous predicament. While held prisoner in a cage in the middle of nowhere, he happens upon some dwarfs on a journey with a daikini baby; or human. The leader of this group is an nelwyn called Willow (Warwick Davis); who was given the task to deliver the baby to the next daikini he sees. Obviously, the first daikini they come across is held prisoner in a cage; thus our story begins across a vast terrain filled with colorful characters and magical creatures from the mind of George Lucus. <i>Willow</i> will hook you with it's captivating storyline and amazing cinematography filled with such imagination; it's a first look into great storytelling. It would have been nice to see this film turn into a trilogy like <i>Lord of the Rings</i>.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 18, 2009","back then..in those childhood-love-any-fantasy-film-you-see days i loved this film.i mean i really really LOVED IT.so much so that i lived n breathed (meaning playing like a star wars nerd with 'wand' instead of the 'lightsaber' and made a complete fool of myself infront of my family) this film. so when i got a dvd of this film as a gift from a friend i was so so excited to see this. and i don't deny it. i was kinda disappointed. shoddy and hurried up with cheap effects. seems odd at places. BUT still you can't deny that it has an old world charm to it. as much as i loved to hate it, i still loved it. well yeah..special effects were laugh-worthy. so was the whole setup and even the story line. and yes it was for kids so you can overlook that one. but in the end, you end lauding the spirit of the film. 
the kind of films are a rare breed these days. kinda film you go to with all your family and have a roller coaster fun coming out. (yeah i know...what about the animation films dude-shrek n ice age n yadda yadda yadda...come on..it's a different breed of film and different age we are talking about it)

"Jul 12, 2009","When a mysterious baby drifts toward his village, aspiring dwarf sorcerer Willow finds himself on a wild adventure as he strives to protect the child from an evil queen. WILLOW has been unfairly attacked by critics, declaring it to be a rip-off of STAR WARS and J.R.R. Tolkien (part of this being that this movie was helmed by George Lucas). While there are some elements of derivativeness at various points (although to harp on such ""similarities"" would almost take away the film's entertainment value), WILLOW exudes a charm of its own, thanks to some expertly directed action-scenes, deliciously campy humor (provided by two miniature size ""brownies""), and fine performances, particularly from Val Kilmer as the swaggering swordsman Madmartigan and Warwick Davis as Willow himself. James Horner's music is also a plus. The special effects by ILM are variable in places, but hold up fairly well for the most part. There are a couple of scary scenes that may be too intense for youngsters: a fight with a two-headed beast and a frightening bit where an entire army is turned into pigs, but for the most part this is a film that anyone of any age can enjoy. WILLOW deserved a far better fate than what it was accorded for in 1988, so it's refreshing to see that it has its legions of fans. As an escapist fantasy, it's no LORD OF THE RINGS, but it's great fun.",NEUTRAL

Well the idea of seeing it as an adult when I really wanted to see as a kid really failed! It was mostly boring at times although the end was the best thing of this movie. The story wasn't that interesting to me sadly. This movie actually was nominated for 2 Oscars even though it didn't won any so give it a shot if you like, maybe your experience will be different.

In the dungeons of the castle of the evil Queen-sorceress Bavmorda, a prisoner gives birth to a child who, according to an ancient prophecy, will put an end to the reign of the Queen. A midwife saves the child from the wrath of Bavmorda, but is forced to throw her cradle in a river when reached by the Hounds of the Queen. The river brings the child near a village of nelwyns, and little Willow finds and adopts her. When the Hounds reach the village, Willow begins a difficult journey to bring the baby back to her people and to fulfill the prophecy.",NEUTRAL

"Jul 4, 2009","Another favorite movie that I grew up with. I enjoy watching this film because it's a joy to watch. I really do get a sense of the fantasy world of those novels that are based in these ""medieval/ magical times"" especially when looking at the castles. Also, one of the movies that I like Val Kilmer. Then there's Warwick Davis whose been in a lot of movies and never tired of him. I like the world that Ron Howard and George Lucas created. It's a simple story of a princess prophesied to bring down an Evil Queen. An unlikely hero with help from friends protects the Princess and the Evil Sorceress is brought down. I find it funny with these stories that is it a self-fulfilling prophecy when the Queen goes after the child, in turn the prophesy comes true. Either way, a world filled with Brownies, Daikins, Elwins, and sorcerors and fun dialogue is an enjoyable experience.",NEUTRAL

There's something Ron Howard brings to a ""Star Wars"" inspired fantasy script by George Lucas that's unforgettable (His only TRUE film collaboration with another director).  The score is fantastic and Val Kilmer does not get enough credit for his flawed hero.  The sorceress battle at the end is unforgettable and one of a kind.  How many times have we seen a great final battle sequence between two middle aged women?  It's also very satisfying to see Davis in the lead role and he does a very good job carrying the film.",NEUTRAL

"Jun 5, 2009","Willow is a fun adventure fantasy that probably paved the way for similar ventures in its time period. There are some very interesting bits at play here. For one, Warwick Davis - a good actor by any reckoning - is cast as a member of a race of diminutive people. While, physically anyway, this is no stretch for Mr. Davis, this is clearly an inspired choice - allowing the movie a freedom that doesn't have to be afforded by special effects (Peter Jackson, I'm looking at you). Mr. Davis plays well as an aspiring magician, and plays well against Val Kilmer. Mr. Kilmer is pretty good here as well, a bit swarthy and such - he knows the character well, it seems and works it all out fine. Aside from the actors, there is some great magic at play here both in the special effects and in how the movie comes together. There really is the feeling of being in a fantasy world. The action and adventure are brisk and exciting, the comedic elements are largely quite droll and amusing. In all, Willow is a thrilling fantasy action-er.",NEUTRAL

"Apr 28, 2009","I get the sneaking suspicion that this was sort of autobiographical for Ron Howard (in the sense that it was a very personal project for him) because there's this dumpy dreamer named Willow who becomes a great hero over the course of the film. I actually liked this movie, though, as it was a fun little fantasy flick. I can't imagine showing this to a kid and him or her not liking it because it has a bunch of different interesting, fantastic elements: An evil witch, a magical child who will defeat the witch, fairies, lilliputians, great battles, sorceresses, etc. The special effects are really good for the film's time and they hold up well-enough for modern viewers.

Val Kilmer does a great job and has fun with his role as a lascivious master swordsman who becomes good over the course of the film. Willow is pretty conventional in its story and nothing too unexpected happens, but that's not really why you watch fantasy movies. I will say that the film felt about 20 minutes too long, but it's not a huge complaint.",NEUTRAL

Let's just say that it's much better through a child's eyes.  The acting was terrible -- even Val Kilmer couldn't do much with the stupid dialogue they gave his character, Madmartigan, and the overall plot was laughable.  It does get points for having pretty great effects in spots considering it came out in the late '80s, but that's about it.  Pure cheese otherwise.",NEUTRAL

It is odd that it didn't do better at the theaters because there isn't anything really ""wrong"" with the movie, but it is fantasy heavy when most fantasies at the time were probably cheaper and straight to video.

This movie was made very well considering the Era. The story line was very entertaining and the cast was fantastic every step of the way.

/profiles/yr2IYZFjDSKLuzeSPgiqgIA0hjR,"Willow had an interesting summarized plot, that is, that a baby is born that an ""evil queen"" seeks to destroy.  It sounded like it might make a good allegory of the Biblical story of Christ.  However, when I watched it, the allegory I had hoped for seemed very minor in the grand scheme of things.  The movie also played out very slowly, with plot twists all seeming very ordinary and, generally, uninteresting, or, at best, interesting at first, but not consistently captivating.  The special effects were good, I think, for the time of the film's release, so I suppose that may help the movie along a little bit, but seemingly does nothing to help make the story more interesting.",NEUTRAL

/profiles/ornuDrTJZH9YhNyuewsa2hZru64,"Willow, directed by Ron Howard, has great villains, dazzling special affects and a very skillful storyline. First of all, the movie was wildly thrashed and beaten by critics who have a following of fans that don't really care to think about the movie for what it is. 

Patricia Hayes, Jean Marsh, and the actor playing General Kael are all quite impressive performers in this fantasy tale. The Prophecy in the start of the film and the atmosphere of sorcery are all well done and the effort put into the film's early technology make this twenty one year old movie barely dated at all, except perhaps for the blue screen effect. 

However, regarding the lack of popularity at the time, Willow was criticized even by Siskel and Ebert as having too much Baby content. 

Elora Danaan was  a strong point of this film. The theme of innocense, as well as great evil is central to the entire plot line. When readers see the ending of this great movie, they will understand how the theme of innocense is important to the Prophecy at the very beginning.",NEUTRAL

Val Kilmer: Madmartigan

Joanne Whalley: Sorsha

Warwick Davis: Willow Ufgood

Directed by Ron Howard and written by George Lucas, this still remains one of the best fantasy movies from my childhood. Still amazing how good it is even when watching now.

Val Kilmer is so young in it as Madmartigan and shines with energetic vitality and charisma. 
Warwick Davis, Joanne Whalley and Jean Marsh all perform their respective characters amazingly.

The music soulful, tingling and uplifting. The adventure fun and nicely paced. Full of imagination and magic. This film has a timeless magic to it that will always be a fave of mine.

A perfect blend of Fantasy and Romance. With a heart thats larger than life.

Classic.",NEUTRAL

/profiles/ornuDYHJDh9eHN4heDHaKFZru6e,"Willow (1988) -- [8.0] -- George Lucas produces and Ron Howard directs this fantasy adventure about an unlikely band of heroes who protect a  prophetic baby against an evil queen who seeks to destroy them all.  ""Willow"" is its producer's baby and has a lot in common with the ""Star Wars"" movies.  It's characters are broadly drawn, the drama never scrapes below surface level, and it's full of visual effects and action set-pieces.  It borrows liberally from Tolkien, Joseph Campbell, and even The Bible, but it's not a piecemeal effort.  ""Willow"" creates a compelling and cogent fantasy world that I enjoy returning to every now and then.  It may not be an ideal showcase for acting talent, but Val Kilmer is certainly charismatic in the role of the rogue swordsman, Madmartigan.  Jean Marsh also delivers a memorably wicked performance as Queen Bavmorda.  What I enjoy most about ""Willow"" is its aesthetics, from Adrian Biddle's color-saturated cinematography and conceptual designs by Moebius, to James Horner's rousing music and ILM's visual effects.  On a historical timeline, ""Willow"" bridges the gap between the height of old school special effects and the dawn of the digital era.  It was one of the last movie to feature optical effects, hand-painted matte backgrounds, and stop-motion animation on such a grand scale, while also introducing one of the earliest forms of computer generated imagery (morphing) to the public.  ""Willow"" is a gorgeous film and a fun ride, and whenever I rewatch it, I'm fourteen again.",NEUTRAL

There's a- a peck here with an acorn pointed at me! A fun movie. Plays like a greatest hits collection of other fantasy movies, made better from the whole thing not taking itself too seriously, and of course Val Kilmer, the fantastic score from James Horner, and some effects that still hold up pretty well today all help in making this a fun childhood style classic. From a story by George Lucas and directed by Ron Howard, short actor Warwick Davis, who is known mainly as either the lead Ewok or the Leprechaun, stars as Willow, a young dwarf who is tasked with finding the proper place for an abandoned child. This leads to an epic quest of course, full of magic, swordplay, monsters, and romance. As mentioned, the story is not exactly original, Lucas himself originally wanted to adapt the Hobbit, but couldn't get the rights, but its made up for by its charming nature...and Val Kilmer. Kilmer really does do a great job in this movie. He is funny but also good as a confident hero. Davis is equally good, working outside the constraints of a creature costume. Its a very enjoyable movie, even if it may seem corny at times. Madmartigan: What the hell happened up there? Willow: You started spouting poetry. ""I love you Sorsha! I worship you Sorsha!"" You almost got us killed! Madmartigan: ""I love you Sorsha?"" I don't love her, she kicked me in the face! I hate her... Don't I?",NEUTRAL

The fantasy land created in Willow lives up to the expectations of the genre, and even goes a bit further.

That's the simple run-down.  However, there is some redeeming quality to this fantasy fare, because George Lucas really doesn't have any problems with borrowing certain concepts, and then creatively enhancing them, putting in the right actors, or making cinematic visions that sometimes work.  

They got a fiesty fighting red-head babe, and you have to love Val Kilmer, because he can play cool, and he can act really whiny and pissed off ,and he is perfect as Mad Martagen, the disgraced, but talented fighter, who will aid in the rescue of whatever the hell the name of this fantasy land is.  Eternia? Narnia.  Fantasia? Oh, well, there's something for once I did forget.

  There's a really funny scene where Val Kilmer as Mad Martagain is in a death cage, and this dude named Eric, who is leading a golden army, with a thick beard says, ""You were a good fighter once, but now you rot in that cage"", and then Kilmer calls the midget a ""peck"".  There's a cross-eyed midget wizard who gives Willow these beans that turn people into stone.

As long back as I can remember, there's two movies that I've loved since my childhood. 'The Goonies' and 'Willow' were these two close to my heart. I recently saw them both, 'Willow' today, and still... The love is there.

The movie is a wonderful fantasy that takes us to a world were nelwyns (dwarfs) and daikinis (humans) live their own peaceful lifes. A daikini child is born and she is the only one that can defeat the evil sourcerer Bawmorda, who's about to set her own reign of terror to the world. Willow, who finds the child from the river, is the one who's job is to get Elora Danan safe. On his journey, he meets Madmartigan, a talented but not so friendly swordsman. Together, they're off to a great adventure full of magic.

""Follow the direction of the bird!
- It's going back to the village!

Ignore the bird, follow the river...""

'Willow' is my favourite Ron Howard movie. Sure, now as I saw it for the first time for several years, I noticed some flaws and so on but you have to remember that filmmaking has progressed a lot in 20 years. The special effect, by George Lucas' ILM were at that time amazing. I remember when the two headed beast came from the water, I almost had to change my underpants. Now the effects may seem a bit dated but so what. The magic is still there.

As a curiosity, 'Willow' was the film that united Val Kilmer (Madmartigan) and Joanna Whalley, who plays the evil sorcerer's daughter Sorsha. Movies can do magic. Well, their love didn't last forever but can it really?

'Willow', despite that it is a bit aged, works wonderfully. The pacing of the film is good and the story develops nicely. The actors, especially Warwick Davis (Willow) and Val Kilmer perform well. Kevin Pollak plays a small but important role as a beer loving brownie. 

So what do you get of 'Willow'? A classic that will surely give you an exciting 2 hour. For me, this film will always have a special place in my film reel shaped heart.",NEUTRAL

If you haven't seen this, it's a more inspired terrifying adventure with less boredom and more feeling. I still love the rings, but this is so undepressing. I've seen it over 20 times and still don't get bored. George Lucas' imagination is outstanding again and Ron Howard's diversity as a director is never more evident. Val Kilmer makes a superb comic hero and Warwick Davis is really rather good considering he's 18. From the stunning opening with scenes you wouldn't get today (scary hogs ripping a baby apart) and the cutest dwarf kids. Birglecut (sic) is an amazing character and the whole thing is so cosy and Warhammer. The chemistry between Kilmer and Davis is winning and the action fantastic. James Horner's wonderful score complements proceedings beautifully. The finale with the wicked queen is certainly not for kids but the end fight uncut with the skulled warrior is movie history.

The whole baby escaping by the hands of an elderly person because of some crazed prophecy is basically ripped straight out of Prince Caspian.  So-So SFX (even for 1988 they could have been better) this film is rated PG, but the scene where the troll melts into a blob and grows and starts eating people is a little outside of what a PG movie should be.

/profiles/wLAu6dHmjTxRfLBFMqsvpuoVFVG,"When a mysterious baby drifts toward his village, aspiring dwarf sorcerer Willow finds himself on a wild adventure as he strives to protect the child from an evil queen. WILLOW has been unfairly attacked by critics, declaring it to be a rip-off of STAR WARS and J.R.R. Tolkien (part of this being that this movie was helmed by George Lucas). While there are some elements of derivativeness at various points (although to harp on such ""similarities"" would almost take away the film's entertainment value), WILLOW exudes a charm of its own, thanks to some expertly directed action-scenes, deliciously campy humor (provided by two miniature size ""brownies""), and fine performances, particularly from Val Kilmer as the swaggering swordsman Madmartigan and Warwick Davis as Willow himself. James Horner's music is also a plus. The special effects by ILM are variable in places, but hold up fairly well for the most part. There are a couple of scary scenes that may be too intense for youngsters: a fight with a two-headed beast and a frightening bit where an entire army is turned into pigs, but for the most part this is a film that anyone of any age can enjoy. WILLOW deserved a far better fate than what it was accorded for in 1988, so it's refreshing to see that it has its legions of fans. As an escapist fantasy, it's no LORD OF THE RINGS, but it's great fun.",NEUTRAL

The acting was alright and the special effects were ok for a movie at that time in the late 80s. I guess I was expecting a little more magical and humor such as the Princess Bride, instead I got a watered down version of Legend.[/size]

As a result, it's more believable than Jackson's blue screen tours of a digital Middle Earth.

/profiles/orRIDeFJDh9ySNyuewsanHZJI6o,"from allmusic: Complete with biblical rubric, medieval sorcery, and mystical creatures, director Ron Howard's Willow is the stuff of good fantasy adventure. In a nicely mannered performance, Val Kilmer plays well off of Warwick Davis as Willow, the sorcerer-to-be. The film is a well-conceived and well-executed quest fairy tale borrowing heavily from Gulliver's Travels, not to mention the story of Moses. Although seemingly a children's film, it is not without its share of violence, gore, and ghastly monsters, all provided by executive producer George Lucas' Industrial Light & Magic special-effects department. With this film, Howard proved his adroitness at fantastic adventure; furthermore, the film's cult following cultivated a generation of Magic, The Gathering players worldwide.",NEUTRAL

Willow single-handedly changed all of this, creating an immersive and unique world that corrected many of those flaws, making a work of medieval fantasy whose cinematic quality convincingly allowed suspension of disbelief. It's a work that makes one want to cheer on its eponymous, pint-sized hero and come to the end of the film having enjoyed it for the storytelling journey rather than any laughter at its abysmal quality.

In 1988, I figured this would be the closest we'd ever get to seeing something similar to the Lord of the Rings on the big screen. Val Kilmer steals the screen as the rogue and former knight Madmartigan. Queen Bavmorda seems stolen directly from ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarves"" or perhaps ""Sleeping Beauty"" and interestingly, the sorceress battle seems to be a prototype to Gandalf and Saruman's little tussle in Orthanc.

LOTR similarities abound, but this lacks that sense of wonder or foreboding; it's yet another fantasy that doesn't properly set up its world and the characters' places in it. All this talk of prophecies and chosen ones is old hat, and ultimately it's not Willow's skills that win the day, but dumb luck. It strains for Star Wars melodrama (even down to George Lucas-style pans and the fact that, really, Kilmer is just playing Han Solo), but again, the fun centre is absent. Some amusing supporting players (such as the brownies, including Kevin Pollack!) and James Horner's score, which aims squarely for John Williams, can't really save the whole",NEUTRAL

</i>
Willow, a small farmer/apprentice magician, meets Madmartigan, a great swordsman, and together they journey through a war-torn land of magic and monsters, to save a baby princess from death at the hands of an evil queen.

<b>Val Kilmer</b>:  Madmartigan

If you want a film which invokes memories of childhood, the late 80s, and magical fantastical escapism on a personal level, then <i>Willow</i> is one I remember quite easily.  Ron Howard directs a piece which takes lengths in equal measure to charm and tantalise in a way that's special, yet blends a story by George Lucas with a charismatic Screenplay from Bob Dolman.  The script and characters speak for themselves, with all that <i>Willow</i> equals, the charm and likeability lies with imaginative material.

<div style=""width:600px;""><a href=""http://www.flixster.com/photos/13559481""><img src=""http://content7.flixster.com/photo/13/55/94/13559481_gal.jpg"" border=""0""/></a><div style=""text-align:center;font-size:10px;""></div></div>
<i>Willow</i> may be the loveliest film to ever be conceived by Director Ron Howard, because it has characters and creatures we can all relate to and love, even on the hundredth viewing.
The cast which was assembled were pretty fresh and unknown back in 1988,  <i>Willow</i> equals memorable characters galore thanks to some iconic ways it divulges.
Who can forget a young unknown Val Kilmer as Madmartigan?  The loveable warrior hero whom falls for Joanne Whalley's  beautiful yet conflicted Sorsha, daughter of the evil Queen.  Warwick Davis as Willow Ufgood plays the unlikeliest of heroes, in a decade pre-ring era, putting Warwick first for playing some varied characters,  Willow joins the ranks.  Jean Marsh playing the main villain excels as Queen Bavmorda, whom actually makes evil look so good.  She embodies the part thus being a character whom you 
love to hate.  
Kevin Pollak and Rick Overton add humour and comedy with the duo, Rool and Franjean.

<i>''I am the greatest swordsman that ever lived. Say, um, can I have some of that water?''
</i>
The magical quality <i>Willow</i> exudes doesn't just come from it's wondrous characters, magical creatures, fantasy bonified locations...But also from it's score and music from James Horner.  The music and sounds compliment the Cinematography by Adrian Biddle in everyway.  It's pragmatically awesome and magnificent reminiscent of a marriage and union between lovers. 
Filmed in UK, Wales, and New Zealand it makes the most of showing beauty in it's humble little way.  When we have a chase scene we feel the vibe and excitement through the turbulent music and luscious environments used.  
In fact, <i>Willow</i> makes you feel the romance, when Sorsha and Madmartigan share a flicker of love, it doesn't just melt their hearts, it melts ours too.
When Willow is sliding down a snowy mountain, we are exhilarated, similarly to the fight involving a monster birthed from a watery moat.

Overall, <i>Willow</i> may not be regarded as a perfect story or film but it's simplicity and fun nature regarding escapism, seems perfect to me.
Nature, fantasy and a simple story of good and evil is all that is needed to be known prior to watching <i>Willow</i>.  Over-complicating a mirrored parody isn't always a case for prioritising necessity, when in fact the magic comes truly from the experience and enjoyment the adventure brings with it's magical journey, it's romantic entanglement, and fantastical nature.
A true must for imaginative fantasy fans whom love escapism and art brought to life, in their films.  <i>Willow</i> satisfies fans and garners new ones whom experience it's simple magic. 

<i>''All creatures of good heart need your help, Willow. The choice is yours.''

/profiles/m8AID6ubZfaXT8qFdNSQ2TBM,"Despite a few funny moments and a very good turn by Val Kilmer, this is a plodding and relentlessly squalid film, unpleasant to look at and rarely rewarding to watch. LOTR similarities abound, but this lacks that sense of wonder or foreboding; it's yet another fantasy that doesn't properly set up its world and the characters' places in it. All this talk of prophecies and chosen ones is old hat, and ultimately it's not Willow's skills that win the day, but dumb luck. It strains for Star Wars melodrama (even down to George Lucas-style pans and the fact that, really, Kilmer is just playing Han Solo), but again, the fun centre is absent. Some amusing supporting players (such as the brownies, including Kevin Pollack!) and James Horner's score, which aims squarely for John Williams, can't really save the whole.",NEUTRAL

Willow (a 'nelwyn' or something) finds a human child who is prophesised (groan) to bring an end to some evil Queen or other.  Willow sets out to return the child to the humans to protect his village, and soon becomes embroiled in the quest to save the babe and destroy the queen.  

Willow himself could be an interesting lead, but he's really not and is never given anything to do.  Surely a wasted opportunity.  There are too many characters, the whole thing's a mess and you never really get to know anyone.

The costumes and puppetry are amazing (or amazingly horrible) but the plot is thin, the characters given little time to develop, the bad guys baffling.  It's all buried in cliched fantasy drivel, nothing and no one is explained, terrible names fly all over the place and all the evil Queen and big finale stuff is just embarrassing.

/profiles/zW2I4xCRLSjvT6OHJyTW6SNkimA,"From September 19, 2007:

Willow is a rip roaring good time. The story is multilayered yet easy to follow.  The special effects are astounding for the day, particularly in the sequences involving the faeries and magical spells, thanks to Mr. Lucas' then-growing Industrial Light and Magic division.  The performances are believable and not cheesy, as sometimes fantasy films (particularly from the 80s) are prone to have, though possibly with the notable exception of the brownies (Rick Overton and Kevin Pollak), the film's principal comic relief device.  The action sequences are fun to watch, particularly with the antics of Mad Martigan (Val Kilmer).  Though a fantasy with some universal fantasy-related elements, the story is equal parts original and inspired by other fantasy, fiction, and even biblical sources; the Lord of the Rings and Gullivers Travels pop readily to mind.

Willow has something for everyone: there is sword and shield-related violence, mild gore, and scary monsters for those who like more edge to their fantasy and movies in general as well as pretty faeries, a cute baby, and imaginative magical sequences for those who prefer the sunshine and rainbow aspects.  Though it was not one of Mr. Howard's more profitable filmmaking attempts, any financial non-success was not caused by him, for he is as adept at filming fantasy as any other film he chooses to helm.  The movie draws the viewer in from the moment the character Willow is introduced, his family, and Ellora Dannon and holds onto one until the end.

This film is not perfect; the ending is abrupt, and the climax is even a bit anticlimactic, but the movie accomplishes what it is meant to accomplish.  It's a great adventure and fairy tale that can be endlessly entertaining if the viewer is willing to suspend disbelief and any possible ""critic's eye.""  This little movie has heart, particularly considering its thematic messages--believing in oneself, staying the course, and love's triumph--and a movie with this much heart deserves a second look.",NEUTRAL

Acting and Dialogue: B+: Remember I am reflecting on a 80's movie so yes I see it as somewhat cheesy, I give kudos to Warwick Davis for being a mighty actor even thought he's stature is working against him.  

Art Direction: B: For an 80's fantasy it wasn't haft bad. 

Cinematography: B: The cinematography work hand-in-hand with the art direction, so it wasn't half bad.

Direction: B+:  This is were Ron Howard stared to gain creditability as a filmmaker.

Sound and Music: C: Really not that remember able, mainly the music represented ""peril"" 

VFX: B: Good for the times, it not as magical as today's VFX.

Overall: B-:I enjoyed this film. As of late I been watch old school Sci-Fi and Fantasy to compare them today wok. So if you have my same ambition to explore old art then yes I recommend it for an older fantasy.",NEUTRAL

His acting shows so well the love he has for both for his family and the baby Elora Danan and the drive that these two inspire him to continue on his journey.

I take the unintentional laughs, the goofy story and the overacting all to the heart, and I enjoy the hell out of myself.

/profiles/PDgSLyHMZfW6fkni9QSLghNYSZJ,"The only thing going on that sets this film apart from other similar sword and sorcery/hero's quest/fantasy action films is thast this one is basically the Star Wars version of things, Not completely so, but, George Lucas had his hands all over this thing, and it shows, even down to some of the music at times.

Other than that ,this isn't really all that remarkable or special. It's not a bad film, and I was entertained, but it's not like a stone cold classic or anything. I think the main problem is that it just runs on for a bit too long, and often times it feels like it's on autppilot, and everyone's going through the motions. If you like that sort of thing, then fine. It's like a cheeseburger. Almost all cheeseburgers are pretty much the same, yet their familiarity gives a certain kind of comfort that we are okay with, even if it's nothing truly special.

I did like the cast though, because it's nice to see Warwick Davis in a prominent role that doesn't involve tons of leprechaun makeup. Plus, it's just cool seeing the lead played by someone's who's vertically challenged. Val Kilmer fulfills the Han Solo role, and he's fun to watch, even if this isn't really his best or most memorable role.  The ""Brownies"" kind of bugged me, and I now realize that they functioned as foreshadowing of Jar Jar Binks, if you catch my drift. 

So I'm giving this thing backhanded compliments and being nit picky, but, like I said, it did entertain me, so I do give it a mild recommendation. Perhaps if I had grown up with this movie I'd have a higher opinion of it, but who knows.",NEUTRAL

You have George Lucas and Ron Howard - How can this not be a hit.
A classic fantasy between good and evil. With some pigs along the way.
The evil queen Bavmorda (Jean Marsh) wields black magic to conquer the surrounding land. She fears the birth of a child with a peculiar birthmark so imprisons all expecting mothers untill the child is born. But a midwife manages to get the new born baby to safety by sending it downstream on a raft. This is where Willow (Warwick Davis) finds her, oblivious to who is searching for the baby, and reluctant to do so, with the aid of other dwarf-like people called 'Nelwyns' they must travel with her to the nearest town of ""large people"" also known as ''Daikini'' to return the baby.
Foolishly they entrust the baby to the first Daikini they meet, a warrior named Madmartigan - The lovely Val Kilmer.
More adventure comes along, making this fantasy a winner as they overcome the forces of darkness that threaten to destroy anyone who stands in the Queens way.
Special effects obviously weren't too great at this time - Although there is one scene which I found rather disturbing, and it's this one scene that makes this the first feature film to use the ""morphing"" process developed by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM)

The story is very entertaining, though many pieces are stolen from previously written epics (The Hobbit, Gulver¬ís Travels, and a Greek Myth where Zeus turns all the men into pigs, viewed later in Jason and the Argonauts on the secret island of Zeus).

Madmartigan: Ooh, I'm really scared. No! Don't! There's a- a peck here with an acorn pointed at me! 

A fun movie. Plays like a greatest hits collection of other fantasy movies, made better from the whole thing not taking itself too seriously, and of course Val Kilmer, the fantastic score from James Horner, and some effects that still hold up pretty well today all help in making this a fun childhood style classic.

From a story by George Lucas and directed by Ron Howard, short actor Warwick Davis, who is known mainly as either the lead Ewok or the Leprechaun, stars as Willow, a young dwarf who is tasked with finding the proper place for an abandoned child. This leads to an epic quest of course, full of magic, swordplay, monsters, and romance.

As mentioned, the story is not exactly original, Lucas himself originally wanted to adapt the Hobbit, but couldn't get the rights, but its made up for by its charming nature...and Val Kilmer.

Kilmer really does do a great job in this movie. He is funny but also good as a confident hero. Davis is equally good, working outside the constraints of a creature costume.

Its a very enjoyable movie, even if it may seem corny at times.

Madmartigan: What the hell happened up there?
Willow: You started spouting poetry. ""I love you Sorsha! I worship you Sorsha!"" You almost got us killed!

 Willow is a pathetic movie for two reasons, the writing is horrendous, and the director isn¬ít doing his job. Ron Howard is a lot like Chris Columbus¬Öaccept raised by George Lucas instead of Steven Spielberg. He can make great movie material good, and a decent idea terrible. Their directors that surround themselves with the best of the business but they themselves have no real talent. Sadly Willow is a movie that demanded a director who knows how to effectively communicate; Ron Howard only knows how to mumble. 
    
       [img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v491/holijay/willow2WEB.jpg[/img] 
    
 There are many missed opportunities with Willow and so in the end all we get are some interesting actors in their earlier years, some cute kids, great effects and a horrible story. Considering what Ron Howard makes now perhaps their still remains some hope for directors like Michael Bay and Brett Ratner.

 I give this movie a 3.0 out of 10.0. I remembered watching this in the theater when I was a kid. There are two things I remember from that experience. One, the movie scared me to death and so I blocked it out of my mind and closed my eyes for over an hour I¬ím sure. The other thing is that there was a mentally challenged man in a wheelchair. I didn¬ít notice him until the movie was over and the credits were rolling. It was at this time that everyone was walking out of the theater. The natural inward slope of the theater made it so the man couldn¬ít push himself back up and out of the theater because his arms were too weak. He kept saying ¬ìHelp me¬Öplease help me;¬î looking up to the fully able adults crowded around him but everyone acted like he wasn't even there, two more feet below their eye level and completely out of existence. I felt horrible, here I was probably about 6 years old and I was wondering why I was the only one that seemed to be hearing him. It was at this point that my dad bent down next to him and asked if he needed help. The man nodded and my father pushed him and his wheelchair out of the theater. Back in the bright light of the summer afternoon the man seemed to feel much more relaxed. My Dad then asked him if someone was going to be picking him up and he said yes and thanked my father. I felt so much better and I suppose it was at this point that I knew my father didn¬ít just care about me because I was his son, but because I was person, a person like anyone¬Öthat should be acknowledged. Sadly it was also at that time that I continued to gain a lot of distrust in people. That poor man, I feel so bad for this world. He probably is now dead, having died shriveled in a blank corner of the world, were no one seems to care.",NEUTRAL

Something upset me greatly today. Text message bullying, that's what it was. I don't understand text messaging to begin with, and then this crap happens. Ugh. I really dislike humans sometimes.

Those films that I consider personal favorites and/or those that have some historical signficance I will add later when I have time for more lengthy reviews. 
 
[b]Jesus of Montreal[/b], directed by Denys Arcand, is the story of a young actor hired by a local church to do a modern day reenactment of the Passion Play.  When his work incorporates blasphemous ideas, church officials become disturbed.  This is a fascinating, seldom seen film worth checking out.
 
[b]Roger & Me [/b]is the acclaimed Michael Moore documentary that chronicles the decline of Flint, Michigan, once the site of a thriving General Motors plant. 
 
[b]Children of a Lesser God[/b], directed by Randa Haines, is the story about a speech teacher James Leeds (William Hurt), who teaches at a school for the deaf.  He is an unconventional teacher who incorporates things like rock music so students can feel the vibrations.  Soon Leeds meets a beautiful young janitor Sarah (Marlee Matlin) who is a deaf former student.  She is withdrawn and not particularly interested in Leeds.  Eventually the two do fall in love and have to develop new ways to communicate.  It's an interesting film and the romance is plausible although it does become overly emotional and sentimental at times.  Marlee Matlin won an Oscar for her role.  
 
[b]Willow[/b], directed by Ron Howard, is a medieval adventure starring Val Kilmer. The film has excellent cinematography and then state of the art computer effects, but ultimately it's a predictable and uninteresting tale.

Queen Bavmorda looked like she was modelled after Disney's evil queen in Snow White, and actually brings some strength to this show that borders on the spongy-mushy . Val Kilmer is fun to watch and the sparks were evident between him and soon-to-be-wife Joanne Whalley.

It's just too bad that Lucas seemed to have taken characters straight from his Star Wars movies (there's the Luke Skywalker, the Han Solo, the Obi-Wan Kenobi, the annoying comic relief...) and borrowed from the LOTR books (again...).
 It's a shame the story starts repeating itself too much near the end (baby gets captured, baby gets saved, baby gets captured, baby gets saved,...) and started to feel inferior to the dated action sequences.

  [/font][/b] [left][font=Arial]After enjoying Catch Me If You Can, I was expecting more great lightweight dramedy from Hanks and Spielberg. Boy, was I disappointed.
  There's nothing wrong with the premise (based on true events), but there's something wrong with the way it's handled.
 Imagine yourself locked in a terminal, not being able to return to your home and not being able to step outside. There's something inherently sad about that. 
  So what do Spielberg & Co do with this? They build a ""feel good"" movie out of it. 
  Hanks'  Viktor goes around helping people, and spreads the joy joy joy down in his heart.
  
 In fact, he only appeared to be sad during the first half an hour or so. The rest of the movie is purely manipulative. And the manipulation is rather obvious.
  
 There are just so many scenes of wasted potential. You have the archetypical bad guy, who seems to be bad just because he can be.
  What bothered me most was one scene:
 [SPOILER]Gupta Rajan gives up his freedom just so Hanks can go to New York. It's touching for the most part, except Spielberg suddenly decides to play this scene out for laughs. He even ends it with a ""funny"" line: ""You have an appointment."" It also doesn't help that Kumar Pallana really isn't that great an actor and that his character is a caricature for the biggest part of the movie.[/SPOILER]
  
  [/font][font=Arial]But I'm singling out the flaws here. The movie looks damn good, and occasionally the manipulation works, mainly thanks to Hanks' performance. 
  If it wasn't for Hanks, this would've been a 6, but it has Hanks.

/profiles/AlBF6LHG0HkNhpgu6NTYlfKbHaG,"[font=Arial]This movie was good. It had some good actors and good acting. The adventure seems like something out of a D&D adventure, but overall, I enjoyed this movie. I recommend this to anyone who loves Fantasy Movies....it's well worth the watch![/font]",NEUTRAL
/profiles/oryFDYHJZH9YhNVIeAIawIZGs6e,This movie is a classic and in many ways set the stage for Lord of The Rings.  It may not be the best movie ever made but it is certainly a must see,NEUTRAL

This movie is what happens when Star Wars and Lord of The Rings have sex.  Let me show you...

Willow = Frodo, and he lives in an area similar to the shire (Warwick Davis was also an Ewok) with a whole bunch of hobbit-looking villagers.

The head wizard, who is looking for an apprentice, is similar to Qui-Gon Jinn.  One of the beginning scenes is a village meeting to decide what to do about the baby (sound familiar to LOTR?)  The baby (Elora Danon) is comparable to the Ring in LOTR.  The evil sorceress Bavmorda is the same character as the emperor in Star Wars. Val Kilmer is Willow's version of Viggo Mortensen in LOTR.  They hold a campout in front of Bavmorda's castle (sound like the end of LOTR III?)  And the list goes on.  I gave it a 7 for liking it so much when I was a kid. :fresh:",NEUTRAL
