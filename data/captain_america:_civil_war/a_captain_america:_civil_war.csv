"Apr 8, 2024",NEUTRAL,I like the play on Civil War here as the Avengers turn against each other trying to sort out what’s best for them and the country. It’s not a Captain America specific movie as it has many Avengers in it to include Spiderman appearance!!!
"Mar 24, 2024",NEUTRAL,S-P-I-D-E-R-M-A-N. That is all there is to say.
"Mar 22, 2024",NEUTRAL,Yeah this is peak marvel top 5 movie
"Mar 20, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Another great Marvel sequence. I was hoping for this to be another solo Captain America movie as Iron Man had three of its own, but this movie focused on Captain America and what he believes is right and wrong and how this will cause rifts for other characters giving them more rounding and arc potential. This also sets up Tom Holland and his take on Spider-Man as we will eventually see."
"Mar 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,This was such a good movie the story was intense the acting was amazing and the characters omg. Such a good movie!
"Mar 6, 2024",NEUTRAL,The characters and themes of Captain America: Civil War are incredibly complex and realistic!
"Mar 4, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Cultural reset, it was a cultural reset"
"Mar 3, 2024",NEUTRAL,One of the best MCU movies of all time...the good old days
"Mar 2, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Quem fala mau desse filme é duente,esse filme é perfeito"
"Mar 1, 2024",NEUTRAL,"The film is nicely made and exciting, you need to see the Winter Soldier if you want to have a real relationship with this film."
"Dec 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,The most serious that an MCU movie has gotten to this point. Having the characters we love face off against each other brought something fresh to a genre that was starting to get repetitive.
"Nov 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,Great story line and conflicts
"Nov 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Good movie, the direction is very good here, it has great action, a very messy script... but I give it an 8/10."
"Nov 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,If you can come out of this movie where you and your friends are debating which side was morally correct...I  think you've accomplished what you set out to do with this film.
"Nov 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,At the time I watched this movie was way more superb then anything else. I was on the side of Iron Man obviously because who doesn't have the same feelings as Iron Man? The execution of the movie was wonderful and the introduction of new characters was perfectly shown. Spidermen's introduction was the best thing here. And Black Panther nailed his role here.
"Nov 13, 2023",NEUTRAL,Not really entertaining
"Nov 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,One of the best movies of all time.
"Nov 10, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Another amazing Avengers movie!
More please!"
"Nov 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A high-grade illustration of an inside conflict, showing that even the good guys aren't perfect and beef with each other sometimes. But anyways the Russo brothers did justice with the famous comic storyline, having made a heavy final product."
"Nov 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This movie does well what it tries to do, and introduces great characters to the marvel repertoire. 
But it sometimes fails to have a two sided plot."
"Oct 31, 2023",NEUTRAL,"it was ok, also didnt iron man literally retire at the end of iron man 3? so confusing..."
"Oct 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,This was so good it felt like an Avengers movie
"Oct 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,Best captain America movie ever made.
"Oct 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,The MCU at its peak. Even better Movie than Infinity War or Endgame
"Oct 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not your typical superhero film, Captain America: Civil War doubles as an action thriller."
"Sep 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,Me encanta un buen villano y buena acción y gran guión es super entrenida y la acción es genial y personajes son geniales es un 8.9 de 10
"Sep 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Though the movie may portray this as a captain america movie, this is most definitely avengers pt3. Zemo is not a simple physical villain. He is a threat due to his iq and meticulous planning. Spider man is introduced well and tom holland brings the lovable charm of peter parker. The events in this movie does have consequences as it leads to the avengers success or failure in infinity war"
"Sep 6, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A movie that has the appeal of an Avengers film, yet still manages to progress Steve Rogers' character. A somewhat more mature outing, it explores themes such as the balance between personal agency and freedom, as well as the need for oversight and accountability. It also deals with the need for unity and understanding, as shown between the characters."
"Sep 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,Incredible! Love this movie!   Nuff said!
"Sep 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Cada pelea, cada escena...
Es una obra de arte.
Top 10 de mis películas favoritas de Marvel"
"Aug 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Perfect movie to end the cap trilogy and I believe this is such a perfect format for marvel, gotta agree with cap tho, he's always right"
"Aug 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This is how you do a VS. movie BATMAN V. SUPERMAN!!!!!!  It makes sure that the characters that are disagreeing with each other very personal and effective that we care about the characters fighting and makes not want them to fight, and also what i really loved is the character arcs between Captain America and Iron Man. Iron Man feels very personal for his actions in the avengers and wants to put the avengers in check, meanwhile the best character in this movie and in his trilogy is Captain America, a man who wanted to fight for what’s right for America and achieves, while he was in the ice he discovers the government is not to be trusted and now in this movie since he knows how government can be corrupt and dangerous he does not want the avengers to trust the government and the people who wants to choose where they fight. That is such a fantastic arc for Captain America overall for me it’s a 10/10"
"Aug 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Civil War is gripping and expansive. In addition to being the third Captain America film, it effectively serves as a third Avengers and a fourth Ironman film. That kind of range makes Civil War big and exciting but also reduces it to a franchise movie that relies on other projects to be relevant."
"Aug 8, 2023",NEUTRAL,Loved this damn movie. TEAM CAPTAIN AMERICA FOREVER!
"Aug 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,An Incredible Movie! Better then Winter Soldier and Age Of Ultron. Loved how this was a mini avengers movie and a Cap movie at the same time. Fantastic way to start Phase 3 of the MCU.
"Aug 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,One of the worst MCU movies for sure.  The inclusion of all those characters is stupid and they don't feel like the characters that we know from the comics.  There is a scene where Captain America tries to murder Spider-Man by dropping a 27-ton truck on him. In a follow up scene Bucky Barnes tries to kill Spider-Man and throws a big rock at him and then Spider-Man responds by trying to decapitate Bucky with the rock he just threw at him. This movie is bad for so many reasons. The fight scenes were nice and Black Panther was probably the only good character in the movie.  My main complaint is how none of the characters act the way you think they would. Cap would never throw a truck on a kid nor would Spider-Man ever try to decapitate someone.
"Aug 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I for sure loved how they managed to get the avengers to split up into to factions lead by the the ones who hold the mcu together; iron man and captain America. Although winter soldier is still slightly better, this movie is in my top 10! Really enjoyed the action, especially the iconic airport battle and final fight!"
"Jul 31, 2023",NEUTRAL,A n amazing film from marvel. The writing and characters were top notch!
"Jul 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,Esto es increíble la acción es genial el villano me gusto y bueno es buen batalla de super héroes es un 9 de 10
"Jul 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This movie was really good. The whole ""Civil War"" idea in Marvel is so cool. The action and high stakes were fantastic in this thriller."
"Jul 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War delivers a thrilling and emotionally charged superhero showdown, with its complex character dynamics and action-packed sequences making it a standout instalment in the MCU."
"Jul 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,it's very intense and i would not watch it with  kids under 7
"Jul 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This movie is fantastic. Seeing our heroes fight each other is something we both want and don't want to see. The mature themes of the story and riveting world building make this entry pure edge-of-your-seat fun. The debut of Black Panther and Spider-Man push this movie into ""perfect Marvel film"" territory."
"Jul 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,Boring af one of the worst marvel movie like it's si boring u fell like it's 5 times longer that actually is
"Jul 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,Perfect movie! Love fights between heroes.
"Jul 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,This impressive movie is a vital part of the MCU that develops many characters.
"Jul 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,"On the one hand, it's nice to see a film where the Avengers have to come to terms with what their actions have done to others, and the possibility that they're actually engendering the danger to the world just by existing. 

On the other hand, Captain America is basically presented as being in the right for rejecting a UN treaty, instead supporting the narrative stand-in for American exceptionalism and the right of the Avengers to act unilaterally in the face of what they deem as a threat without oversight and without facing the consequences of their actions in any bigger way than doing a sad face about it, which subtexually says ""America has the right do what it deems to be necessary for the good of the world"" and invites the audience to assume that when the USA does something like invade a developing nation based on fabricated intelligence and a propaganda campaign, that it must be for the good of the world... And that definitely blows."
"Jul 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This movie makes you choose a side, and those who have chosen a side can normally defend it elaborately, decrying those in the opposing camp. This movie shook the MCU and delivered a taste of what was to come in terms of huge crossover movies. By this point the team behind the Marvel movies has mastered the art of witty banter and CGI fight scenes, while still delivering an impactful story and an ending worth remembering."
"Jul 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,Captain America: Civil War starts phase 3 of the MCU with a bang as we see all of our favorite characters (as well as a new one) in the MCU go face to face in an epic battle. I can really feel the tension when all the characters interact.
"Jun 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,I really good movie loved it one of the best marvel movies with the comics were better but still one of the best marvel movie
"Jun 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,AMAZING scenes especially when we got a full blown battle royal with spider man
"Jun 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,É um dos melhores filmes da Marvel
"Jun 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"É um filme fantástico, com conflito e lutas espectaculares. O único defeito é que não tem como classificar isso como filme do Capitão América."
"Jun 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Thought provoking and a new intriguing direction bolstered by Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Captain America: Civil War takes a new route, in a grounded and more gritty approach that addresses a main complaint about superhero films, and poises a new era for the MCU as a whole."
"Jun 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I feel like if everyone were to simply sit down and talk things through, things could have been solved without so much division. That having been said, it is a good movie, it introduces some of my favourite characters, and it certainly impacts the rest of the Infinity Saga."
"Jun 11, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Civil War divides the audience in an intentional way and it works, it takes what BvS could've been and takes it to an 11, although I simply can't understand why anyone chooses CA side when he didn't tell Tony Stark anything that he knew"
"Jun 9, 2023",NEUTRAL,"What a way to start Phase Three. 'Civil War' is surely one of MCU's best movie, with its great action sequences and performances."
"Jun 8, 2023",NEUTRAL,Once again a great Captain America film. Again Action sequences are literally jaw dropping. Climax was incredible as a Christopher Nolan.
"Jun 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,Basically Avengers 2.5 rather than a Captain America 3. Features a civil war between the Avengers as two teams of Avengers fight each other in a German airport fighting over whether or not someone did something very bad or not. Also introduces us to Black Panther.
"Jun 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A civil war of a soilder , who struggles between 2 sides being his pals & team ."
"May 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,This movie takes the characters we love and puts them against each other. That's just simply awesome.
"May 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,THIS MOVIE IS COOL AND GOOD
"May 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"i just have one thing to say, if this wasnt a Captain America movie Tony would have won without a problem"
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,Definitely team Cap. This was an awesome non-Avenger team up. Plus it introduced our favorite web slinger.
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Might be the best mcu movie
"May 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War is as close to perfection as I have seen in a film. It has everything that I look for in a superhero movie; there is character development, realistic action, appropriate humor and above else, heart. The pacing of Civil War is wonderfully crafted as you learn the ""why"" behind each individual's actions. Honestly, the motivations of every single person that takes place in the ""civil war"" are explained. The Russo Brothers even go back to explain Tony's character arc in IM3 and AoU. Where most ensemble films have a problem with screen time and balancing character subplots, Captain America: Civil War overcomes this problem with ease and is the best MCU film because of it. Not only does Civil War do a great job of balancing character development, it also has stunning visuals, emotional pulling moments and suspense. I was on the edge of my seat every minute of this film, even on a rewatch. This film has everything that you can hope for in a film and more!"
"May 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Captain America Civil War is an incredibly gripping and emotional story that very ambitiously pins its heroes against each other. Besides some shaky CGI moments, it continues Marvel's streak of amazingly choreographed and visually stunning action sequences."
"May 13, 2023",NEUTRAL,A bit darker more mature take shows that even marvel superheros can have disputes over the correct course of action. A movie where your favourite character can actually die or get hurt is much more thrilling.
"May 9, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This was one of the best MCU movies when it came out. My only down fall is I feel like it takes away from the Captain America story, with them having to introduce two new MCU characters. I also wish they hadn't called it Civil War as the comic story had a much larger lump sum of characters. In the end it still holds up as a good MCU film just don't watch it too many times or you'll see the magic wear off."
"May 8, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War is an awesome movie. Honestly, this should really be an Avengers movie! This movie is the long awaited battle between Captian America and Iron Man as they cause the Avengers to take sides. This movie introduced Spider Man. I Highly recommend this movie. It also makes a good conversation with your friends about which of these two would actually win in the battle. If you like Batman vs. Superman, well this is basically the marvel version of that."
"May 6, 2023",NEUTRAL,Once again Anthony and Joe Russo did a great job. I'd think this is the Perfect face off film Since Face off (1997(.
"May 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,"RDJ as Iron Man , Chris Evens as Captain America and THE GOAT Tom Holland AS SPIDER-MAN in the same movie!!!!! uh YES PLEASE! BEST CAPTAIN AMERICA MOVIE OF ALL TIME AND FOR SURE ONE OF THE BEST COMIC BOOK MOVIES OF ALL TIME"
"May 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,Wow!!! Is the first thing that comes to mind. Insanely good movie. Plus the introduction of Black Panther.
"May 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was so good that it could have been an avengers movie
"Apr 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,One of the better MCU movies. There is so much going on in this film that it’s almost hard to keep up. The story gets twisted to the point you don’t know who to cheer for and you just hope for the best. 
"Apr 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,Small villain sometimes is work better rather than big villain.
"Apr 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I kind of like the movie. The acting and the action is great, but the center story that drives this, the Sokovia Accords, is the most fabricated, biggest bs possible. The explanation given by Ross, the Secretary of State, is New York, Wash DC, Sokovia, and Lagos is billions in damage and loss of life = they need to be controlled. The first three were a percent of what would have happened if it had not been stopped and the fourth was an accident in which more would have been killed in the marketplace than were killed in the building [and it was still an accident]. Like I said: an excellent action movie with a weak center piece."
"Apr 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,The greatest MCU movie in my opinion! Definitely Oscar worthy.
"Apr 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Personally one of my favorite superhero movies. Easily a top 5 MCU film. 
"Apr 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,A great movie that makes your emotions swing all the way through!
"Apr 9, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Dark and shocking, Captain America: Civil War is a stand out film that puts the heroes we all know and love in a fight and impresses with its story and character development.

Rating: 85%"
"Apr 8, 2023",NEUTRAL,It had it's moments.
"Mar 31, 2023",NEUTRAL,One of the top 5 best MCU films. Sets the stage for the rest. Great flick!
"Mar 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This movie is phenomenal this villain “Zemo” what’s the avengers dead but knows he can’t take them on so instead gets them to be mad at each other so then they can kill each other. I love how they fight it’s super interesting and entertaining. They introduced Spider-Man, antman, and black panther. Witch those are some of my top 5 favorite superhero’s "
"Mar 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,para mi la menos preferida de la trilogia del cap america aun asi muy disfrutable una peli que trata de adaptar libremente el comic donde le falta bastante para acercarse a este comic adaptada como un mini vengadores o un civil war en el ucm con los personajes disponibles buenos momentos buen villano pero una trama algo lenta
"Mar 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,Love this movie cap vs iron man awesome
"Mar 13, 2023",NEUTRAL,"An All Time Classic. The acting, action scenes, and special effects are the highlight of this being first rate throughout. This film is perfectly paced also despite being on the long side which I never felt once. The only minor complaints is the music while very good isn't as good as Winter Soldiers and the editing while very well done bounces around a lot. There is way more characters in this and it borders on being an Avengers Film more than a Captain America film at times. But I never felt that was a hindrance because it never really has many subplots to it, it just has more characters involved in the main plot. Also, the villain is kind of forgettable as well as he gets lost in the shuffle of so many other characters at times. Anyone should give this a watch though. A great way to close on of the best trilogies ever made."
"Feb 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,i like the differences of each avengers character in this movie
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"To me, this is the least ""play-it-safe"" movie in the entire MCU, maybe besides Guardians or Iron Man. To have the world you built over 8 years torn apart when a threat coming that they can only stop when united, this movie has dire consequences. Zero, however, does not need to be in the film, this movie did not need a villain, and even though he is, his plan doesn't make all too much sense, it is completely a result of coincidence. Regardless, the pain and emotion in this story help me forgive its flaws."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War, directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, is a thrilling action/adventure film that pits members of the Avengers against each other in a conflict over government oversight and personal loyalty.

The film benefits from a strong ensemble cast, with standout performances from Chris Evans as Captain America and Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man, as well as newcomers Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther and Tom Holland as Spider-Man. The dynamic between the characters is compelling, and the film effectively balances character development with high-stakes action sequences.

The cinematography and special effects are impressive, with thrilling set pieces and fight scenes that showcase the characters' unique abilities. The film's themes of personal responsibility and the consequences of unchecked power are thoughtfully explored, adding depth to the film's fast-paced action.

However, the film's complex plot and large cast can at times feel overwhelming, and some characters don't receive as much screen time or development as others. The film's humor and lighter moments can also feel out of place at times, detracting from the film's more serious themes.

Overall, Captain America: Civil War is a thrilling and well-executed superhero film that delivers on action, character development, and thought-provoking themes. While it may not be perfect, it's a standout entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and a must-see for fans of the genre."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Cool adaptation. Nice entry for Spider-Man.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"perfect, just perfect"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Fantastic , a triumph!  This and the winter soldier are modern day story telling at its best !"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Super-powered friends break-up because they make politics their personality.

MCU's twist on Civil War...it's not as grand as the comics, but it has loads of battles and characters. Never talk politics with friends."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Incredible. It takes everything good about The Winter Soldier and cranks it up to eleven while bringing in the other avengers.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A ver esta pelicula tiene como trama principal la traicion y la separacion de los Vengadores como equipo, pero sin contar un elenco espectacular y efectos muy bien realizado, Capitan America Civil War se considera muy baja para mis estanderes"
"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Without a doubt, best MCU movie ever."
"Feb 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War isn't just a Captain America movie, it's also an Avenger movie, and it's overall an improvement to both sides!"
"Feb 14, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Joe and Anthony Russo's second addition to the ever-growing Marvel Cinematic Universe is an explosive, globe-trotting affair that can't help but feel like the unofficial third Avengers film.

When political pressure from numerous sources overflow, the Avengers receive an ultimatum: sign the new 'Sokovia Accords' (documents that mean the Avengers will obey a committee that decides when, where and if they can fight crucial battles) or retire. This deeply divides the team. Captain America (Chris Evans) believes heroes should remain free to operate without government interference, whereas Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) disagrees and states the Avengers need to be 'put in check'. But when it appears to be Bucky Barnes a.k.a The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) who is responsible for an attack on the UN building during a meeting for these accords, Steve must jump into action and find Bucky before someone else does. Their disagreement then escalates into an explosive, intense feud that will create a long-lasting rift between the two sides.

The film is full of both emotional moments and, in classic Marvel fashion, perilous fight scenes. The Russo Brothers also bring in props and characters from some of their previous jobs - for example, Jim Rash makes a cameo as a member of the MIT team. Due to the vast cast and variety of subplot, viewers could argue that 'Captain America: Civil War' is an unofficial Avengers film. Anthony Mackie even referred to the film as 'Avengers 2.5'. As well as dealing with numerous subplot and storylines, The Russo Brothers were put in charge of Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Spider-Man's (Tom Holland) debut into the MCU. They give each character enough time to be introduced to viewers without their debut taking up chunks of the film. The Russos leave enough unexplained to build up the anticipation for each character's solo films that were to come in the later years: 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' released in 2017 and 'Black Panther' released in 2018.

Like any other Marvel film, 'Captain America: Civil War' sets up the future of the MCU. Both 'Avengers: Infinity War' and 'Avengers: Endgame' are influenced by the events of this 'Civil War'. The casting, as always, is brilliant. Chris Evans plays Steve Rogers as the honest, protective man that he is. Robert Downey Jr. brings back Tony Stark's arrogant, humorous personality to viewers, resuming his role as the billionaire playboy. Natasha Romanoff acts as a midpoint between the two sides, joining Tony's team, only to end up letting Cap get away, eventually joining him on the run. Tom Holland brings Peter Parker's nervous, nerdy presence to the screen. His casting also makes him the youngest person to play the iconic web-slinger. Holland was only 19 during filming. Daniel Brühl also makes his Marvel debut as Helmut Zemo, the first non-enhanced primary antagonist in the MCU. Brühl brings his slick charm to the character, presenting Zemo as a cold, calculated man on a mission, a mission for revenge.

Henry Jackman once again lends his composing ability to the film. Jackman creates a score that features intense climaxes and compliments the action on-screen. Jackman also features and reworks the themes of heroes like Spider-Man, Captain America and the iconic Winter Soldier theme. Trent Olapoch's cinematography is impressive, he captures the feel and aesthetic of the previous Marvel movies while still providing new and unique imagery.

If you look at 'Civil War' as a whole, it's clear to see that all the subplot and plotlines come together almost like a jigsaw puzzle. There's a myriad of themes and ideologies floating around the film including grief, accountability and responsibility. The dominant theme that looms over the film is choice. Each character chooses what side they fight on, Steve chose to help Bucky knowing it made him an enemy of the state, and Zemo chose to go after the avengers to relieve his grief.

Overall, 'Captain America: Civil War' is an impressive piece of skilful filmmaking that features great performances, detailed storylines and a brilliant score. The Russo Brothers prove that they can wrangle such a large cast and create a complex film that deals with powerful themes and ideas."
"Feb 13, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The Russos have made another action packed, solid movie for Marvel – but it's not perfect. More: https://bit.ly/3Yuw3tX"
"Feb 10, 2023",NEUTRAL,Gostaria de dizer que: Que filme mano!
"Feb 10, 2023",NEUTRAL,I think that this movie is pretty good. It has action and a twist that I wasn't expecting. I think that this movie has an ok plot. I think it needs a little more elements of spider-man in it. I think that the ending  was a little different than what I thought it would be. Overall a good movie.- 7/10
"Feb 9, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Civil War gives you the introduction of Spider-Man to the MCU, which is something that actually turned out to be the most amazing and over the top experience for any fan in the theaters, we screamed. Trust me we screamed. We also got the introduction of Black Panther, which, just as great as Spider-Man, we got the legendary movies to follow. I think the battle between captain, America and Iron Man was greatly done, and the Russo brothers deserve more than just a clap and a happy ending. They are legendary directors when it comes to these films and deserve anything that they ask for. This film is definitely worth watching. I've already watched it again this year, and it seems to be a yearly thing with me."
"Feb 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A fantastic movie which is essentially Avengers 2.5. The main issue with this movie is the motivations for dividing the Avengers are contrived, and there are no consequences either. It's still very fun, but it had a lot more potential."
"Jan 31, 2023",NEUTRAL,I think this Marvel movie was probably the best one actually. The emotional interaction and fight between Cap and IronMan over Cap's best friend was powerfully moving  towards the end.  The introduction of the Black Panther and Spidey to the MCU was also good. A real emotional rollercoaster for Stark in this more Avengers 3 like movie.  Lots of true to the comic book characters' personalities shines thru everyone of the actors in this movie.
"Jan 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,A MARVEL SABE FAZER FILME BOM ESPETACULAR
"Jan 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"9.5/10. Somehow was able to top the other Captain America movies, great Marvel movie."
"Jan 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Great action sequences in the movie. The way the two teams come at each other is done in a way that is believable and one can understand both perspectives. Also a great way to introduce Black Panther and Spider-man into the MCU. This is one of my favorite MCU movies due to the exciting action scenes. Zemo is also one of the best villians ever introduced because, despite not having any superpowers, actually achieves his goal of trying to split the Avengers apart, and his motivation for doing so makes logical sense."
"Jan 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Greatness at its finest in the world of Captain America.
"Dec 30, 2022",NEUTRAL,"The story is a bit up and down with some glaring plot issues, but the star power and stellar action makes up for the film's weaknesses."
"Dec 12, 2022",NEUTRAL,Better than I expected. They gracefully made the conflict and the action is great
"Dec 6, 2022",NEUTRAL,Fanservice. Nothing else to say
"Nov 29, 2022",NEUTRAL,"So many twists and turns that lead to the eventual clash between the two main heroes of the Avengers. In many ways this is written as a tragedy even with the action-packed fight scenes. You see two friends that have united against great foes to clash in a brutal conclusion to their story. The writing is amazing and works well to support the heavy load that has to be carried in this film. Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans do well to portray the conflicts they have with each other as well as within themselves. An amazing ride whose only flaw is that certain characters don't fit perfectly into the story and instead seem to be thrown in to increase the spectacle of one fight scene. Even with that, it is an example of what great storytelling and world building can do for film."
"Nov 22, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Yes! Finally! The moral dilemma that ""Ultron"" could have been, and the answer to questions posed by more realistically-minded watchers of past films who saw the chaos left behind. Not only that, it pits Iron Man and Captain America, two fan favorites, against each other. ""Simo"" is exactly the kind of villain that the Avengers have yet to face - a quiet and brooding one, rather than the earth-smashing kind. Must watch for superhero/Marvel fans."
"Nov 19, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Best of captain America, very fun action sequences."
"Nov 18, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Recommend, worth watching."
"Nov 15, 2022",NEUTRAL,"While I prefer the films where the Avengers unite and thrive as a team, the sweetness of introducing new characters and adding them into the action-packed mix with the team splitting apart and fighting is very original! Plus, the last 20-30 minutes of the film gives us one of the best and emotion-inducing fights of the entire MCU!"
"Nov 14, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War brought its audience a captivating film full of emotion that, people who have kept up with the MCU thus far, truly felt. It was written exceptionally with amazing characters who we have previously loved dearly. Overall, an outstanding and exciting film."
"Nov 13, 2022",NEUTRAL,Marvel’s best ensemble film that manages to be one of its most personal.

"Nov 2, 2022",NEUTRAL,This is an amazing movie and one to watch
"Oct 29, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Me encanta esta pelicula, se siente coml una verdadera obra de arte por parte de marvel"
"Oct 26, 2022",NEUTRAL,A cinematic masterpiece. Civil War makes a realistic story that pits the Avengers against each other. Introduces a human villain that is a nice break from crazy space aliens and robots with no motivation other than world destruction. Civil War sets up the next stage of the marvel universe with a bang!
"Oct 24, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Absolutely amazing. I can't tell which I like more; this or winter soldier. It's a tie. But since this one has my favorite superhero; Spider-Man, imma say this one. Chadwick Boseman was amazing in this. Rest in peace."
"Oct 19, 2022",NEUTRAL,I like this one. Was a tough choice for me picking sides between the billionaire industrialist and the aryan ubermensch
"Oct 15, 2022",NEUTRAL,Civil War is just the beginning of the great war later. It is a fun movie with a thrilling battle throughout the movie with a great conflict in it
"Oct 7, 2022",NEUTRAL,This and Winter Soldier are two of the best non-Avengers MCU Titles in The Infinity Saga!
"Dec 18, 2019",NEUTRAL,"Apparently people hate this movie but, Not to be rude but how."
"Dec 18, 2019",NEUTRAL,"Captain America Civil War is one of the best movies of all time. It has a incredible story. The action especially the airport and final battle are Amazing!! Zemo is such a great villain for this story, And It is one of the best MCU movies."
"Dec 17, 2019",NEUTRAL,"If Age of Ultron failed to keep up with the first Avengers, Civil War knew how to bring fun and the beginning of disagreements in the team.The addition of the Black Panther and the combat at the airport satisfy the comics audience so much for those who have met the characters through the movies."
"Dec 16, 2019",NEUTRAL,"Tony's reason for the Avengers signing the Sokovia Accords was harsh, but it made some sense. The heroes need to be kept in check to better ensure the safety of many innocent lives."
"Dec 16, 2019",NEUTRAL,"Civil War was an action-packed film and had lots of brilliant, memorable dialogues that Marvel enthusiasts can obsess over until the following flick comes alongside."
"Dec 16, 2019",NEUTRAL,"Capt. America for the win! No offense for #TeamIronMan, but Steve Rogers just made the movie so good! Now I want to have Capt. America as a friend, to always have my back."
"Dec 16, 2019",NEUTRAL,OH YEAH! Seeing Antman turned into a giant almost made me lose my mind. This is what I am paying for movies -- these moments right here.
"Dec 16, 2019",NEUTRAL,"I love this one from Vision, ""Our very strength incites challenge, challenge incites conflict. and conflict breeds catastrophe."" The Sokovia Accords might be a bit overboard, but he made a legit point."
"Dec 15, 2019",NEUTRAL,"This battle between Marvel's finest superheroes left me hanging on the edge of my seat. It was a great one, seeing how friends had to choose which side will they choose, and to fight for what they believe is right."
"Dec 15, 2019",NEUTRAL,"Spiderman and Black Panther's introduction to this movie made it a whole lot better. And we can expect that that is a foreshadow for their upcoming movies, too."
"Dec 15, 2019",NEUTRAL,"Civil War is just like the prequel for the Infinity War, where a lot of Marvel's heroes are showcased. More hyped to see what will happen after the Avengers were disbanded."
"Dec 15, 2019",NEUTRAL,"FRIENDSHIP? OR THE WORLD? Capt. America proves that being a friend means that even if the entire world is against you, he will be there with you till the end."
"Dec 11, 2019",NEUTRAL,Hands down the best Captain America movie. Captain America civil war has everything you could want in a superhero blockbuster and its truly epic from start to finish as close to perfection as you can get.
"Dec 2, 2019",NEUTRAL,"Top 5 MCU for sure. This movie perfectly illustrates how when two friends have different viewpoints, it can drive a wedge into their friendship and cause, in the words of Vision, catastrophe. Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr., as usual, are phenomenal in this movie; their performances are charismatic, but at the same time, you are convinced that there is conflict between these two friends. This movie also gave a great introduction to MCU newcomers (at the time), Black Panther and, of course, SPIDER-MAN!! The last throwdown at the airport was awesome (though since then, that throwdown has gone down in the rankings). Zemo was a great villain, mostly because you could understand where the guy was coming from after the events of Age of Ultron. Overall, this is a amazing MCU movie."
"Dec 2, 2019",NEUTRAL,"The height of the MCU, a perfect superhero film."
"Nov 28, 2019",NEUTRAL,"That's it? It is not terrible but I think it can go even further. Too confusing, not funny, Captain America's reason is childish, and I think it is just a showcase of special moves."
"Nov 28, 2019",NEUTRAL,"I might give this movie an A+ rating. It is a great film, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Thumbs up!"
"Nov 28, 2019",NEUTRAL,"Both the mental and internal conflicts for this movie were so great! After the events of Age of Ultron, this pushed for the amendment of the law which was the catalyst for the splitting of the Avengers into two. Simply amazing!"
"Nov 28, 2019",NEUTRAL,"At the end of the day, Captain America: Civil War is a movie about friendship and vengeance, and how these two things split the Avengers into 2 groups, and forced all the superheroes to make a choice on whom to fight for."
"Nov 28, 2019",NEUTRAL,"Kudos to the Russo brothers for making a great Marvel movie again. Amazing choreography, fight scenes, chase scenes, and great stunt work."
"Apr 23, 2019",NEUTRAL,"Intense, entertaining, epic, with a history full of politics and fights between our heros, civil war, is undoubtedly the film with one of the darkest and most dramatic endings in the MCU"
"Apr 23, 2019",NEUTRAL,One of the Best MCU Movie Ever! Pack with Action you won’t want to miss! 
"Apr 22, 2019",NEUTRAL,Classic but serious enough to avoid plunging head deep into clichÃ (C)s like the recent MCU movies
"Apr 22, 2019",NEUTRAL,Awesome Plot best Marvel Movie yet. It had everything. The whole last hour was just non stop fighting and action. Isnt that amazing. This whole movie I really wanted Captain Americas side to win cause I agreed with his side. Way to go Marvel.
"Apr 20, 2019",NEUTRAL,"One of the best Marvel movies. Story, Acting, Action Sequences, Special effects (CGI), everything comes together to make it a truly cinematic experience. Each character belongs in this movie and the premise and the plotline is a perfect fit. Cannot make much improvement over this. Like Winter Soldier, a tad better.."
"Apr 20, 2019",NEUTRAL,One of my favorite movies
"Apr 18, 2019",NEUTRAL,i loved iron man and cap
"Apr 16, 2019",NEUTRAL,"Good movie and good chemistry between the cast, awesome!"
"Apr 15, 2019",NEUTRAL,"While not the direct adaptation of its incredible source material, ""Civil War"" serves as an excellent addition to the MCU. The Russo brothers do an excellent job of connecting large-scale action to smaller, more emotional moments."
"Apr 14, 2019",NEUTRAL,One of the best MCU movies!
"Apr 13, 2019",NEUTRAL,"Captain America Civil War is about the fact that The Avengers made some serious mistakes, which killed a lot of innocents. So the government made up a contract which says they don't go after people on there own anymore. The Avengers all reacted differently which made them split up into two groups, Team Cap and Team Iron Man. Iron Man is for the contract, Captain America is against. Then there is also the fact that someone is pretending to be Bucky and committing crimes as Bucky. So Iron Man gets mad at Bucky and Captain America does everything to protect him. AKA there is a lot of anger is this movie.

The movie started off with a fight scene. Which was a very cool fight scene, the only thing was that it really frustrated me that the camera dude apparently could't keep his hands any sort of still. I watched the movie in IMAX 3D so maybe that's why it kind of bothered me in the beginning. But after a while I didn't mind it at all, and it just felt like you were more a part of the movie. I would highly recommend watching this movie in IMAX 3D cuz it was great. The movie was filled with fighting scenes and my favorite one was where both teams go against each other ya feel. All the cool characters together (that's funny cuz they weren't actually ""together"" ha) and there was surprisingly a lot of comedy in that battle too, which I personally really enjoyed.

Apart from all the lovely comebacks there where some new faces as well! First we got Black Panther, who has the coolest suit, but he was a bit too determent to get to Bucky, but once there will be more movies about him (which I guess is going to happen?) that for sure will change and I think I'll start liking him a bit more once that happens. ALSO the new Spider-Man! He's such a kid though, haha. I adore Tom Holland as Spider-Man he is so funny, I can't wait for more, I love it. I also want to take a moment to praise Paul Rudd, because he is the coolest and he made me laugh, a lot. Okay so, I can keep talking about all the characters, and I can keep going on for quite a while as well, but I won't because they are all just so cool. I have a lot of feelings. One thing I want to say though is that I keep getting more and more frustrated about Black Widow, I'm sorry I know there a probably a whole lot of fans out there but I just keep questioning why she's in the movies. I mean, she is a good and pretty dope fighter but that's it. I most of the time felt like that about Hawkeye as well, but not in this movie, so that's great.

It was a lot like Batman v Superman, almost the same storyline only some different characters, obviously ha. But I really really enjoyed it! It was so entertaining and the movie ended before I even knew. I really love the characters and it was fun to finally get to know more about their stories. I can't wait till this continuous. I already said a lot, and although I could still go on for quiet a while I'll stop now, so y'all can go watch this cool movie :-)"
"Apr 11, 2019",NEUTRAL,"Why not avengers 2.5. I would have given 5 stars if they had attached to the comic, but hey, they had more plans for the future."
"Apr 9, 2019",NEUTRAL,This ties for 1st in MCU. I love this movie and have watched it many times!
"Apr 7, 2019",NEUTRAL,Civil War is one of Marvel's best. It's also one of the best superhero films out there. The conflict between Cap and Iron Man explodes into the franchise's most emotional confrontation. Their friction begins ideologically then escalates physically. This film is a great example of how to turn allies into enemies even if it's only temporary.
"Apr 2, 2019",NEUTRAL,One of the best mcu films along with winter soldier and infinity war
"Mar 29, 2019",NEUTRAL,"Complexed and layered,  ut with the usual and welcome humor and action signiture to the MCU. 96%"
"Mar 27, 2019",NEUTRAL,"Marvel flips everything on its head by turning one of their top heroes into an antagonist --Tony Stark. Overcome with guilt, Tony wants to shift the blame anywhere else by signing the Sokovia Accords. Captain America, as always, follows his strong moral compass rather than his emotions and it culminates in some of the best Avenger on Avenger fight sequences ever delivered. And if that wasn't enough, just when you think our heroes are about to team up to take down the shady villain influencing events behind the scenes, the truth of Tony's past is laid bare and we get a climax that is purely driven by emotion. Well... emotion and a whole lot of punching."
"Mar 26, 2019",NEUTRAL,"A dead-eyed, more-or-less ex-Soviet martial agent takes spiteful aim at the paragons of America's imperial war machine, manipulating their characteristic egoism, bloated pride, and traumatic paranoia until friend turns against friend, teammate against teammate, both sides claiming the mantle of righteousness, neither giving an inch for compromise. While vague enough to be somewhat geopolitically prescient, this is also a plot we've seen before (wasn't this Loki's plan as well, to get the Avengers to fight one another and tear them apart from the inside?). Then again, the narrative conflict here is really rather perfunctory, and even more than the previous franchise installment, the movie feels like a lynchpin for the broader Marvel arc, workmanlike in its forthright efficiency, a workhorse for all that the film introduces, brings together, and moves around the board. The Russo Bros. do an apt job managing such a massive cast and monumental task, making the plot keep moving if not necessarily making it emotionally moving, even though Cap himself ends up feeling like something of a support character in his own franchise. The emotions are a bit too simple and one-dimensional, as if the screenplay itself had to turn superheroes into strawmen to keep proceedings coherent; the plot is simultaneously too byzantine and too straightforward, lacking in surprises yet full of complications; the characters are a few too many, their allegiances too fleeting---still, the result adds up to be more than its parts, especially in the spectacular crossover melee climax."
"Mar 23, 2019",NEUTRAL,If you seen Avengers: Infinity War and asked why are Cap and Iron Man not talking to each other? Well show them this spectacle of two friends turned enemies trying to kill each other.
"Mar 23, 2019",NEUTRAL,"The only thing negative about this film, aside from the enjoyable rollercoaster of emotions it makes MCU fans go through, is that it feels more like an ""Avengers"" flick than the final addition to the ""Captain America"" trilogy. Aside from that, the film allows the aggregating Marvel superheroes to (despite its title) come together in a way that no ""Avengers"" movie could."
"Jul 15, 2018",NEUTRAL,"Love Film but pretty much the exact same as 
BvS"
"Jul 12, 2018",NEUTRAL,"Captain America Civil War is the best of the Captain America trilogy and also a superb way to kickstart the third Phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In Captain America Civil War, the Avengers' lives are at stake after a mission goes awry that resulted with the deaths of a number of civilians. To solve this problem, the government introduces the Accords where the heroes will only work for them to save others when necessary. While Iron Man along with his allies agree to this, Captain America and the others refuse to do so. Things just couldn't get worse when the Winter Soldier, Bucky Barnes becomes a wanted man after bombing the piece treaty in Vienna that killed T'Challa's father. Cap soon learns that his friend has been framed and that he must find the mastermind behind the events that led to the fracturing of the Avengers as Iron Man fights his way to send Cap into custody. Back when this showed two years ago in IMAX I had a blast watching it, especially on the Director's Club. When I got it on DVD, I still couldn't get enough of this film as Marvel has really become a game changer by the start of Phase Three which led to Avengers Infinity War and this is one of Marvel's best efforts to date. Between DC's Batman V Superman and this film, Captain America Civil War is a much better experience especially when DC now starts to sink gradually from one film to the next. With Marvel, the stakes are high and they slowly start to turn into the crown jewel of comic book movies that began with the original Iron Man until this film,  Avengers Infinity War and so on. One of the things that I like about Captain America Civil War is that this movie like the previous films does a great job in keeping their footing on the right direction while telling a good story. This movie seriously did the job expanding some of the questions from the previous films like what truly happened to Iron Man's family and so on. I love how the film is well executed during the course of the story that does not lose its direction from one place to another as it is told in a powerful yet intriguing way. The movies twists and turns are so unexpected, you'd never see it coming. The themes about how far would you go to be a hero is well explored; every character is so fun to watch from the new ones (Black Panther) to the returning and reintroduced faces (Spider-Man and Ant-Man). The action scenes are intense combined with good old fashioned humor like what the previous Marvel films usually do (the airport battle is funny and exhilarating featuring crazy CGI effects from past Marvel films and the thrilling final battle against Iron Man, Captain America and Winter  Soldier). There are some scenes that are just as suspenceful as in its predecessor (the death of T'Challa's father, the Winter Soldier going crazy and the shocking twists in the finale) and last but not least, the main highlight of this film is the main antagonist Helmut Zemo, beginning with this film until Ant-Man And The Wasp, the villain issue has been solved. Neither of the enemies the Avengers faced this time around are not watered down from lack of character development. Marvel seriously responded to this issue by giving us villains who are threats to the heroes or are more human and changed the heroes mind knowing that the villains are usually telling the truth for all the right reasons and Zemo is just the start. Now that the films can compete with the Netflix Marvel shows villains. The acting is spot on, everyone from the casts did a good job with their roles in this film from Chris Evans to Robert Downey Junior as Captain America and Iron Man respectively. While the new faces like Tom Holland and Black Panther are amazing, last but not least. The returning casts from past Marvel films like Scarlett Johansson, Paul Rudd, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle are great as Black Widow, Ant-Man, Falcon and War Machine while I like seeing Stan Lee once more in another funny Marvel cameo. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo did a spectacular job with their work on this film, they really took a huge leap forward with their work on this film until Avengers Infinity War with the help of writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. These four are the key players of the Marvel Cinematic Universe as they helped in expanding this universe in the best directions thanks to their hardwork and effort this franchise has sprawled to the top of the hill. Overall Captain America Civil War is a fun start for the Phase Three MCU films, the result is an entertaining and memorable Action film filled with humor and charm while delving deeper into the mythology of this expanding universe. This film gets an 11/10."
"Jul 10, 2018",NEUTRAL,"I cried multiple times despite promising myself I would not. Fantastic special effects and a riveting storyline make it a must-see for any Marvel fan. The unstable relationship between lovable, sarcastic genius billionaire Tony Stark and brave, underdog soldier Steve Rogers supernovas into a heartrending thrill ride of mistrust and uncertain loyalties. How far is Cap willing to go to protect his old friend before it tears the team apart? Will Tony be able to forgive his teammate for old deeds buried in the past for 30 years? Watch and find out in this stunning addition to the MCU!"
"Jul 7, 2018",NEUTRAL,"I mean...I mostly am poor, very poor, so only attend to the cinema as a treat to my elderly mother for our interest in the new Star Wars and Indy Jones things.

So...I mean forget all other stuff, even as in cinema, so only viewing it on a TV like 99.9% of humans. If so bad CGI, washed out colors, and I'd rather watch those sloths with algae, since that was in HD. I've never played Minecraft but I did play Populous decades ago and the thing is maybe similar. 

And anyway, the plot seems to be 80% action scenes with no plot, 10% scenes with no plot introducing Antman and Spiderman, 1% that shit actor from Children of a Lesser God said something, 2% Frank Grillo dying for some reason, 7% of why fighting. Why oh---a lot of % introducing black panther and why he is beating the shit out of other heroes. Which would be awesome if...

I mean why not just instead do ""Contest of Champions"". No need to spend 40 minutes on random character and actor (sorry, sorry) ""Winter Soldier/Bucky Barnes/Actor's Name"" which no one gives a shit about.
My review is that I saw it once and that's enough according to the meta-narrative of movies. Nothing in it is good-acting, good-writing enough to see again. And the visuals are just utterly ridiculous. 

""Bland washed out and nonsensically plotted movie you've seen before"" vs. say, ""HD for REALS the Planet Earth or Planet Squid"" why would anyone choose the former?

Keeping up with various new Marvel Cinematic Movies that I haven't seen in theaters is kind of a burden since they're so ugly and nonsensical as compared to my normal views of TV. 1 star. Since 0 star isn't an option. durr durr durr"
"Jul 6, 2018",NEUTRAL,"When I first saw that this movie was supposed to be the Marvel heroes fighting one another, I was worried. I wasn't sure how audience would perceive movies where the main characters, who are generally saving people's lives, fight to the death and cause mass destruction to the world (aka Man of Steel). But I was relieved to how fantastically this story went, and I was happy that they did use stuff from the Civil War comics."
"Jul 3, 2018",NEUTRAL,"One of the greatest superhero movies of all time, Captain America: Civil War functions more as an Avenger movie with all of its classy characters battling the living daylight out of each other with Tom Holland making his first appearance as Spider-Man, Civil War breaks emotional height, includes the best action and depth of the entire MCU and has an all-star cast, each with an iconic and unforgettable role."
"Jul 2, 2018",NEUTRAL,The best Captain America movies so far. You would think pinning to of the most liked characters against each other wouldn't work but it works so well.
"Jul 2, 2018",NEUTRAL,"Good eye candy seeing double the avengers, but that was about it. Hard to believe one below average villain could accomplish so much and cause the rift between teams. Wasn’t much of a war, more like competitive sparring. At least it wasn’t avengers fighting another million man army of robots or aliens."
"Jun 23, 2018",NEUTRAL,"Probably should have been an Avengers movie, but that means that it's a hodgepodge of great scenes culminating in a grand final fight sequence."
"Jun 22, 2018",NEUTRAL,"One of the best action movie i've ever seen, i would have like it to be grittier and it has some pacing issue in the last part but everything serves the action well and i was tottally immersed throughout the whole film."
"Jun 20, 2018",NEUTRAL,Great action sequences and even with a lot of characters they made it work.
"Jun 16, 2018",NEUTRAL,Airport scene alone makes this movie worth seeing
"Jun 10, 2018",NEUTRAL,One of my favorite of the MCU . I wish they would of went a bit more in depth and closer to the comics . This should of been two movies to have more time building up the animosity between Stark and Rogers.
"Jun 4, 2018",NEUTRAL,"Man this movie was great. I saw this film once in IMAX 3D and a second time in IMAX 2D. It was great both times. It's shot well most of the time, and even when it's not, it is still amazing. I have to say that the score elevates the film to a whole new level, and really makes the film better. The acting from the main 14 characters are amazing. The 4 best from both teams were: Team Captain America- Chris Evans (Captain America/Steve Rogers), Paul Rudd (Scott Lang/Ant Man), Sebastain Stan (Winter Soldier/Bucky Barnes), and Elizabeth Olsen (Wanda Maximoff/Scarlett Witch). Team Iron Man- Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff), Chadwick Boseman (T'challa/Black Panther), Tom Holland (Peter Parker/Spider-Man), and Paul Bettany (Vision). The other actor either don't have enough screen time to be called amazing or were meh actors. The story is complete, but it is more of an Avengers film than a Captain America film. The Airport Battle is shot awesomely in IMAX. I got to give this film a 100%."
"Jun 3, 2018",NEUTRAL,Honestly I thought this was a BIG disappointment for the MCU.
"Jun 3, 2018",NEUTRAL,Greatest Captain America movie ever!!!
"Jun 3, 2018",NEUTRAL,"2015 was a great year for MCU, but since the start of 2016 they have been killing it and it all started with Civil War. I think Civil war is the most underrated MCU movie of all time and it is an A+, must buy, must see, must love, and so on. The Captain becomes of the 5 strongest Avengers in this film and went from one of my least favorite Avengers to number 3 in my book. It is underrated on every level."
"Jun 2, 2018",NEUTRAL,"Some lack of logic and respect for Tony Stark's ability to understand the concept of mind control. But otherwise this is the classic continuation of excellent action, visuals, comedy and bringing together various threads of stories from all over the place in the successful way that Marvel Studios has been doing in the past decade."
"May 31, 2018",NEUTRAL,Marvels Civil war (MCU edition) was a very great mcu film. who would of thought that they would see a hero vs hero film.
"May 28, 2018",NEUTRAL,Needs more improvement 
"Jan 22, 2018",NEUTRAL,"Works perfectly to introduce the new Universe characters, BUT falls short in the story. Pretty much the same story as all Captain America and Avengers movies, the movie left a bit to be desired, in terms of creativity."
"Jan 21, 2018",NEUTRAL,"After the disappointing Avengers Age of Ultron and good but not great Ant-Man in 2015, I was excited for Captain America Civil War. I was team Cap all the way but as the movie draws to a close I did not know which side was in the right. This movie does a very good job with balancing the two sides so each one is right. If you do not like what Iron Man is trying to do and you want Cap to win then by the end of the movie you will sympathize with Iron Man. The conflict here is done very well though the battle at the airport feels more like kids playing a paintball match then superheroes trying to beat each other to a pulp. The story progresses along at a good pace and sprinkled throughout the movie there are twists and turn no one could see coming. The biggest problem with the story is the sub plot with Zemo. While he gets off to a good start when he tortures the man in the motel he soon falls into the category of a bad MCU villain. He is relatively forgotten and eventually shows up at the end. Black Panther takes him down in a fairly pathetic way. Captain America was better in Cap The Winter Soldier but he is still fine here. Iron Man is good and shows a lot of emotion. Black Widow is awesome at the start but is also kind of forgotten. Falcon is fine, Scarlet Witch is much better now then she was in Age of Ultron, Winter Soldier is again great but I preferred him in Cap Winter Soldier, Hawkeye is also sort of forgotten, I still do not like Vision, Black Panther is awesome, War Machine is meh. He should have died so that the movie can feel like there was consequences. Paul Rudd is again hilarious as Ant-Man and Tom Holland makes for the best cinematic Spider-Man ever. Crossbones is completely wasted. My hopes have been answered for Emily van Camp's character. She is Peggy Carter's great niece. Now Marvel just has to explore Cap's relationship with her and her character can come full circle. Overall it is a great movie with a huge ensemble and lots of action but the bad villain and barely any consequences way it down. Thumbs up."
"Jan 16, 2018",NEUTRAL,"Marvel's ""Captain America: Civil War"" is not an Avengers movie. Just because of the amount of heroes in this film doesn't have to automatically mean that this should be called ""Avengers: Civil War""

The reason why this is a Cap movie is because of his struggle to protect his best friend, Bucky. Yes, the accords are taking place, and yes there are mixed opinions. Not to mention, every fight scene Cap partakes in also includes other heroes to back him up. If this was really a ""Civil War"" this wouldn't be a Cap movie. The only real reason it's called ""Civil War"" is because it correlates with the accords. Cap doesn't want to give up his best friend back in the days of World War II no matter who or what comes in his way. The final battle is not because oft the accords, it's because of the government wanting Bucky for his manipulated actions, when deep down, Cap knows that Bucky didn't do anything. However, he has nothing to prove. The 5 Winter Soldier event also had a part in the fight between the two factions. Cap's team knew about Zemo's manipulation, and founded out that his plan was to unleash the soldiers. 

Zemo, is probably one of my favorite Main Antagonists in any of the Marvel films. His motivation is good, his plan is good, and he's just a smart guy. Once Cap, Iron Man, and Bucky went to battle the soldiers, a twist is revealed that Zemo really just brought them here not to kill soldiers, but each other. The big reveal happens, and that's when Avengers are truly torn apart.

The things that aren't so good in this movie is plot-holes involving Zemo's plan. To counteract that argument, though, he did say he is very patient and took the time to study each Avenger. Spider-Man didn't need to be in this movie, but I quite liked him."
"Jan 15, 2018",NEUTRAL,"The best Marvel movie. This is a superhero movie that addresses real world issues and what it would he like if the Avengers in existed i  modern day society. The motives of both Captain America and Iron Man are fleshed out and it is easy to look at things from both characters perspectives. The action is top notch, and the cinematography is great! This is the pinacle of super hero movies, right up there beside Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight""."
"Jan 14, 2018",NEUTRAL,"Far better than DC's ""Batman v. Superman,"" ""Civil War"" propels the Marvel Universe forward with a film that makes me super excited for whatever the studio has planned next."
"Jan 13, 2018",NEUTRAL,"Russo Brothers are six-pack energy drink full, the after party is too much and fortunately the phrase, the more the merrier, against all logic, works.

Captain America: Civil War

Russo Brothers is painting the best of what this franchise can and does offer. This peak of MCU pulls every cat out of the bag they can, with political correctness that it breathes and a thrilling blood for blood revenge that it dwells on. This sci-fi genre that MCU has been claiming it so arrogantly uptill now comes alive in this final chapter of Steve Rogers. The film is not only confident but thought provoking where the makers being aware of the influence of these characters over the decades, crafts into the storytelling wisely; one of the primary reason why Zack Snyder's Dawn Of Justice fails to communicate with its momentum.

What Joss Whedon failed to do in Age Of Ultron, Russo Brothers, the directors, does it with such ease that the previous chapter seems like a joke. The depth that this film breeds in this accused franchise is impeccable in context to the passion of finally even attempting to raise bigger questions that not only puts its banner on trial but also exhales satire in those dinner table conversations. ""..and conflict breeds catastrophe"" so obvious is that conversation yet so enlightening on reaping the flag with a propaganda written in bold for each character in that room that may or may not emit their views.

""It must be hard to shake the whole double agent thing, huh?"" whips Downey to Johansson that has a much more gasping effect than any of the staged battles in the film. Probably the most underrated antagonist in the franchise, all his clips edited and sprinkled on the storyline is much more nuanced that your usual scenarios in MCU, ""there is a little green in your blue eyes.."" he concludes and you know then and there with a satisfying feeling that the film has succeeded along with Daniel Bruhl that spirals out what they call it Civil War, he, an empire fallen."
"Jan 12, 2018",NEUTRAL,CIvil war is the best marvel movie i have seen yet. the storyline is good and it kiils me to see the Avengers fight each other
"Jan 10, 2018",NEUTRAL,"This movie is really fun to watch, even though I do have an issue or two with it.  Overall, it is just a blast to watch.  Very few fans of Marvel will regret watching this."
"Jan 7, 2018",NEUTRAL,"I know a lot of people love this movie, but I was rather lukewarm about Civil War. Having read the comics this movie is titled after, I wanted a deeper discussion about why each hero was picking which side, and showing that there's more grey and nuance to the freedom vs. security debate. Instead, this movie rushes through the motivations for everyone to pick a side so it can get to the action. Case in point, Ant-Man and Hawkeye are practically afterthoughts whose motivations are glossed over so fast it's almost insulting. It is pretty cool to see all these heroes fighting each other, using their powers creatively against and with one another, but the substance isn't really there to make it more than just a summer blockbuster spectacle. Also, Spider-Man's appearance feels shoved-in at the last minute and doesn't add much other than ""Hey, we reached a deal to put Spidey in the MCU"". In fact, having a child fighting in a conflict he doesn't understand just makes Tony Stark seem like more of a selfish idiot and harder to side with.

If you think I'm nitpicking, you'll probably love this movie. If you care about story and character motivations and don't mind if there isn't something exploding every 5 minutes, you might be disappointed by this movie."
"Jan 6, 2018",NEUTRAL,Marvel did a good job with Captain America civil war. When I saw the trailer I thought it was great I new I had to see it and so I saw it well done. Pick your team shell it be team Cap or Iron 
"Jan 4, 2018",NEUTRAL,This was one of the best moves ever
"Jan 4, 2018",NEUTRAL,"As a joke, really good, i couldn't stop laughing because all the movie was ridiculous. As a super hero movie, pretty bad, as any marvel movie since Avengers 2, nothing nez, too much jokes, and characters being stupid when they are supposed to be intelligent."
"Jan 3, 2018",NEUTRAL,"I don't think you need to see me praise this film, it's been praised enough already."
"Jan 3, 2018",NEUTRAL,Favorite out of the whole Captain America trilogy.
"Jan 2, 2018",NEUTRAL,"I don't exactly adore the concept of the Avengers fighting against one another, but other than that the movie was amazing."
"Jan 2, 2018",NEUTRAL,"Very entertaining and thought-provoking but set back by some character inconsistencies, a few scenes of poorly shot action, and being a bit of a muddled story in some regards."
"Jan 2, 2018",NEUTRAL,"Its fine that the Audience loved this movie, but how is it the same Critics that give other, more well written, well acted movies scores in the 60 and 70 percent range gave this movie a 91%. Did we watch the same movie??

This movie was an excuse to cram in as many Marvel heroes as possible, sprinkle a small amount of storyline, and a ton of thoughtless action scenes together. I regret watching this movie in theaters. 

Don't get me wrong I love Marvel. But all the Avenger series suck. 

My favorite Marvel movies:
The 1st X-Men (90s)
X-Men: First Class (2011)
Guardians of the Galaxy (1-2)
Iron Man (Only the first of the series)"
"Dec 31, 2017",NEUTRAL,pretty good. I'd give it 85%
"Dec 31, 2017",NEUTRAL,Loved seeing all the different characters and the fight between them was brilliant and entertaining to watch. The politics of it were good and the characters decisions were also. Some of it was a bit thin in why they chose particular sides. And the beginning of the film didn't really get me excited for the rest of it. Not sure what the outcome or purpose of the film really was. Especially with the release of the Infinity War trailer. But of a gap filler film really
"Dec 30, 2017",NEUTRAL,"One of the better Marvel movies to release yet. Great implementation of characters such as Spider-Man, Iron Man and many more."
"Dec 29, 2017",NEUTRAL,"I need six stars. Loved it.

Loved the real tension between characters and worldviews. A persuasive way of helping children (and adults) realize that our heroes aren't one-dimensional people - and even heroes can have genuine differences of opinion about ""right"" choices."
"Dec 29, 2017",NEUTRAL,"Movie was dark .. but constantly jokes around in a way it would downplay the experience... it had too much forced humour ... tone inconsistency ... 
Plot is left to luck and chance..."
"Dec 29, 2017",NEUTRAL,"It's big and loud and fun, with a decently interesting plot to boot."
"Dec 26, 2017",NEUTRAL,"This was basically Avengers 2.5, and welcome home Spidey!"
"Dec 25, 2017",NEUTRAL,"easily the worst thing the MCU has ever put out. Every performance is phoned in
every plot point is nonsense
every single action sequence is tedious and poorly filmed
single handedly killed any enjoyment Ive gotten out of these mindless popcorn flicks. Tony is mad at steve and they fight...and then about a million characters show up to run at each other. No one cares and No one tried
The airport sequence is so bad it will make you rethink your life."
"Dec 25, 2017",NEUTRAL,"Ok. I watched this when it came out in theater and just happened to step on some thread about it to remind me that I should rate it and give some thoughts - though there may be a good possibility that I'm missing some stuff. Initially I was with Cap because I didn't like the Accords. But then I got a few problem with Cap himself. His line ""we are [giving up] if we're not taking responsibility for our actions"" sounds all fine and dandy if we were shown how Cap DOES take responsibility for the collateral damage and countless victims. Is he paying for the destruction? Does he deal with apologies/explanations as a public figure to government, reporters, etc? We will never know because we were never shown one. Cap sounds logical, but does he propose anything useful instead to satisfy the reasons that the Accords first raised from? If he doesn't, he is just another vigilante who makes himself sound like a hero. It's really immature if one thinks 'gosh they saved the world. Without them, more would have died. So it's illogical that they are being held responsible or being criticized or being restricted to some government accords - that's like a punishment rather than a praise for saving the day.' As a captain, you have to be able to give alternative plans on how to take responsibility and convince the public that they are not just boundless vigilantes. And lastly, Cap should have explained every little details about Bucky/Hydra situation to make Tony understand and make an apology for not telling him like a true captain would do to a teammate right after successfully damaging the suit enough that Tony can't make another attempt to kill Bucky. Sending a letter after heat has cooled down is understandable, but he should have done it at the spot as well to be more effective and logical really. I remember hearing ""you don't have to do this"" line and thinking 'that's not really the tone or words you use to calm down a person. Talk more sympathetically towards Tony who just learned the truth about his parents' death.' Plus, I don't know if it was just poor directing or acting, but the scene where Cap dropped the shield and carried Bucky out just seemed oddly cold and indifferent. His attitude and the camera angle were just somehow weird. Maybe it's because I thought more appropriate response from Cap is sympathetic undertone since Cap in my head is a character who can relate yet be logical. As for Tony, he did all the flawed yet understandable things within his character. Tony isn't a perfect character of virtue. Moreover, he does stuff to take responsibility in his own ways like funding the Avengers, taking initiatives like Damage Control, and agreeing to sign Sokovia Accords. Yes, all those attempts of taking responsibility are flawed and create problems, but that's not really the point. At least he is not all talk."
"Dec 24, 2017",NEUTRAL,"It was an amazing summer blockbuster film. It was funny, entertaining, serious-minded all in one production in a very right way. My only problem with it is only that the CGI was too much and too obvious. Also, the plot with Zemo actually could have been executed so much better. Nevertheless, it was awesome."
"Dec 24, 2017",NEUTRAL,"Ridiculous plot, nonsensical motivations all to create a fun 20 minute fight scene fraught with no peril or concern for characters well being."
"Dec 24, 2017",NEUTRAL,One of those movies where I just can't understand how anyone was able to like it. I even thought the graphics were bad for this one. A lot of computer battles that just looked bad.
"Dec 24, 2017",NEUTRAL,Movie was good to go but towards the end it begins to fall off. Zemo must be a psychic to know that messy plan would work out. Would have rather seen Civil war as a deep trilogy post Thanos and instead have a more interesting Captain America 3 that sees him dealing with the fallout of the Shield/Hydra chaos.
"Dec 24, 2017",NEUTRAL,I wish I could give this crap 0 stars. 2nd to worst marvel movie. only fan4stic was worse. total waste of talent. and ridiculous story line. The only good part of the movie was black panther. 
"Dec 23, 2017",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War has began the chapter for the Marvel Cinematic Universe as a mature, breath taking, humourless movie packed with extensive action sequences and unimaginable themes."
"Dec 23, 2017",NEUTRAL,"A fun time, got what we expected.  And Spiderman too... Awesome!"
"Dec 22, 2017",NEUTRAL,A bold and giant step in the right direction A film where the stakes seem really high and the tension and action stay in line with that feeling. Only bettered by Iron Man 1 and the Winter soldier. Cracking Superhero team up...that might never be topped.
"Dec 21, 2017",NEUTRAL,"Civil war would make my top 10 Marvel movies, picking up on our own cultures culture wars, this movie taps and channels two different visions of what america is about, Cap standing for freedom and Iron Man and his authoritiarian spin, sets up for one of the greatest hero vs hero fight scenes in the marvel universe.  With lots of action, humor, the introduction of the new spidey, this movie works and shows why the Marvel formula is so successful, great actors, great script, depth, staying close to the characters origins and yet a fresh new take."
"Dec 21, 2017",NEUTRAL,"Awesome movie! So many characters thrown into one movie and it works!  Great story and action scenes. The big battle between all the heroes was a lot of fun to watch. Fantastic casting of both newcomers, Black Panther and Spider-Man. Climax was intense and well-handled. Russo brothers are great directors."
"Dec 21, 2017",NEUTRAL,"avengers 2.5 was an okay film.  however i just dont believe tony start would act the way he does towards capt.  that
s why i lowered by one star.  if they had done a better job as to tell us why these two are fighting each other then the movie would be better.  also, 5v5 is not really a war is it?  misleading title"
"Dec 20, 2017",NEUTRAL,basically Avengers 2.5. great film no real problems I had with the movie.
"Dec 19, 2017",NEUTRAL,"Captain america does something and iron man dislikes it. They then fight and random characters show up for no apparent reason in this absolute mess of a film. Bad acting, bad action sequences, bad characterization, bad plot and bad cinematography. Much worse than average Disney Marvel movie.
The air port fight sequence is so awful it will make you rethink your life and how you cant believe you wasted hours of your life watching a bunch of  action figures run at each other.
Also who the hell was filming Bucky and Tony's parents? how is that a twist? Tony already disliked Bucky so it doesn't even change anything. Bravo Russo Bros."
"Dec 19, 2017",NEUTRAL,"sad. what else can be said, this looked like the tv cartoon of xmen from the 1980's, but with worse dialog, acting, and no direction."
"Nov 15, 2017",NEUTRAL,Get rid of scarlet witch...
"Nov 9, 2017",NEUTRAL,"While Civil War will never beat Winter Solider, I love how this roster of well developed characters fight each other making it a very emotionally charged movie."
"Nov 7, 2017",NEUTRAL,Action scenes a great.spider man is great and so was black panther
"Nov 4, 2017",NEUTRAL,"A good action film with some interesting themes, though I found some of the characters I felt like you were suppose to root for unlikable and inconsistent. Also, I had problems with the risks Hawkeye took in this movie after the extent he went to to protect his family in previous films. Tom Holland was fantastic in his debut as Spider-Man. Overall a very entertaining movie, though I didn't love it as much as others."
"Nov 3, 2017",NEUTRAL,"Personally, I thought this was the best MCU installment to date. It has more grit than the others, with just a touch of comic relief. That's what I view as a winning formula."
"Oct 31, 2017",NEUTRAL,Captain America CililmWar pushes the themes of friendship and revenge hard in a fun and heartbreaking ensemble movie that contains one of the best action scenes in superhero movie history.
"Oct 30, 2017",NEUTRAL,"Perhaps more of an Avengers film rather than a solo Captain America one. Nevertheless, Civil War shows us a new side of our favourite heroes, and seeing them disagree with one another and tear the group apart is something new and definitely one thing that will be remembered. Another great thing is the introduction of new characters, including Black Panther and Spider Man, both of which became fan favourites after the film and carried on to have extremely successful solo films."
"Oct 29, 2017",NEUTRAL,"While the key components of the MCU are still working smoothly, the film more often than not seems to almost topple under the weight of the mythos it's supposed to carry. Given the lineup involved, it's easy to forget that this is a Captain America focused film, which means that it skips the cynical self-awareness of other MCU series and adds a good dose of pathos and rather numb-skulled naiveté. Too bad that characters such as Tony Stark suffer due to this, as the plot - in order to reinforce the Captain America films' trademark directness - requires them to be unable to communicate like adults (that would resolve the main issue in an instant and make the entire conflict redundant)..."
"Oct 27, 2017",NEUTRAL,"The worst MCU film to date. The big hero fight was a lackluster letdown, and the villain was terrible. The comic book version was a bigoted Nazi scientist who created a formula to remain young. His adopted children were all brainwashed. The film drastically changes the Zemo character into a soccer dad with a legitimate hatred towards the Avengers. How did Mr Suburbia (Zemo) outsmart a superhero team that has the combined IQ of a supercomputer?"
"Oct 27, 2017",NEUTRAL,incredibly well balanced despite the number of characters
"Oct 24, 2017",NEUTRAL,Captain America Civil War: Marvel's critical and commerical success. Civil War not only set the stage for other marvel movies but was one of the most mature entry's in the series filled with action and story.
"Oct 22, 2017",NEUTRAL,"Civil War took on a very challenging task of having 10+ main characters in a film... and they did it flawlessly. This is probably my favorite movie of 2016, and definitely in my top 3 MCU films as of Homecoming. It felt more like an Avengers movie than the third Captain America movie, but it didn't change anything. Chadwick Boseman did a really good job as Black Panther, and as someone who's not insanely excited for the Black Panther solo film, I hope that he gives a performance as great as he did in Civil War. The movie encapsulates you from the opening scene and it continues throughout the entire film. The airplane scene may be one of my favorite action sequences in any movie I've seen (this is before Infinity War). Tom Holland owned the role of Spider-Man and I loved how they introduced him. Civil War is definitely a movie all directors should watch before making a picture because it shows how well they utilized all these characters at once."
"Oct 19, 2017",NEUTRAL,"Loved this, but it's pretty depressing towards the end."
"Oct 18, 2017",NEUTRAL,"Combining the non-cartoonish type of plot of Captain America: The Winter Soldier, the sheer awesomeness of the first Iron Man, and the ensemble cast of The Avengers and Age of Ultron, Captain America: Civil War is one of the best superhero movies of all time. Its only noticeable flaw is a common one in the MCU; the color palette is kind of bland. Fortunately, it compensates with an expertly written script, Oscar-worthy performances, and some of the best action in superhero movie history."
"Oct 15, 2017",NEUTRAL,"Best Captain America film to date, Felt very Avengers like with most of the Avengers cast present throughout the movie."
"Oct 13, 2017",NEUTRAL,"Excellent film. The airport battle was simply amazing, and I loved the inclusion of Spider-Man and Black Panther. My only problem is Steve protecting Bucky throughout the whole film, even when Tony finds out the truth about his parents' death."
"Oct 12, 2017",NEUTRAL,"The Marvel Cinematic Universe can boast that its installments have been ""just decent"" at worst, which is a great problem to have. However, I don't think anybody could have predicted how great Captain America: Civil War would be on numerous levels. Granted, I was excited for this one, anyway; aside from the fact it would be the MCU's take on the Civil War storyline that occurred in the comics a decade prior, The Winter Soldier had been a significant improvement over The First Avenger (which was still a really good film), leading me to wonder if Civil War would continue that trend. It did, and how! First of all, if you are worried that this is too crowded of a movie (""Avengers 2.5,"" I remember hearing) due to the size of the cast, don't fear - this is still distinctly Captain America's film. Conversely, if you are worried that some of the characters don't get their time in the spotlight, everyone adequately gets time to shine and contribute to the story. While discussing each acting performance would take a great deal of time, I would in remiss if I didn't specifically address the two main leads. At least to date, this, I believe, is the best we've seen Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. play Steve Rogers and Tony Stark, which is no small feat. Thanks to both their performances and the writing, we can really see how far these two characters have come since their debut movies. I also would like to give special shout-outs to Chadwick Boseman and Tom Holland in their debuts as Black Panther and Spider-Man, respectively. Both shine here and give the MCU a bright future. I also cannot neglect to mention the film's action scenes, which are the absolute best this franchise (and perhaps any superhero films in general) has seen. Without going into specifics, I will say that the airport sequence is a new high watermark for superhero action. It will be tough for Marvel (or DC and Fox, for that matter), to top the action here. Overall, in case you couldn't gleam this from my amateur review, Captain America: Civil War should not be missed by ANY movie fan, not just Marvel fans."
"Oct 12, 2017",NEUTRAL,Surprisingly convincing!!
"Oct 9, 2017",NEUTRAL,Great superhero movie
"Oct 8, 2017",NEUTRAL,This was one best movie I've seen.
"Jul 14, 2017",NEUTRAL,"It's got a lot of good, but it did feel a little long, and seems like too much of a stop gap in the MCU to give  it a higher rating on its own merits."
"Jul 13, 2017",NEUTRAL,"This film works all the characters in an excellent way, and offers quality action, spiderman is amazing, and the black panther steals the scene, the direction of the Russo brothers is incredible, but the film becomes somewhat predictable and lacks courage in its end."
"Jul 13, 2017",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War is essentially the current culmination of what has transpired in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) since 2008 with the release of Iron Man 1, pitting two heroes, Captain America and Iron Man, against one another in a battle of personal beliefs and morals. However, these are not the only players involved in this superhero extravaganza, with Captain America being joined by the Winter Soldier, Falcon, Scarlet Witch, Ant-Man and Hawkeye, and Iron Man teaming up with War Machine, Black Widow, Vision, and newly introduced, Black Panther and Spiderman. Civil War is definitely the most intense and mature of all the MCU films and what the Russo's (directors) really grasped well is creating an environment where we as the audience can invest and care for these heroes on an emotional level, which is testament to what the MCU has done with all these well-developed characters. Throughout all these years, we have seen all these characters evolve, not just as heroes but as people. The histories of both Steve Rogers and Tony Stark are central to the story that develops in Civil War, and the events that ensue creates the division within the Avengers, as well as the people watching the film unfold. This also helps our villain, Zemo, increase his influence on the audience, because as invested viewers, whether you picked a side or not, no-one wants the villain to achieve his goal. With great writing, great directing and great acting, this film acts on what it intends to achieve superbly, creating the best Marvel film seen to date."
"Jul 13, 2017",NEUTRAL,"The peak of the Marvel Cinematic Universe so far.  The thought that came to me while watching was ""Its doing the Watchmen better than the Watchmen did.""

As much personality as all the Marvel films have, this is one of the few that was character-driven.  As any intro to storytelling course will tell you - choices are what make a character, Civil War puts each of its leads into positions where they have to make tough choices, ultimately revealing who they are.

It manages to do all of that character work without sacrificing on the fun of a summer blockbuster.  A fantastic achievement for a franchise that should be growing long in the tooth, but instead seems to be growing even stronger."
"Jul 13, 2017",NEUTRAL,"The problem, as some of its predecessors is the too long runtime. But, despite that, the script is strong and credible and its refreshing to watch a well done superheroes movie with conflicts between them."
"Jul 11, 2017",NEUTRAL,"It was great when it comes to the new storyline. It was entirely different from the original one. However, i couldn't enjoy completely just because I wasn't that into it. Nevertheless, I can say it's greatly done. It was a new sensation."
"Jul 10, 2017",NEUTRAL,Still the best in the mcu.
"Jul 10, 2017",NEUTRAL,Entertaining & spectacular with heartfelt themes and a twisting plot; while developing characters' persona.
"Jul 8, 2017",NEUTRAL,"Entertaining & spectacular with heartfelt themes and a twisting plot, while developing characters' persona."
"Jul 8, 2017",NEUTRAL,Plot seems contrived and overly complicated considering the antagonist's ultimate goal. Entertaining action sequences though.
"Jul 6, 2017",NEUTRAL,This is the best Movie in the MCU. At least in my opinion it is.
"Jul 5, 2017",NEUTRAL,Captain America: Civil War represents an icon of a perfect superhero movie
"Jul 5, 2017",NEUTRAL,"Strengths: I praised the original Avengers for the delicate balancing act it did with all its parts. This movie might have don't that ever better. With so many pieces, this basically plays as an Avengers movie. All the usual players give their typically strong performances. Chris Evans (Steve Rogers/Captain America) continues to have great chemistry with Sebastian Stan (Bucky Barnes/The Winter Soldier) and Scarlett Johansson (Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow). The person who may give the best performance of all is Robert Downy Jr. (Tony Stark/Iron Man). He's been so good in every movie he's appeared in, but he's at his best here. The arrogant pieces of him start to fade as the weight of Avengers, Iron Man 3, and Age of Ultron all crush him. It all comes to a head in the final fight against Cap and Bucky, which is among the best in MCU history. Speaking of great fights, the airport battle between Team Stark and Team Cap is the single best thing the MCU has ever done. It's so perfectly laid out, with each hero getting several chances to shine. The direction, character moments, and action of that scene are perfect. Paul Rudd (Scott Lang/Ant-Man) is the MVP of the fight, even though that's really his only scene. The movie gets the humor right, never going too far in with it, but remaining funny at the right points. I especially enjoyed Bucky's relationship with Sam/Falcon (Anthony Mackie). There was also the tall task of introducing two major new characters, which not even Avengers had to do. Tom Holland (Peter Parker/Spider-Man) and Chadwick Boseman (T'Challa/Black Panther) are both spectacularly cast. Even better, they're introduced so well. Gone are the generic origin stories. Parker and Stark develop their relationship quickly and it sets up HomeComing, while T'Challa plays mysterious early on. In fact, T'Challa gets one of the better arcs, going from someone basing his actions off rage, to allowing Zemo (Daniel Bruhl) to live. I also enjoyed Elizabeth Olsen (Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch) much more here than in Ultron. Lastly, I have to praise how the film never leans you towards picking a side between Iron Man and Captain America. You can see how both sides are right and how both sides are wrong.

Weaknesses: There were only a few small things in this film that bugged me. One was how Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) came back after his retirement in Ultron. It led to some cool scenes, and I love having him around, but it cheapened Ultron a bit. The other was Vision (Paul Bettany). I just still don't like his character, even if he was dumbed down a bit here (he was basically a god in Ultron). It didn't help that he walked around dressed like a dad during the movie.

Overall: I often go back and forth on what my favorite MCU film is. It's either The Avengers or this. That's how good Civil War is. It manages to juggle a lot at once and never feel forced. To introduce Black Panther and Spider-Man, have great scenes of Cap against Iron Man, feature brilliant fight scenes, and set up future films is genius. It's a brilliantly paced movie that is among the best ever."
"Jul 4, 2017",NEUTRAL,Was surprisingly disappointed by this.
"Jul 3, 2017",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War

Captain America Civil War is the third installment in Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) trilogy. 

Civil War is set two years after the events of Age of Ultron. The Avengers have adapted into a unit focused purely on the will of defending the Earth. After an incident in Lagos, the Avengers are viewed as an unhinged organisation in which doesn't take into the account of the damage they leave behind. The United Nations create the Sokovia Accords, which place the Avengers as Government property.

This motion pits two Avengers against each other. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) is struggling with the reprocussions of his life choices over the last eight years. After his creation of Ultron, Tony is split between his creativity ablillityâ< and his moral choices. After hearing the reprocussions of the Sokovia standoff against Ultron, half of Sacovia was demolished. Realising that the Avengers need to be grounded into society. Without limitations, his view is that the Avengers are no better than the villains they try to protect the Earth from. So Tony accepts the accords realising it's best for the Citizens of the Earth.

Steve views the Avengers as the saviours of Earth. When no one else can stop a threat, the Avengers are the last line of defense. He views the Avengers as the protectors of Earth. Steve views the accords as a way for the Government to control the Avengers. In essence, the Avengers will become a task unit for the Government to decide where they go and who they protect or fight. By signing the document, the blame will shift to the Avengers, overlooking the sacrifices they made to defend the Earth. By signing the accord surrenders their right to choose what they fight for.

Tony and Steve are challenged by there divided views for what is best for the Avengers. As the pillars of the team, the team are divided on what is best for the Avengers. 

Joining Steve is Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) Wanda Maximoff (Elisabeth Olsen) Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner) and Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) Team Cap focuses on the idea that the Government doesn't control the Avengers.

Tony's team consists of 
James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) Vision (Paul Bettany) Natasha Romanoff (Scarlet Johanson) 
Peter Parker (Tom Holland) and T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) Team Iron Man focuses on the idea that the Avengers need to be grounded into reality.

Through the Sokovia Accords which unites the Nations of the world. T'Challa the Heir to the throne of Wakanda is thrown into this war between heroes through events which I can't reveal without spoiling parts of the plot.

Bucky Barnes returns as the Amnesiac Winter Soldier. Struggling with the actions he has made in the past. Bucky is in hiding after the actions he has committed. Steve and Sam are still hunting for Bucky after his second disappearance in The Winter Soldier. And after he is targeted after a current disaster. Steve finds Bucky on the run and pays a tough price for Reuniting with his old friend.

The villain of this movie is Zemo (Daniel BrÃ 1/4hl) Zemo is a simple man with no super powers or evil organisation, he is one man who manages to tear the Avengers apart from the inside. Why Zemo is a brilliant villain is the fact that in a typical Marvel movie, a villain has to be powerful and menacing to fight the hero. However this movie is about heroes turning against each other due to their morals and points of view. The terrifying and amazing factor of Zemo is that he could be anyone. The everyday man in the crowd. There is nothing powerful about him which is terrifying. Zemo may not be the most memorable villain in the MCU. However, he is the most affective in the sense that his drive is relatable and a genuine threat.

The action in this movie is fantastic. The Russo brothers show once again the realistic close up violence in which can and should be shown through 12 rated superhero movies. The fights in this movie are on a massive scale throwing in so many characters and not once does it feel as if the action is overused or the characters never feel too bloated in this movie. One scene in this movie is one of, if not the greatest fight scene in superhero history, I will refer to this as the Airport Scene. However the drive of this violence comes from the fact that you route for both sides to win and you really empathise for these characters and some of the fight scenes in this movie are really emotional and affective.

One performance really shines in this movie full of serious scenes and character development. This performance is the only fun and comedic performance in this movie. Even Robert Downey Jr is grounded and serious in this movie. There is only one scene where he is the traditional Tony Stark and that's when he's with this specific character. Tom Holland is the much needed comic relief for this movie and he brings it all in one scene. The Airport Scene. This is the Spiderman which we have been waiting for. Tom Holland is fun, young and what you picture when you think of Peter Parker. This is the version of Spiderman which is apparent in the comics. The source material Spiderman in which is quirky and somehow fits in the MCU. Tom Holland is a small part of this movie but really makes an impact showing the capability of this version of Spiderman. Holland maybe the best Spiderman yet on the big screen.

This movie is amazing. The action, the cinematography, the story, the characters are top notch. The acting in this is brilliant. Every part of this movie is on point and entertaining. The exact thing in which Batman V Superman isn't. Even though these movies are the exact same. The difference is the execution of the movie. Civil War has been building up since Age of Ultron and you have come to relate to these characters as you've seen them grow as the movies have continued. This is what is missing in the DCEU. Although the characters in this universe are known. The movie versions are not. This is what separates these two franchises. The audience has grown with these characters and cares. This is why the Russo Brother's Civil War is better than Zack Snyder's Batman V Superman. Honestly I can't wait to see what the Russo Brother's create for Avengers Infinity War. Because this movie has Iron Man, Black Widow, Spiderman, Black Panther, War Machine and Vision pitted against Captain America, Ant-Man, The Winter Soldier, Falcon, Scarlet Witch and Hawkeye. This is a must-see for Marvel fans and movie fans alike. I can't recommend this movie more."
"Jul 3, 2017",NEUTRAL,Boring and doesn't take enough risks
"Jul 2, 2017",NEUTRAL,A fun albeit overrated entry in the MCU.
"Jul 2, 2017",NEUTRAL,BEST MARVEL FILM EVER!!!!
"Jul 2, 2017",NEUTRAL,This movie is awesome! When I watched it I said this is the second best MCU movie just before The Avengers. Civil War has some problems but the main problem which make it a little bit worse(still great) than The Avengers is its romance. It was awful. The romance between Steve and Sharon started and finished in this movie. We didn't see anything special in the Winter Soldier. But Civil War totally is the second best MCU movie.
"Jul 1, 2017",NEUTRAL,"This movie is able to push so many characters together into one story. There are so many characters but it still manages to keep a Captain America story. There's a great balance of humor, action and drama!"
"Mar 13, 2017",NEUTRAL,"It's what Batman v Superman could have been. But seriously it's just a better version of bVs . It has a lot of things in common with dawn of justice . The end result is way better than what bVs is but it just has that many things in common , but is definitely worth a watch, even though it's a lot like Batman v superman"
"Mar 11, 2017",NEUTRAL,Marvel did their thing. Captain America lived up to the rest of the marvel Comics depiction
"Mar 10, 2017",NEUTRAL,"I don't see how they could have done this one any better ,I'm extremely satisfied with this film."
"Mar 8, 2017",NEUTRAL,"If there is 1 sentence I can say for why Captain America: Civil War was awesome to watch, it would be, ""The airport fight scene was the best fight scene I have seen in any Marvel superhero film. But it wasn't just action-packed, it was also emotional in a way that was just so mind-boggling and so entertaining. 99.99% of the characters were great and a bunch of other things."
"Mar 7, 2017",NEUTRAL,"While I believed Deadpool was a good film, Captain America: Civil War is the best comic book film of the year.  Not only was this the best comic book film of the year but possibly the best product Marvel has put out since Avengers.  As a fan of the original comic run of Civil War, I was hoping that Marvel would adapt the story to their cinematic universe since the announcement of the MCU.  While the story doesn't translate word for word (Thanks Fox!) to the original comic, the film keeps the core beliefs and story arcs alive in the film adaptation."
"Mar 7, 2017",NEUTRAL,"An excellent film, from characters, to acting, from plot and to emotion. 
Though it is full to the brim of characters, old and new, it never feels bloated, and remains a Captain America story through and through. Chris Evans does an excellent job in portraying the conflict Cap feels, as well as the resolve to remain who he is. Robert Downy Jr, is excellent as Iron Man but never steals the spotlight from Cap, but adds to the film, not making it an Iron Man 4 film. And the introduction of Tom Holland as Spider-Man is a fantastic casting choice and the brief screen time he does have, has won many people over.
The airport fight is built nicely and the fight itself is one of the best not only in a CBM, but movies in general.
An excellent film that ties the past together and sets up the future in interesting ways."
"Mar 5, 2017",NEUTRAL,Incredibly boring and samey. Fighting between the heroes is totally unnecessary the story is pretty much based around the destruction caused in the previous movie. So shallow its ridiculous. This is an avengers movie and not a captain america movie whatsoever. Its all just total rubbish and completely boring. Funny here and there but a poor follow on from the incredible winter soldier. ---- Better on second watch.
"Mar 5, 2017",NEUTRAL,"Should really be called Avengers 3. Superb. Marvel wins again with humour action combo.

TheVerdict# Marvel Vs DC. DC is pulverised.. Spiderman is in it... need I say more"
"Mar 4, 2017",NEUTRAL,"An amazing climax to a long-time build of conflict throughout Marvel's cinematic universe. 

The Russo brothers balance a culmination of suspenseful turmoil, explosive action, well-timed humor and even character development across the board of a roster never before seen on the silver screen.

A landmark for superhero films."
"Mar 4, 2017",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War' keeps it's serious tone from the past Captain America' movies, with not so much jokes (like marvel in almost every movie) and introducing all the new and old avengers fighting together, even if it is against themselves."
"Mar 3, 2017",NEUTRAL,Classic the way Marvel does this is astounding
"Mar 3, 2017",NEUTRAL,"Airplane fight scene is worth the price of admission alone. Though not a perfect movie, this is one of Marvel's best for sure."
"Mar 3, 2017",NEUTRAL,Weakest of the previous Captain America but still a good movie..
"Mar 3, 2017",NEUTRAL,The editing on the action scenes was realistic... I've seen this film twice already and I still can't figure out why Iron Man and Captain America are beefed out. The only thing that makes this film amazing is (Spoiler) Spider-Man!
"Mar 2, 2017",NEUTRAL,"More like Avengers 2.5 than a straight third installment in the Captain America film franchise, but it's still heavy on the Cap so us Cap fans will still love it. Black Panther is pretty cool in this, another of my favorite Marvel characters from back in the day, sets up what seems pretty could be a pretty cool movie. Some cool action scenes, especially the airport fight scene, if you've seen it you know what I'm talking about. It's maybe the best action scene in any Marvel movie. While not a great self contained story it does push the MCU narrative along well and sets up some awesome potential plot points for future films."
"Mar 2, 2017",NEUTRAL,"It was supposed to be about a fundamental ideological opposition. In the end, it was about a guy taking his bromance way, way too seriously."
"Mar 1, 2017",NEUTRAL,Loads of visual entertainment and unbelievable action sequences with a deeper plot then we find in many action superhero films....oh and if that isn't enough there is an all star cast including Elizabeth Olsen !
"Mar 1, 2017",NEUTRAL,"This review contains spoilers. 

Political pressure mounts to install a system of accountability when the actions of the Avengers lead to collateral damage. The new status quo deeply divides members of the team. Captain America (Chris Evans) believes superheroes should remain free to defend humanity without government interference. Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) sharply disagrees and supports oversight. As the debate escalates into an all-out feud, Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) must pick a side.

Since 2008, Disney have changed the face of the superhero movie with their triumphant Marvel Cinematic Universe. The superhero genre (yes, it's its own genre now) has produced some terrific films. Many people believe X-Men (2000) started the modern era of superhero movie craze, and while I do agree, I think it was Sam Raimi's Spider-Man (2002) that gave it the boost it needed, and the one it deserved. These were real characters with real depth! The 2004 sequel was even better, building upon the story that the original started. We got a better insight into who these characters were and what made them so special. It's the real beauty of a sequel. They allow you to explore so many different aspects of a character. It's why TV shows are the go-to place for excellent character development. We get to know them for years and it helps us sympathise with them. The MCU feels much like a TV show. Each phase is a season and each season ends with a finale: Avengers/Avengers: Age of Ultron.

Captain America: Civil War adapts Mark Millar's popular comic book that saw the Avengers, the X-Men, the Fantastic Four and much of the Marvel Universe collide. The comic was filled with deaths, betrayals and fantastic monologues that furthered the dark side of the Marvel Universe that we had previously seen in stories like House of M.

Unlike the comic, the movie feels much smaller and more personal to Captain America. Sure, you can call this Avengers 2.5 but it still feels like what is is as heart; a Captain America movie. Captain America: Civil War is packed with some incredible fight scenes and an engaging plot which differs dramatically from the source material it's adapting. We have spent numerous movies with these characters and to see the compromises they make in this film is what makes it stand out.

While the Avengers are on a mission, their carelessness leads to the deaths of innocent civilians and political pressure begins to squeeze them into choosing a side; Save the day with absolute freedom or fight by order of bureaucrats. While previous MCU films are all about fun, adventure and heroism, Civil War brings the universe into a real world with real consequences. If the events that took place in both Avengers movies were real life, there would be hundreds of innocent lives lost and this would be something that is immediately brought up, yet we don't hear about that grim side of it until this movie. The characters and the audience are both being smacked in the face with consequence. It's what Watchmen (2009) and The Incredibles (2004) do so damn well. However, the film isn't necessarily a downer. Unlike Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, the film still has plenty of the humour and fun that the MCU has come to be so widely known for (not that that's a fault of BvS). So there's a mixture of seriousness and jokiness, and I don't think that works too well.

Until the final few scenes, I never felt any real tension. The first act is full of reasons why the Avengers is a controversial branch of the once mighty S.H.I.E.L.D and so we understand that something big has to happen, and once the Avengers take sides, we expect brutal, death-filled warfare. After all, the movie has 'war' in the title. However, the second act contains an action scene that felt as though it was out of a completely different MCU film. One with a lighter tone; where there were no real worries and it was all about fun. They have come here to fight and if needs be, kill each other in order to make a stand and have their way in an incredibly important and serious issue. So what do they do? Why, they tell jokes of course! They're not supposed to be having fun. They should be terrified about the outcome of the fight but it's not even clear if they want to kill each other or not. Of course, like every MCU movie, there are no major characters who die (and stay dead). This takes away the impact and any tension the 'airport' scene could have had had there been one or even two characters die. The airport scene is one that was made to entertain, rather than propel the story.

In comparison, the final confrontation between Rogers, Bucky and Stark is brilliant. This fight has raw emotion. It's brutal! Where the airport sequence focused on spectacle and great big set pieces, this fight has a much smaller scale, yet the stakes are so much greater. There has never been a fight in the MCU like the fight at the end of Civil War and I'm not sure we'll ever get one like it again.

My favourite thing about this movie is the philosophy that weaves the story and separates the characters. The Dark Knight sees Batman and the Joker fight a battle of wits; Daredevil Season 2 sees Daredevil and the Punisher collide in both verbal and physical battle; Batman v Superman takes Batman's anger and plots it against Superman's naivety; Captain America: Civil War has the patriotism of Captain America go up against the compromising and regretful Iron Man. The writers, Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus, do an excellent job of giving reasoning and understanding as to why there is conflict and why the two lead characters take different sides, but the minor characters don't seem to get enough screen time or dialogue. They pretty much decide their team in a few lines or less. It doesn't feel like the characters made the decisions themselves, but the writers. Along with the good writing for the lead characters, both Robert Downey Junior and Captain America give their best performances of the MCU thus far. As far as newcomers go, Black Panther and Spider-Man had great on-screen presence. Chadwick Boseman gives a fine performance and his character has a touching and inspired arc. Tom Holland brings a Spider-Man that we've never really seen before. He is very much like the Spider-Man from the Ultimate universe, in that he looks a lot younger and doesn't shut up. Although a little shoehorned in, he works really well throughout his sequences and it was a great advert for Spider-Man: Homecoming.

The film almost feels like one producer wanted them to go dark with this and another wanted them to stick to the usual MCU feel. When War Machine is blown out the sky and free falls into the ground, he should be dead. No question. But it's the MCU and so he is more or less fine. He's walking again not soon after. It's this sort of thing that makes me a little sick of the MCU. It almost feels like schlock. Same formula, same result. I have to say, I enjoyed this movie, but not nearly as much as I wanted to.

It's uncommon for superhero movies to directly adapt a single story from the comics. They rarely even use the name of the comic they are inspired by or are are adapting. On the contrary, Captain America: Civil War uses the name of the comic and, I suppose, would call itself an adaptation, but it greatly differs from the overall story and tone of the comic. Had they faithfully adapted the comic, I think it would have felt out of place for many people. If many characters were killed off in this film and if it was handled really well, I would have loved that, but I'm not sure the general audience would have been too keen. The MCU took the ultimate risk in bringing all of these characters together but from there, there hasn't been much to greatly admire about the MCU like there once was.

Score: 3/5"
"Feb 28, 2017",NEUTRAL,"Hero against hero not only shows us a different take on a Marvel film, but also gives us a little taste of what's to come for Infinity War. New Spider-Man, Tom Holland proves to the audience that he's perfect for the role of 15 year old Spidey."
"Feb 27, 2017",NEUTRAL,I'm team Tony all the way!
"Feb 12, 2017",NEUTRAL,Nothing special about this one
"Feb 12, 2017",NEUTRAL,"Great fight scenes, and decent plotline and backstory. Probably the best in the series so far."
"Feb 10, 2017",NEUTRAL,Marvels as I've come to know. Lot of gadgets and special powers and fight scenes.
"Feb 10, 2017",NEUTRAL,"With a thoughtful plot and solid action, this is what Marvel movies should aspire to."
"Feb 7, 2017",NEUTRAL,Fair though I didn't believe the stance or spineless followers on each side. Spider-Man was annoying.
"Feb 7, 2017",NEUTRAL,"I was at the edge of my seat through the whole movie. I can't believe how great the got Cap and Tony with all they went through and how their motivations are caused by what have happened in previous movies. Fight scenes are just pure beauty and grace, Black Panther rocks and I cant wait to see his solo movie. The storyline of Bucky was just thrilling and his relationship with Steve is everything I ever wanted, it makes whole fandom, which I love to the deepest pits of my soul. 10/10 <3"
"Feb 7, 2017",NEUTRAL,Best Marvel film so far and little below the realistic Dark Knight which still stands strong as the best superhero movie. Hype was big and Russo brothers didn't disappoint. Just another strong step for Marvel as they enter the phase three.
"Feb 6, 2017",NEUTRAL,"In my opinion, Captain America: Civil War is Marvel Studios' best and one of the greatest superhero films of all time. The third chapter in The First Avenger's series of films (and the thirteenth chapter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe) divides our heroes into two factions after they requested to run under the control of the United Nations. Some agree, and others oppose, which leads to some amazing action and stellar writing. The airport fight scene alone is enough to make the film worth seeing. It sees the return of many old faces (Sorry, no Hulk or Thor) and the introduction of new heroes to the MCU (Black Panther, Spider-Man), which does lead to a lot of side plots, which does lead the movie feeling ambit cluttered, but the film does manage to tie up all the loose ends by the end. This also leads to numerous films getting set up throughout, such as Spider-Man: Homecoming and Black Panther. The main villain, Zemo, attempts to get revenge on the divided Avengers by getting them to kill each other, but his plan, similar to Lex Luthor's in Batman V. Superman, is very convoluted and relies a little too much on chance. Despite this and the fact that a bit too much goes on in the film, it's an action-filled, sometimes humorous, and downright entertaining ride from beginning to end."
"Feb 4, 2017",NEUTRAL,"Ignore the plot holes,  sit back,  and enjoy the ride!"
"Feb 4, 2017",NEUTRAL,Awful. Worst movie of 2016 rip off of bvs. From the trailer to the poster
"Feb 4, 2017",NEUTRAL,"Disappointing. I loved the first two, and this was good, but not good enough. Spider-Man was irritating and Black Panther wasn't that great either. Bucky was the most exciting character in it I reckon. Still definitely worth a watch."
"Feb 2, 2017",NEUTRAL,"Hi everyone! So let's jump into the review. This movie is fucking amazing! Captain America Civil War is what the perfect Captain America sequel and Avenger sequel! FINALLY AFTER 13 MOVIES we finally have a complex villain with a very interesting motivation. He wasn't weak in my opinion. Zemo was actually a strong villain because he had a reason to do what he did. Words cannot express how happy I am to see Marvel step it up with the villains!
Anyways this movie is amazing on all points. From a human perspective, a political perspective, and from a superhero perspective! I think the story was interesting how everything is surrounded by consequences, vengance, and the biggest theme...FRIENDSHIP! Literally if a building blows up the people are going to go ape shit on the Avengers!
This is by far the best performance from Robert Downey Jr. since Iron Man 1! There is one scene in the end where if you're in film class you can do an entire analysis on Tony Stark alone. This was the most interesting Tony Stark in a long time and his character was awesome! You will feel bad for Tony Stark in the movie.
This movie is honestly a character study for superheroes. There is another scene where the Avengers are discussing Superhero politics and you can study that too. You will sway toward Team Cap or Team Iron Man. This movie could've been where you only see Caps side and that's it, but instead you get everyones perspective from SPider-Man (we'll get to him in the spoiler review) to the star Captain America and it's glorious!
Now I usually never rate anything a 10/10 unless if I feel something or I am truly moved and this movie actually did it. This rating is by being an actual movie too, as a superhero movie 10/10 forsure, but as a film. This movie is both epic, emotional, dramatic and most of all brilliant, but the only 2 movies I've given 10/10 to is the Dark Knight and the Avengers (#1). Guess what? This will be on the pallet of the 3 superhero movies to make me do this, but I give Captain America a 10/10.
PS this movie is so good that Batman v Superman doesn't deserve to be compared to this movie."
"Feb 1, 2017",NEUTRAL,This was awesome! Much better than Batman vs Superman.
"Feb 1, 2017",NEUTRAL,"I really think that the Captain America's series is the best from Marvel so far. It's the only one where each movie got better than the last one and I can't say the same for the other series (Thor, Iron Man, The Avengers ...). This one is full of jaw-dropping action, amazing CGI and all the characters that chose a side (TeamCap or TeamIronMan) had their reasons well explained.

Rating: A"
"Feb 1, 2017",NEUTRAL,"Not bad.  I guess they had to do it, and because they did, I kinda felt that maybe they might be running out of ideas.  I'm sure there will be a few more good super hero movies, but they maybe numbered..."
"Jan 30, 2017",NEUTRAL,"Admittedly, I am unfamiliar with all these franchises. I bet on a legit system, this movie would have sounded great. I made it to the end. That's at least worth an average rating. For me, that's 6/10. 

I think Chris Evans can be a good actor, and Robert Downey, though he plays the same guy in everything, can somehow be great. These movies have brought in quite a cast and everyone is there in this one. That and some decent effects and action sequences again make this at least average, perhaps more if you're into these kinds of movies."
"Jan 30, 2017",NEUTRAL,"Although this movie doesn't exceed expectations, it certainly meets them by presenting characters you are made to care for, and some of the greatest action scenes the MCU has to offer."
"Jan 30, 2017",NEUTRAL,"I understand it's a ""Captain America"" movie but it feels like RDJ and Chris Evans get entirely too much screen time by themselves. The Black Panther and the Winter Soldier's story arc could have been phenomenal with a little work. Of course Vision and Scarlett Witch's arc as well. Still visually gorgeous and gritty, incredible acting aplenty, still good ole Marvel."
"Jan 29, 2017",NEUTRAL,The action as always is some of the best you'll see but the way to story ties together by the end is really what makes it perfect.
"Jan 28, 2017",NEUTRAL,"Excellent movie.  Complex ideas were distilled into an understandable dialogue between the characters.  All of the characters continued to develop and change as they faced the consequences of their actions.  Heroism, freedom, vengeance, and national security are all debated, but without being overbearing or pedantic. The action and special effects fit into the story and are a part of the conflict, rather than distracting from the plot.  Very good movie with comic book superheroes used as a vehicle for debating contemporary issues while being very entertaining and bringing the Captain America character to life on the big screen.  Very well done movie and thoroughly enjoyable."
"Jan 14, 2017",NEUTRAL,"There are so many things that should have gone wrong, but that is a testament to why Civil War works so well. Fantastic action sequences and a willingness to explore foreign territory in its themes culminate in Civil War as the definitive blockbuster of 2016."
"Jan 14, 2017",NEUTRAL,"Captain America:Civil War is an amazing film and my 2nd favorite MCU Movie. The Russo Brothers continue the Cap Trilogy with a ton of consequential action(Airport Scene), Black Panther and Spider-Man are a welcome addition to the MCU Franchise, most of the cast from Avengers:Age Of Ultron rises high also in this movie, and the pacing is well made for some of the time. Zemo is STILL underdeveloped(every villain in the MCU feels bad except for Loki) and the pacing feels somewhat slow as some action takes forever to get to. Still, a welcome addition to what the MCU can accomplish."
"Jan 13, 2017",NEUTRAL,"I have absolutly no clue how any could rate this higher than a two. It was stupid, childish, and had one hell of a bad script. Boring plot line, bad editing, no depth in any of the production whatsoever. The first two were good, but this was just straight up shit. If you think this was better than Winter Soldier in absolutely anyway your opinion should have no value on any movie ever made. This was a bad movie."
"Jan 13, 2017",NEUTRAL,The story is a cluster fuck and a snooze at best. But the entertaining action is keeping me from giving it a fat 0
"Jan 12, 2017",NEUTRAL,Great action and a strong first half. But bloated overlong and the hole plot was muddled
"Jan 12, 2017",NEUTRAL,Oh MY gosh This Movie Was So Cool The Airport BATTLE Was The Best Super Hero Movies BATTLE Scene In all Super hero Movies My Favourite Character Was Spider-Man!
"Jan 12, 2017",NEUTRAL,I loved rooting for captain America with my boyfriend rooting for iron man. was just more entertainment in top of the movies great entertainment.
"Jan 12, 2017",NEUTRAL,Winter Soldier was wayyyyyyy better.
"Jan 11, 2017",NEUTRAL,I'm definitely hitting fatigue with the MCU
"Jan 10, 2017",NEUTRAL,"So lame. Unrealistic fight scenes as most hollywood crap movies. And so boring, I was falling asleep watching it. I only watched it because it had 4.5 stars on netflix, now I cant trust their ratings either. It's a kids movie."
"Jan 10, 2017",NEUTRAL,"É um filme bom, certas vezes se torna ``parado``, porém depois volta ao seu ritmo normal . Cenas de lutas muito boas. Até hoje não consegui escolher de qual lado estou. Hahaha!"
"Jan 9, 2017",NEUTRAL,"Boring, ugly and forgettable. I cannot and will not begin to try and understand how this film is reviewed so well. The action scenes are uninspired. Spider-Man felt tacked on and the plot lines that tie Ironman and Cap into their feud feel that way also. The Introduction of Black panther is this films only saving grace. Don't believe the hype, this movie is a total bore."
"Jan 9, 2017",NEUTRAL,was a disappointment compared to other marvel movies full of one liners and tried to hard to be funny. No hulk... it does introduce some new characters which was nice but not enough to make up for the dull movie.
"Jan 9, 2017",NEUTRAL,You call that a war? What a waste.
"Jan 8, 2017",NEUTRAL,"Very disappointing... I thought that the premise had the potential to be great, but there was just too much over the top emoting and posing for posters."
"Jan 8, 2017",NEUTRAL,"loved, loved, LOVED IT!"
"Jan 8, 2017",NEUTRAL,"Just goes to show, today's generation of critics and viewers have no idea of what a good movie.  A foolish plot that's so sappy at it's core, and with a half asleep cast, makes it one of the worst in it's genre."
"Jan 8, 2017",NEUTRAL,"I don't know if it's just coincidence or something about the state of the world right now that both the Marvel and D.C. film franchises have movies dealing with the legality and morality of allowing costumed superheroes to destroy entire buildings and bystanders while they fight their super villains. In Civil War, the Avengers face the consequences of their actions in Age of Ultron, in which an entire city was destroyed and countless innocents lost their lives. The U.N. wants to control and direct the Avengers. The Avengers themselves can't agree on whether they should submit to this, so they end up fighting with each other. Unfortunately, the conflict is simply not plausible enough to accept that they can't talk this through. Several new superheroes are introduced, including a new Spiderman (who will have his own movie soon). These films are well made, but there are so many characters, it becomes confusing keeping track of who's who and who's on which side."
"Jan 8, 2017",NEUTRAL,"Russon veljekset käytännössä pelastavat Avengersit surkean ja läpitylsän Ultronin jälkeen! Kapteeni Amerikka elokuvat ovat muutenkin Marvelin elokuvauniversumin parhaiten onnistunut sarja. Hämmentävää huomata esim. kuinka valtavan paljon parempia toimintakohtausten ohjaajia Russot ovat kuin Whedon. Draama ja toiminta on muutenkin paremmin tasapainossa. Hiukan heikohko lähtökohta oli keksitty (YK-sopimus) mutta homma eteneekin nopeasti toimivammalle henkilökohtaiselle tasolle. Onneksi Avengersit on nyt ilmeisesti uskottu veljesten käsiin niin näille viittii vielä antaa mahdollisuuden!

****+ /5"
"Jan 7, 2017",NEUTRAL,My favorite Marvel movie! It has a ton of action and has a pretty good storyline. I love this movie!
"Jan 6, 2017",NEUTRAL,"Am I the only one who actually hated this movie? It was so unecessary!! It didn't add anything new to the MCU because we know that by the next film, all will be well again. The bickering between the Avengers felt stale and annoying, and this just felt like an effort to make money with Civil War merchandising"
"Jan 6, 2017",NEUTRAL,Wasn't bad for a Marvel movie.
"Jan 6, 2017",NEUTRAL,"For a movie called CIVIL WAR, there was no CIVIL WAR at all...

Baron Zemo is such an boring character and the whole Bucky - Steve bromance is such an annoying thing... The fact that the Captain America trilogy is, in fact, a Captain America - Bucky Barnes trilogy, is the most dissapointing thing of all...

Such an overrated movie... Russos' as directors are great but the script was a s*#@&t!"
"Jan 6, 2017",NEUTRAL,"Enjoyed it a great deal, but I wasn't really sold on the emotional conclusion of the Starks/Rogers conflict. It was a pretty small blemish on an otherwise convincing plot. (Would have liked more on Spider-Man's ethical struggle from the comics too, but I guess the timeline doesn't really match up for the needed maturity level of Peter Parker)"
"Jan 4, 2017",NEUTRAL,Marvel does it again
"Jan 4, 2017",NEUTRAL,"The movie has a theme of distrust especially between Captain America and Iron Man. The cameo appearance of Spider Man more the lab halfway through the movie made it interesting. It was though unforgiving to watch it for 2 and a half hours. Ironman rightfully has a grudge, who wouldn't after what be found out towards the end of the movie"
"Jan 4, 2017",NEUTRAL,"It wasn't my favorite MCU movie, but definitely it the top 5. I really liked seeing characters from different perspective. It had its flaws, but it worked."
"Jan 3, 2017",NEUTRAL,"A great way for marvel  to kick off 2016 with one of the greatest of all time.
This movie represented a great amount of action and slight comedy to enforce a fantastic superhero movie. It shows a great intense family-like conflict with Captain America and Iron Man feuding over a new registration act passed by the government. With the new act, various Avengers are hit with an important decision that is either to join team cap and be a fugitive, or join team iron man and work for the government."
"Jan 3, 2017",NEUTRAL,"Boy-Oh-Boy is Marvel on top of their game. Their movies just keep getting better. Being a Canuck, I never cared for the Cap. Thought he was too goody-two-shoes and kinda bland. He's still far from one of my favs, but I'm beggining to be swayed by him. Anyways, this movie is excellent considering all aspects. I hope this cast of Avengers stick together for sometime."
"Jan 3, 2017",NEUTRAL,"The action and look of the film can't be faulted, but this is pretty much just a film for film's sake as it's essentially a set-up for the next film, which at the time of writing hasn't even been made!"
"Jan 3, 2017",NEUTRAL,"A crowded film that has a lot on its plate, Civil War manages to deliver a thought out plot while minimalizing the clutter that comes with introducing new characters and setting up groundwork for a new wave of storylines. While not quite as deep a story as Winter Soldier or the first Iron Man, civil war is surely worth a watch as long as audiences ignore the subtle plot holes that come with most hero films."
"Jan 2, 2017",NEUTRAL,"It's always nice to see our favorite superheroes, but the villain was amazing!"
"Jan 2, 2017",NEUTRAL,Probably a good movie but I don't like friends fighting.
"Jan 2, 2017",NEUTRAL,"Showing an excellent maturation of the Marvel Universe movies. Civil War is not only the very best of the Captain America, but the Avengers themselves."
"Jan 2, 2017",NEUTRAL,"It was light fun entertainment that appeared to loose itself, especially with the airport action scene with SpiderMan which felt like an exercise in cramming everyone into the sequence rather than delivering a memorable violent  romp.  Disappointing to see them working on the ""consequences"" theme because I don't feel I need a lecture on the political consequences of violent action in a light action film."
"Jan 1, 2017",NEUTRAL,"waste of 2 hours, terrible cgi, bad fight scenes, garbage plot, this movie was horrendous i cannot fathom why it has such high regards by critics this movie in my opinion is the worst but overall no better then decent."
"Jan 1, 2017",NEUTRAL,Good movie until they started fighting each other that part was crazy
"Jan 1, 2017",NEUTRAL,"Good action, and a masterclass in giving everyone something to do, even if the story is a little nonsensical."
"Dec 31, 2016",NEUTRAL,Granted the title is Civil War but the premise did not justify the destruction of each other and the airport. I understood Tony wanting to attack Bucky when he knew about his past but the reason behind the war was so childish. Too much of that in real life so it made it churn my stomach rather than making it an enjoyable movie.
"Dec 31, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The Russos created an tight telling conflict, which a lot emotional pay-off through the MCU."
"Oct 26, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Yet another superhero flick with a trivial plot and yes, I know that all Hollywood blockbusters have basically the same script but still... Anyway, I have to admit that the fight scene where all our heroes are gathered is pretty cool and it's always good to have Daniel Brühl around but overall it's not worth all the fuss."
"Oct 26, 2016",NEUTRAL,Civil War was a fun movie to watch.
"Oct 26, 2016",NEUTRAL,Captain America Civil War is the best film of the year!
"Oct 26, 2016",NEUTRAL,Amazing. A great and intrigating movie plot
"Oct 25, 2016",NEUTRAL,Captain America: Civil War made me like the genra so much that I now have seen the entire MCU and read comics. So yeah pretty good stuff. ...Who am I kidding? It's just outstanding!
"Oct 25, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Another excellent chapter, not quite as good as TWS but a couple of the action sequences are right up there. Best Spider-Man yet and his Aunt May (what has she been taking?) has got it going on!"
"Oct 25, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Beautiful and fun with phenomenal action and effects with fleshed out characters and themes with truly great sequences and costumes with one of MCUs better villains , the best thing about this film manages to be its actors who captivate you into this world ; RDJ , Daniel Brühl , Sebastian Stan , Elizabeth Olsen , Scarlett Johannson, Jeremy Renner , Chadwick Boseman and many more are all delightful !"
"Oct 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America Civil War has become one of my favorite Marvel movies to date, only second to Winter Soldier. Spider-Man and Black Panther are amazing new additions to the MCU and I cannot wait to see their respective films. The two best performances come from Chris Evans, Captain America, and Robert Downey Jr., Iron Man. Both of them convey a slightly darker side of their character and they do it very well."
"Oct 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,A dream come to life...
"Oct 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,Nice flick...Action packed...Insane fight scenes...Thoroughly enjoyed it....
"Oct 23, 2016",NEUTRAL,Batman V superman is better
"Oct 23, 2016",NEUTRAL,best marvel movie ever!
"Oct 23, 2016",NEUTRAL,it's so cool! everyone gets to see it
"Oct 23, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Far too long but it did hold my attention. But wow is it a mess. It believes it has some deep political tone, but i couldn't get my head around it. They decided CA is still too dull, so it's essentially an Iron Man movie. And thy hit each over the head with shields but you know nobody's gonna get hurt."
"Oct 23, 2016",NEUTRAL,"great movie, but not sure if I liked the ending."
"Oct 22, 2016",NEUTRAL,for all intensive purposes i think that Marvel is hanging on based solely on the Russo brothers and James Gunn.
"Oct 22, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I'm in the minority when it comes to this movie. Loved by many, this movie was a messy, overstuffed disappointment."
"Oct 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I  love this movie can't wait til the next one. Love seeing black panther,ant man and all the other marvel characters"
"Oct 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,"You know what's interesting--there are similarities between this and Batman V Superman, two films that came out within a month of each other. And in fact, I felt like BvS actually managed some of the motivations better (I know I'm probably in the minority).  It just seemed ridiculous that these 12 superheros who are very good friends normally would really fight each other practically to the death over what...signing a piece of paper?! 
With that said, the actually fighting sequences were cooler than BvS."
"Oct 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,A perfect high note that far exceeds AoU.
"Oct 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,i really liked this but it has left me confused regarding the 'timeline' and where this fits in to the tv series/movies scheme of things.
"Oct 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,"worst Marvel movie ever. such a disappointment. Marvel need to rethink what you do in the future. Too many heroes. keep separate other heroes from other series, like iron man should've stayed out from captain america. messy. just messy movie."
"Oct 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,A great movie with some minor flaws
"Oct 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The Third and last movie to The Captain America Trilogy  which to say the least was erratic,Follows present day Steve, Tony and James while briefly flash-backing way to many times and brief plot points that are brought up with menial importance to any of the super friends.Captain America hits hard in action as the russo brothers brand this corner of Marvel.This film while trying to stay blue turns red in just another love tale of Steve and ol' pal Bucky as they bypass Federal laws and shove double standard down world goverments  throats and deny justice in the name of love.Captain America is to say the least is unpatriotic-ally portaryed in the film Civil War.Above all else in a quest for a unique Villain they instead implement a obviously rushed storyline for the character Zemo (Helmet) unlike its predecessor its rushed, all action,has major plot holes,and doesn't stand up to comic par I think the effort was valiant but I believe they should have left this story to later time were Marvel can coral more heroes and make a solid movie."
"Oct 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,Really fast action movie! I think the director did a great job delegating screen time between all of the important characters. I look forward to seeing if Marvel can keep its steam up.
"Oct 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,"A truly fantastic film, that will leave you craving to see more! The storyline was fantastic, and the twist at the end AMAZING!"
"Oct 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,Really Good Too many eggs though
"Oct 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This was like watching Super Smash Brothers! However, the introduction of one specific character (who already has his own enormous franchise and is personified by an entirely different actor than they used in this movie) annoyed me considerably. I'm also growing weary of every Avengers movie being just another ""chapter"" in a very long story. It was cool at first, but it's getting a bit old."
"Oct 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Honestly, I thought it would be better. No one died. Someone should have died. It would have made the movie so much more emotional, but Marvel is too scared to even kill off their minor characters."
"Oct 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Starts a bit off, I thought the casualties implication was on the nose a bit. But ends quite strong, whereas BvS (had to) starts strong and finish not quite as you would have wanted it to be. 

I thought Cap's motivation shouldn't really be focused too much on Bucky, but instead on the accords. It kinda makes him a bit uncharacteristic. I thought that they had heavy themes to play with, but the fact that they just gloss over makes it somewhat anti-climactic. As Vision' said ""Oversight is not an idea that can be dismissed out of hand.""

The fights are also pretty tame and harmless, I'd say. I thought they didn't really wanna fight, or as Scarlet Witch said they were ""pulling their punches"". So, its' hard to take them seriously. Whereas, BvS looked more convincing on their fight scenes. And Superman did die (although that would just be a stepping stone and wasn't really done right, and I do have issues with it, let's not talk about that) You could say you would expect nobody to die. And it was. Nobody dies.

Although, I really liked anything involving Spider-Man (I am a big Spider-Man fan, after all). Except the CGI. Looks a bit too fake most of the time. Doesn't look as good as Andrew Garfield's CGI Spider-Man. And Baron Zemo is quite good. I'd say it's the best Marvel cinematic villain to date. Isn't powerful, but manage to split them apart. More villains like these please. 

Overall, a good movie. Sure, I thought they should focus more on certain issues rather than make this movie too much a ""Save Bucky"" movie, that they play it too safe. But hey, it is a Marvel movie. It's good, but not good enough. Even if they're bad, they're not Batman & Robin bad. I would like to see future Marvel movies change this perception of mine. But as it is, it's a standard 4 out of 5 Marvel movie."
"Oct 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"An epic action movie that has a really creative storyline that all adds together in the end.  Well done, humorous, action packed, interesting, great film!"
"Oct 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"A great deal of sound and fury, but there never really seemed to be any stakes."
"Oct 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This film is pretty entertaining and is well directed.  My problem with it is that the marvel films for the most part are starting to feel familiar, with a rare exception being ""Guardians of the Galaxy"".  My other issue is that all these films have major fights, but you know the Avengers characters are never going to seriously get hurt or die, so there's no real tension or suspense.  I did enjoy Spider-Man though, as well as Ant-Man.  Lots of humour as well, which is a Marvel trademark and one of the things missing from the DC films.  This one is definitely worth checking out for fans."
"Oct 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,Amazing Marvel does it again with these really hard hitting and action packed movies.
"Oct 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Absolutely amazing movie,one of (if not) the best marvel movies"
"Oct 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,it was an okay movie. missed the hulk!
"Oct 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Amazing in Superhero Movie of the year, the Best is Oscar Academy Day,
My Lifie Ten Marvel SuperHero is Captian Amercia VS Iron man 
Play a Boxing Team Everything ever see Avengers: Age of Ultron Movies."
"Oct 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Simply spectacular - full of drama fun and suspense
"Oct 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Average movie.  Dark, never delves into what it could regarding the situations that come up during the movie.  Ending is just as dark if not darker than Batman vs Superman (universally panned).  To me there's not much separating these two movies.  Worst Captain America yet."
"Oct 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This movie delivers anything you ask for. Earth's mightiest heroes face off in an epic throw down, they introduce Black Panther, and who could forget Tom Holland's amazing performance as Spider-Man. And this movie still holds its weight considering it's action packed and still keeps a well-maintained story line."
"Sep 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,been a long time since the last one so I was kinda lost during parts of the movie. I recommend re watching the winter soldier before this to refresh  your memory. however I would compare this to batman vs superman in the sense that it wasn't as good as most marvel movies
"Sep 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"he Russos have achieved an uncommon balance of plot and action, humor and drama, all of it once again deeply grounded in character."
"Sep 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Lots of action and a great story.Great cast ,and directing ,also great effects"
"Sep 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,Definitely one of the best superhero movies and  Marvel  movies to date it's fun  has a ton of characters but doesn't get too cluttered  has a sympathetic and  realistic villain which is saying a lot for a Marvel movie
"Sep 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This movie had many major plot holes like the Ross scene at the beginning and the whole Zemo plan. It has great action, but no great story."
"Sep 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,Fantastic movie!! great emotions and action!
"Sep 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,Another great Marvel installment
"Sep 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,A great superhero V superhero movie. Way better than Batman V superman.
"Sep 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Entertaining as always, yet a little wierd that it's a Captain America title and not a Avengers.. when still all of them are acounted for.. Oh well.. I liked this one to.."
"Sep 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Review: 
I must admit, I wasn't that impressed with the first half of this film but when the action kicks in, it is truly superb. Watching, most of the Marvel heroes in one epic battle, was a spectacular moment in cinema but I'm sure that it would have been completely different if Thor and the Hulk was involved. I did find Bucky/Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) a bit dull, mainly because he was the cause of all the trouble and he didn't seem to speak or interact with anyone but maybe that's because everyone wanted to kill him. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), also wasn't his usual, charismatic self, which was a shame because the movie could have done with a bit of humour. They finally put the Falcon (Anthony Mackie) to good use, and some of his gadgets were quite impressive, and it was good to see the Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and Spiderman (Tom Holland), play a big part in the epic battle. I'm not quite sure what the Black Widow's hero abilities are but she always seems to be in the middle of everything, and I think she is the only superhero to make an appearance in all of the Marvel movies. Wanda (Elizabeth Olsen) seems to have the most unique super hero abilities out of all of the Avengers, to date but with a huge line-up in comic book hero movies planned in the future, I really can't imagine what direction these Marvel movies are going to go in but it's very exciting. This movie did seem more like an Avengers movie than a Captain America movie but as the focus was more on the Winter Soldier, I can understand why they put it under the Captain America umbrella. Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed the action scenes and the director gave each individual superhero some depth and well earned screen time. I can't wait for the next Marvel movie! Great!

Round-Up: 
I was surprised to see Black Widow come out without a scratch on her body, and a hair out of place, after the big explosion, which killed Black Panthers father and with all that commotion happening with the Avengers, we're was Nick Fury? Anyway, this movie was directed by Anthony & Joe Russo, who brought you Welcome to Collinwood, with George Clooney, You, Me and Dupree and Captain America: The Winter Soldier. I find it weird that these unknown directors, who haven't made anything that impressive, are chosen to make these humongous comic book hero movies! With such a huge task at hand, and a massive budget to control, I would have thought that the studios would have picked directors who have a lot of experience in this field, especially with so many different characters to bring to the big screen. In terms of the Marvel movies, these new directors are obviously out to prove that they have the ability to do something amazing, which is why I have been impressed with the outcome of the franchise so far. The Russo brothers are rumoured to be directing the Avengers: Infinity War, which is due to be released in 2018, so they certainly have there hands full, especially with the introduction of new super heroes in this movie. I do think that they done a great job with this film, even though the first half was a bit glum but the epic battle scenes were worth waiting for. 

Budget: $250million
Worldwide Gross: $1.1billion (WOW!)

I recommend this movie to people who are into their action/adventure/sci-fi movies, starring Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Jeremy Renner, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Rudd, William Hurt, Tom Holland and Daniel Bruhl. 8/10"
"Sep 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It's an entretaing film, with full of action (most its last hour) that makes us wonder what is going to happen with the Avengers for Infinity War; but certanly it's not the wonder that everybody says or ""the perfection made into a superhero movie"", true is the fact that this is not a Captain America story neither a Civil War (definetily not the great comic book made into a film)... it's an Avengers story that tell us a personal interest conflict; so, it's a good movie, but it could be a way better..."
"Sep 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It's okay, I guess, as long as you've seen every other Marvel movie for context, you enjoy lame attempts at humor, and don't care about little things like an ending."
"Sep 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War so far is the best movie in the MCU. One of the best parts of this movie is that it feels very grounded. There are also three new characters in this movie, one of them is Spider-Man, and I thought Tom Holland did a great job playing as Spider-Man, he is actually a teenager in the movie. If Spider-Man Homecoming is a hit, then I think he will be the best portrayal of Spider-Man. Black Panther was a great addition, he was really cool in the action and when he is out of the suit is equally as interesting. Then there is Baron Zemo, who is the villain of the film. He isn't exactly one of those villains who uses physicality to tear them apart but to turn them against each other, which I really liked. I thought Civil War was a perfect superhero movie and is the best MCU movie."
"Sep 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,This movie was for kids.  They should remake an adult version. This was terrible.
"Sep 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Simply put, I enjoyed 'Civil War' more than I did 'Age of Ultron' or 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier'. This movie hit all the right notes, and included an action scene that could possibly be the best superhero fight ever put to screen. A deep story, unique villain, and perfect pacing make this a must-see for any Marvel fan or moviegoer. But don't expect to get what's going on if you haven't seen the other movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Things like the ""Sokovia Accords"" and General Ross' appearance won't have much significance if you haven't. 

Everybody did a solid job, and Spider-Man had a standout performance in his debut in the MCU."
"Sep 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,this is one of the best superhero movies i've ever seen #teamcaptainamerica
"Sep 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best movie in the MCU since The Avengers! The Russo Brothers have shown that they can take a complex story with multiple characters and make sure everyone known their backgrounds and the story behind each one while still incorporating some great humor and unforgettable action sequences. My first perfect 100% (A+) of 2016. Well done Russo Brothers! Well done!
"Sep 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Good start, then everything was lazzy. And the villian could do more for us. It's  really boring if you watch for second time."
"Sep 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,One of my favorite films of the Year
"Sep 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,Oh I loved it.  Still great action and funny comedy.
"Sep 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Cuando Nolan dejó el mundillo de los comics, Hollywood perdió una oportunidad y el cine de blockbusters se vino en picada. Una fomedad que se hace eterna y que le compite a Batman v/s Superman, con eso se dice todo."
"Sep 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War begins with strong international pressure to install a system of accountability for our heroes. This leads to the Avengers being fractured into two opposing teams.
I really enjoyed this excellent non-stop action film; saw this in Gold Class. 4th viewing  9/10 Rev 354"
"Sep 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,Marvel knows how to have fun with superhero movie!!!!
"Sep 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,yells from back row: TEAM IRON MAN!!!!!!! TONY STARK DESERVED BETTER
"Sep 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Una película la cual es muy promocionada. El dinero de Marvel parece influenciar al cine (al no artístico). Otra película más, un circo de efectos especiales, sin buenos personajes o momentos atrapantes. No hay un verdadero motivo por el cual exista una pelea, es forzado el que se presenta en la película. La elección de bandos es injustificada por los personajes, y decir: ""el es mi amigo y lo tengo que apoyar"" no es un motivo."
"Sep 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I'm not Avengers fan but this movie is quite awesome. I like the idea they scale out the avengers universe ,the story happened all around the world."
"Sep 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,When you RDJr in a movie you know he is going to steal the show and on top they put spiderman in the same. Really?
"Sep 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,"captain America: civil war is an amazing movie. it had plenty of jokes, action and drama. plus they all mix well together. keep on doing it Marvel."
"Sep 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I really wanted to like this more. After all,  it has lovely action sequences, beefy muscles, and some substance. Still, the plot is flimsy and recycled, the gassy nature of the film is too prevalent, and the barrage of heroes is just too much. It's a mishandled shame that feels too afraid to seek new territory."
"Sep 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Even with a crowded cast, the Russo Bros. still was able to make a compelling story, with great action, depth, and great characters, with good motivations, that makes a great action-filled movie. One of the best of the MCU."
"Sep 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"it was great, i hope infinity war would be better ;)"
"Sep 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"A movie meant to be a modern epic, it accomplishes a lot when the fighting feels personal, and much less when it aims to big for its own good."
"Sep 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Fun, exciting, with great personal and political themes which boasts fantastic action driven by its great story, this 147 minute 250 million dollar picture is another big success which keeps you wanting more"
"Sep 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Finishing the movie will be hard when you come to the end of the Russo brothers' cataclysmic marvel cinematic magic. Many were worried that this was just a dulled down Avengers redo, but do not fear it is undoubtedly a Captain America blockbuster, that also serves as an unaccredited Iron Man 4. Downey Jr. and Evens continue to shine. Though there are moments of 'corny' humour for the sake of humour, and some underdeveloped plot threads, the Russo brothers have somehow weaved a role for the cast that continues to expand exponentially. Bosman and Hollard bring a fresh and welcome element to the film, which is only made more enjoyable with Rudd reprising his role as Ant-Man. A movie which involves some thinking, and dedicated attention, those that have followed the marvel cinematic universe will not be disappointed."
"Sep 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,entertainment at its best this franchise is keep on getting better and better
"Sep 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Plot: Very Good, though some problematic character development.
Acting: Very Good
SFX: Excellent
Soundtrack: Very Good"
"Sep 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,Just not what I expected. I was a little boring for my taste.
"Sep 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,My only concern is if they did it like the comic books I would be more impressed. But that's not going to stop me from watching my favorite childhood heroes on screen.
"Sep 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Love it it's awesome lets go iron mans team
"Sep 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,This is now my favorite MCU film. I'm a huge fan of the comic storyline and I was happy to see them adapt it in a way that kept the essence of the story. I was happy to see them keep to not glossing over everything. There is real conflict. I love this film.
"Sep 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,best one yet! Loved it!
"Sep 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,A absolute platinum piece added to the ever growing marvel cinematic universe. Civil war sees the avengers divided over a new policy regarding their power. This felt more like an avengers film than a captain america film as many characters have equal amount of screen time. Marvel studios are forever expanding and enhancing the cinematic universe and this film was no exception. We see spiderman and black panther as the new additions whom add a little spice to the story and bring something different. Stunning fight scenes and witty dialogue made the action scenes an absolute pleasure to watch. Civil War is a peach of a film and a worthy addition to the film saga. This film didn't feel like 2 and a half hours long and could've easily been 3 hours to expand more characters.
"Sep 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Lives up to the hype! a great supporting cast inturducing 2 new heroes that work really well. Great directing and a great amount of humor to yet somehow darker than most the other films.
"Sep 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"First ever Movie i saw in 3d in Cinema :D
It was in Mumbai."
"Sep 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Thoughtful and emotionally resonant Captain America feels more like a character pi9ece than a conventional superhero spectacle. of course action is lacking here but the real punch is the emotional one.
"Sep 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It's fun, well acted, and decently made, but it saddens me that this weightless film has everyone over the moon"
"Sep 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,The best second movie of Marvel. Good job.
"Sep 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America vs Iron Man. Now that alone would be worth the price of a pay per view fight, however now comes the avengers draft, because sides are being chosen and everyone is about to lose. Throw in a sweet appearance from Spiderman and what more could you want? It could have used more of a behind the scenes figure manipulating things, someone you don't see until the end of the movie but it was still a very good movie. Acting 5, cgi 4, story 4, plot 4, character development 5. Leave your comments at RateMyMovieReviews@gmail.com"
"Sep 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,awesome movie and lost of actions
"Sep 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The movie was good, but was slightly lacking in story. Most of these movies have messed up, when trying to pack the comics, into a couple hours of filming."
"Sep 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Lots of fights and silly action all because of something to do with rules and not obeying them or something. Pretty boring plot and it dragged. At least young Spiderman was in it for some comic relief
"Sep 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"While both beautiful and impressive, not every fight seen escaped without the ""I'm bored"" feeling."
"Sep 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The biggest pay off for the Marvel Cinematic Universe yet, the drama is just as intriguing as the action"
"Sep 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Oh yeah! This is a very fun and overall good Marvel movie, my second favorite in fact."
"Sep 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,Civil War succeeds where many other Marvel films have failed in it's inclusion of an ensemble cast all the while tackling interesting concepts and concluding in a refreshing yet unexpected climax.
"Sep 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,If you tinker with your phone between the fighting its watchable. The story is flimsy as ever.
"Sep 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Awesome. Great action, epic, fun. Not quite on the same level as the other Avengers flicks, mostly because it lacks a strong adversary to conquer."
"Sep 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Tío  Step down from Wanted soldier. Marvel does not know to make serious movies and in this one we can confirm that.  Could not care less for the emotional conflict, too forced. The Best part was spiderman, the only thing in the movie that was not taken so serious."
"Sep 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It's very well-paced and action-packed but never loses sight to it'ss chaaracters and fleshes out both Cap and Iron Man.

5/5, definitely one of the most well-balanced and enjoyable movies of the year"
"Sep 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,Enfin un film où Spiderman a de l'allure
"Sep 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Super heroes, good guys vs bad guys, the lines blur..."

"Sep 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Good diversion of the superhero movie theme, although a little unusual."
"Sep 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,These are all getting very similar. I'm feeling a little fatigued.
"Sep 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Comme souvent avec les Marvel un gros foutoir a profondeur limitee, mais avec quelques bonnes surprises comme l'enieme resurrection de Spider-Man."
"Sep 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,The action is incredible and the emotions are everywhere. It's fun and serious when it wants to be.

"Sep 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,Fairly awesome and epic! Maybe the best Marvel movie to date.
"Sep 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This is my favourite marvel movie! The plot was amazing and had me sitting on the edge of my seat at every moment, the script was witty and smart, and the effects where tremendous. The whole film really shocked me, I expected it to be good, but not that good."
"Sep 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Bold enough to break the monotony of Super Hero movies, with a story that is interesting and not to convince you to like it the way it always was"
"Sep 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It's a regular film, nothing to do with the Civil War really. such action is not seen, were more laughs than anything else. It is an offense for which he has read the comic. 
Elizabeth Olsen and Scarlett Johansson UFF WOW. They are the most wonderful thing about this film <3 <3 <3 <3"
"Sep 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,One of the best Marvel movies so far.
"Sep 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,"great movie,  Marvel doesn't dissapoint"
"Sep 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,"""I don't care. He killed my mother."" At its best, it's less about thrilling action sequences and more about the futility of revenge. But when there must be action, at least it's usually fun."
"Sep 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,This movie was entertaining. But Wasn't as great as everyone else are saying. It's Just my opinion. 3.5/5
"Sep 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,One Of Best Marvel Movies :D
"Sep 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It is not my cup of tea, but it is so cringy with forced jokes and forced story points and characters."
"Aug 31, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Unlike Age of Ultron, and despite the number of characters (aside from perennially-useless Hawkeye), this is a blockbuster with a lot going on and yet never feels like too much. The characters are fantastic and despite the name, it is actually Tony Stark and Natasha Romonoff who take the most room to grow. It's also a more fitting debut for the highly-""enhanced"" Elizabeth Olsen as The Scarlet Witch. I never fully bought into the idea of bringing in Bucky ""The Winter Soldier"" Barnes as Captain America's arch-nemesis but it's nicely wrapped up here, and aside from a few plot and pacing problems, this is one of the  best films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. 9.75/10"
"Aug 25, 2016",NEUTRAL,When fantasies become reality. That Civil War is absolutely awesome! The fight scene in that European airport is incredible! Fabulous!
"Aug 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,This movie takes the stand of being my newest favorite movie of all time!
"Aug 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The Captain America series, in my opinion, are the perfect examples of a film series that improves over time. This new installment conquers new territory by installing a thought-provoking message, but balances with enough action, humor, and charm to still make it a very entertaining superhero flick."
"Aug 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,Fucked up movie sucks as fuck
"Aug 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,Decent film! As good as any other Captain America film but with too many characters.
"Aug 23, 2016",NEUTRAL,Certainly the best instalment to come out of the Marvel franchise.
"Aug 23, 2016",NEUTRAL,Another great movie for the Marvel line.
"Aug 23, 2016",NEUTRAL,It was a lot better then I thought. Id probably buy this on iTunes on discount.
"Aug 23, 2016",NEUTRAL,Marvel strikes again!!!!   Love the fight scene at the airport
"Aug 23, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Riveting moments w/all of our favorite superheroes, resulting in quite the colossal showdown. The Russo Bros keep all of the rowdiness in check by cutting deep into the difficult sacrifices made by a busted & bruised Avenger family. An entertaining, action-packed blockbuster done right."
"Aug 23, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Characters were great. Story good. Nice effects. Way better than the previous one, Age of Ultron. Definitely worth watching"
"Aug 22, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best Marvel Movie Ever
"Aug 22, 2016",NEUTRAL,Marvel bias is real. The chase scene was excellent but rest of the movie was utter crap.
"Aug 22, 2016",NEUTRAL,"La apoteósica ""Captain America: Civil War"", la tercera entrega de la saga del Capitán América y la película No. 14 de la serie del Universo Marvel de Disney (yo incluyo la primera parte de ""Hulk""), es la mejor película sobre superhéroes de la historia (con el perdón de ""The Incredibles""). Aquí, los hermanos Anthony y Joe Russo (directores de ""Captain America: Winter Soldier"" y el talento detrás de las series de televisión ""Arrested Development"" y ""Community""), logran unas secuencias de acción perfectamente coreografiadas y que hacen que el corazón palpite más aprisa. Las actuaciones de su elenco son de una perfección absoluta (ni hablar de la química) y la historia está armada con la precisión de un reloj y tiene un trasfondo político y de tragedia griega que hace que ""Batman V Superman"" parezca un bosquejo de película sin desarrollar (aunque hay muchas similitudes entre las dos cintas). Como el objetivo es reseñar sin revelar ninguna sorpresa al espectador, es una obligación limitar al máximo la información suministrada sobre la trama. Se puede decir que el Capitán América (un Chris Evans con actitud de líder) no está solo, ya que lo acompañan casi todos los miembros de los Avengers. Junto a Cap, se encuentran Iron Man (un Robert Downey Jr. con el papel hecho a su medida), War Machine (un estoico y a la vez gracioso Don Cheadle), Black Widow (una peligrosísima Scarlett Johanson), Falcon (un leal Anthony Mackie), Hawkeye (un carismático Jeremy Renner), Scarlet Witch (una depresiva Elizabeth Olsen) y The Vision (un más que maravilloso Paul Bettany), Thor y Hulk no aparecen, debido a que se encuentran en algún lugar oculto, el cual se revelará en la película ""Thor: Ragnarok"". Junto a los Avengers originales, se suman Winter Soldier (un sólido Sebastian Stan), Ant- Man (un magnífico Paul Rudd, que ya habíamos apreciado en una igual de magnífica película), Black Panther (un soberbio Chadwick Boseman, protagonista de las biografías ""Get On Up"" de James Brown y ""42"" de Jackie Robinson) y nuestro amigable vecino, el Sorprendente Hombre Araña (interpretado a la perfección por Tom Holland, protagonista de ""The Impossible"").  Tanto Black Panther como Spider-Man tendrán sus propias películas individuales. En cuanto a los villanos, se cuenta con un peligroso Crossbones (un Frank Grillo lleno de fuerza) y el Barón Zemo (un viperino Daniel Brühl), quien se convierte en una especie de conspirador que busca acabar con los Avengers desde su interior, revelando unos secretos devastadores para el equipo.  Con un elenco tan numeroso, la película podría colapsar fácilmente, pero gracias a todo un camino forjado con excelentes películas y a unos directores creativos e ingeniosos, se logra todo un milagro cinematográfico tanto emocionante como profundo. Si usted ama los cómics de superhéroes (ya sean de Marvel o DC) como yo, esta película encierra todo lo que amamos del género y más. Y si usted no es amante de los cómics o de las películas de superhéroes, no tendrá más remedio que admitir lo evidente:  ""Captain America: Civil War"" es un verdadero clásico del cine de acción norteamericano.  P.d. No se vaya antes de los créditos finales, ya que hay dos codas importantes para saber lo que se avecina en el futuro.  ¡Allí estaré, Marvel!"
"Aug 22, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The pinnacle of superhero films so far, Marvel's casting pays off again, action is intense but still fun and comic book inspired, and the airport fight is so amazing it's almost exhausting."
"Aug 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,"A very fun and incredibly enjoyable movie that was well directed, well edited, well acted, and overall was done very well"
"Aug 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,Civil war is pretty much what you expect. Marvel has seem to have given up taking risks with their stories but other than that civil war is a well paced action adventure film with fine performances and solid action. Not the best I have seen
"Aug 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,fun to watch with a great script too boot
"Aug 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I feel like this whole movie was just an excuse to make that ""face-off"" scene on the airport tarmac with a bunch of iconic characters beating on each other. Further proving additional brain development doesn't come with those extraordinary super-powers. The basic premise of this was; a bunch of comic book superheroes have a disagreement and get damn angry at each other, queue mayhem & fighting i.e. the film. It's over-stuffed with everything you'd want from a marvel movie & I enjoyed it more than previous editions so I guess for that it's done something right. But people who admire these films are getting their own place in hell, trust me I know."
"Aug 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I'm gonna be in the minority here, but it was just ok. The airport fight scene was amazing, Antman was great for the little bit he was in the movie, but it was just another Marvel movie with the same feel these movies have had since Iron man 1."
"Aug 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,Awesome that's all you can say!
"Aug 20, 2016",NEUTRAL,Pas mal mais pas aussi bien que les derniers films Marvel. Pas vraiment aime le fait qu'ils se battent entre eux. Film sans enjeux au final.
"Aug 20, 2016",NEUTRAL,Phenomenal. Marvel did it again.
"Aug 20, 2016",NEUTRAL,This movie wasn't that great. I really enjoy black panther bin this movie but that's about it. The title of this movie should have been avengers 2.5. Winter soldier was a far better movie.
"Aug 20, 2016",NEUTRAL,This movie gives me the excitement about comic books that I had as a kid again. The stories are great and progressively becoming more unpredictable and I love it. All I can say is that this movie is SUPER AWESOME!
"Aug 20, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America Civil War has been described as the perfect superhero movie. And i can safely say that those theories are correct. The captain america trilogy have been the only marvel series to improve upon the last movie. This film takes time to introduce each charcter in a way that we feel connected to them as people. Black panther and spiderman are 2 welcome editions and it advances upon the relationship between bucky and steve. All in all, this film was great and will be a sure-fire classic for future generations."
"Aug 20, 2016",NEUTRAL,I'm a Marvel fan to the end. this was full of action and all the new characters. Cant wait for the next one. Black Panther â?¡â?¡â?¡
"Aug 19, 2016",NEUTRAL,"One of the most ambitious and creatively successful blockbusters of this decade. The fights run long on the second viewing, and parts of the film are rather fragile upon close inspection, but it all holds together long enough and well enough to see you out of your seat both satisfied and hungry for more."
"Aug 19, 2016",NEUTRAL,what a waste.  typical.
"Aug 19, 2016",NEUTRAL,this movie was a perfect balance between action packed and mysterious about background between the characters
"Aug 19, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best superhero movie ever!!!!!!
"Aug 19, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Spider-man and Black panther completely stole the movie by far! And the plot is amazing like any other marvel movie and...it's better then DC. I had to admit it...Robert And Chris really acted great for this movie. And some are complaining about Tom playing as Spider-Man but trust me, he captures the power and nerdy parts of Parter Parker/Spider-Man better then Andrew Garfield..."
"Aug 19, 2016",NEUTRAL,"good, sum one liners"
"Aug 19, 2016",NEUTRAL,Great way to end the trilogy.
"Aug 19, 2016",NEUTRAL,Everything you would imagine and more!
"Aug 19, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Good movie, but the storyline is a downer."
"Aug 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I fell asleep midway through. Way overrated. Not as good as Guardians, Ant-man, or even suicide squad."
"Aug 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,We need more characters for our predictable script!
"Aug 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Another good Marvel film, but nothing special. I don't know why everyone is so blown away by it. It feels the same as previous Marvel films, and the conflict is not really believable ( I don't get how scarlet witch couldn't just decimate everyone). So many stupid decisions by both sides. Many of the character's actions were just unrealistic. But noooo, logical actions are not allowed, or else the movie would end too early. Like, why did Bucky not just plug his damn ears? They made a show out of him breaking free of his arm restraints, but then he pounds on the glass rather than plug his ears... And why on earth did Vision knock down a tower to stop Cap, instead of just going directly for him? I thought he was on the team that thought the Avengers should be kept in check? But he decides to destroy half an airport for no reason? Oh well, still a fun movie at least."
"Aug 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,The best the MCU has to offer so far and thats saying something stacked against movies like The Avengers and Winter Soldier. Having very little in terms in flaws the movie moves along fast but the story keeps up to the pace but also finds time for the humor that has helped build the MCU it also introduces Tom Holland as Spider-Man who may be better than Tobey Maguire in the role given time
"Aug 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,Great relationship dinamics make this movie.
"Aug 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"fun, good set up for what is to come"
"Aug 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Thought it was an ok movie but marvel could have done way more with the idea. I also found myself thinking ""when is this movie going to end"" a few times."
"Aug 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I found this to be more of an Avengers sequel than a Captain America story, moreover, I found Steve Rogers to be a bit of a dick to Iron Man vis-à-vis the latter's parents."
"Aug 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,amazing. epic. next level marvel!
"Aug 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,My second favorite of the three Captain America movies.
"Aug 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,Darker/ more fun that most marvel movies! Directing was spot on.
"Aug 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,Actually had something interesting to say. Spiderman was amazing . . . makes me look forward to that movie even more!
"Aug 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This was very interesting, but I did not care for this Iron Man in the movie, but of course it's in the comics. Spiderman was really a joke in this movie, unexperianced super hero."
"Aug 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Civil war is one of the best mcu movies.
And that AirPort battle is amazing, one of the best superhero fight scéne"
"Aug 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"https://soundcloud.com/ryangunasekera/captain-america-civil-war-2016

After the outstanding success of Deadpool, Civil War for me suffered conceptually from high expectations.  It will ultimately go down as a mediocre instalment of the franchise.  Nearly every character's arc has already been aptly explored, meaning Ironman and Captain America's moral dilemma of abiding by, or ignoring superhero 'rules', is where the heart of the film will be judged.  For those of us who are still entranced by superheros, this plot may suffice.  For me, the idea of civil war between our heroes simply lacks the punch that made these characters when they first arrived on our screens.

There are solid moments throughout the film; Spiderman's journey into the Avengers being one, but in the end, this feels like another action blockbuster that relies too heavily on CGI over original  characters and depth of screenwriting."
"Aug 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,I always loved marvel and congrats on another fantastic moive I just can't wait to see what's next in line for marvel
"Aug 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Enjoyable, funny, well directed, and good performance; but the plot is everywhere and nowhere at the same time."
"Aug 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,"As much as I wanted Civil War to be its own movie other than a captain America movie, it stands extremely well among the previous marvel movies in my opinion. The Action and introduction of new characters is handled very well by the directors. A very good, well directed, well acted movie."
"Aug 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Avengers 2.5 Though Cap is in the forefront. The cast is well balanced, fight sceans are epic and so much wit and banter between players A very Solid entry to the MCU."
"Aug 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,Longwinded and short on character development. An army of CGI developers does not an interesting movie make.
"Aug 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,there should have been more emotional scenes between the main character (steve rogers) and bucky barnes (the man steve rogers starts a war for). all in all good movie but the amount of characters and action scenes makes it just another typical superhero movie and doesnt beat the winter soldier. i especially enjoyed black panther's characterization in the movie cant wait for the black panther movie.
"Aug 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,One of the better written marvel movies
"Aug 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War is the definitive Marvel flick and the best of the superhero genre for years to come. The emotional impact of the story is genuine, the plot is exhilirating and intense, each and every action scene keeps you at the edge of the seat, and new additions such as Spider-Man and Black Panther are what makes this film such a masterpiece.

Some might call it Avengers 2.5, however, above all these characters, such as the Avengers, or the United Nations, or Black Panther, or Spider-Man, or the vengeful Zemo, there are three that keep their importance and shine in the movie; Steve Rogers, Bucky Barnes and Tony Stark, the three most important characters. Beyond all that charismatic and non stop action with fantastic stunt work and clever visual effects, is a story about friendship, vengeance, anger and grief.

Civil War starts off with a perfectly paced fun but emotional first act, that sets the main plot device of the story, the Sokovia Accords. However, the second act becomes much more interesting and gave me goosebumps! We get to see the motivations clearer, the story develops, the character develops, another crisis occurs, the heroes are divided, and boom! We finally get to see the greatest cinematic battle in history of superhero films, the highly anticipated Civil War battle, where all heavyweights such as Ant-Man, Hawkeye, Spider-Man and many others join in. 

But that airport battle wasn't really the real civil war. The war was engulfing within our three main heroes. As the villain becomes more apparent and as the heroes unite to stop the ultimate dillema, another shocking revelation burns down the relationship of the heroes, and it is Iron Man vs Bucky Barnes and Captain America: THE REAL CIVIL WAR.

But there are indeed some nitpicky cons, such as rushed story devices, such as the appearances of Hawkeye and repetitive arguments. But these are all minor issues, but the main problem was Zemo, who also turned out to be quite satisfying as well. Zemo's motivations and schemes were very relatable, but was dissapointing and could be expanded further upon. Daniel Bruhl did what he could do best and it is not really that much of an issue.

The main highlight of the movie for me is Spider-Man. He is my favorite superhero, and I was worried about his debut in the MCU, portrayed by Tom Holland. And honestly?
He nailed it. It's as if he popped out of a real comic book panel. He is the most accurate portrayal of the webslinger yet, and has awesome quips as he should do. He has some awesome moments as well. But Black Panther is also my other highlight, very integral to the plot. He is a very regal straight up badass and you can see his character develop in a limited screen time in a very appropriate and blessed way.

Captain America: Civil War keeps the stakes high, improves as the story progresses, with a lot of character development and political and realistic aspects to it, however, it perfectly maintains it's popcorn worth, with exhilirating action and great visual effects."
"Aug 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The Marvel Cinematic Universe rises in suspense with this, the third instalment of the Captain America franchise; Captain America: Civil War. Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. lead this large cast of one of the most anticipated action movies of 2016. Constantly filled with suspense and cleverly executed action, Civil War is a film that succeeds in attracting unflinching attention; this film is certainly action-packed, never demoting itself to anything but a quick-fire pace. Civil War is visually monumental and accomplishes exactly what you want in terms of brilliant fight scenes and surprisingly emotional sequences. Evans and Downey Jr. are fantastic, playing both protagonist and antagonist each, giving some of the most complex performances seen yet as their characters. The supporting cast of Scarlett Johansson, Elizabeth Olsen and Sebastian Stan (to name but a few) are mostly wonderful too. However, the film can tend to feel slightly too manic at points, lacking structure, and trailing off to complete disorder and turbulence. Though this doesn't happen very often, the film is constantly plagued by a dull villain, who is later forgotten and then hurriedly tied in across the course of the film. The character is not needed and adds a useless layer to the film that wastes time. Overall, however, Civil War is one of the best films yet produced by the MCU, complete with nail-biting action, often deep emotion and an all-star cast. This film surely shows that the next era of MCU films is something we should anticipate with high hopes."
"Aug 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"A fantastic story from beginning to end. Comic book critics will complain that it isn't true to the comic books, but in my opinion Marvel does not need to be anymore. This movie is the best Marvel movie second to Guardians of the Galaxy in my opinion, and does such an effective job at introducing new characters and making you invested in them, and the entire MCU. Take notes DC."
"Aug 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Another great Captain America movie by the Russo brothers but it feels like more of an Avengers movie. That could be because of the fact that there are most of the Avengers in it and they are fighting, but this could have easily been called Civil War. 
Again the Russo brothers deliver a very action-packed blockbuster which surprisingly has a lot of grim consequences on the Marvel Universe but still is a really fun standalone movie because it is dealt in the typical Marvel way. 
Spider-Man was amazing in this movie. Tom Holland was great, and the character did not feel stuffed into the movie, he just came into the movie very smoothly. And a movie with so many characters, no character I felt was sidelined and everybody felt like they had to be there, except Crossbones, he was just there for an action scene. 
Overall, this movie was really fun and is a very different and awesome Marvel movie, thanks to the Russo brothers and the writers."
"Aug 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,A waste of time doesn't fallow the comicbook don't waste your time !
"Aug 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,This movie was amazing I give it a 9.5/10
"Aug 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best big budget film of the year.
"Aug 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,the return of the living dead
"Aug 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The best film yet in the Marvel Universe, best superhero movie of all time."
"Aug 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Plain. Boring. Same as any other avengers movie. Nothing new. Actually fell asleep at 1 stage of the movie
"Aug 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE EVER
"Aug 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Strong story, stronger choreography. Among the MCU's best."
"Aug 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I am not gonna address the plot problem this one has but what makes me give it a negative review is that I found this movie impossible to watch in a single sitting. Plain screenplay, sketchy VFX, average acting performances that makes a point that you should stay away from the screen when this movie is on. The movie just doesn't end and Marvel fails to find a good villain. The airport war scene was less interesting than seeing a man snort for an hour. I expected a lot better movie than this"
"Aug 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,It continues to amaze me how they are able to fit this many characters into a single movie while giving each of them their turn to shine.  That might very well be what really makes Marvel films so enjoyable to watch.
"Aug 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Was great. Iron man still has it. I loved Elizabeth Olsen. Superb. I did not miss Paltrow at all. Did miss Thor, as did most of the girls in the audience. The story was interesting and the visuals amazing as usual. Looking forward to the next installment."
"Aug 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The new standard for ensemble cast superhero movies.  At this point most will have seen the preceding movies, and so the movie can flow without the continual rehashing origin story of every character and move the plot along.  Great action scenes, great character building.  Seriousness offset with levity.  Just great."
"Aug 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,Marvel's best movie yet...nailed everything especially Spider-Man!
"Aug 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,Better than the first in the series but not as good as the second.
"Aug 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"A solid follow up to Winter Soldier but i think that one is the best Captain America movie.

Spider-Man was handled really well and i am looking forward to his standalone movies. I did find the whole Aunt May Tony Stark scene completely missed the mark but doesn't detract from the movie.

Now this charge is somewhat spoilery (you have been warned) but how can ironman blow off Winter Soldiers arm and then not be able to eviscerate Captain Americas shield?

Overall a very good movie that had tons going on and is worth watching multiple times."
"Aug 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,I really loved the story but why the heck did Tony not just shoot both Cap and Bucky and leave his shield was not there.
"Aug 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It's good like we have come to expect with the MCU. This film reflects other films in the last few years incredibly well and the Russo brothers do a great job on the characters. One of the best Marvel films to date, worth a watch!"
"Aug 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Another great movie from Marvel Studios and Disney. Very good story, excelent action, great actors, and good comedy."
"Aug 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"While it's a perfectly good film, it gets overhyped all to easily, and a roster of fan favourite characters seem to distract people from its muddled plot and general clunkiness around the edges."
"Aug 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,What really needs to be said about this movie it was by far the movie of the year
"Aug 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,best movie ever i even have smile on face thinking about ant man and spidy :D
"Aug 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,This film is so good
"Aug 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Ugh could not finish this dull movie with poor acting and lame ""action"" and effects. A couple funny lines, but not worth it. What is wrong with people?"
"Aug 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,ITS ABOUT TIME SPIDERMAN JOINED THE AVENGERS
"Aug 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"4.8/5. 9.6/10.

-JDK"
"Aug 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,Really disappointing finish. In the end it feels like nothing was accomplished. The fact the the characters are fighting without the intent to kill each other makes it much less enjoyable.
"Aug 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I want to start out with the Cinematography first, then the Visual Effects. 

The cinematography as every film fan knows should be unique to its nature and genre. This has to be the film that uses lenses and quality as if your watching a romantic movie and surprisingly it goes so well with this technical and visual masterpiece. 
As you may know movies these days are almost the same where there's just destruction of multiple boring CGI buildings and CGI explosions. However, this film delivers its own unique action sequences which will entertain film fans and especially superhero fans.

Only downside is running time. Extensive running time should be delivered for fans who are willing to watch it on their own time at home. Normally people would not watch it through a pact space in a theater. Overall, great movie. Four stars

- Gean Kaurgill"
"Aug 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Marvel has done it again introducing a famous story arc from the comics and slightly changing it to keep things fresh. The Russo Brothers kill it with some new cast members like Black Panther who we see for the first time in the MCU, and Spiderman who is no longer owned by Sony. We see him for a little time but he is just the spiderman that we wanted. Captain America and Ironman get political and aggressive being played by a villain who relates a puppet master who could have been better, but played his part. The story has great dialogue and character interaction balancing many characters from the MCU and giving them all some screen time. The story was well played out only problem of mine was that some scenes had poor looking CGI that momentarily take on you out of the film but are too little to ruin the film."
"Aug 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Alas, weakest of the Marvel films to date. Plot holes you could fly a quinjet through. Every reason Iron Man had to fight was illogical and flawed. Smartest man on the planet shouldn't have been so foolish. New heroes all well done though, the movie's saving graces."
"Aug 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Best superhero movie of all time, loved every minute of it"
"Aug 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Going into this movie, I was extremely pumped. The trailers were great, I even re-read the ""Civil War"" comic. Was I disappointed? Absolutely not. This movie blew me away. I loved the action sequences, the internal conflict between these characters, and the finale was downright amazing.

When talking about this movie, it is impossible not to talk about Spiderman. I really liked how he was introduced, and his witty comments during the airport scene were really cool. Tom Holland was great, he actually felt like a random highschooler-turned-superhero and you really felt for him.

This movie was almost perfect, but something was missing

After the first action scene, a lot of the scenes involving Cap and Bucky felt a little rushed. Also around this part, there is a scene that (no spoilers), I didn't really understand fully until the ending. Second viewing, much better.

All of the scenes with Bucky and Black Panther were really great. You really understood Black Panther's motives and it really captivated me. 

The ending fight, with the twist (no spoilers, again), really felt emotional and you understood both Cap and Iron Man. All in all, I really liked this movie and its a definite ""would watch again"""
"Aug 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Another Great marvel movie ! lots of Character development, action and humor ! exactly what I like when I go to the theater"
"Aug 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,Comic book movie overdrive at its best. Russo's can do no wrong.
"Aug 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The Russo Brothers do it again by making Captain America bad-ass in his threequel. By having Iron Man and Cap battle between the accords, Captain America: Civil War is even more mature with action than any other Marvel movie to date."
"Aug 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,Probably the best Marvel movie to date ;)
"Aug 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,One of the most complete comic book movies of all time. I still prefer TWS  a little more but this is definitely one of MCU's best movies.
"Aug 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"HANDS DOWN ONE OF THE BEST COMIC BOOK MOVIES EVER. I'M SHOOK. THE CULMINATION OF YEARS OF WORLD BUILDING BROUGHT TO ONE MOVIE, WOW."
"Aug 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"One of the best action-filled, dream-come-true, superhero, fighting movie.
A MUST WATCH !"
"Aug 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Probably one of the best trilogy's that the marvel universe has brought us, first avenger killed it. Winter soldier was an amazing thriller. And with this third I guess act to this story, you really get to see how far not only captain America has come as a character on the big screen. But also the winter soldiers character as we'll, the action in this film is perfection, the use of humor in my opinion was so on point and the story never in my opinion felt dazed. Or u got tired of it, this film had a good pace in tone and was very captivating. Some minor things tho. The so called villus was very 50/50 and his plot and placement in the film was kinda ehh. And the idea of the ending which if you haven't seen the film. Spoilers *(when u have the package from cap given to stark and him saying I'll still be their for you. And all that. As touching as that is, I didn't think it was needed. Cause they have the infinity war coming. I don't want it to be the o gangs back together and everything's fine. To me that kinda makes this film fall down a bit. I would've wished they'd kept a more darker tone towards the third act. And make it where barons plan actually makes more of an impact. Like have Bucky die, have cap tell stark f you. Stuff like that would've made it more kinda true to the grittiness of the comic and made a much more better beginning to the infinity war)* spoilers no more lol over all good use of all characters and many having GIANT ??roles. Great film hope people have a blast watching it. Follow me on Instagram @chrisaldana1 thanks happy movie going"
"Aug 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,Captain America: Civil War was amazing in my opinion! Great couple big fighting scenes. Did a great job introducing Black Panther and a brand new SpiderMan! Can't wait to see them two in their own solo movies. It's a great start to the MCU Phase 3!
"Aug 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I got in the theater thinking that i was watching a good movie and what i got was the worst superhero movie ever i swear that there is something wrong with critics these days (how is batman v superman bad and this is good? probably paid off by marvel),they are complete liars,everybody says this is an emotional movie and it's not at all,it's got the worst plot ever (why didn't iron man just destroy the quinjet) and the worst villain ever,i mean the avengers accidentally killed his family so he plans to kill them? well,dozens died because of the avengers, baron zemo was one of my favorite marvel villains and now marvel ruined him,I was so dissapointed by this version of spider man (he didn't even say with great power comes great responsibility),the only good thing that came out of it was Chadwick Boseman's performance as black panther,do not watch this unless you love terrible movies."
"Aug 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Civill War has the same story as Batman Vs Superman  the Main villain  	
Zemo  who does not like nothing like Zemo   has the idea as Lex to have the two main superheros to fight against each other   and the only good part was Spiderman, Ant-man , black panther and the fight with all the superheros and story is a bit boring and cartoonist"
"Aug 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Striking and consistently engaging, Captain America: Civil War is a well-crafted comic book blockbuster that manages to find time in it's overcrowded plot to examine it's characters and convey moral & emotional conflict in this epic superhero showdown"
"Aug 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,Decent but not fantastic
"Aug 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Besides Avengers (original) and Guardians of the Galaxy, best Marvel movie ever."
"Aug 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,Way too long and boring!
"Aug 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Hey, look, another Avengers movie"
"Aug 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,Yaaaaasssssss!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Aug 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Overall, it's a good film, but it just doesn't do enough to become a great film, even with the excellent new additions of Holland and Boseman."
"Aug 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,"For me this was like making a rift in the MCU making the audience pick sides and when it came to it, kiling blow or something, it didn't come wich i found like the missingthing, If someone died okay fans would have been pist or angry but it would have meant something the whole fighting and the whole plot. Now for me the whole plot stands on that SPOILERS bucky killed iron mans parents and that the only thing and they kept the feud kinda settled but with open end"
"Aug 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,It is an Amazing movie right up there with the other 12 MCU movies because it's awesome mature and fun.
"Aug 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Terrible plot , the terrible half funny puns make this movie funny where there should be a heart warming moment. Until Spider-Man came in I was almost asleep . I love marvel but this movie flopped hard. It's like they took the die hard villain added him to 21 jump street for no reason."
"Aug 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This movie is the best film I have ever seen from Marvel. Personally, it leveled with The Avengers! (Which is very difficult to do!)"
"Aug 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Predecible, una vez más pésimos villanos"
"Aug 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,The best marvel movie ever!
"Aug 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I wasn't dissatisfied with this film as I don't expect supreme satisfaction from an MCU film, anymore. Except for as a young child when I saw Iron Man, I have never been blown away by an MCU film. I understand the appeal, and the films are well-written, acted, and produced, but they are still dumb. Not all films can or should be thematically abstruse, operatic in tone, and reminiscent of ancient drama, and not all films that do establish these identities are good, however, for Captain America: Civil War to be the end-all-be-all that I was hyped up to believe, it fell short and left me with an ""Eh, it was good"" feeling. The Marvel Cinematic Universe has evolved into a drug for many audiences. It's darkest approaches still incorporate some myopic opinion on life and inject some of that MCU humor, and while some may argue that these implements are consequential of a modern superhero film's quality, I must staunchly disagree."
"Aug 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,perhaps the best captain America film and it is sooo great!
"Aug 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Not my favorite, and a bit long and boring."
"Aug 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I absolutely adore this movie. The choreography was beautifully done. There was a lot of comic fan service, which I adored. The only thing I wish they did was give Crossbones a bigger role in the movie."
"Aug 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,This was great. Furthered the story along. I totally enjoyed the fight scenes. Go team cap!
"Aug 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,Incredibly boring movie to watch and absolutely unnecessary. Downey Jr. looks tired and old and can't stomach his constant fixation on Bucky...Like get a life man.
"Aug 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,Another Incredible installment to the Marvel Universe.
"Aug 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Terrific movie, heartfelt and beautiful. One of marvels best entries"
"Aug 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Dispute, resolve and intensity throughout. Best of the three by far."
"Jul 31, 2016",NEUTRAL,action filled but not as good as I thought it was going to be.
"Jul 31, 2016",NEUTRAL,Why do superheroes have to fight?  Aren't there enough bad guys to put away?  Just burning out the comic book genre here.
"Jul 31, 2016",NEUTRAL,"If I could give this movie a zero star rating, I would, I only gave it 5 stars to grasp your attention. This movie was absolute garbage, it couldn't even ble-I'm kidding, This movie was amazing, it had stunning visuals, amazing action sequences, and great story development."
"Jul 31, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Smart, sleek, and loaded with some of the best superhero action in recent memory, Civil War might not always carry the weight that its title suggests, but it's nonetheless an MCU highlight featuring a jaw-dropping finale fight."
"Jul 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,Emotional. Fun. Breathtakingly one of the best Marvel Movies to date.
"Jul 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I could watch it 100 times and it would still be a great movie. You want waste your money on this movie"
"Jul 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"One of the best entries to the mcu, Although it lacks a villain and the actual villain is quite annoying still a great movie and we'll become a classic in the future"
"Jul 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Fantastic. Moves well, feels visceral. The problems seem a little manufactured, but the exploration of the threats, history, relationships, and ethics are quite drawing."
"Jul 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,Marvel .... nothing else to say .... A*
"Jul 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It was great how The Russo Brothers managed to Fit all the superheroes that were not the Avengers. I think Tom Holland was a great Spider-Man. Chadwick Boseman needs some work to be Black Panther, a superhero who's never been on the silver screen before."
"Jul 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,This film is the MCU's best film not saying the others aren't good because so far all MCU movies are good bbut some are better than others. But this one beats the others and gives us something new. This movie is so fun to watch and this movie is an Avengers film but at the same time it is a Captain America film. I have seen this film twice and both times I enjoyed it the same. They also introduced Spidey and Black Panther perfectly and I can't wait for their solo films. I love this film and hopefully what happened in this film effects the whole MCU. Marvel you have done it again. This movie is so fresh and it also has funny jokes at the right moments.
"Jul 28, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Overall, I enjoyed this movie. This movie felt more like Avengers 2.5 than a solo Captain America film. On of the other issues I had is that this movie very loosely follows the Civil War storyline from the comics."
"Jul 28, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Gaining remarkable critical acclaim above the high standard of productions in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Captain America: Civil War had too much remarkable hype to disregard.

As a huge fan of all the films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe with the exception of The Incredible Hulk (2008), I must admit that I was less enthralled with Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) in comparison to the others. I felt that it lacked the same energetic pace and comic timing as the other's due to its greater ambition on being a serious espionage thriller, even though it was still a fun time. I found it relied on an overly familiar premise which it took very seriously and that Bucky Barnes was short on characterisation with the story leaving him as more of a simple archetype. Captain America: Civil War not only compensates for those shortcomings, but it reinvigorates Bucky Barnes as a character of nothing but necessity for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. 
The film puts a lot of emphasis into characterising Bucky Barnes, establishing his background and how he struggles to cope with his sleeper agent status. The inner conflict he battles as he fights to reclaim his identity while evading authorities makes him both a great hero and villain for the story, and how the characters view him is what splits the heroes down the middle and puts them at war. Bucky Barnes is just one of the many figures who are given rich characterisation in Captain America: Civil War because even though the abundance of characters makes it potentially just a third big Avengers battle movie, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely's screenplay isolates who deserves to have their story told and pursues that without coming up short on the stylish value of the film. 
Captain America: Civil War is the most character-rich Marvel film to date and certifiably one of the finest achievements of the MCU. Captain America: Civil War forces The Avengers to confront the damage they cause and the lives lost in the process with real emotional strength without detracting from the occasional comic edge of the film. With the multiple-film buildup to Captain America: Civil War, viewers have had time to adjust to the humorous fun of the series while it has gradually grown in strength for dramatic plot points and characterisation. So when this plot point is introduced, it isn't melodramatically dropped upon viewers. Instead, it becomes a turning point for the series and the start of a new dramatic direction for the new generation of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The main two characters are Captain America and Iron Man whose friendship, humanity and patriotism is all put to the test along with the superheroes around them. The dialogue given to the characters proved to be truly some of the smartest writing in the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe. The political discussion that sparks the start of the titular Civil War is one which may divide viewers, particularly as the film progresses and we see how far the rabbit hole goes. There is so much political drama occurring in the time outside the battle that Captain America: Civil War finds a way to keep entertaining every moment. It moves along steadily so that viewers have the time to embrace the character development and comprehend the large scale of events happening throughout the narrative universe, and it remains gripping the entire time. None of the intensity brought on by the action spectacle is lost in the dialogue since the two flow with each other very smoothly. The characters discuss some really serious concepts which are thought provoking and mature without condescending the audience with complicated terminologies, tedious melodrama or ridiculous sentimentality. In a clear sign that the Marvel Cinematic Universe has stepped up in maturity, the dialogue in Captain America: Civil War manages to implement in uses of the words ""sh*t"" and ""bitch"" without it being purely for humorous gimmicks. Many superhero films fail to match script with spectacle, but Captain America: Civil War is undoubtedly the finest superhero feature to ever make such an achievement.
However, the standard of writing in the film does face one setback with its main villain. As smart as the antagonist of the story is it seems like his motives are a bit of a cop-out. There is only so many ways you can characterise the antagonist of a superhero film as it's usually a quest for power or vengeance, and in the case of Captain America: Civil War the story falls into the latter. Unfortunately it chooses a blankly simplistic path in doing so and puts his determination to stop the avengers on a path of ridiculous simplicity. While the conflict between the characters and political themes of Captain America: Civil War really raise the stakes for its dramatic nature, Helmut Zemo does not live up to the same standard as a character since he has simply directed the blame of his family's death in damage caused by The Avengers when countless lives were threatened by terrorism. It's not impossible to sympathise with the character, but somebody could have thought up a more innovative idea as to why was out for vengeance because this one just feels slack. It doesn't cause any major detection in the film, but it just comes up generic and doesn't offer the character any really powerful moments to show off the brilliant acting talents of Daniel Bruhl. If it did that then perhaps we could see a greater extent of Helmut Zemo's madness and fully understand his need to destroy The Avengers, but amid the battle between heroes there doesn't prove to be much screen time for the villain.  He pops up sporadically, says some things and then disappears while the chaos unfolds to the rest of the world. Daniel Bruhl is still a convincing fool in the role, it's just that the standard for characterisation in Captain America: Civil War is of a higher standard than any other MCU film and I feel that Helmut Zemo does not live up to that.
To say I was majorly bothered by the film's treatment of the villain would be a lie when there is so much more to enjoy in Captain America: Civil War. Namely, amid the serious nature of the entire experience there is still great room for audiences to have a fun time. The screenplay is serious not but bereft of the distinctive sense of humour which has propelled the series for so long. And in terms of being a visual experience, Captain America: Civil War is the greatest action film of the year so far. It takes minimal time before this is clarified because the intro action scene is brilliantly paced, moving along intensively fast but confining its scale to small so that a large number of characters get to show off their skills without the view losing focus. Everything is shot with cinematography that balances intense close-ups with more distant shots that emphasise the scale of the battle and the nature of the setting around them. And the film mediates top-notch fight choreography with the assistance of visual effects to ensure that the action testifies to the talents of the people working both behind and in front of the camera. The magnificent musical score of Henry Jackman helps to keep the feature powerfully atmospheric the entire time, and it's mediated at a sensible volume with the sound editing.
The overall quantity of action in Captain America: Civil War is perfect. The film doesn't hide its story behind the spectacle, but it mediates a strong quantity of it over the course of the film so that the film never loses focus on its pacing. And what's also impressive is the variety of action that audiences get to experience in the film. With the superheroes in the story pitted against each other, there is an endless visual feast of superpowers on display which audiences can marvel at. These are used in a series of scenes which depict the characters fighting with close one-on-one combat or showing off their powers to keep each other at a distance. As well as that, we get to see car and motorcycle chases and characters in aerial pursuit of each other which takes the battle to the sky. There are even elements of parkour implemented into the film. When Steve Rogers first helps Bucky Barnes escape the authorities, the entire escape is choreographed and captured much in the same style as the iconic French action film District B13 (2004). As a fan of that precise film and parkour in general I was ecstatic to see it present in Captain America: Civil War without it having been forced in there. 
Of course, the major action scene that audiences will enter Captain America: Civil War with the intent of viewing is the big battle between the two teams of Avengers. Choosing a team to support in the battle is one not easily done, but this is the moment where audiences can stop thinking and just sit back while the experience unfolds. Without being overblown or prolonged, Captain America: Civil War perfectly lives up the hype behind it. Every character gets engaged in an exhilarating battle with someone else where the film's focus gives enough attention to everybody for everyone to show off their powers. There are momentary breaks from the action for the characters to remind audiences why this is happening or where things are going next as well as allowing them a chance to crack a joke, but it never detracts from the consistently fast experience. The action in  Captain America: Civil War is captured with visual expertise and lasts an engaging long time with a rich atmosphere of intensity, and it is of such quality that it should fill the gaping hole left in viewers after the underwhelming experience of Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016). The rest of the story should help do that too. 
Frankly, Captain America: Civil War brought out the child in me who loved superhero movies so much that it made me want to grow up to be a superhero myself while it had the adult in me really questioning the politics behind the battle, so it provoked all kinds of thoughts in me. And in a remarkable achievement, Captain America: Civil War spreads out its characterisation well enough to bring out the best focus in every cast member and evoke intense performances from everybody present in the film.
Chris Evans delivers his most personal depiction of Captain America to date. While almost every other MCU film has relied primarily on his energetic patriotism and soldier discipline, Captain America: Civil War focuses more on him as a person. Expanding upon what was sparked by Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Captain America: Civil War shows Steve Rogers' morals being thrown into question as his personal beliefs come into conflict with his directive as a warrior of justice. Finally we see Captain America being genuinely humanised in an intelligent way, and Chris Evans manages to ensure this happens with his real charisma. While maintaining the same comic charm, muscular appeal and brilliant fighting talents that make Captain America such an iconic superhero in the first place, Chris Evans really conveys to audiences the confusing struggle he faces as he has to battle the justice system to protect his friend. It's a sign of genuine vulnerability in the character which is all too sympathetic, and it sheds new light on the superhero while displaying a greater extent of Chris Evans' acting abilities. We see him delivering an emotionally restrained performs where the conflict is internal but the charisma is clear, and it really makes him a perfect lead. Chris Evans' is at his highest standard as Steve Rogers in Captain America: Civil War, the the variety of chemistry he shows off with Robert Downey, Jr. and Sebastian Stan is brilliant.
Robert Downey, Jr. is similarly awesome. With the legacy of Tony Stark having been established by the Iron Man trilogy (200_-201_), Robert Downey, Jr. is similarly challenged to face new ground in Captain America: Civil War. The arrogance and egotism of the character which was used largely for comic relief in many of his other tales evolves into something new in Captain America: Civil War. It becomes the source of his real pride as a superhero and his determination to fight for what is right, and this leads to some really sophisticated tension in his chemistry with Chris Evans. As the film goes on, this only grows as we see him becoming more fierce and aggressive in the role without ever dropping off into melodramatic territory. We see the darkest side of Tony Stark that the MCU has ever displayed, and effectively the most human. Similar to Chris Evans, Robert Downey, Jr. displays what lies beneath both the exoskeleton suit of Iron Man and the the playboy facade of Tony Stark: an emotionally damaged and vulnerable man who is driven by his own insecurities. Robert Downey, Jr. is incredibly intense in Captain America: Civil War, and the chemistry he shares with Chris Evans provides some incredibly enticing drama that anchors the heart of the film firmly within a character-driven narrative.
Sebastian Stan is also brilliant. I never saw much potential in the character Bucky Barnes, but that's simply because the MCU never really did anything innovative with him. In Captain America: Civil War that finally happens. While he was just another soldier in Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) and a rather silent villain Captain America: The Winter Soldier, he finally becomes an actual character in Captain America: Civil War. Bucky Barnes battles his identity as The Winter Soldier with a path of intense unpredictability which ensures that viewers can never be certain of his motives, and Sebastian Stan manages to consistently capture both the fierce and aggressive nature of his brainwashed new identity and the sympathetic human side to the character. Sebastian Stan has to play multiple characters with the one role and convince audiences that he is both a ruthless villain and a man with true vulnerability, and he does it brilliantly. Sebastian Stan captures every edge to his character while putting a relentless physical effort into his performance to ensure that he kicks some major ass during every action scene. Sebastian Stan certifies Bucky Barnes as an unforgettable and compelling character for the MCU with his powerful performance in Captain America: Civil War.
And Paul Rudd is one of the most welcome returning cast members in Captain America: Civil War. Ant-Man (2015) was a greatly entertaining film, though it did have a formulaic narrative to it. The thing which really sold it was the performance of Paul Rudd in the titular role, so bringing him into a superhero ensemble with the sole purpose of battling with and against The Avengers as well as making viewers laugh is exactly what the film needs. Amid everything serious in Captain America: Civil War, Paul Rudd is consistently hilarious because his comic gimmicks are used to soften the intense mood of the story. They are spread out amid his scenes to not overuse them, and he manages to hit the right note every time with his natural charm and swift timing. Paul Rudd's performance just boosts the excitement surrounding the upcoming Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018), and he proves a perfect part of the Avengers team.
However, Paul Rudd is not the only main source of comic relief in Captain America: Civil War as he shares that status with newcomer Tom Holland, cast in the role of Spider-Man. Tom Holland puts up a hell of a fight to claim the spotlight in Captain America: Civil War, and even the fact that Spider-Man is no cinematic newcomer and is one character in a crowd of many superheroes, Tom Holland makes his brief appearance one that is impossible to forget. Spider-Man is a character that has been toyed with in the cinematic universe over the course of five films since the 2000's, but only in Tom Holland have they finally found the perfect actor. Tobey Maguire was a good Peter Parker and Andrew Garfield was a convincing Spider-Man, but only Tom Holland perfects the feat or successfully portraying both. Only 19 years of age at the time of filming Captain America: Civil War, Tom Holland perfectly conveys the young and naive nature of Peter Parker. Of course his ability to grasp the character's intellectual capacity is extremely convincing as well. He is perfectly reserved and geeky in the role of Peter Parker, playing with a nerdy stereotype through his own inherent charm which prevents any kind of cliche one-dimensionality from taking over. Tom Holland works the geeky nature of Peter Parker to brilliant comic effect and manages to implement it into moments of him being Spider-Man, reminding audiences that the character is a teenager bent on having as much fun as he can in the process of standing up for what he believes in. Tom Holland is hilarious as Spider-Man, delivering every line with excitable energy and a subtle serious nature to him while performing with a rich physical passion for Spider-Man's abilities as a superhero. Frankly, I was reluctant that Captain America: Civil War was going to be introducing a third actor to play Spider-Man since viewers have been repetitively pummelled with the character over the course of five films since 2002, but Captain America: Civil War gets everything right: they cast the perfect actor and establish that his Uncle Ben Parker is already dead to ensure that audiences will not have to sit through another origin story with Spider-Man: Homecoming. For the first time since I was a child watching the trailer for Spider-Man 2 I find myself extremely excited at the release of a new Spider-Man movie, and seeing Tom Holland working alongside the always delightful Marisa Tomei is an experience I will thoroughly look forward to. Marvel fans can rest now that a perfect Spider-Man has finally been found in the unknown Tom Holland.
Chadwick Boseman is an actor I have had long respect for, so his introduction to the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Black Panther is something I most valiantly support. The character is not one that I'm all that familiar with, but anchored by a strong performance by Chadwick Boseman he is very hard to forget in Captain America: Civil War. T'Challa is a character from a different culture to the Western-dominated culture of The Avengers. As a result, the personal motives behind T'Challa's pursuit of Bucky Barnes are made unpredictable by the mystery of the character. Black Panther is a justifiably aggressive character who fights with a controlled ferocity that makes him intimidating while the fact that we see T'Challa change before he becomes the character gives us a greater understanding of him. Black Panther seamlessly works his way into the narrative and provides a different kind of hero for the story, one whose animalistic fighting style and cultural background certified that he has enough difference to stand out from the crowd of characters. If that isn't enough, then the performance of Chadwick Boseman should sell it. His perfection of the character's African accent and emotionally fuelled line delivery makes T'Challa a certifiable character while his physical energy makes him kick ass as Black Panther.
Don Cheadle makes a passionately patriotic return to the role of James ""Rhodey"" Roads, bringing in the intense charisma of a soldier and giving Robert Downey, Jr. a perfect side kick. His voice makes a strong dramatic impact being shouted beneath his War Machine suit. Anthony Mackie captures a similar spirit in the role of Falcon with the determination to really command his team as a leader and a follower at the same time. And Paul Bettany takes Captain America: Civil War as an effective chance to expand upon the character of Vision with a consistently sophisticated line delivery that supports his vast intelligence. Paul Bettany manages to put some slight elements of humanism into Vision while maintaining his artificial intelligent brilliance.
Captain America: Civil War doesn't do too much to expand upon the characterisation of either Black Widow or Hawkeye, but Scarlet Johansson and Jeremy Renner give strong performances in their respective parts. Elizabeth Olsen also makes a welcome return as Scarlet Witch, as does William Hurt. And as a fan of both Jim Rash and Martin Freeman, the fact that they got bit parts in Captain America: Civil War was most satisfactory without being any kind of a distraction from the story. Stan Lee's cameo is also a pivotal gimmick.

Captain America: Civil War takes maximum advantage of its hugely talented ensemble cast with a story that pits them in a intelligent story of political turmoil and rich characterisation while maintaining visual expertise to find success as a remarkable action spectacle."

"Jul 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Not a huge fan of the consistent changing of Spidey. This one does a good job but, for me, isn't age-appropriate."
"Jul 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,Love Captain America. He's my favorite Marvel hero (after Spider-Man).
"Jul 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,great characters great action  my favourite marvel movie yet.
"Jul 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,This was just a good movie. It wasn't the best movie in comic book history but it was good. The plot was unique but predictable. A bet overrated...yes. A bit formulaic...yes. But thats what fans of this Marvel universe love so much so this is spot on for Marvel.
"Jul 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Brutal, engaging and ultimately very touching Civil War isn't Marvel's best but it's certainly close."
"Jul 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,About as close to perfect as you can get.
"Jul 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,Loved it! Really answered a lot of loop holes in the saga
"Jul 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,"A movie that focuses more on the civil than the war, Civil War is a movie that tried to keep the family friendly aspects that are now so common in these Disney Marvel movies. They fail with an incoherent plot that relies on knowing the critics will give it a good review because it's a Marvel film. The villain has such a terrible plan that could of only been even close to successful if you looked a few pages ahead in the script.  The endless amount of quips from almost all characters, not just Spiderman and Scott Lang. As a very big fan of the Winteretardation Soldier, it's clear this wasn't a Russo brothers film but instead the Marvel executives making a movie that could pander and make money from even toddlers.  The excessive plot holes and disregard of characters actions in previous films can't be made up with some subpar action scenes."
"Jul 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Rooted and defended the film on IMBD threads.  Finally saw it.  I was so wrong.

This is not the best Marvel movie ever.  WINTER SOLDIER IS THE BEST."
"Jul 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War continues what was left off from Captain America Winter Soldier,  Steve Rogers/Capt's (Chris Evans) hunts for his long life best friend Bucky Barnes aka Winter Soldier ( Sebastian Shan) in between that time comes his duties as an Avenger member. 
It returns the Russo brothers ( Joe and Anthony)  who brilliantly directed the last Capt. America film ( Winter Soldier) 

The leading big difference between Winter vs Civil War - besides the added superheroes of course is the cinematography - particularly the camera work during the fighting choregraphy scenes. Quite frankly I was quite annoyed by the shaky-jittery jumpy camera work in the early part of the film. 

I did like one scene where it displayed of an early, youthful Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr. ) the trick photography was impressive, and this part was significant because it played a big important part at the climatic end of the film. 

Normally I would have been anxious to hear Downey's usual zany, charismatic Tony Stark character in either Avengers/Capt. America or Iron Man film because of his oddly entertaining sense of humor but he was somewhat 99% serious-side only in this one and for the first time seemed misplaced. I guess they didn't want Stark character to overpower the Steve Rogers character.

Speaking of Capt. America - this film seemed more like an Avengers movie than it was a Capt America film. Not just because of the mass super beings in this one- but such was made so much about the government involved civil war that not enough seemed as appealing and directed to the Rogers/Bucky factor. One group believes in protecting lives and mankind at all costs, another believes there should be government control, new rules, and limitations on engaging the conflict, and leaves it up to you to decide which side of the coin to go with. 

I did like the image and emergence of the Black Panther -even wonderfully done by Chadwick Boseman. The way "" T'Challa was brought into the foreign fray was ideal, he was relentless and charming even in his pursue for revenge for the demise of his closest relative. In fact it was set up such that there could be a path way for a future Panther solo film down the road. His battle with Bucky and Capt America would have been a lot enjoyable If not for Russo's intent on the shaky camera works.  

Civil War features a slick, cunning villain (albeit no superhuman powers) but to me, there wasn't much appeal and intrigue to the Baron Zemo character (Daniel Bruhl) who is tracking down secret highly classified Hydra documents to gain vital information that he thinks he can use to manipulate the Winter Soldier program that will help him topple an empire. 

Actually what was thought to be impressive plan by Zemo with the possibility of multiple ""winter-soldiers"" ended up disappointing my high expectation up for a soon happening , such as these "" super-soldiers""  being pitted against any and all incoming Avenger(s) ... but it never materialized. (sigh) 

Sorry but I continue to think that Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye is easily the most boring character of all the Avengers'  .. besides his variety of special weapon arrows, I just don't find him the least bit appealing. 

There's the emergence of a Spiderman appearance  (en route to a future Spiderman upcoming film.)  But I didn't get
a wow vibe for Spidey . Why did it seem like been there and done that  already, and I wasn't left with an impression that the next Spidey movie (featuring Tom Holland) would be any different than the past Amazing Spidey movies . Also it was unclear on how Stark discovered Peter Parker's identity. 


Although I'm beginning to like what the Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) is bringing to the Avengers-like films, I'm still somewhat the opposite for the Vision (Paul Bettany) . There's nothing appealing about his cyborg personality that would make me want to crave even more to see him and have him even more involved in future films. 
Black Widow  (Scarlet Johasson) was puzzling confusing to a degree, at one time she ever bit for Stark and Team Iron Man but just in a snap of the finger, she instantly becomes Team Capt. America ?   There's also the Falcon  (Anthony Mackie) .. Ant-Man (Paul Rudd)  .. 

With Capt. A: Civil War I didn't get near the same flow, pace and wow factor as I got with  Capt. A"" 'Winter Soldier, which didn't seem to let up, and it help having some real close calls and easily far more clearer in its fighting choreography and camera work than Civil War.  

What made up and gave it a rebound was the awesome epic ""civil war"" face-off showdown at the Airport betwixt Team Captain America ( Capt. America, Scarlet Witch, Winter Soldier, Falcon, Ant-Man)  vs. Team Iron Man (Iron man, War Machine, Black Widow, Spider-Man, Hawkeye, Vision)  One of the two times where the shaky camera work settled and subsided enough where I could finally see the fighting action  and choreography much clearly. And to see the mixture and blend of superpowers and strategic counter-attacking against another Superhuman powered group with acrobats, shrinking to gigantic, chasing, target-aiming, brilliant hand to hand combat, bionic vs. spidery-powers, flying drone-gadgets, sky-air maneuvers, etc. There's even the awkward one-liner  sense of humor that is known to come with zany characters like Ant Man and Spiderman

And all this and even without Thor or the Incredible Hulk being present in this movie.  The big fight was made out to be everything it was advertised to be- and easily the most enjoyable scene. 
Something can be made for the final battle at the film's end between the 2 group leaders Iron Man/Capt America and Bucky Winter Soldier, with a puzzling twist at the end to set it on fire. That one on two battle 

As with most Marvel films - stay put until the lights come on - there are future-clips at the beginning of the credits as well as at the very end of the credits. So do please stay put. (: 

Coming away from Capt. America Civil War - I have to say though it has its flaws , I still enjoyed it - but I thought it was a GOOD film, that could have been a GREAT film.  Despite the much added superheroes included in this one in the epic Airport battle, it wasn't up to the level of Capt. America Winter Soldier, IMO. 
Still do recommend it in dubiously. (: 

On a scale of 1 to 10, .. I'd give Capt. America Civil War 8.0"
"Jul 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,Entertaining and high budget.
"Jul 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captivating and thrilling the whole way through, Civil War does a brilliant job of introducing fantastic characters to the MCU and balancing a great storyline along the way. Never has a marvel movie been this good."
"Jul 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This is by far the best marvel movie of all time. It's action packed, funny has a great story that's similar enough to the comic. Also black panther and the new spider man are awesome and funny. And if you've seen all the films that have both Iron Man & Captain America, seeing them brutally beat each other can almost make you cry. It's just an over all great movie on every Front :)"
"Jul 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,Marvel tapped some new material here - very entertaining and thought-provoking for the genre.
"Jul 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,"What an awesome movie! I’ve held out seeing these for so long because I’m not always the most interested in superhero movies. I am so glad I gave this a shot. A little slow in the beginning but once it picked up, oh man what a fun ride. I really liked seeing all the superheroes working together and I especially liked the addition of the new Spiderman. Oh man his quirky humor and talkative nature made it fun. Plus my heart was racing during the epic all out battle in the middle. I mean every single superhero fighting against each other? What more could you ask for? It was also cool seeing everyone divided and fighting against each other. But seriously, to bring all these different superheroes into one movie? Awesome. Love it."
"Jul 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The minor plot holes keep it from being truly perfect, but the Russo brothers have crafted an unforgettable film, and it will be recognized as one of Marvel's finest."
"Jul 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,The movie captures a great rivalry between Captain America and Iron Man. Portrays Spider-Man almost perfectly. Chadwick's role as Black Panther highly impresses me. The Russos have balanced a good distance between Steve and Tony.
"Jul 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Best captain America movie, best avengers movie. Went with a friend who hasn't liked any marvel movie and he loved it. Great film!"
"Jul 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,Buenas secuencias de acción pero eso no quita la pésima dirección de los hermanos Russo y esta película prueba que Batman v Superman y Suicide Squad son mejores que estas porquerías.
"Jul 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,iron man got beat up
"Jul 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,"As the comic book juggernaut (pun not intended) continues to grow, there are going to be numerous comparisons between movies as they come out and how much better this film was over that one. A film should be allowed to stand on its own (even though I am going to be writing a special comparison between this film and the clash film from the ""other"" publisher). After the mediocrity that was Age of Ultron, Captain America: Civil War has the ability to continue the greatness of The Winter Solider. It doesn't have to stand on the remains of the film before it, even though Civil War plays more like an Avengers sequel, this is Captain America's story.

 

As the film begins the world is angry after the massive collateral damage that's occurred in the battles of the Avengers. Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.), faced with the real life cost of their wars, spearheads the idea of the Avengers to be monitored and controlled by the government. Of course this splits the Avengers into two camps, which is going to happen when such a revolutionary idea is placed upon a group of people. This is coupled to the fact that Captain America (Chris Evans) has the added stress of finding and helping his friend Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) a.k.a. The Winter Soldier. As the story progresses we learn that there is a puppet master pulling the strings on the situation, continuously driving a wedge between the already fractured Avengers. 

 

Civil War is what a great movie should be. The film takes the audience for a ride, literally and emotionally. We travel the world as this characters, many of whom we grew up with since we were children, build for their cause. It's these same characters that cause us as an audience to finally choose a side in the ultimate confrontation that builds throughout the film. It's an experience that sucks you in and involves you in the action that's happening up on the screen. A hallmark of any good film. In a world flooded with comic book films this film will be one that stands out.

 

This film has everything in place and gels in every way and is currently the one stand out in a summer movie season that seems to be more about malaise than masterpieces. Obviously there will be more films and Civil War makes me want to see them. The film made me want to go back and check out what I missed (Ant-Man- review coming soon). A stunning film in a bloated market."
"Jul 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Absolutely phenomenal. Fun, dramatic and touching  with great tone variety and range Civil War is both enjoyable and intriguing by being a deconstruction of heeroes we have known for 8 years.

You have never seen Avengers at their lowest and the MCU have never been in the highest!!"
"Jul 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Once again, was worth a price of admission"
"Jul 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best Superhero film of all time
"Jul 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America Civil War is one of the best Marvel movies ever. The thought of some of the best Marvel heroes fighting each other is unbelievable. This movie ties together the best movies. These movies contain the Iron 
Man series, Ant Man, the Captain America movies, and reveals the new Spider-Man.  I would recommend this movie to anyone."
"Jul 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,I might have seen to many of these to be dazzled. It all looks fake and contrived.
"Jul 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Love all the new Marvel flicks. This one was also good, but too many holes in the plot line kept me from being able to immerse myself in the fantasy."
"Jul 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,"First-timers to the series may get lost, but dedicated fans will be treated to an intelligent, character-driven film with spectacular action."
"Jul 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,Great movie. It's amazing I loved it I can't wait for the next avengers movie. It keeps you wondering where it's going to go.
"Jul 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,"it was good, my kids enjoyed it. this genre is starting to fray for me"
"Jul 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I thought this film was quite well done and very different from the previous Captain America films.  I didn't think it had the same focus and development for Captain America that Winter Soldier did, but that's obviously due to the fact that there are a lot more characters in this film to deal with.  Given so many characters, I thought it was balanced fairly well.  The major focus was still on Cap and Bucky from the franchise, sharing with Tony Stark, but I thought the smaller stories were told well, the Scarlet Witch's guilt story, Vision's development, all fairly brief but well done.  I especially have to say that I thought Black Panther's introduction was done tremendously well and this film and story was a great opportunity to introduce him.  I think that was one of the best parts of this film.  Spider-Man's introduction was a little shakier in this film, but once he got in costume, he was an incredibly entertaining part of the movie.  I really enjoyed Tony Stark's development in the film, building on his previous appearances and going back into his past with his parents.  I had a sinking feeling through the whole movie of how that was going to tie-in to Winter Soldier, and that hunch proved correct.  I really like the climax of the film as it came about very unexpected.  It seemed very standard, the good-guys fight each other, but see the error of their ways and team up to fight the villain at the end.  But they walk into that base and that turns on its ear so fast and so well and we get the real fight that everyone was expecting.  I thought that was really well done.  All in all, I think Civil War tries to pack a little bit much in and feels like a bit of a behemoth, but for all that, it still delivers and I really enjoyed it."
"Jul 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,This movie was nearly flawless. Just an amazing masterpiece for Marvel. I don't think I can say anything that hasn't already been said. Everything in it was just awesome and I loved every second. There is no reason to not like this movie. It's the best comic book movie of all time. 10/10
"Jul 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best Marvel movie yet.
"Jul 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,As close as you will get to the perfect comicbook event/crossover!!! Simply brilliant and balanced expertly.
"Jul 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Like a fine wine, Marvel gets better with age."
"Jul 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Finally something good for once,Pros,The plot,Robert Downey Jr.,Chris Evans,Chadwick Boseman,Scarlet Johansson,Tom Holland,Paul Rudd,Jeremy Renner,The airport fight scene,CAPTAIN AMERICA VS IRON MAN,the avengers effect,pretty much the action,Crossbones looks badass,one flaw though,Vision,so I have to explain something,when something gets 5 stars I myself says fav club cause well it's the best of the best,"
"Jul 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Fun, action packed, and perfect.  All you need to know"
"Jul 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,Captain America Civil War is a movie that will emerge you back into your inner child.
"Jul 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"from best action movies i have ever seen , trust me you must watch it and you'll enjoy"
"Jul 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,In contrast to last months gritty frustrating nonsensical DC hammer blow; Civil War is a powerhouse. Showcasing great character development. Motives and ideologies you understand as they have been built up over 7 films. My only real negative (not even that) is with marvel films plots starting consistently showcase villains/big bads of the movie being direct results of a specific character/s actions. Such as ultron being created by starks Mistakes. Simply as so far if the hero's didn't exist there'd be no problems. But the way they use this to set up the final battle is really interesting and totally new Steynton end it on. In all best marvel movie yet?...could well be.
"Jul 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,Captain American or I like to say Ironman 4: Civil War. is very well made comic book movie. but it plays it too safe in a time where more risks should be taken.
"Jul 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best movie ever!!!I love captain America so much!It was like OMG!My new favorite movie.
"Jul 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,Eh.. 2nd movie best so far.
"Jul 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,overall a pretty good movie
"Jul 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,Phase Three of the Marvel Cinematic Universe kicks off with a bang in the form of one of the series' best films yet.
"Jul 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,The best of them yet.  What can touch this in its genre?  NOTHING!
"Jul 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,a fun superhero showdown
"Jul 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Not on par with ""The Winter Soldier"", but it comes pretty damn close."
"Jul 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I gave the third Cap movie a rare 5 Star because it was simply an amazing movie. The characters were great! The intense drama was intertwined with hilarious jokes! The action sequences were flawless! The only downside was the villain, Zemo. Although, he was not the comic book adaptation that loyal Marvel fans anticipated, he was still the witty character we have all grown to love. His plan was a little unrealistic, but how it played in with the story was just perfect! Can't wait for the next Marvel movie!!!!"
"Jul 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,captain America: civil war
"Jul 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Having the idea of an incredible film like this is one thing. Knowing how to put the ideas together to create your masterpiece is another. 
Captain America: Civil War was a well written, well directed, and well put together masterpiece.
Dawn Of Justice is an example of a potential masterpiece, a wonderful idea, but terribly put together.
With Captain America: Civil War, a crowded canvas doesn't really matter. Civil War was a creative idea, and well painted. This is a masterpiece.
I rate it a 4.5 rather than a 5/5. Something was missing. A major ingredient made this film seem cluttered or overcrowded.
Civil War is a must-see for comic fans, or at least - people who watched the other Marvel movies to understand it."
"Jul 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,AN awesome movie. The best MCU movie after Winter Soldier. Thank u Russo Brothers
"Jul 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,Better than I had hoped
"Jul 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,This movie made me so happy and I loved it so much it's a great film and I think all of you should see it. Oh and Spiderman was awesome!!!!!!!!! Cannot wait for his next movie:)!!!!!!!!
"Jul 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This movie is everything that the MCU has ever tried to be, it shows that even though you don't have those godly characters you can still have a movie that is action packed. Captain America Civil War has the grittiest action we have ever seen in the MCU. This gets me very excited for what is next in the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
"Jul 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Great movie awesome characters,Spider-Man is the best part"
"Jul 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,Very solid film that will keep audiences entertained to the end.
"Jul 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It should have been called Captain America: Avengers 3 because that's what it seemed like.  Incredible from start to finish, it gives just enough time to all the characters and leaves you begging for more even after the 2 and a quarter hours of movie.    Well worth the Imax price."
"Jul 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Bad movie, Spider-Man was only added as a cash grab, terrible villain."
"Jul 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,Overrated.  This was not the best Marvel movie.  Winter Soldier is the best Marvel movie so far.  Its not even close to matching rating of predecessor.
"Jul 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Hey everyone! (""spider-man voice"")

This is by far the best superhero movie yet. I put the word ""yet"" at the end of the sentence, because i'm still waiting and looking forward to ""Suicide Squad"" and other superhero movie that hasn't been released yet. Although i'm a DC and a marvel fan, This movie is the one i enjoyed the most.

The movie starts off nicely, building the scenes for the main event. The character's are well put together, Tom Holland as spider-man is as great a spider-man is in the comic book and black panther is also good. The CGI is also great, i really can't add any insight on this cause i've been sucked into the movie and hardly any focus on it. Although the villain is not that good, it hasn't affected the movie overall. The actions are great, the best action scene that i've seen in a movie 10/10. The airport scene is the most spectacular thing that happened, you're always at the edge of your sit. The plot is great, there's this clip that will horrendously trigger something at the end.

This is really a great sequel to the Captain America franchise, or maybe the best marvel superhero movie to date."
"Jul 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This movie good. Just good nothing really special about it. The action was good, the acting was okay, the writing felt okay and the phasing good. The only thing it gets a 3.5 stars are two reason. Black Panther and Spider- Man. These characters stole the show with pure awesomeness. I do have to say Spider-Man had a little more of a personality. Both were handeld perfectly but it doesn't exuse the movie for being just good/okay."
"Jul 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,Might be a bit biased as Captain America is my favorite Marvel Super Hero but this movie was amazing. Some cried about lack of action and plot but it was their and fit in the context of the story and characters.
"Jul 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,Its action packed theres drama beteewn both sides and the best spiderman We've seen yuu will never get board
"Jul 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,This is a near masterpiece!!!!!!!!!
"Jul 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Great movie, the CA line of movies continue to be my favorite super hero movies."
"Jul 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Civil War begins with political pressure to limit The Avengers on what they can do, due to the collateral damage they have caused. Steve Rogers doesn't want these changes to be implemented, but Tony Stark does. So when The Avengers break apart and pick different sides and the internal conflict begins between friends. This film is dark, suspenseful, and action packed. The introduction of The Black Panther and Spider-Man really add to an already great film."
"Jul 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil WAR could've won a 5/5, but here's why it didn't:
Spectacular CGI, phenomenal acting, good writing, among other things prove why Captain America Civil War could potentially be one of the best films this year has to  offer. But, it doesn't, due to the repetitive character writing. Marvel, not every character in your films needs to be a comedian and drop a joke every 3 seconds. You can do light hearted films without it being nonstop quips and jokes. Although, this movie gets VERY dark.  In conclusion, Captain America Civil War without a single doubt is worth the price of admission, that fans of the comics, and newcomers to the films alike can enjoy."
"Jul 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,Everything was amazing except the interpretation of Robert Downey Jr because he neded more humor
"Jul 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,Ant man and Spider-Man earned this movie an extra star.  The best Captain America movie.
"Jul 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,Even the 13 th. Installment of Marvel cinematic universe. was totally MARVELLOUS ......Marvel Rocks.......
"Jul 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,One of the worst movie of Marvel I have ever seen....

"Jul 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Your classic marvel movie. Yes it's big, yes it's loud, yes.... It's just like any other marvel movie. The formula for these movie seem to never vary. It's almost a perfect recipe for success but at some point you have to ask yourself ""have I seen this before"" and yes the answer is yes. With that being said, great special effects and really unique new characters"
"Jul 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Gives a great feeling I've only ever felt since The Winter Soldier. Really strong throughout with great action pieces and surprises aplenty.
"Jul 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"One of the best superhero movies out there. The airport fight was just awesome. Spidy was the best part. Black Panther got full marks w/ casting. Tony's past was touching. Great action flick as well. I loved Black Widow for the first time. Her look, body language was more confident in this outing. I wasn't disappointed w/ Scarlet Witch & Tony. Just a great watch."
"Jul 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Civil War is an action centric and character driven movie with a strong emphasis on the moral questions surrounding the nature of the Avengers. The narrative while being fairly well written and excellently paced, unfortunately lacks the explanation of events to the audience."
"Jul 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"What can i say that hasn't been said, marvel is killing it."
"Jul 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,wow that all i got to say

"Jul 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I am a Marvel fan since 2008.  Batman V Superman storyline was better than Civil War. 

BVS cinematography might have been terrible.  But still for me, it is all about a good story.  I have already watched it 2 times.  I just can't want to watch Civil War a second time."

"Jul 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"4/5 Stars
The ever expanding Marvel Universe is embroiled in conflict and great care is taken in navigating the busy playing field. An expertly crafted story fueled by incredible action and exciting new characters, makes for a fantastic superhero entry. The climactic clash between Captain America's and Ironman's opposing teams is an absolute knockout. Favourite performance: Tom Holland as Peter Parker/Spider-Man."
"Jul 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This movie is for 10 year olds.  Not for adults.  

Civil War did not live up to it's title.  Just a bunch of camera cut PLAYFUL  CHEESY fighting scenes.  NO ONE DIED.  NO DEATHS ANYWHERE.  X-Men at least has DEATHS, GORE, and KILLS.   Civil War my ass."
"Jul 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,it makes up for age of ultrons mediocrity and adds to the super hero genre which was getting incredibly tired. It does a good job juggling all the characters and almost never feels messy.
"Jul 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"As a movie, this was much better compared to Batman vs. Superman, you can tell the protagonist and the antagonist apart."
"Jul 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Great movie, with a great battle scene done right. They allotted a perfect amount of time for each character during the fight."
"Jul 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The film is well paced, well made, entertaining and funny.  It gets you really involved with the characters and makes it difficult to chose a side.  But I would have liked to call this film Iron Man 4..."
"Jul 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Simply incredible. A must see at any age.
"Jul 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,Great from start to finish.
"Jul 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,I took away 1/2 a star because Iron Man's actions in the film makes no sense like Batman trying to kill Superman for no good reason.
"Jul 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Great action sequences, but do we need to show good guys fighting against good guys?  Think of better story lines."
"Jul 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,I being the only one didn't like Spider-Man all that much because he was sidelined.
"Jul 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,best marvel movie so far!!

"Jul 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"cinegeek.de Die schlechte Nachricht zuerst: Etwa zehn Filme laufen gleichzeitig ab im neuen Avengers, was gut sieben zu viel sind. Nun die gute: Würde man die störenden abziehen, macht der Rest Spass! Ein paar Helden fehlen übrigens dieses Mal und werden vage entschuldigt. Zur Handlung: Die Avengers mutieren zur Sonder-Terroreinheit und agieren auf Auftrag. Captain America findet diese Idee nur vordergründig gut, da die Politiker-Interessen nicht notwendig global sind. Es besteht die Gefahr der Manipulation der Superhelden! Iron Man (der wie immer unter Schuldkomplexen leidet) widerspricht und schon sind die Heroes in zwei Lage geteilt: Die Systemtreuen und die Renegaten. Das Aufeinanderprallen der Giganten wird dadurch einleuchtend motiviert, denn grundsätzliche politische Differenzen werden noch durch persönliche Fehden verstärkt. Im Hintergrund aber zieht der Bösewicht Zemo (Daniel Brühl) die Fäden, so dass die Avengers zu seinen Marionetten verkommen. Als ob wirs nicht geahnt hätten: Civil War ist ein Cliffhanger und wir dürfen wieder warten. Weiter gehts 2018..."
"Jul 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"As a huge comicbook fan and a person that loved this movie,i say that you can't give CA:CW 90% and BvS around 30%,especially after the UC BvS became a much better movie than it once was.CW was a good movie,maybe Marvel's best,but I don't think it deserve 90%,we all know that Spider-man stole the show,he was the man that everyone loved,Tom did a great job portraying Spider-man."
"Jul 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I finally watched Civil war this weekend, and was surprised I enjoyed it more than I expected. I know the Capt. America films have had a lot of good reviews, more so than the last Avengers, but I've been bothered by the whole aspect of how violent the Avengers have been, just easily killing their foes, like all of the soldiers. I understand they are saving lives, but a hero is not supposed to kill. Aside, from the Hulk, the others should have more control. I also understand Cap's issue of not letting the government control them, because who knows what they would use the Avengers for? I like how the issues are related to what is going on with the violence around the world. I also really liked all the characters, including the new ones, and love Ant man! The battle scenes were intense."
"Jul 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War is AMAZING! This is the best Captain America and superhero movie yet. The plot of this movie is awesome. This movie is action-packed, surprising, and very entertaining. Marvel has done an amazing job with this movie. I would very much suggest this movie."
"Jul 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,Awesome action packed Marvel movie!
"Jul 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This film was everything Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice should have been for the DC universe. CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR was absolutely fantastic, unforgettable, and defining for the MCU. 

This film is just the right amount of action and drama, and also had fabulous acting by both Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. A great part of this spectacle was the use of Avengers that do not always get the spotlight, like Scarlet Witch, Vision, War Machine, Black Widow, and the new Spider-Man. CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR is a film to be excited  for and a film that gets fans excited for the upcoming additions to the MCU. I cannot wait to see what comes next!"
"Jul 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The best of the summer blockbuster films. A little darker than CA: The Winter Soldier, this movie lives up to it's hype and is one of the better entries in the Marvel cinematic universe."
"Jul 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,Another homerun by Marvel
"Jul 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America. 
Marvel movie. 
Enough said."
"Jul 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,so flipping awesome I couldn't handle the action!!!!!!
"Jul 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Excellent movie. Great action sequences, amazing story, all around an incredible film."
"Jul 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Was never a fan of superhero movies, but this is a fun time, if you like superhero movies, you will like this."
"Jul 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Please replace Scarlett with Emily Blunt who's Marvel's first choice for Black Widow. I dunno, but Scarlett just doesn't look convincing in action roles and doesn't do justice to Black Widow. Props to Scarlett's stunt double, the real Black Widow."
"Jul 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,Absolutely the best Marvel movie after Avengers. 2 groups going against each other over brotherhood. Captain willing to save one of his brother and leave his team. After that they became friends again. I don't think I ever saw a movie like that in my life where a group of teams works together but divided over a issue and later reconnects. It's so worth it to watch it again.
"Jul 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"holds up really well
if not the best hero movie, has to be in most top ten 
interesting in repeat viewing to see shell of winter soldier driven story without civil war part"
"Jul 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The best fight scene of all time, this is marvel best film to date."
"Jul 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"O Governo quer controlar a Shield, sendo que um ataque a um Rei de uma pais africano leva uma guerra entre os integrantes da Shield, de um lado Capitão América tentando defender um inocente acusado de matar o rei e o Homem de Ferro se mostrando prepotente e ao lado do governo."
"Jul 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Face it, Disney's MCU Franchise is for the children.  Disney is not brainwashing me.  Civil War is one BIG DUMB kid's movie.  Adults need to grow up."
"Jul 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best Marvel movie I have seen.
"Jul 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"My favorite movie of all time! This movie was perfect. The pace of it I can't complain. The story was nicely told. The way they introduce new characters to The Avengers is just perfect. Great action scenes, very exciting movie, I highly recommend this movie to anyone seeking excitement in a movie."
"Jul 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Even friends can be your biggest enemies.

Captain America: Civil War is behind ""Iron Man"", ""Winter Soldier"", and ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" of being the best movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (Or MCU for short). The movie has it's flaws, but that doesn't stop me from liking it. I don't know about you, but the Captain America series are the only movies in the MCU that actually get better with it's squeals. The action, the effect's, the humor, the characters, and it's stunt work has improved from the first movie.

What this movie dose so well is that it's really hard to pick a side, because both sides have a very good reason to be at each others throats. One minute I'm rooting for Tony, and the next I'm rooting for Cap. It's conflict like this that I couldn't decide for myself on who side I was on or who was right, but that's just the fun of it.

Tom Holland as Spider-Man might be one of the best adaption of the character that we've had. Sony studios has made over five Spider-Man movies and the two actors who played Spider-Man (Maguire and Garfield), did their very best of what their got, but didn't quite capture the character that we know and love. But the Spider-Man in this movie has a screen time of 30 minutes or more, and Holland managed to capture the character so perfectly that it makes Sony studios look lousy. He was excellent in the role and I would go as far to say that he was a billion times better than Maguire and Garfield (In my opinion). I can't wait to see more of him in ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" that's out next year.

Speaking of good casting - Chadwick Boseman was pretty damn awesome as Black Panther. Boseman can basically play anything and I'm not kidding you when I say that, as he played Jackie Robinson, James Brown, and now Black Panther. Chadwick Boseman has some crazy talent and him as Black Panther was spot on casting. I'm looking forward to seeing his solo film coming out in 2018.

If you thought the stunt work in ""Winter Soldier"" was outstanding, then wait until you see the stunt work in this movie, as it was just....INCREDIBLE! All the heavy praise belongs to the stunt team for doing the impossible.

Now for the problems: Daniel Brühl is a boring villain. I honestly can't remember much about his character in the movie and that's because he was pretty forgettable. That came across a bit too harsh didn't it? It really sucks for me to say that, because Daniel Brühl is great actor and sometimes he can be the saving grace for a movie that's either good or bad. He wasn't awful or anything like that, it's just that I didn't find him treating at all.

Martin Freeman is a great actor and I'm glad he's getting more meaty roles, but he doesn't do anything special or interesting in this movie. Yes, I know his character is probably going to developed more in the next movies, but my problem here is that he really felt out of place in this movie. At times the movie itself completely forgets about him, so every time he popped back up on screen I was like ""Oh, Martin Freeman is in this movie, I totally forgot about that"". But that's just me.

The story was a bit meh and there was a little bit too much quick cut edits in the fight scenes that I couldn't get all that infested with. Now don't get me wrong, I like the airport fight and the Iron Man V Cap fight, because those scenes didn't have stupid quick cuts and I could easily see whats happening. I think it's the hand-to-hand combat fights that are too cutter for me to see what's going on. That's just my opinion.

Overall: ""Captain America: Civil War"" lives up to the hype of being a great superhero movie and being a good movie on it's own. Marvel is having a great track record thus far- with the box office success, great reviews, and many upcoming spin offs. Civil War is most likely going to win every fanboys heart and it's not hard to see why."
"Jul 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,Really good! Felt more like 'The Avengers: Civil War' though.
"Jul 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,Most amazing  movie ever
"Jul 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Filled with outstanding action sequences, and a more mature plot than most of the other MCU movies, Civil War is a thought-provoking superhero flick that might be the best Marvel movie I've seen yet."
"Jul 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,Marvel movies are always good
"Jul 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Big budget, big bangs, big CGI, but ultimately boring. Intellectually very unstimulating."
"Jul 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Just like so many other marvel films, it was great!"
"Jul 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,It's ok. Any Marvel film going to be fun.
"Jul 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,Spider-Man was amazing!!!!!!!!!
"Jul 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,Downey was not very entertaining.  This movie is seriously overrated.
"Jul 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,This was average.  Tarzan is better than this. LOL
"Jul 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,What boring movie.  I can't understand why critics gave it 90%.
"Jul 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I love the franchise, this was definitely TME (too much everything) but I'm not going to hold that against them, it's kind of what you sign up for with the marvel franchise, I mean, just look how many people are on the poster."
"Jul 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Generic and boring.  

Critics obviously paid.  Time to overthrow Rotten Tomatoes."
"Jul 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,And they all live happily together again.
"Jul 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Dumbing down children and adults. Intellectual my ass, nothing mentally challenging in this superhero movie."
"Jul 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,This was sooo boring.  I was expecting Winter Soldier quality.  Instead I got rated G quality.
"Jul 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,I hope Spider-Man Homecoming doesn't turn out like this.
"Jul 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Dumbing down society theory, this movie is a good example. 

Reduce the intellectual content of writing to make us more stupid."
"Jul 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,Have a drink loads of popcorn kick back and enjoy. More of the same far better than Superman v Batman.
"Jul 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,A film that is filled with plot holes but gets a pass because they crack jokes every 30 seconds.  Vision could have hacked and disabled the jet Captain America and Winter Soldier escaped in. Also a high security facility doesn't do background checks on a doctor who's about to examine the most dangerous prisoner on the planet?
"Jul 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,"We all know what's good about the movie. With a huge ensemble, it managed to give each superhero the screen time he/she needed. It didn't feel forced at all. The 18-minute or so airport scene was perhaps the most talked about because of Spider-Man's appearance. While that's one explosive fight, I didn't feel that there was seriousness in the fight. They all held back. I thought it was a farce. 

I thought the best parts of the movies are those that put me through the emotional wringer - the moment Iron Man finds out the truth about the death of his parents. It was intense and powerful."
"Jul 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,"After Critics falsely rating Ghostbusters with a 75%, how can you trust them at this point.  This was an average movie for children.  Finding Dory and Jungle Book was better than this."
"Jul 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,LOL 90%?  A snore fest.
"Jul 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,Spider-Man is annoying.
"Jul 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,Now this is one big gay pun.
"Jul 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,Could have been better.
"Jul 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,Loved it one of my favorite superhero movies. The characters are great marvel did it again!
"Jul 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,I wanted a little more humour between Iron Man and Ant Man.  Also it would have been amazing if they killed of somebody. (Captain America)
"Jul 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I thought it was great, but Tom Holland as Spider Man will be hard to get used to."
"Jul 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"After watching CACW,it now is my favorite MCU movie.One of the best Marvel,you've done it again."
"Jul 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,50% rating would have made sense.
"Jul 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,Two hours of action sequences.
"Jul 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The movie had everything that a fan like me wanted, great action, great comedy, an interesting story that makes sense, and lots of the Cap.  If you love Marvel movies, and just love movies in general, I would highly recommend that you go and see this movie"
"Jul 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,muy buena esepto por el exesibo de chistes y baron sim
"Jul 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,Way more dialogue than necessary. Too many sub stories that ultimately weighed down the movie.
"Jun 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Immature.  This movie was for the kids.
DEADPOOL or DOCTOR STRANGE  WILL BE THE BEST MARVEL MOVIE THIS YEAR."
"Jun 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,one of the best and most exiting marvel films to date
"Jun 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,One of the best Marvel films you will ever see.
"Jun 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,awesome in my opinion just as good as or better than the avengers movies going through a few different peoples playing the hulk and a few playing spiderman
"Jun 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,I loved the movie and thought that it was cool to see all the characters
"Jun 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It's no Winter Soldier, but it's still pretty darn good."
"Jun 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Not much to say other than another very well made Marvel movie.

Solid storyline, acting, CGI"
"Jun 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This movie was not very intriguing, even as a marvel fan. It felt more like padding to hold us over till Infinity War comes out. I really had to sit forward in my seat in order to stay awake during the talking sequences, and they make up A LOT of the movie. BUT, the fighting sequences I would even go as far as to say aw inspiring. Wait for this movie on DVD for seeing, because believe me, the fighting sequences are worth seeing."
"Jun 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Diverse cast of characters, no hulk ð???"
"Jun 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,Some parts are really good other parts are predictable.
"Jun 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America series in this Marvel franchise never lets one down. Regardless of what is going to reveal about the true colour of the Captain (facepalm), he is still the Captain for now, standing up for righteous cause and true justice and integrity. Civil War really is a lot better than one had expected and brought in so much laugh!!"
"Jun 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,all these critics always seem to praise Disney's Marvel and trash DC comics. let's make it clear please.  Marvel is for simple people and DC is more aimed at the fans that read and know the story lines and not just about action like Marvel does their movies. If the critics don't understand the DC story lines then say it and stop trashing the DC movies just because you as a critic are dumb to story. All I see are a bunch of biased critics.
"Jun 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,Lived up to all the hype. Great movie!
"Jun 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"One word...spectacular. This is the pinnacle of what a superhero movie should be. One, where as an audience member, you are able to sympathize with the heroes hopes and beliefs. This film does a wonderful job at making both sides (Captain America and Iron Man) seem right about what they are fighting for. If that's not enough, the movie perfectly establishes the newer characters into the story without allowing the rest of the movie revolve around them too much to the point where it detracts from the main characters. More is revealed about certain characters and their actual connections and it gives the audience a chance to see them at a new light. I found myself split on the decision on which team to follow through the entire film. This is how you properly create an engaging story about ""Hero vs Hero"". The only flaw that I can see is the abundance of constant FYI for the majority of the action scenes. This film shows a bright future for the Marvel Cinematic Universe and I simply cannot wait to see how they top this one."
"Jun 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Really solid flick. Not as good as The Avengers 1, however, but better than the The Avengers 2: Age of Ultron."
"Jun 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"i really cannot understand the critics here. I guess they were reviewing a Disney film for kids rather than a Marvel franchise film about comic book superheroes. The film has good non-stop action but nothing else. its full of contrived plot and uncharacteristic behaviour. It should have been called an Iron Man or Avengers film, none of which I like."
"Jun 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,Captain America: Civil War not only settles vital moral debates amongst its stellar cast but also assists in setting up future installments and define a new direction for the franchise.
"Jun 26, 2016",NEUTRAL,"awesome, but didn't blow my mind, kinda predictable"
"Jun 26, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Easily the best MCU movie to date.  It does what BvS did not do; respect the source material and tell a straight forward story.  All the characters had their moments to shine, but Spider-Man, Ant-Man and Black Panther really stole the show in this one.  It really got me excited for a new Spider-Man movie and a Black Panther movie.  The only weakness of the movie was the overall villain but he was okay."
"Jun 26, 2016",NEUTRAL,Meh... Probably the worst of the avenger super hero series thus far. A few good scenes
"Jun 26, 2016",NEUTRAL,"YOU ARE A FOOL IF YOU DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. The action, the twist, everything about this movie is amazing. It answered a lot of question but also opened new ones. Makes me excited for the other movies to come out! Seriously you need to see this movie in order to understand previous movies. The Marvel movies are all connected so do not just watch one and call it a night."
"Jun 26, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Once again, a Marvel film relies on relentless fight scenes to make a film. The story line is there, but lifeless. I fell asleep twice."
"Jun 26, 2016",NEUTRAL,This was a great Marvel movie. They did a great job integrating the many other characters. I loved the new spiderman and hope they make a spiderman movie worthy of him for once! I have faith in Marvel.
"Jun 26, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Left the theatre early- way way way too long, slow-moving plot"
"Jun 26, 2016",NEUTRAL,"One of the best Marvel movies this far. Maybe as good as Winter Solider. Plenty of action & drama, & character building. A fun ride from start to finish."
"Jun 26, 2016",NEUTRAL,I liked it.. but what was with Spiderman ?
"Jun 26, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Adding some real tension to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, all your favorite characters have something to do. Both fun and rather  dramatic."
"Jun 25, 2016",NEUTRAL,Fantastic. So well done.
"Jun 25, 2016",NEUTRAL,Awesome. I can't think of any other words to describe this movie except awesome from start to finish pure awesomeness without given much away let me say two break out characters Who stole the show were Antman and Spiderman and kudos to Robert Downey Junior who made me really feel hatred towards Iron Man.
"Jun 25, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The Captain America movies have never been lacking, and Marvel certainly wasn't going to let that happen in CA:CW. Civil War was probably the best Avenger's movie that I have ever seen, and it wasn't even an Avenger's movie. 

Probably one of the only things that annoyed me was the marketing campaign. Civil War, despite what the marketing team would want you to believe, is not a dichotomy of good and evil, right or wrong, Captain America or Iron Man. And what was so amazing about the movie was that it illustrated both sides of the argument shown in the film. Black Widow's flip flopping between Rogers and Stark was also addressed, which made it easier to understand her motivations, and ultimately made her even more likable. (I mean, who doesn't like Black Widow?) 

Oh, the other thing that annoyed me was Spider Man. Although he was perfectly likable and actually provided a good outlet of comedic relief, it was annoying to see another skinny white boy as Spider Man. When the friendly neighborhood spider was unveiled in the trailer, a plethora of cries called for Miles Morales, a spark of hope that I was clinging onto that said, ""Please Marvel, do something good for us"". Alas, it was easy to disappoint. Not to mention that Aunt May seems to be getting younger and younger through every reboot of Spider Man...

But this was by far the best Captain America movie. And by far one of my favorite movies of the entire year, no questions asked. It's packed with action and sentiment, and is a perfect blend of - unsurprisingly - Captain America and Iron Man."
"Jun 25, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best captain movie yet!
"Jun 25, 2016",NEUTRAL,Good but also just more of the same. All these Marvel movies are blurring into one at the moment.
"Jun 25, 2016",NEUTRAL,Very nicely done!  I just disagree with who they chose to play spiderman and disagree that Tony Stark helped spiderman with his suit and all because that did not happen in the comics.  The guy that plays spiderman is just too young.
"Jun 25, 2016",NEUTRAL,"A reminder that Disney's ""The Avengers"" was not  a fluke and that every bit matters from the actors, the stories, and the teams behind the cameras.  Civil War accomplishes what so many big budget action films don't.  It intelligently entertains.

These characters have motivation and purpose.  The script is was written by those who paid attention to what the characters would want to do, and the story is woven deep within that concept.  The Disney Move Machine is in top form with obvious love being given to every detail from those behind and in front of the camera.

I detailed synopsis is not required.  If you have even the slightest interest in this genre you will enjoy it immensely."
"Jun 25, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Great stuff when it concentrates on the intellectual aspect of the conflict. Maylays at an airport are all ""Saturday morning cartoon"" fare but the real fight comes toward the end when friends lay into each other over loyalties and nobody is a clear cut winner. Not better than Winter Soldier, but well worth anyone's attention. Consummate acting and directing, a big jump from the days of 1990's rubber suits and boring villains."
"Jun 25, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Probably Marvel's finest production. Stellar direction, stellar cast, stellar movie."
"Jun 25, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Doy gracias al cielo por haberla visto descargada de internet, mas de lo mismo! Chistes idiotas para niños y se cagan en el comic..."
"Jun 19, 2016",NEUTRAL,good from beginning to end
"Jun 19, 2016",NEUTRAL,I've seen this movie three times now and it's still awesome!!
"Jun 19, 2016",NEUTRAL,These comic book films (apart from Deadpool) are getting a bit boring now
"Jun 19, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Ok, fell asleep a few times !"
"Jun 19, 2016",NEUTRAL,"great premise but poorly executed, and the spiderboy character sucked,costume and all."
"Jun 19, 2016",NEUTRAL,"weak plot, no consequences to the heroes action, more like a transformer movie, not a captain america movie its more like an iron movie featuring captain america ,  too many heroes"
"Jun 19, 2016",NEUTRAL,the comics are better. cap could not fight iron man in a million years... it was ð???
"Jun 19, 2016",NEUTRAL,loved it would watch again
"Jun 19, 2016",NEUTRAL,It was a really good plot on what most of the comic battles are to be. Wish the Spiderman would have been played by the Amazing Spiderman actor this one did not really pull him off
"Jun 19, 2016",NEUTRAL,This is the shit of superhero brilliance.
"Jun 19, 2016",NEUTRAL,5/14/2017 (2):  A good movie and exactly what I expected. I was not a huge fan of the plot and cause of the civil war though.
"Jun 19, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The most amazing super hero film of all time.  I enjoyed it so much I saw it twice, it has great story, great action, and an amazing cast! A must see!"
"Jun 19, 2016",NEUTRAL,"So this movie it's more like a fight club that a civil war and the movie make no sense they want to kill each other but they are friend so they don't want to hurt each other but and the same time they shoot rocket,thrown shit everywhere... AND some of them don't even know what ex:spider-man can do but no fuck given Cap destroy a ramp on top of spider-man without knowing he can survive AND make a stupid one line joke ... seriously that what kid love ?? what happen to movie critics with 90% on rotten tomatoes - its a no brainer movie"
"Jun 19, 2016",NEUTRAL,in the long line of Marvel movies that are coming out now they seem to be trying to one-up themselves with everyone that's coming out. this movie is good and sets up the infinity War series coming pretty well I like the fact they introduced a few other characters into the Avengers world being in a Spider-Man coming back and Ant-Man.. The airport fight scene was probably one of the best films and best action scenes I've ever seen in a movie.. I would suggest seeing this movie if you haven't already
"Jun 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,Greeeeeaaaaat moviye
"Jun 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,i liked most the quicksilva btw all over good movie but missing thor ..
"Jun 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,started slow but picked up later on
"Jun 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,Shaky camera. Action scenes are hard to follow right from the beginning of the movie. So disappointed.
"Jun 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The tension and conflict between Cap and Stark was magnified from the comic book in this MCU version with funny, amazing Spidey scenes."
"Jun 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,Fun but nothing to brag about for the hype.
"Jun 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,"a better version of 'batman vs supeeman' but also taking itself too seriously especially for a Marvel film 
I miss deadpool"
"Jun 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,Excellent flick! Kept you guessing till the end with lots and lots of action...Great characters all the way through with an interesting moral dilemma...
"Jun 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Great action, humor and masterful use of all the pompous characters. Airport fight sequence best since The Avengers. Must-watch!"
"Jun 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,Loved it!   Much better than the comic event it takes it's name from.   My second favorite Cap movie and my fourth favorite of all the Marvel movies (and I love them all).
"Jun 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The best Captain America yet, and the official winner of the Superheroes-Fighting-Each-Other Contest."
"Jun 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best come together of all marvel characters
"Jun 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This movie, which I've been waiting for years, lives up to its expectations."
"Jun 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,This was a fun movie.  I enjoyed it.
"Jun 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,"A 
The magnum opus of Captain America films and possibly Marvel films. This film is a fun, gritty, dramatic, and entertaining moviegoing experience. It's the most fun I've had in a theater in awhile."
"Jun 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,A great film... As good as The Winter Soldier but not necessarily better.
"Jun 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,Marvel does it right again. I absolutely loved seeing so many of the Marvel heroes on one screen (although I did think it was quite unusual). I thoroughly enjoyed this film just as much at the other Captain America films. It's definitely worth a watch.
"Jun 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,"While not the best movie of all time,it's the best one of the MCU"
"Jun 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,The Movie made no sense to me RDJ and Chris Evans is awesome but the movie has the worst villain ever to appear in a movie and to much jokes just wrong with so many jokes. No one of the superheroes appear not to kill the other. And the movie is just so like the rest of MCU with plot nothing special. Marvel Studios can much better than this. A pair of the heroes like spider-man is rushed to the movie with sucks. Do a much better job next time.
"Jun 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,"mala, la trama es de niños"
"Jun 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,Dont follow the comics much but movie was entertaining.  Had alot of fighting scenes between superheroes that had the whole family on the edge of their seats for. Kids laughed and repeated the one liners for about week around the house so I see us adding this one to our collection when it hits digital.
"Jun 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,best marvel movie yet everyone should see it
"Jun 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,Greatest marvel movie ever based off a comic book hero greats
"Jun 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,Another solid effort in the superhero genre. These have become the must-see movies in my book and some of the few that actually warrant a trip to the theater.
"Jun 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,Weakest Captain America movie to date. Ridiculous how they avengers continue to fight against each other. Makes no sense.
"Jun 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,Unnecessary violent and uneven story
"Jun 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"While the first two Captain America films were good, they were a bit of a reach from great.  ""Civil War,"" however, does a great job of not only bringing Captain America and the Winter Soldier into the full swing of the Marvel cinematic universe, but also handles a difficult conflict that can easily be applied to our society.  Besides creating a believable story line, the film is also filled with top notch action.  Creating a fun and dramatic film with this many characters, including new ones, should have been pretty close to impossible, but the Russo brothers somehow found a way to pull it off."
"Jun 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Not the greatest superhero film, but Civil War is a fine installment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
"Jun 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Great fun! Highly recommend it - yes there are a few holes but nothing to worry about really. Loved Daniel Bruehl as the villain and the Spiderman dialouges are so well written, so was the ending!! It helps to have seen the other Avengers (Group or Individuals) movies for this one though."
"Jun 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The director of the second captain America film, presents the third film in the Captain America Series: Civil War. Being a big fan of the winter solider, I had high hopes for this film, but found myself quite disappointed. To start off the film hardly feels like a Captain America film, and is more like an Avengers film. The film features all the super heroes from the previous films with the exception of Thor and the Hulk. The film also adds Spiderman to the mix. The division of the team begins when a pact signed by over 100 countries calls for the Avengers to be in check and have more scrutiny and responsibility for their actions. The tension grows as Captain America and Ironman disagree on the matter. Throw in tons of over the top action scenes that feel bloated and pointless, the threads that pull the team apart seem pretty trivial as well. With the short and stubborn tempers of nearly all of the heroes in the film was tiresome. The jokes in the film were also terrible and at 2 hours and 26 minutes, the longest Marvel film, I was more than ready for this film to be over."
"Jun 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"1 of the top action movies I have seen so far. it shows about friendships, a tad pit of romance, and the heartbreaking quote. must see!!"
"Jun 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,awesome movie!!!! everyone should watch it
"Jun 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Everyone loves this movie and I'll admit it's rather well done, with notable highlights being Spiderman and for once an actually interesting villain produced by the Marvel movies. However this movies praise are far too large it's a little sloppy but a fun ride all the way nonetheless not 5/5 but more so a solid 3.5/5, just next time Marvel please please please let one of the characters die, there are no stakes if everyone lives in the end and continually cheat death."
"Jun 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,one of the best mcu movie
"Jun 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain War: Civil America is about a 100 year old war vet who has a disagreement with a rich robot boy because of the big bad gub'ment, he then finds out that his only living 100 year old friend with a prosthetic arm maybe blew up the UN. He gets scared and goes looking for him. He gathers up a team of illegals, including a teenage girl, bug boy, and arrow man to follow bucko's intuition against robo boy's and widowmaker's feelers. Turns out, buko (aka. cold commando) is right, and an adventure ensues that might split the avenger apart.
Was it good? Yeah. Was it long? Yeah. Did it have an after credits teaser? Yeah. Stan lee was there too? Yeah. And it was made my Disney Marvel in the superhero series that keeps making good action flicks with a little substance too? Yep.
Okay, it fits the checklist. It's a Disney/Marvel movie, you know it's going to be good, they always are. Why are you reading this? This was was even better than the usual, i'd say, but alas I wish these has more of that sweet, hot, sticky, salty plot and story elements instead of ""kicking ass"" as robo boy likes to say. If it did, i'd give it a nice, slick 4~
Overall i'd give a 3.5 good, fun, not spectacular or a masterpiece. Still worth the price of admission if you wanna relax and eat popcorn and not want to think too hard."
"Jun 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Awesome movie, I thought the actual Civil War would be more emotional driven..it was more like a contest but turns dark toward the end. Must see!"
"Jun 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"dull compared to ALL the other Avengers Movies i've seen.  I havent seen Ironman3, but I cant imagine it being worse than this one."
"Jun 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,the best marvel movie so far
"Jun 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,AWESOME  saw it the day it came out and seing it and seing it again this week.
"Jun 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War

I saw this because it was 100+ degrees out,there was nothing else to
see in town, and it got good reviews. So, a short review is in order.

Pros: No Pepper Pots, No Hulk, No space aliens, (Head) Human villain played
by Daniel Bruhl. No Thor. Spider man's acrobatics. Antman was cool,
shockingly, Plot had some surprises, Trailer for Dr. Strange played by
Benedict Cumberbatch, Black Panther kicks ass! Captain America is
actually not a rule following, annoying, frat boy, kiss ass in this
one. 

Cons: Rhodes in an Ironman suit. What a self-righteous prick.
Spiderman's dialogue and childishness, Hawkeye is a waste of time,
Wanda the Witch is misused, Vision was NOT a sight to behold, No one
died in all the fighting, The plot has big holes, if you care to look,
a dearth of decent female superheroes, a weak origin story for Black
Panther, Set up had flaws like the fact that no one admitted that
without the Avengers, things would be worse. 

Push: Wanda still a cool character even if out of place, Black Widow
also seemed out of place here, Special affects sometimes
special, other times, not so much. Rogers is still Captain America. 

Rating: Matinée 

There was enough entertainment and an actual plot to bring out the
characters. The final battle was not overblown, and while the middle
battle was, it was still fun. An actual moral dilemma present in a
superhero action film is refreshing even if it is too simply presented.

Now, can we have Spiderman and Black Panther join up for a movie
without all those other clowns? Call it, 'Good Friends Defeat Umbrella
Corp', or some such thing. 

Peace, Tex Shelters"
"Jun 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,Very watchable. I enjoyed very much.
"Jun 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Very well done, good writing and directing."
"Jun 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Action, story and humour ... With a cameo appearance. Brilliant film"
"Jun 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Boring, confusing, unconvincing, terrible."
"Jun 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,Pretty good movie. The main epic fight only lasts for about 5 minutes
"Jun 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"it may not hit all the peaks that Ultron did, but it is none the less a tremendous entry into the surprisingly not exhausted genre."
"Jun 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"One of the greatest superhero movies of all time. Great plot line, side characters and themes."
"Jun 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Peggy Carter would have kicked Steve and Sharon's asses but eh. What can you do. #heteronormativity Oh and Spiderman was really unnecessary. Truly, his presence in the movie is just to advertise the re-renewal of the movies. Do we REALLY need a third Spiderman? Can't we finally have a Black Widow movie instead?"
"Jun 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Fucking incredible!""nuff said"""
"Jun 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,Marvel movies are normally well done. This lived up to its expectation.
"Jun 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,Team Cap all the way!
"Jun 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,"One of the strongest additions to the MCU, Captain America: Civil War, is a satisfying action-packed extravaganza boasting its impressively mature storyline."
"Jun 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Great Movie. Good story line and action.
New characters awesome!"
"Jun 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Fantastic play, I like captain so much"
"Jun 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,One of if not the best movie of the avengers movies.
"Jun 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Amazing, well thought out and the intro of Black Panther and Spider-Man were top notch.  Must see"
"Jun 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Not worth rating, what a waste of time. Worse yet, way to ruin the character of Captain America."
"Jun 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,I loved every second of this movie and I can't wait until the next movie marvel cooks up.
"Jun 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,"An excellent superhero film, easily in discussion for best Marvel movie to date. Where other superhero films fail when putting too much into one movie, somehow the Russo Brothers make it all work, sacrificing only a small handful of plot holes. If you're worried about not being able to follow the massive fight scene, don't. It has the most emotional impact of any Marvel movie, the story is smart and very entertaining, and with solid acting by all (especially newcomers) this is not so arguably a must see."
"Jun 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,great movie and the saga continues
"Jun 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,The best of the Capt Americas so far. The civil war was believable unlike the nonsense of Batman vs Superman (I mean really?!) Nice to see Iron Man a little more serious and appreciating the gravitas of the moment. Favourite moment: the battle at the airport with a hilarious spiderman supporting. Best spiderman yet. Well worth seeing.
"Jun 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The best Spiderman movie ever :).   Even more characters then ultranationalist , but didn't feel bloated like ultron did at times.  The long run time left me still wanting more. Black Panthers PEFORMANCE is incredible  a few characters didnt get developed much as ID hoped  like vision & scarlet witch but we did see the start of what's hopefully a great deeply intuned relationship"
"Jun 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I was excited to see this movie based on the reviews and the rottenness, however I was extremely disappointed and literally hated this movie almost the entire 2 + hours.  The only redeeming quality was Spiderman, not even my love for Robert Downey Jr could save this movie, however I did give it 2 1/2 stars because of RDJ."
"Jun 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,incredible action packed film with a shocking twist in the plot
"Jun 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,"2nd only to Iron Man, marvel finally brought grit back into their saga. I was getting tired of the"
"Jun 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,I thought it was really good and plot was amazing storyline made sense characters and cast palmed their roles really great
"Jun 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It was lacking at the end, it worked you up to some big battle that you're expecting to happen and then falls short into a miniscule story about a single character's stubbornness to see the bigger picture.  The effects and battles were cool though.  The story really lacks that juice at the end which was very disappointing.  It just didn't live up to the hype for me so I will not be drinking the Avengers juice today, definitely not like the previous Avengers movies."
"Jun 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,It was a awesome movie
"Jun 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,one of the best super hero movies!
"Jun 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,Dont like them fighting each other because none of it is for the kill. nothing to die for. so we dont get the best out of it.
"Jun 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It may be just another episode in the MCU show, but a very entertaining one nonetheless"
"Jun 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Excellent. Not a dull moment, thought provoking yet with some mind blowing action sequences. Would watch again at the cinema, which is a rare thing for me."
"Jun 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,I Love This Movie!!!... One Of The Best Movies Of The Year!!... Its Definitely A Must See!!
"Jun 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I'll be honest guys this movie was just a little too slow for me. I know a lot of people are saying it amazed them when they first saw it but it didn't really amaze me, I didn't really think it was that amazing. It's alright, it was just too slow for me."
"Jun 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Great movie lots of action can't wait for the next one, they need to keep putting out better and better movies so everyone is interested in watching all the universe."
"Jun 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,Great story. Very unnecessary shaky cinematography.
"Jun 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Powerful conflict, great acting, with a wonderful story to follow makes this one of the greatest Marvel movies to exist so far!"
"Jun 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,Marvell + Libertarian theme = Just in time!
"Jun 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Predictable but extremely beautiful and watchable. At the ending, the ""twist"" and fight was a little hard to suspend my disbelief for... but the rest of the movie, I was hooked."
"Jun 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,"When a superhero movie never feels ""silly"" or kid oriented while watching, you know it is truly special."
"Jun 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Malisima. Con tantas que sacan y tan seguido, estÃ¡n perdiendo la calidad. PelÃ­cula aburrida y predecible."
"Jun 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,The first hour and a bit was really slow and boring but it picked up with action and turned into a good movie. Loved the new Spiderman!
"Jun 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,Good film but bloody hard to follow the plot
"Jun 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Great movie, strong addition to the Marvel collection and setting up for a lot more moving into the future!!!  Go see it you won't be dissappointed!!!"
"Jun 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,such an amazing film loved it!
"Jun 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,This movie was everything Batman vs. Superman should have been. Great storytelling along with a great way of setting up characters for the future of the MCU. One of the best movies so far this year. Truly a great way to start off Phase 3!
"Jun 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,"it is one of the worst Marvel movie,The movie is too happy,they said that the movie would be darker,im very sad with Marvel,it is because of it that I prefer DC !"
"Jun 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Ever since the trailer came out, the world has been divided into two groups. Team Cap and Team Stark. As the excitement keeps on building, we were waiting to find out who wins. I personally was on Team Stark, but I thought that Cap would win because it's his film, not the Avengers. We would be extremely disappointed if it was not great. The day we all waited came. May 6th, the day of the #CIVILWAR. We enjoyed the movie. It was good they really had no winner because they would have disappointed half of the MARVEL fans. I felt that it was a great movie, but a little more events could happen like deaths and all. We are not at all disappointed. If MARVEL makes blockbusters like this, they are in for big success."
"Jun 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Best Marvel to date! Towards the end I was gripping my pants, it was SO INTENSE!"
"Jun 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,Captain America: Civil War is one of the best Marvel movies up to date. Personally I would place it right after Guardian of the Galaxy in the second place.
"Jun 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,no different than the freak of the week tv episodes. users the same theme as the last few super hero films. too easy.
"Jun 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,Finally a less childish movie from Marvel. Funny but courageous enough to touch some serious themes.
"Jun 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,Loved it! Probably has about a 20mins or so they could cut out of it though.
"Jun 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,"An excellent movie, must get on Blu-ray."
"Jun 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"A fun movie that handles a surplus of characters brilliantly and explores human themes like most superhero movies never do, giving it a great distinctiveness. Character tension and thrilling action sequences is what it is built on, but gives a sorry attempt for a villain that could have been better, was almost pointless, and wasn't needed."
"Jun 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I loved it. 

The action sequences were amazing. Story was actually well integrated into the Universe. Lots of thrills, humor, action, and tear jerking moments. Yes, I meant that one. 

Black Panther and Spiderman stole scenes entirely. Cool and kick ass. Not to mention Tom Holland adequately played the Spiderman we all wanted to be as a kid.

And Cap and Iron Man did the usual job as franchise anchors of delivering an altogether kick ass film. While I feel like the film could have been better had they saved it for Phase 4 or 5 with plenty more franchises and characters on hand or had they introduced more franchises in this story (frankly it felt more Melee than War). I still loved the film.

Side note: FOX please give up and hand the X and Fantastic Four rights back to Marvel Studios. The XMEN continuity is a wreck and you reached strike three with the Fantastic."
"Jun 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,Fantastic. My favorite marvel movie to this date. I was very pleased with almost every element of this film.
"Jun 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Absolutely loved this movie. There was great chemistry between everyone, and the newcomers shined just as much as the leads which is a difficult feat. I also liked the big location titles. Steve and Bucky gravitated towards each other and Sam and Bucky had a banter that added years on my life. Overall, it went past my expectations."
"Jun 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,love love this movie.... ð???
"Jun 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Total blast, even some of the expected twists still packed a punch do to the brilliant story telling and incredible action sequences."
"Jun 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,Awesome movie. Definitely a must see.
"Jun 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,It is always interesting to see two super heroes going head to head. I must say that this film was one of the best.
"Jun 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,one of the best marvel movies so far
"Jun 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I'm a huge fan of the MCU, but this movie is nothing more than a ploy to introduce new characters who have upcoming films. The reveal is interesting, but the story is ludicrous and civil war ""battle"" is absolutely pointless."
"Jun 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,It was all action with no plot. Disappointed.
"Jun 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,This movie sucks balls.
"Jun 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"to Many Movies of Avengers Movies &
together , Apart What a Waste of Time!!!"
"Jun 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,Saw this three times at the cinema and each time I was not bored. Amazing film.
"Jun 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,Full of action and story character background. But not enough to wow me.
"Jun 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,One of the best Marvel superhero movies and this installment is better than the Winter Soldier. It has humor and great action and the acting is as good as it need to be. It probably is 20 minutes longer than needed but I was invested from the opening until the end. A great escape to the movies for sure.
"Jun 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"If movies were ketchup, this one would be Heinz.  Everything else would be Hunts"
"Jun 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,very good movie but most fiction cience
"Jun 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,This movie sucked plain and simple. People just jump on the bandwagon and automatically like this bullshit. It's a really bad movie
"Jun 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The first half is good. Not great, but I can pinpoint the moment it turns great. SPIDER-MAN!!! The second they introduce Spider-Man, it's like the movie remembers what made the MCU successful in the first place. Being different. In a year of darker-toned superhero movies, the welcome difference is Marvel and it's sense of humor. Once it picks that back up, the movie becomes great."
"Jun 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,Airport Scene Blow Me Away
"Jun 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"No title screen wtf! It's not called Marvel, that's what it looks like. This was just as bad as the first Avengers. The pacing in this movie is really terrible. It goes up and down throughout the movie and drags on during the dull moments way longer than needed. It has some good actions scenes but not as good as the first Avengers. The best scene happens about 30 minutes before the movie ends. Then the final battle scene is just Captain America, the Winter Soldier, and Ironman punching each other. They should have switched those and that would have made it loads better. They through in Spiderman and AntMan too just because they had the money to do so. It works out great for that one battle scene but that is all there was. It does have some comedic relief, but it wasn't as good as Age of Ultron. They throw in everyone from the Avengers except Thor and Hulk just to make it more of an Avengers movie. I would not recommend seeing this in theaters; maybe on DVD when it comes out and skip most of the slow parts."
"Jun 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,More like Captain America: Civil Pillow Fight and Shoehorned Characters that People like Just Because.
"Jun 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Chris Evans: 5 stars
Robert Downey Jr.: 5 stars
Scarlett Johansson: 5- stars
Sebastian Stan: 2+
Anthony Mackie: 4+
Don Cheadle: 3"
"Jun 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Loved this movie!  The Captain America movies are much better than the Avengers movies by far!  Ant-man was fantastic, and robert downey jr was solid as always!  Highly recommend"
"Jun 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"My favorite Marvel movie yet! This movie had a very good story. Although there were a lot of characters, they all had a role and all got some screen time. The Captain America franchise continues to get better and better. I also loved the characters they added into this movie such as Black Panther, Spider-Man and Antman. Slowly started off with Iron Man then added Thor and then Captain America. Made a couple of those then made the two Avengers movies and then Ant-Man and Deadpool and they've already announced that they're filming Deadpool 2, Black Panther and another Spider-Man movie. I love what Marvel is doing with the MCU. I hope they continue to expand and keep making awesome films!"
"Jun 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,Awsome movie something that i would see again.
"Jun 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War is overstocked with characters and drawn out action sequences. There is little in the way of plot and the ""thought provoking"" themes are left superficial and uninteresting."
"Jun 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Loved the action scenes!  Great Super Hero action!  It felt like watching a comic brought to life.  All the heroes in the movie looked great!  After some discussion with Twanna, I am on IronMan side."
"Jun 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,Already seen it multiple times. It was action packed and every minute had me on the edge of my seat!
"Jun 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Plays more like an avengers movie, but nonetheless is the rare superhero spectacle that doesn't get bogged down in its spectacle. Highly recommended"
"Jun 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,very good movie once again  Marvel comes through with another blockbuster
"Jun 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,Would get 5 starts if the villains plan made more sense and if they didn't waste crossbones character and if they also made more sense of the government wanting control over the avengers but mostly good over all
"Jun 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"What happens when u take our childhood heroes, divide them, and let them fight? Nerve wrecking, soul shattering masterpiece of cinema! Deep characters, believable conflict, great action, and amazing performances will keep you at the edge of your seats. Marvel and Russo brothers did it again. Civil war is not just adaptation of comic-book story line, its actualy logical step in developing MCU. Not all the time heroes can be united and share same vision of worlds problems, and knowing the biggest threat is yet to come, that makes it even more engaging!"
"Jun 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Really good, but I just wish they took more risks."
"Jun 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,Brilliant action and full of great cast. Conflict being centered and live up fan expectation. Even with many superheroes Russo's brother cleverly funtioning every character and fill it with bright humor.
"Jun 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I am not a big super hero fan. However, I was thoroughly impressed with this movie."
"Jun 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Eh, maybe I just don't have taste but I'm not really a fan of all of these Disney Marvel movies. They don't seem to break new ground or take chances with anything, and all their characters are less than one-dimensional. I don't really know anyone else that doesn't like them, though, so maybe I'm just weird."
"Jun 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Awesome action, good story line, great characters. Awesome movie overall."
"Jun 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"it was really good, but not the civil war comics good"
"Jun 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,This Movie Captain America: Civil War Full Movie 2016 HD Click Here to Watch = http://bit.ly/1ThMTJ1
"Jun 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Very good movie, but I find it difficult to cheer for the good guy and he is fighting another good guy."
"Jun 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,A fine addition to the Marvel series with plenty of story-driven combat that keeps the movie entertaining.
"Jun 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,Brilliant start to finish!
"Jun 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,This is Marvel's saga and they own the show.
"Jun 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Doesn't disappoint, Marvel hits another out of the park!  stay for both end credit extra scenes!"
"Jun 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It was hella lit. what else can I say? Spider gave him the buissness, and the man with the dark complexion and falcon wings... he was fire. Iron man is the man, Vison is a closet bigot, and captain america took steroids."
"Jun 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Almost perfect. Best Marvel movie since Winter Soldier. I'd correct Spidey's CGI, thta's it"
"Jun 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,no one-dimensional characters
"Jun 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Capitán América conlleva una historia un poco absurda pero vital para el universo Marvel, la distinción de todo el elenco y las escenas de acción hacen de esta película un hito para los fanáticos ensordecidos. Su esencia lo vale que es el entretenimiento y las buenas palomitas."
"Jun 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This film is easily one of the best comic book films thus far. With a great story that divides fans and fantastic introductions to characters joining the MCU, it is hard not to grade this film well. The biggest negative was once again the villain who seemed to be based highly upon convenience, which was no surprise in the MCU."
"Jun 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Wow, What an amazing...disappointment.  It was a series of letdowns and depressing solutions.  It was beautifully shot and acted.  Some parts were even fun, but you didn't feel like celebrating at the end.  It's like going through a divorce, where it's not fun to watch, or be in."
"Jun 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best one yet. Now waiting the next one
"Jun 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"If people didn't LOVE this, something is wrong with them!! THIS HAS TO BE ONE OF THE GREATEST MOVIES OF ALL TIME!! As of right now it's my FAVOURITE MOVIE OF ALL TIME! (5/5) PERFECTION, AN ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE!! DIEHARD MARVEL FAN TILL THE END OF THE LINE!! (C what I did there) Best Comic Book Movie made as of now.. Best Hollywood Movie ever made as of rn!"
"Jun 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,Watched it twice already. It's some of the most fun you'll have at the movies this summer.
"Jun 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,This is one of the best Marvel movies to date!
"Jun 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It can be slow at times, the jokes don't always hit, the conflict between Rogers & Stark doesn't quite seem like enough to carry an entire movie becoming a little repetitive at times, along with an ending that kind of undermines the whole movie. Despite those complaints, it is intense, it is funny, and it is a much more serious and dramatic Marvel movie that raises the stakes and tension much more than most movies. Probably the best Marvel movie to date."
"Jun 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,The perfect setup for Justice League
"Jun 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,A near flawless movie if they kept the same tone throughout the film
"Jun 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It's amazing to think that less than a decade ago, superhero films were completely independent of each other, the characters that featured in them never crossing paths or interacting. With the release of Iron Man, however, Marvel Studios introduced the concept of a shared universe in which all of their heroes would co-exist and eventually team up to form the world's first onscreen super team. Following solo adventures for each character, 2012's The Avengers was proof that all the studios hard work had payed off, and now with Captain America: Civil War, the formula they introduced has been fine tuned and perfected by Joe & Anthony Russo in order to produce possibly the greatest film the superhero genre has ever seen.

As much Avengers 2.5 as it is a sequel to Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Civil War brings together all the main players of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, along with a few new faces, and pits them against each other over 2 and a half hours. Dividing the team is the Sokovia Accord, a document signed by 117 of the world's nations which is intended to keep the Avengers on a tighter leash to minimise civilian casualties when the UN deems it acceptable for the team to act. It's this accord which replaces the Superhero Registration Act seen in the comic book storyline of the same name and is a great example of how Marvel uses the events of one film to heavily influence another and take full advantage of their shared universe.

On one side of the divide is Steve Rogers, his ideology as Captain America making him believe that the Avengers shouldn't serve any countries agenda, on the other is Tony Stark, still struggling with his guilt after creating Ultron. While the two heroes have had disagreements in the past, they've yet to come to blows in a literal sense, and witnessing it finally happen in Civil War is satisfying as any superhero battle could ever hope to be. In order to further muddy the waters between the two, Cap's childhood friend Bucky Barnes - last seen being mind controlled by Hydra as the Winter Soldier - has been accused of a terrorist attack in Vienna leading Iron Man and his team of pro-accord heroes to hunt down the once-Soviet weapon.

While there is an antagonist in the film in the form of Zemo - more on him later - each of the existing Avengers that are present, as well as the newcomers, are treated as both the heroes and the villains of the film, their motivations making it hard to determine exactly who is right and who is wrong. The film's marketing campaign urged fans to pick a side out of Team Cap and Team Iron Man but in reality, it's not that simple when each of them is fighting for what they believe is right. It's because of this that the confrontation between the two sides is so engaging, neither of them being guilty of fighting for the wrong cause but instead just the one they believe in, and the fact that all of their actions are completely in line with what has already been established within the characters is a testament to just how carefully Marvel treats their heroes on the big screen.

This level of care is recognisable within the small character interactions that litter the film  whether it be during a set piece, engaging in conversation, or simply a throwaway joke. The Russo brothers are able to expertly balance both action and humour and while Avengers: Age of Ultron tried too hard to make everyone a wise-cracking, ass-kicking demigod to the point that it became irritating, Civil War has much more in common with The Winter Soldier tonally. It's this tone that makes each interaction and quip feel much more natural and earned, and it's pleasantly surprising to see Robert Downey Jr play a much sterner version of Iron Man than has appeared onscreen previously which paves the way for Sam Wilson's Falcon, Paul Rudd's Ant-Man, and Tom Holland's Spider-Man to steal all of the films best lines.

Speaking of Spider-Man, both he and Black Panther prove to be exciting additions to the MCU and fit right into the pre-existing universe. Tom Holland plays Peter Parker and Spider-Man as equal parts goofy and brainy, expressing his interest in each of the heroes costumes and weapons as he dukes it out with them, while Chadwick Boseman is excellent as Black Panther, exhibiting composure and ferocity as he hunts Bucky in order to carry out his vengeance. The Russo's ability to juggle new characters amongst the old is extremely impressive and both of the new additions are used wisely within the film's narrative, their abilities and personalities shining through enough to understand who they are as individuals, yet not so much that it takes away from the excitement of seeing their solo films in the coming years.

If the thought of more superhero films doesn't make you experience euphoria, however, the airport battle that features within Civil War almost certainly will. This may not just be the standout scene of the film but also the greatest sequence ever featured in the superhero genre, each of the characters being given a chance to showcase their own unique fighting style. The Russo's proved that they could handle action scenes with ease in The Winter Soldier but this is unlike anything else seen in a superhero before, an all out brawl which pits the Avengers against one another and all of it being captured perfectly by the directors. The interactions between the characters continue to entertain throughout this scene, particularly Spider-Man's amazement at standing alongside and against his heroes, while the wall crawler and Ant-Man manage to steal the best parts of the battle as it escalates towards a climax of gigantic proportions.

When they're done fighting each other though, the heroes turn their attention to the film's primary antagonist who's been hiding in the shadows orchestrating the events playing out onscreen. This antagonist is none other than Daniel Brühl who is excellent as Helmut Zemo, a Sokovian citizen stricken by grief after a tragedy that is all to relevant to the film's plot. It's because of this tragedy that their is a hint of sympathy to be felt for Zemo but make no mistake, his plan is nefarious as it is meticulous, the endgame being completely logical unlike Lex Luthor's in the recent Batman v Superman, and the character proves to be one of the best villains that the MCU has delivered so far.

Amongst all of these thrilling aspects, however, there are minor flaws to be found. Despite all of the characters featured, at the heart of the film is a story about Captain America and Bucky and the lengths the former will go to in order to protect the latter. It's because of this that the film exists under the Captain America title but it's a shame to say that the titular hero doesn't receive any standout moments. Chris Evans is on fine form as Cap once again, yet it's the films new characters that linger in the memory after the credits (and the two post-credits scenes) have finished rolling. 

Similarly, some of the films smaller characters feel like wasted potential. While all of the central characters are well developed and extremely close to their comic book counterparts, Agent 13 and Crossbones are given very small roles when each of them could have occupied an interesting space within the MCU, Agent 13 as a modern day Peggy Carter and Crossbones a recurring villain. Unfortunately, they turn out to be nothing but bit-parts in a film that is too big to properly justify their inclusion, but with so many characters present, it was inevitable that some would feature less than others.

It's also a shame that despite the film being a lot more violent than any of the previous MCU films, it still feels very safe. Beneath the intense action sequences, this is still very much a film aimed at all age groups in hopes of making $1billiom at the box office, and Marvel still have a plan which they have to stick to in order to properly tell the story they wish to tell. While this doesn't make the film any less thrilling, it does lessen its impact slightly knowing that the characters will return in just a few short years, however satisfying that thought may be.

Captain America: Civil War is the best entry in the MCU to date and possibly the best superhero film to ever grace the silver screen. Both the characters interactions and the set pieces are handled masterfully by the Russo brothers who now find themselves in the directors chair(s) for Avengers: Infinity War. If it's even half as good as this, bring it on."
"Jun 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,One of the worst films I've ever seen.  Only the 2nd movie in 15 years I've walked out on.  Very overrated.
"Jun 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Yeah, sticks to comics fairly well.  Great intro to more marvel characters."
"Jun 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I was almost about to sleep 3 times during the screening.  No engaging story, boring fight scenes and not-so-funny funny parts..Disappointed would be the word on this one."
"Jun 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,A very confusing plot
"Jun 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,excellent story and featuring many storylines.
"Jun 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,A great flick. +Spiderman!!!
"Jun 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,Amazing feet of cinematic entertainment.
"Jun 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best of the Marvel movies so far Captain America: Civil War explores some very human themes in the context of current political issues.  How many of us would choose a friend in the face of overwhelming pressure to conform?
"Jun 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,More laughs than our 1861 civil war.
"Jun 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,One of my favorite marvel movies so far. Amazing addition to the brilliant franchise.
"Jun 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,amazing film with astounding cinematography! I hated the character of vision but other than that this film is flawless
"Jun 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Spider-Man was the shining point in this serviceable, yet disappointing film. Bogged down by a lengthy introduction, when the hits come hard, they ultimately come a tad too late for the viewer."
"Jun 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"loud and corny.  Too bad Scarlet Johanson has forgotten her great acting skills from ""We bought a zoo."""
"Jun 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Spoiler warning

To put it blunt, nothing happens. The only major thing that happens is Captain America losing his shield and that's it. It makes me wonder why you would need to see the movie for the over all series. Rhodes becomes partly paralysed but that's fixed by the end of the movie. What was good was the three new characters, Ant Man, Spider Man and Black Panther, though they were more cameos for future movies. The action was more show than meaning, in fact the main fight really did not make sense and seemed forced. What adds to the lack of purpose in the movie is how the Winter Soldier is lazily written off by being frozen again, which also did not make sense.  Over all I think Marvel had a good run on Phase One, OK on Phase Two and now slowly becoming boring."
"Jun 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,I give this an A+/96.
"Jun 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,Overated movie..after the story line I'm not a Captain America fan anymore...this it's what marvel came up with as the plot for the movie it's important but not for a whole movie..and villain is the worst i have seen nothing special
"Jun 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This new avengers' movie (w8...it's cpt America's? Really?) sucked pretty hard. *Despite the good acting*, the plot is insignificant. It has nothing to do with the civil war from comics...it looked like dodge ball gone wrong. If they had settle this down at hawk eye's place (without having to destroy an airport or bothering anyone else) would have probably been better.
The first part is so boring I would have killed myself. Becomes ""interesting"" in the second part, with the fights. Aunt May is almost younger than peter (WTF?!)."
"Jun 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,An epic addition to the prestigious marvel cinematic universe.
"Jun 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Tony Start is a different character. I like the Iron Man from the 1st , 2nd movie and the Avengers."
"Jun 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Amazing movie, really liked the humour."
"Jun 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,Captain America Civil War was great. Amazing acting by everyone (Especially Spidey and Ant-Man) and it was one of those movies where they thought about the plot and the script to make it look 'smart' in a way.
"Jun 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I came in the theatre with very low expectations for this movie following age of ultron and winter soldier ( I know I must be the only one who didn't liked it !) 
Civil war was exactly what I never expected to see in such a movie : a deep plot with real concerns that is attached to a brillant humor reuniting a huge cast yet letting every caracter has his / her space in the movie . Nowhere does that movie feels rushed. It has the best twist ending I saw in a long time that even I has a comic book fan didn't saw coming and it introduce new caracter very well .

Overall a must see movie and probably the top of the summer so far."
"Jun 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,The best movie of 2016.
"Jun 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Brilliant movie with accomplice story ark for all of the characters, while the bigining might be slow the air port sceane really makes up for it. Action is amazing while focusing in on every single chacter to the best amount of time so that it doesn't feel to crowded. Over all I highly recommend this movie as it is an awesome summer block buster"
"Jun 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,The best marvel movie yet.
"Jun 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,Captain America seemed to be the villain in his own movie when he wanted to protect Winter Soldier. Not much of a civil war in the movie I say. Zemo plot  was extremely dumb and a waste of time. Only things good about this movie was all the superhero's together and the 1st appearance of Black Panther and Spider-Man in the MCU.
"Jun 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,AWESOME THE BEST ONE OF ALL THE DC AVENGERS FRANCHISE
"Jun 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,One of the best movies Marvel has made.
"Jun 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I really loved how Nemo was orchestrating everything- and his emotional beat in the end - The airport sequence is blockbuster fan boy joy. Really loved it, just didn't bring something new and stay with me as hard as Winter Solider hit."
"Jun 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,Very well done! My favorite movie of the year so far.
"Jun 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,A thought-provocative yet action-packed romp into the Marvel Universe.
"Jun 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I'm gonna keep this nice and short. Loved the movie! While some may argue it was lacking in some areas, it's still worth the watch. It's packed full of humor you would expect from the lovable comic book characters, while still having the awesome action that you would expect from marvel. Overall rating: 4/5"
"Jun 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,It was very good however the plot was kind of all over the place and I thought the casting was excellent!!!
"Jun 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,Sucked. Plain and simple. Thrown together and  wish I saved my time.
"Jun 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Freaking awesome movie, disappointed by the ending."
"Jun 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,They topped Winter Soldier! This was the best installment in the MCU yet!  Can't wait to see what happens next!
"Jun 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,No hay ganador porque el máximo ganador es la audiencia
"Jun 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Im vary bitter sweet about Civil war. Black Panther was awesome suit, actor and all. Tony's heart crushing mind set makes me want to hug him and make him a hot glass of tea through out  the movie. The new spiderman shows great potential and I hope to see him again. The effects were spectacular as always the plot over all left me heartbroken.My biggest problem is that it is a well done movie over all and for the people who've seen nothing but the movies theres is little to not like about. But for the hard core fans or  just those that have read the comic books. Captain America Civil War shows just a small fraction from its comic book origin and as one of those hard core fans it hurts deeply. and the ending made me want to just stare and a blank wall for a few hours feeling the pain for the Iron Avenger. I hope the next Avengers movie will help me change this  sweet and bitter taste in my mouth."
"Jun 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America is back! And with him he brought a lot of new friends. This captain America movie features almost all of the players from the avengers plus Spiderman, black panther, and a nice extended cameo from antman. Great action scenes, great story, I was entertained from start to finish. Plus if you've watched and remember the other Marvel films ,you'll catch a lot of the witty dialogue.  It's one of the better superhero movies I've seen in a while and a massive improvement over the disappointing Batman versus Superman."
"Jun 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,it's boring as hell not comic book related and just Boring
"Jun 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,My new third favorite Marvel movie behind Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy.  Fun characters and script with a focus on a personal story to both Cap and Tony.  The airport scene is also probably the most amazing thing I've ever witnessed in a theater.
"Jun 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I didn't know who to root for. Great action and actors as always, just left me a little conflicted."
"Jun 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,Civil war was very uninteresting film the plot was hard to follow. The plot also felt shoehorned in. The movie has the word war in its it title and no one even got really hurt besides war machine.Overall I give Civil war a C-
"Jun 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,Probably going to end up being the best comic book movie of the year.
"Jun 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I loved this movie, maybe not as much as everyone else, but still loved it! I love when these characters interact with each other, the introduction to new characters, the action scenes are great, and that fight scene at the airport was great! I look forward to the spin off movies and more avengers!!"
"Jun 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Amazing movie. It doesn't go along perfectly with the actual 2006 comic book story line but it came very close. This is one the whole family can see. Disney is doing a great job with their Marvel Cinematic Universe. I keep wondering ""when are the comic movies going to slow down?"". If this movie answers that question at all it's going to be awhile. It definately had the best fight scene out of all MCU movies if not all comic adaptations together at the airport. Black Panther and Winter Soldier brought the action(especially hand-to-hand combat) to another level in this entry. Alot of critic's say it's another Avenger's movie, and while there's nothing wrong with that, it's still a Captain America movie when it comes down to it. Maybe Cap on steroids compared to the previous 2 entries but still a Captain America movie non the less. It definately makes me excited to see a Blank Panther stand alone and totally turns my stance in another new Spider-Man movie around. Him and Ant-Man provided the right amount of comedy when needed. There's just nothing bad I can say about this movie. You leave the theater wanting more without feeling like you missed something. Looking forward to the next MCU entry in Doctor Strange this Fall."
"Jun 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Personally, i believe this is the best Marvel movie to date. The villain's plan is not to destroy the earth or kill the Avengers. His plan is to tear the Avengers apart. Apparently he succeeds. This movie does have a lot of action, but not as much cgi as Avengers Age of Ultron. The Russo brothers know their comic books and know how to entertain the comic book fans. Definitely check this movie out."
"Jun 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It's a masterpiece! 
Action packed, with a ton of nerdgasm and thought provoking themes to the point you wont bother enquiring about it's runtime. It's not just a better avengers movie than the last avengers movie but also the best ending to the MCU's greatest trilogy.  Alongside amazing action sequences and opposing ideologies it manages to retain the humour we've come to expect while seamlessly introducing the regal black panther and arguably the best spidey yet.  Cemented with action scenes that have purpose and a villain with true motivation despite his brief role, Marvel once again achieves coherence with multiple characters. It's great to see Tony Stark's backstory fleshed out in a devastating way while the Cap storyline comes full circle. With it's refreshing and fitting tone alongside its breathtaking action, Captain America Civil War kicks off phase 3 in a monumental way and will be remembered as one of the greatest superhero movie of all time."
"Jun 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This movie is fantastic.  It's as thought provoking as the Dark Knight, and as fun as the original Avengers.  I regret is that I can't give it 6 stars."
"Jun 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,fucking loved it ding ding ding ding
"Jun 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"i think this is the best one that mcu has ever made, the story plot is good and joe and anthony russo did a good job, they make it fun but, the cgi of the film is a bit bad"
"Jun 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,I didn't enjoy this captain America film as much but I do like the other movie winter soldier a little better. But extremely exciting definitely a summer film to go see.
"Jun 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,awesome. action packed from start to finish.
"Jun 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,The story is about how Captain America saved his old love at all costs and broke up with Iron Man. And finally he proved that he's the one who always make things right.
"Jun 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,while not quite as good as Winter Soldier another great movie by disney/marvel. well done making it where it was hard to choose one side
"Jun 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I think it was really hard make a movie with many characters, but, well done Marvel"
"Jun 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"God I love marvel, I think this is the best yet! I love they add Spider-Man, but not forget about ant-man, adding his character is to the story line makes the movie even more fun to watch, he plays his character perfect and always gives you a laugh! Cant wait till the next marvel film or tv show!"
"Jun 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Decent story with some of the worst CGI I have ever seen in a mega-budget super hero film. I was taken out of the movie several times by the effects. However, the filmmakers made it easy to be torn between the two opposing sides, which given the plot is no easy task."
"Jun 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War is a definitive end to the Captain America trilogy with spectacular fight sequences, character development, and the introduction to two great marvel characters being Black Panther and Spider-Man. The flow from the Winter Soldier also directed by the Russo Brother's was done flawlessly with only minor continuity issues which also meant people who have not seen the second film could watch it with very little questions of the story line. The movie was perceived to be more of an Avengers style movie but as Anthony Mackie quite rightly said ""It really plays well with the storyline of Cap, and how he's evolved into his own man, him doing his own thing, everybody coming together to fight for the common good of man."" There were five main character standouts to myself in this film and they were Iron Man/Tony Stark, Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff, Black Panther/T'Challa, Ant-Man/Scott Lang and by far the best adaptation of Spider-Man/Peter Parker. Tom Holland is everything a comic book fan would have been waiting for in Spider-Man and for all those with fatigue with the character trust me he will not disappoint or give reason to continue that fatigue. Black Panther's introduction was probably the best, as his character is almost seamlessly put into play with the Avengers and creates an interesting dynamic going forward for the Infinity War films. In this film, there is the best comic book movie fight sequence that has ever been seen and will leave you wanting more. There is an incredible amount of spectacular visuals and great dialogue along with the political and humorous nature of this film works incredibly well and does not distract the audience from the plot or action. In conclusion, a greatly executed film with engaging dialogue with humour sure to have the whole family in laughter and realise that choosing your side was actually the hardest part to decide. Score: 8/10"
"Jun 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The film is just more of the same stuff Marvel has been producing since Iron Man in 2008. Don't get me wrong, the movie is good, but it isn't exceptional. It doesn't feel as strong as most of Marvel's earlier films, but is nonetheless enjoyable albeit a bit stale."
"Jun 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,"went in to see this movie with my girlfriend, she is a big United States conflict buff...was extremely disappointing. None of it seemed to take place During the Civil War. Every part of it was historically inaccurate. If they are making a movie called Captain America: Civil War...maybe make sure that it is blatantly obvious that it is in fact not about the great war that took many peoples lives. A horrible spit in the face on a historical conflict...it is not given the attention and care necessary, for either side of the war."
"Jun 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,Loved this movie. It did a great job at putting all the characters together. It was very good at having balance betwen dark and humor. It was fun and spiderman stole the show. I have been waiting for this spiderman. He is perfect. Black panther stole the show too. They also did a great job at buliding the new avengers vision and scarlet witch. Go see it over ninja turtles.
"Jun 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Probably as good as a marvel movie can get. Russo Brothers, you've done it again."
"Jun 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,Very good but character development suffers a bit from # of characters.
"Jun 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This movie made me sleepy.  They fight each other and then they get back together without the Captain.  Who will later join the team again.  He is suppose to die and come back to life or wake from whatever sleep he is in and the rejoin team.  Doesn't matter he joins the team again.  Their version of story is horrible.  Comic series is boring but better than the movie.  I forgot all about Baron Zemo.

Their marketing for the film was great.  The movie itself is really disappointing"
"Jun 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,"'Civil War' is an absolutely fantastic addition to the MCU. It is based on the very good comic book story arc by Mark Millar. Whilst not as big of a scale as it's source material it delves deeper into the characters and gives us a more personal adventure. This film enhances my trust in the Russo Brothers taking over Infinity War. Like 'The Winter Soldier', this film brings the psycological thriller genre to the MCU, keeping it fresh. The registration act is put in place due to the small trust the government have in these super beings. These questions make sense. Can we trust this power? Who's responsible for the damage? Should power like this be monitored? The heroes collide in one of the most mezmerizing battle scenes ever put to screen. The Russos do brilliant at creating creative action scenes of awe. However, shaky cam was a minor problem near the start of the movie. The action does a splendid job of managing to create a cool battle whilst providing humour and fleshing out characters, this done with some brilliant dialogue. Everyone in this movie has clear motivations, the psychology of Cap and Iron Man make sense. We also find ourselves introduced to two new characters. Black Panther is thrown into the story in a way that felt natural and not at all shoehorned. His vendetta against Bucky was a great way to blend him into the story, casting Chadwick Boseman was a fantastic choice. The movie even manages to develop T'Challa. Spider-man was portrayed almost perfectly by Tom Holland. This Parker is younger and inexperienced, this creates funny interactions between him and other characters. Holland looks the part and plays Peter and Spidey just like he is portrayed in the comics.  The movie is certainly a big step for the MCU. The ending left me unsure at first but upon reflection I realised the potential it leaves for future movies. Characters and relationships are developed well, especially Black Widow and Black Panther. The pacing of this film is even and exposition doesn't slow it down. The cgi in some scenes do feel a little to polished and animated, this doesn't affect the movie experience. This movie had so much to carry and sees to hold it all with ease. This film introduces Spidey,  T'Challa, brings in Ant-Man (who was awesome), sets up the registration act, develops the characters and gives us more insight on them, creates a relationship with Steve and Sharon, brings Bucky into the picture and shows us his and Cap's friendship, gives us more than a few awesome fight scenes and creates a satisfying conclusion all in the runtime of 2 hours 20 minutes. That's really impressive, the Russo have proved once again how masterfully they are are their job. Marvel supplied us with the greatest Marvel movie yet."
"Jun 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Very fun, a great Spiderman, all around a good job with this movie, Marvel. Keep it up."
"Jun 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,"In my opinion the best Marvel flick. Now Marvels:The Avengers was a success because it was the first flick to involve multiple comic book heroes. This one may not be the perfect adaptation of a comic book but the title Civil War is justified. But you can for the first time since the Dark Knight trilogy compare this to a real life situation (just the idea not the gimmicks). Of course being titled Captain America the movie is more sympathetic to Caps view, infinity war may see others aspects too. They could have involved Maria Hill and Nick Fury somehow (but they were probably trying not to make the flick bloated, thats where it has succeeded over DCs Dawn of Justice and of course much better characterization and acting. Top Marks, atomic complaints with the plot at the most. I would give it 95%."
"Jun 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,loving all them varvelers....!!!
"Jun 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,This IS the second Avengers movie people were hoping Age of Ultron would've been. And for the Bucky Barnes lovers it's Part 3 in his saga which we're excited to hear will go on in Infinity Wars.
"Jun 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,"not really a Captain America movie... more like Avengers 2.5, which isn't a problem. however, though I enjoyed it, I wasn't overly impressed with it. Spider-Man was hands down the best part of the movie!"
"Jun 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,Not for me. I really wanted to leave the movie theatre and don't understand the 90% on Rotten Tomatoes! The beginning (first third or half) was ok.
"May 28, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War?  More like Avengers 2.5!!!  Right from the beginning, we get the amazing action we love about superhero films but also the intelligent realism when it comes to the consequences of said actions.  With amazing debuts of new characters, awesome battles beyond imagination, and some bits of fun along the way, and we get a film that shows how strong the Marvel movie franchise is and that it's success will not be ending anytime soon.  And that we can expect greater things from upcoming Marvel films.  I was worried about the larger number of characters in this film much as I saw did not work for Spiderman 3, Amazing Spiderman 2, or Batman Vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice but as shown in The Avengers, Avengers: Age of Ultron, and the better X-Men films, this film's writers and directors demonstrate they know how to handle it.  An awesome day at the movies."
"May 28, 2016",NEUTRAL,Very good movie. Cool drama between the good guys ! The fight scenes were a little too herky jerky for me but very entertaining . Definate must see .
"May 28, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best Marvel movie to date.
"May 28, 2016",NEUTRAL,Poor direction. Too much for one movie!
"May 28, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Didn't wanna watch it, turned out great"
"May 28, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Very good, loved the teams!!"
"May 28, 2016",NEUTRAL,best Captain America yet... a must see
"May 28, 2016",NEUTRAL,One of the best team up movies since the first avengers film.  Not as good as winter soldier but certainly worth a watch for the scenes with ant-man and spiderman
"May 28, 2016",NEUTRAL,One of the best so far!
"May 28, 2016",NEUTRAL,Marvel's best film so far. Had me watching it two times!
"May 28, 2016",NEUTRAL,"While it does not reach the heights of Winter Soldier, Civil War is still impressive on its own and is thankfully one of those rare good third movies. It promises that the audience will get to see two of the most famous superheroes of all time battle it out, and certainly delivers on that to the full. What I loved so much was how focused the story was; Civil War could have easily tried so hard to foreshadow what is to come in Phase 3, but instead it simply sticks to Captain America & friends vs. Iron Man & friends, right up to the end. The hallmarks of what make Marvel so respected-the fun action, the witty one-liners, and the distinctive memorable personalities-are all there, which is enough to give casuals a recommendation. And plus, I have to give props to Black Panther and Spider-Man as the noobs; BP has a journey of his own that can be best described when seen, and Spider-Man was like Quicksilver in X-Men: Days of Future Past-he doesn't stick around for that long, he has only one job, but boy, does the guy make the best of what he's got (seriously, though-Tom Holland was really funny in the role). The only major gripes I really have with this are that Baron Zemo wasn't that well-developed as a villain (thankfully, he's not part of the central focus), and Ant-Man could've been utilized a bit better (though Giant Man was really cool to watch).

One theme I noticed in the movie was how actions always have consequences, and that rings true in this film-every event in the movie has a consequence that is shown onscreen (even if it is just a new report on a TV screen), thus giving the full emotional impact necessary to care about the film's grave subject matter. Ambitious to its core, the film dares to make the audience think about which side they are on. One major highlight in the movie was when the Avengers are arguing over the nature of the Sokovia Accords, and many of them state excellent points that are later reflected as the story plays out (Is the right to intervene in grave matters a privilege, or a right? How far does the regulation of superheroes' actions go until it gets out of hand?). And right up to the end, Civil War leaves it up to the audience to decide for themselves what they think; it doesn't choose a side, but just presents the situation as it is.

Final verdict: Is Captain America: Civil War a good movie? FUCK YEAH!!!"
"May 28, 2016",NEUTRAL,Cookie cutter Marvel fare.  Way too much time spent on side characters which I don't care about.
"May 28, 2016",NEUTRAL,Good action as always.. No progression on any story....
"May 28, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The movie Captain America Civil war did not like it at all, honestly expected more from this production of the Russo brothers, is achieved not aprecciar darkness and realism that promised to confirm the movie, the end has this slogan came out really avenger''Ningún injured or killed in the filming of this movie'' now my faith in crumbles marvel to see unhappy as you consider it as one of the best"
"May 28, 2016",NEUTRAL,Very exciting and fun to watch :)
"May 28, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Basically the third Avengers movie, I mean, who dislike the Avengers? They are always the best."
"May 28, 2016",NEUTRAL,Not crazy about the direction they took with this story line.
"May 28, 2016",NEUTRAL,Really good movie. Plot was a little ridiculous and wish they had gone in another direction. Def. need to see it and buy it on Blu-Ray.
"May 28, 2016",NEUTRAL,A story about friends in an ideological war.
"May 28, 2016",NEUTRAL,same store nothings new
"May 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,To much shaky camera and not enough plot. Think I need a break from x-men movies for a while.
"May 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,I think they let the interns do the CGI parts. Poorly done & too dragged out. I give it a 45%.
"May 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,"""Capitán América: Civil War"" es una de las mejores películas de super héroes de todos los tiempos y la mejor de Marvel Studios hasta la fecha.
La historia sigue los eventos tras ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"", y tras todo el daño colateral causado por sus misones las Naciones Unidas deciden intervenir a los héroes solicitando su registro como agentes para regular sus acciones y prevenir catástrofes. Teniendo el grupo respuestas mixtas se ven obligados a tomar caminos separados, situación que se comprometida cuando el objetivo del grupo pro registro es ir a por el Winter Soldier.
La película esta muy bien balanceada en cuanto a acción y drama, cada diálogo sirve para entender mejor la perspectiva de cada bando, dejando en claro que ambos están ciertos y equivocados.
Civil War es una excelente plataforma para introducir a Black Panther y Spider-Man al Universo Cinematográfico de Marvel, a ambos se les da la atención necesaria y se permite ver cuan asombrosos son durante los enfrentamientos. Baron Zemo también es presentado pero de un modo que no a todos les va a gustar, en mi caso creo que Daniel Brühl cumplie maravillosamente con su rol como villano.
La tercer entrega de Captain America es totalmente recomendable, la historia esta bien orquestada, ninguna situación se siente forzada y las escenas de acción son memorables."
"May 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,"One of the best super hero movies, but was a little confusing."
"May 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This was an AWESOME movie!!!  Not quite as good as The Avengers but on par with Avengers: Age of Ultron. If you're even just a casual Avengers fan you HAVE to see this movie even if it's just to see Spidey in a Marvel movie for the first time (by the way, he's more than just a cameo and is really funny) :)."
"May 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,love it good action and comedy
"May 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,"A satisfying conclusion to the Captain America trilogy, and felt like the much needed Avengers (2012) sequel we all needed. With hard-hitting emotional arcs it definitely pulls on the heart strings whilst still keeping the marvel comedy in balance."
"May 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,"With a year full of superhero movies packed to the brim with characters, this movie manages to balance them all with tact. While I feel like Ant-Man's presence, while always remarkably entertaining was a bit cut short and awkward, I feel like the balance of characters was good. Finally Marvel deals with the consequences of the actions in the Universe so far, and the ending was satisfying without wrapping up the conflict in a neat bow, because that would never happen. I'm excited to see the newer characters develop further along the road, as well as see how this movie effects the older founding characters"
"May 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,spidey and ant-man were the highlight. The rest was formula driven fare. No real emotional beats to this movie. Pretty super-ficial :)
"May 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,Captain America: Civil War is everything I dreamed of when I was younger. My favorite super heroes battling each other. That was something only my action figures could achieve. I finally saw it on the big screen and I was in awe the whole time. My only complaint is that Iron Patriot isn't compelling and he never will be. It was just kind of dull when he was around and I wasn't ever attached.
"May 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,"There is not much left that can be said about this movie, the performances are amazing, the cast is fantastic, the action is by far some of the best, that air port scene is a master piece. This has arguably the best on screen spider-man, and the villain, though not as menacing as others, is more thought provoking and interesting compared to some from past movies. Not better than Winter Solider but still up there at the top of Marvel Movies, The Russo Brothers have shown again how amazing they can be, and make you look forward to the next avengers that much more."
"May 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,The first movie I've been compelled to actually see in a theater in many years. A fantastic sequel to Winter Soldier and could almost be called Avengers 3. A good mix of action and humor. The plot is something meaningful to me and I was Team Cap. all the way. I'm actually considering going to see it again.
"May 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,Well civil war was a great film. Best film of 2016 so far. Definitely the best in the mcu. I support team cap. I love the action sequences and the new characters especially spiderman. Best scene is the airport scene. Can't wait to see the next wave of mcu films.
"May 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best Marvel movie to date!
"May 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Finally, a marvel movie which is both smart and action packed as well as having a great sense of humour in between the serious action sequences. First off, the stunts, too many movies these days rely so much on CGI fight scenes along with long ranged weapons. Not in this movie, so much of this movie felt as if they were done on set with actual stunts, its scary how much fighting skill the characters show and it honestly felt like something out of a game which is more than what other movies can say. 

The characters motivations were so clear and you can't hep but pick a side at the beginning of the movie but see yourself shifting your stance throughout the movie. This is further emphasised by the fact that the characters had to deal with the really real consequences of people actually dying. It seams that it's about time that our heroes finally faced the music and look at what happens when they're left unchecked. Even the villain felt real and he became what he is as a direct product of the heroes actions. The relationships between the characters feels like its being tested more than ever and it's interesting to see what they're willing to do when it comes down to it. 

Let me be the first one to say this, but please let there be a blackwiddow standalone movie already. I its feels like she's been in the shadows long enough and even though she was in this movie I almost forgot about her at the end of it. But I would say that this movie has one thing going for it, it made me feel invested and interested in quite a few characters and let me tell you that if any movie about them comes out which I'm pretty sure it will, I can't say that I wouldn't want to watch just out of curiosity. 

This movie is a great departure from the greater than life action sequences that isn't always matched with a good storyline. A marvel movie which I can definitively say is both fun to watch and think about even after I've left the theatres."
"May 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,I love the movie I have seen it in theaters butbi want to see it again
"May 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Amazing! Couldn't say enough about the film,
One word, Spider-Man! (*Two words)"
"May 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,Don't confuse this with Superman vs Batman. Its a lot better. Not just endless fights. Lots of great super heroes and fine special effects with some good story. This really builds on the previous Captain America movies and has some good Iron Man thrown in too!
"May 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,16th of december 1991
"May 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It was ok. Kinda feel like I've seen all these Marvel characters so much, it wasn't really anything new."
"May 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Absolutely fantastic movie except that it's in no way Cap 3. It's either Iron Man 4 or Avengers 2.5, I can't decide. Go in understanding that, and you'll love it."
"May 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,"First things first! The movie was way beyond extraordinary, especially the fighting scenes. It was more than what I was expected! we could get every element in this like hilarious moments, serious, darker, intense moments and I really didn't except much serious and darker part in the climax. It was great about Winter Soldier and made it better, furthering the story. This is yet another addition to the Marvel franchise, and it's an entertaining story. Spider Man, Black Panther and Ant man they really stole the show in the airport Scene. The film is one of the best of MCU almost on par with Avengers, Winter soldier, Ironman and Guardians of the Galaxy. 
Trust me guys! You Will enjoy this."
"May 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It hits all the notes. It does everything I expected, yet also sneaks in a few surprises, lighthearted moments, and a perfect reference to another revered movie."
"May 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This movie was so amazing! Great fight scenes, funny humour, excellent character involvement. Everyone must watch this movie because if how amazing it is."
"May 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Its a fun, funny, superhero film worth seeing on the big screen. The villain and ending was a let down for me."
"May 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,DBox + 3d =  amazing
"May 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It was very well Done. Some of the cast decisions were a bit disappointing seeing how Marvel always Linked it's movies. You'l know what I'm talking about once you watch it. Over all It was great plot, On your edge, and thrilling story also the Decisions they made to reunite the Heroes."
"May 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,Wasn't much of a Civil War.
"May 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Loved it. They made Spider-Man a little wimpy, but overall, liked the movie! Looking forward to the others."
"May 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,"If you stripped away the powers, this movie would still be amazing!"
"May 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,great movie thought the villain should have been different. ..
"May 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I loved it. I had low expectations for this film, as I haven't been a big captain America movie fan (though I love avengers). This movie was a lot better than I anticipated. It seemed more like an Avengers movie minus Hulk and Thor. Great action, intriguing storyline and I was fully committed when I realized Spideman was in it (by the way, why are there 900 different people playing spiderman?). Overall, a great film and a must-see if you love Marvel like I do"
"May 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,Better than I thought
"May 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,Over rated nonsense. seriously 90% rating is a joke. X-men got a 52% and is in a completely different league. Tomatometer cannot be trusted.
"May 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Fights are amazing, It feels like really big WWE match (or a MOBA game)."
"May 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,Amazing. Marvel hits another home run.
"May 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,"A dumb plot fueled by the inconsistent stupidity of all the flat characters involved, some of whom are extremely forced in."
"May 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,Another home run for Marvel.  Very well done.  Just sad seeing Cap and Ironman fight.   Whether seeing it in 3D or 2D it is a must see.
"May 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,Not a whole lot of anything new more Marvel nonsense
"May 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War once again follows the tone of what Winter Soldier had and if it isn't broke don't fix it. Captain America: Civil War gives us an engaging story to follow and the Russo brothers prove once again how much of an investing yet kick ass character Captain America can be, but not only do they do that with just Captain America but also with every other hero and character. Stark is the best he's been since the first Iron-Man and the new characters like Black Panther and Spider-Man feel organic to the plot because of the wonderful script. Civil War is an emotional thrill ride with a lot of fun action sequences and emotional character moments showing the MCU at it's best."
"May 23, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Dark and violent, just not my cup of tea."
"May 23, 2016",NEUTRAL,"As it comes to the comics the premise of civil war has been changed to fit the universe. To make it fit with our modern heros today, adding only 6 heros on each side of tony stark and steve rogers. The 2 heros clash when a registration act called the soviet accords demands the heros to be put on the govt leash. While a good idea to tony steve refuses to sign these accords just like the comics. while that stays the same the rest of the film  goes into its own story to completely make this a captain america sequel and does this work yes it does. civil war proves that the russo brothers, who will be taking the reigns of the anticipated infinty war, have what it takes to put a dozen super heros in 1 film and make them all relevent and give them all time to shine. while the story is basic there are other layers that surprised me that give these emotional characters a driven part and reason for their action. this film also introduces 2 new heros on top of that and make them 2 of the best parts of the movie. I'd say civil war is  absolutely  one of the best marvel movies with one of the best action sequences of all time. but the fact that it had a strong story as well to keep it together is just mind blowing ."
"May 23, 2016",NEUTRAL,"With all the personalities, Civil War, truly plays out like a third Avengers movie, besting Age of Ultron (2015) for emotional depth, but lacking the breezy joy of The Avengers (2012). The story is at its best in quieter moments when it focuses on the personality of the individual. The narrative gives clear, understandable reasons as to why each superhero aligns with the side that they do. Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr deserve major kudos for anchoring the production with sincere performances that captivate our attention. That's not easy to do with a cast of this magnitude. In a film full of many highs, I did not expect Ant-Man & Spider-Man to be at the very top.  Both have amusing vignettes that make the promise of 2017's Spider-Man: Homecoming and 2018's Ant-Man and the Wasp something I am now willing to embrace rather than dread. Additionally the heavy emotional burden that Bucky Barnes carries as the Winter Soldier is emphasized. His relationship with Steve Rogers, his buddy since childhood, is affirmed as well. These cast members stand out in a roster that is uniformly excellent. I could cite more characters and the traits that make them interesting but that would spoil the fun of discovery. It's their complex backstories that help secure our interest in the personal dynamics of these people. They give the heroes depth. That is what makes Captain America: Civil War so gosh darn entertaining.

"May 23, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I really don't understand how anyone can like this movie better than previous MCU films.  Black Panther is boring and pointless to the story (especially since his wife is not allowed in the MCU due to licensing).  Zemo is poorly portrayed and simply terrible and the premise is dry.  As a comic book fan I am getting really tired of the MCU taking fantastic comic book arcs and using them to market their films then destroying what made those comic books so great.  This should really be called ""Captain America: Adventures in Buckysitting.""  Wait for the Blu Ray if you have not seen it yet."
"May 23, 2016",NEUTRAL,Fantastic installment from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Evans & Downey shine!
"May 23, 2016",NEUTRAL,I did not think I'd enjoy this one as much as I had
"May 23, 2016",NEUTRAL,Great fun. The reintroduction of Spider-man was a highlight. Highly recommended.
"May 23, 2016",NEUTRAL,I love the marvels this was to me a great movie with mind swings. Tony has manicured up in this movie and showed a lot more sincerity. only part I seen in the movie that I would have left out was Spider-Man. Spider-Man to me was a waste of time. He looks like a cartoon in the movie.
"May 23, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best superhero movie ever

"May 23, 2016",NEUTRAL,"it had fun moments. Tho mostly felt rushed. It's like a re-titles Avengers.
The acting is fine, FX fine, the only problem is it was kinda rushed... like Batman v Superman... spiderman is only in the movie for 1 fight scene that lasts 5-10m."

"May 22, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I have watched this movie 3 times in the theatre and still couldnt get enough of it. Such a brilliantly crafted script where each character gets his/her moment to shine and yet it distinctively feels like a Captain America movie. Its serious when it is supposed to be serious, its funny when it supposed to be funny - i went through so many human emotions while watching this movie, even i cant describe. Its so good.
Performance - TOP NOTCH by everyone especially RDJ & CHRIS EVANS. 
Story - Brilliant
Action - There is nothing like this ever put together in a movie screen before. Its just phenomenal.
Scene stealer - BLACK PANTHER, SPIDER-MAN & ANT MAN.... #Perfection"

"May 22, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Great movie. Mervel has done it again. They introduced Black Panther perfectly and had great setups at the end for Spiderman: Homecoming and Black Panther. It had everythong you could want out of a superhero movie. Action, drama, and much, much more. A must see movie this summer."
"May 22, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Some of the best action set pieces of the past decade.  How any screenwriter tasked to tell a new story about these characters is able to come up with something is impressive.  But to come up with something good / worth watching...nice work, Markus & McFeely!"
"May 22, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Despite not much development for some of the side Avengers such as Spider-Man, Hawkeye, Ant-Man and Vision, Captain America: Civil War has an exciting story which seems like a satisfying conclusion to the Avengers saga despite two more movies confirmed."
"May 22, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This movie was horrible. How did this get 90% on Rotten Tomatoes!?!?
This movie was soooooooooooo boring.  You would think they could do something cool with all this money and rights to the Marvel name...instead they just write a bunch of poop dribble with no content at all...just CG digital explosions....poop dribble at best:/"
"May 22, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The fight choreographers could learn a lot from Daredevil on Netflix. After seeing those fight scenes, nothing measures up. The action scenes in this film are too chaotic. It's difficult to tell what's happening. This film is well done overall."

"May 22, 2016",NEUTRAL,One of the best movies Marvel have to offer. Scenes in the movie were entertaining to watch.
"May 22, 2016",NEUTRAL,Seemed pretty long and kind of lame....i truly rhink they were stretching for a marvel movie
"May 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,The best superhero film since The Dark Knight.
"May 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I need to go and see this a second time. I thought it was actually crap. The absolute worst dullest, boring, plotless marketing of marvel I've ever seen.  Maybe the critics are drinking the Kool-Aid. And perhaps all these ratings of 5 stars are marvel fans and can't see the forest through the trees, but both my wife and I were stunned at how dull, absolutely dull this movie was."
"May 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,not the best Marvel movie but certainly in the conversation
"May 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,Spider-Man The pre movie. Starting to lose my touch these movies are starting to feel really formulaic and making Tony Stark kind of unlikable wasn't as fun to watch. Seeing vision and the heroes banter was worth my money. See it because everyone you talk you probably has
"May 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Horribly boring anticlimactic movie, just like the other 2 turd CA films."
"May 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I wish there were more Steve/Bucky moments in it. There are too many characters in the marvel cinematic universe now, and that makes it harder to create proper character development without making any of the characters relationships seem forced, but it worked pretty well in this movie, and the whole movie was very well directed."
"May 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Wow!  A must see, even for non-superhero fans.
Action sequences were incredible, dialog entertaining...may be the best Marvel movie ever?"
"May 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It met and even exceed expectations, I read the plot/summary before see it and was still pleasantly surprised by the story and the ending."
"May 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This film was a bit marmitey. Some will love the plot, the transition from Cap's Good-All-American image to troublemaker, the shift in relationships, and the graphics.  But others will find the camera shake too shaky, and if not already inducted in to the MCU, the whole thing might not standalone as well as other films.  I personally loved it... woot woot."
"May 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Great movie, great action, funny dialogue, intriguing tense dramatic moments, this movie completely deivered. It is a great movie, and a great addition to the MCU. It is a great self-contained movie that also sets the way for future movies, and provides great new additions to the Universe. Spider-Man and Black Panther are presented in a compelling way and Ant-Man has a great moment. The airport scene is perhaps one of the greatest action scenes ever.

Overall a great, fun movie to see!"
"May 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,Not worth the hype. ClichÃ©d characterization!
"May 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Best marvel movie in a while, and I'm DC FOR LIFE"

Review by Zanele Jiane

The movie is encased in a mini plot which has several protagonists and antagonists, despite the multi character format it still does not feel overcrowded, the pacing leaves enough room to breathe.

This movie is riding on the unconscious, overtly with Becky and covertly in the leading characters. Tony Stark is compromised from the word go by being directly blamed for a murder of an only child, a blame he fully accepts. When the United Nations initiates a plan to domesticate the Avengers, Tony is too compromised to fully assess the situation and immediately gives in to the initiative.

The remainder of the movie is the result of this compromise. The antagonist plays a very passive role as he sends the Avengers to do his dirty work and they do so without knowing they were acting out someone's evil plan.

Sebastian Stan has always a victim of some super hero's antics, in The Bourne Ultimatum Bourne delivers news that his sister Marie is no more, in Drive he suffer burn wounds because of his opponent and in the Avengers - Age of Ultron his family is killed in the climactic scene.

Tony Stark is a well-crafted character - he is very steeped in pop culture (calling Becky Manchurian Candidate, in The Avengers 1 he called Thor Point Break, also the Shakespeare in the park). A movie this detailed the directors were strong in that there is an emphasis in continuity i.e. Stark's black eye from the first fight is retained throughout the movie.

Steve Rogers is resolute and highly consistent, a work of a very fine screenwriting.

The weakness of the film is that the characters are ""never"" vulnerable and deflates a potentially powerful conflict in the body of the film, this was further deflated by the abortion of the Winter Soldiers who were deadlier than Becky was. This was the powder keg that was going to drive some sense into the Avengers so they unite.

Another bone to pick is that the film is ""Captain America"" but members of S.H.I.E.L.D and the AVENGERS are too prominent in the film that it seems we are watching the AVENGERS. It would be great for these films to retain their distinct characters because they are worth it and they have a story to tell.
The battle sequences may have been inspired by the Native American adage ""Use the whole buffalo"" as anything in the vicinity of the fight sequence is gainfully employed to outmatch the opponent - recently fight sequences were do so as to disable the opponent, case in point Bourne movies, but in the Avengers/Captain America the fight sequences are the movie, the sequences are so well choreographed, it's hard to look away even for a bit, also the choreography is inspired.

Henry Jackman's score is beautiful and serves the story just enough - it would have been great had he given us another ""MAGNETO"" score are he did in XMEN - FIRST CLASS. Nothing stood out for me score wise. Owen Patterson (The Matrix) has created a serious production design landscape that gets some serious trashing during the battle scenes.

CIVIL WAR does arouse the conscience and pushes us to definitely reflect on our actions and how past errors cam mean our very end. When we flourish we may leave a scar behind - you may be minding your business - drive a nice car and someone may end up being hijacked because someone has spotted you, envied you and failed to wait and want your kind of success immediately. These ugly repercussions may be something we can't even help, but it is happening. We are failing each other whether we realize it or not."
"May 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I really should stop going to films where most of the rest of the audience seems to have arrived on skateboards.  But it was raining, Mme Nield was scratching to be let out, and I DID abandon her two evenings on the trot while I gallivanted about Swansea.  The film?  The Ben & Jerry's beforehand was the best thing about this loud, bewildering, overlong, incomprehensible adolescent tripe."
"May 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The event movie of the year.  So in the wake of all the acts of destruction that wraps up pretty much every single movie in this universe, the public and the government demand that all superheroes sign a registration act, with the conceit behind it being that clearance must be given before they go ahead and fight villains in major metropolitan areas.  Not everybody sees eye to eye on this, and it isn't long before all heroes must pick a side.  Even if you don't follow this universe, or even if you don't follow movies in general, there is no way that Civil War is not on your radar.  Everybody's talking about this, and rightfully so: it's damn cool that it has all come to this, and this is sure to give you that same feeling that you got when you watched the first Avengers.  Even without checking, I am certain that this has already been said in other reviews, but I can't help but compare this to Batman v Superman.  In both universes, the extent of the collateral damage has been extremely high whenever the superheroes hit the scene to ""save the day"".  While DC dismisses it with a few offhanded comments, Marvel has the gall to actually sit down and have debates about it, so much so that it makes up a big chunk of the movie, about a third of the runtime I would say.  It's a conversation that needed to be had, so I am actually okay with them slowing down the pace to have this extensive discourse.  It makes it feel more grounded in reality, because this is something that should have already happened a while back.  But this is still a comic book movie that you are paying money to see cool stuff in, which brings us to the next item: the action.  You will know it when you see it, but the action sequence that hits around the 100 minute mark is nothing short of amazing.  It is fully realized and just overflowing with creativity.  Everybody is present for a reason, and every single hero gets not one, but multiple moments in a fight that isn't resolved in measly 4 minutes (like in Batman v Superman), but lasts a solid 10 - 15 minutes.  It's extremely well filmed, and you can tell exactly why is happening at every moment.  It's so spectacular, you are sure to wish that the theater had some sort of instant replay feature where you could immediately just watch it over again.  The sequence is not only the standout segment of the film, but arguably the standpoint piece to the entire Marvel Universe so far.  Unlike Avengers 2, Civil War pulls off its juggling act and never feels too crowded, even in the face of having such an extensive line-up, as well as introducing two new characters.  I haven't seen Tom Holland before, but I think he's perfect for Spider-Man and he owns the part without them having to take the time with another origins story.  Chadwick Boseman is also a talented actor, and he makes for a great addition to this story as Black Panther.  Marvel keeps building this universe up, and I thought that they may be reaching the bursting point with Ultron, but they've really brought it back with Civil War, showing that they still have so much more to bring to the table."
"May 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,"What a fun ensemble. 
The fighting scenes were well thought out and visually striking (ha).
Worth it to see it in the theater unless you have a home theater (jealous).
Acting was solid all around, except for Paul Rudd. Love the guy, but his head seemed like it was somewhere else for this movie.
Whoops, are you supposed to put spoiler alert somewhere in here? Hopefully you knew Ant Man was in this one. If you didn't, sorry. If you don't know who that is... I'd Google up on some of these characters, if you don't: this movie will have explo$ions!
Spoiler alert? *there's a scene with Tony Stark and Peter Parker that is incredibly awkward. Very memorable."
"May 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,"In some ways, I was glad this installment gave me the same elements I enjoyed from the first Avengers movie, in that it was lots of characters playing off each other, and less of those alien threat storyline. Pitting the 2 teams against each other in words and action made for a great time. I still need getting used to The Russos fast-action directing method though. The real highlight for me was the characters that injected humour in just some very small but significant moments of the movie. It just gets me excited to see more of them in their future individual movies."
"May 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,very good movie on my top 5 marvel movie list must watch again and again
"May 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Not bad, could be better."
"May 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Quite near the best Marvel has ever showcased, Captain America: Civil War is a highly entertaining, serious superhero film that is character-driven as well as action-driven."
"May 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Good but not as good as Winter Soldier. 
The Winter Soldier was like a thriller with a good story and great standout moments. Civil War felt more like Marvel Assembly 2.5. Too many characters for me with little back story. Spiderman for me was miscast! He looks too young. Andrew Garfield should have kept that role. Not a bad movie just not great either."
"May 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,Loads of action with a plot that complicates the good vs evil question with one of defining civic morality and loyalty.

"May 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,"captain america civil war is one of many rare sequels that is the best of all 3. the story was compelling, dramatic and well written, the character development was well done, the action was outstanding, the humor and drama mixed well and sends the marvel cinematic universe to new heights as the movie Iron man 3 should have been"

"May 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War is action-packed, thrilling, fun, and the best Marvel movie since Guardians of the Galaxy, and it's also one of the year's best films."
"May 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,"What can be better than a bunch of super-heroes trying to kick each other's butts for well over two hours!  However, I wonder how many people missed the (important) scene that didn't even play until the credits had been running for quite awhile?  Luckily, I was slow exiting and caught that scene just as I came off the last step before turning to leave the auditorium.  When is the next installment?  2017 or 2018?"
"May 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Marvel thinks it's ok set up two new franchises in a movie that relies on knowledge from at least two other franchises to understand. Every Marvel movie is a set up for more movies. When are we finally going to get to the grand finale they are setting up? It's frustrating that this is the 3rd movie in a franchise, but requires knowledge from more movies other than the previous two Captain America movies.

Spoiler Alert:
We focus on telling the story of so many different characters, besides the ones the further the plot of THIS movie. The main villain at the end was barely set up or payed off. But hey, let's watch people punch each other for two hours."
"May 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,very cool movie best movie ever
"May 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This was a great addition to the Captain America, Avengers and Marvel movies. I love how they are incorporating the damage that Super Heroes/Villians create when they fight each other and how it affects everyone else's lives. Captain America is the model for America and how great we were and how great we can be again."
"May 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,It is a very fast paced movie in my opinion. Doesn't let you get bored a single second and when the movie ends you are wondering why did it finished so early~
"May 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,great action. best Spiderman yet
"May 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The best MCU movie to date. With the Russo Brothers doing an amazing job in managing to tell an emotional story with so many characters involved, a true masterpiece of film. With new characters such as Spider-Man and Black Panther, they live up to the hype and leaves you wanting more!"
"May 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,"O melhor filme da Marvel com a presenÃ§a dos vingadores, a conexÃ£o de todas as histÃ³rias deixaram os filmes muito mais interessante. IntroduÃ§Ã£o do Black Panther foi uma das melhores que a Marvel jÃ¡ fez."
"May 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,Incredible. On the edge of my seat from the very beginning. Best Marvel film to date. Highly recommended
"May 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Marvel come out with another big hit with Captain America: Civil War. Joe and Anthony Russo's Latest Movie in the Marvel universe comes off as both a straight up sequel to Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Avengers: Age Of Ultron. The massive set pieces and the fantastic introduction of both Spider-Man and Black Panther add more depth towards the movie. This movie shares many story points as the disappointing Batman Vs. Superman, however unlike Batman Vs. Superman, Captain America: Civil War embraces it's Comic Book past, while also being grounded and realistic. Civil War has what many consider the greatest Comic Book Movie action scene of all time, and that is what it is exciting, action-packed and not too CGI heavy, while there is CGI, it isn't overused, the movie builds sets and builds a world, characters and each one has a clear motivation. The audience has a clear sense of that the audience will be torn, just like the characters in the movie. The directors aren't afraid to discover many deep and adult thematic arcs inside the movie. The Vision is given a lot of time to grow as he and Scarlet Witch share some intimate scenes. On the whole Captain America: Civil War explores the Characters of Iron Man and Captain America, getting inside their flaws, and why they fight for what they do, giving the movie an extra layer on top of the excellent action scenes. The movie feels like it has real stakes behind it and is by far Marvel's best outing so far."
"May 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,"great movie, Like how the exra action heros"
"May 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The super-hero smack down we all anticipated, this delivers on major levels. Never have we seen superheroes have so many levels and layers to them when beating the living crap out of each other. This is in the top tier of Marvel movies,"
"May 20, 2016",NEUTRAL,"160520: It is, as you would expect; typical Marvel fare. Good, fun, action entertainment but, even with the multiple characters, I won't give it more than 3.5. What Marvel annoyingly did with their comic line, they are now doing with movies. Shall we call them ""Tendril Films""? The infamous ""Marvel Universe"" that provided me with so much entertainment in the 80s and 90s. Satisfying yet exhausting on multiple levels. No story is truly complete without the other. I'm not even sure these films should be classified as art anymore. Art is no longer the purpose."
"May 19, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Marvel starts off the upcoming phase 3 with the Thrilling Captain America: Civil War, simultaneously delivering a fresh blockbuster action-packed thrill ride while fleshing out compelling thought provocking themes with sharply written élan and satisfying character standouts."
"May 19, 2016",NEUTRAL,I enjoyed Civil War just as much as I did Batman vs Superman. Both of these great movies are a bit similar when you compare the two. Black Panther was my favorite followed by spiderman/boy. Great movie.
"May 19, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Better named ""Avengers 2.5"" Captain America Civil War seems to be more about Ironman than anyone else. The goofy ""we're still friends, right?"" attitude through the film made it difficult to really get emotionally invested in it. All in all, if you like the Avengers films, you'll like this one- but don't expect any real plot or true enmity."
"May 19, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Civil War hit all the marks, not a scene, character or performance felt wasted or dull! Humor, drama, action, performances, characters, plot, everything was spot on! I now have complete faith in the Russo brothers' ability to handle Infinity War and bring the Marvel Cinematic Universe as we know it to a close!"
"May 19, 2016",NEUTRAL,"incredible movie. great action scenes, great characters, and a great coherent story."
"May 19, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Perfect in every ways, as a comic movie, as a triller, as a continuation."
"May 19, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Filled with many surprises and also with a lot of humor, Captain America Civil War is indeed the best comic book movie made.  The action was great and the humor was really funny.  There were times where you could joke around and other times where you had to be serious, and Marvel did a good job with balancing it.  Spider-Man did a great job, we finally have the greatest Spider-Man in Tom Holland and Chadwick Boseman killed it as Black Panther I cannot wait for their solo films!  This is a good movie to watch, and I recommend everyone to watch it.  10/10 perfect score!"
"May 19, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The difference between good and great movies lies in the treatment of characters - whether it makes the audience feel about the characters. This is where BvS failed. No one really cared about any of the character, probably even the writers didn't care. They were too focused on creating a spectacle of the battle between two heroes. And this is where Civil War wins. Marvel focused on the human aspect of the heroes - guilt, insecurity, righteousness, friendship, vengeance, conscience, compliance, tradition, legacy and the resulting conflicts. And all this leads to the big climax when only 3 of them remain. And boy, does it leave you breathless and waiting for more... 
This is turning out to be a phenomenal year for Disney. Zootopia, Jungle Book and now Civil War. Disney is surely back in the game. Lets just hope that Finding Dory keeps it up."
"May 19, 2016",NEUTRAL,"loved it, it is the best marvel film yet can't wait for the films to come"
"May 19, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It doesn't get much better than this for comic book films.  Even though they did a good job keeping the story focused on Captain America, it's really an Avengers film."
"May 19, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I loved it, but I saw faults that kept this form easily being the best superhero movie ever."
"May 19, 2016",NEUTRAL,"So good, i had to watch it 3 times :D"
"May 19, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I really liked Captain America: Civil War, but this movie, like most of Marvel films, was extremely forgettable. I left the theater not remembering if any main characters died which is not a good thing. While watching the movie I was really enjoying it, definitely a more serious tone than other Marvel instalments, which I prefer, but when I look at the significance of this movie in a larger world it makes me question if it was even necessary."
"May 19, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Action packed from beginning to end, Marvel Studios expands its cinematic universe yet again in Captain America: Civil War.

As the Avengers have stepped up to the plate, toe to toe against the forces that threaten our humble blue planet, public opinion of our heroes have been heavily tainted due to the high body count, and absolute destruction left in the wake of events that occurred in New York, Washington D.C, and the fictional country of Sokovia. Some hail the Avengers as the only group able to battle such enemies, but others believe that these events occurred because the Avengers allowed them to happen. Think about it for a second, if Thor never came to Earth, then neither would Loki. If Stark never invented the A.I Jarvis, then Ultron would never have been born. Captain America has been left in charge of the team for now, but the U.S government would like them to register their identities, and put themselves under their command. Although this entry lightly samples the massive 2006/07 Civil War crossover events, it does well on its own as the Marvel universe expands.

The plot is everything an action movie should be, with a few twists and turns in the road. It is of course as linear an event as you would expect, you know 'catch the bad guy,' as every superhero film goes, and it rehashes a few topics already touched on in the first Avengers film where you have the typical 'Hero Vs. Hero' situation that everyone seems to love. Yet the film does well in its intensity, and is never cartoonish or convoluted within the borders of the story-line. I didn't expect too much after seeing 'The Winter Soldier (2014), which I felt was probably one of the more boring entries from Marvel, but this film makes up for that slow movie, expands on it, and drives home quite a punch. This is the film that I felt closes the second phase of Marvel, and leaves it open for new additions for the next.

I found it difficult to put the focus on any one character, because of the sheer volume of characters who star and interact with each other. It is a 'Captain America' branded film, but arguably he shares the screen with several heroes throughout the film, and this movie doesn't necessarily feel too focused on him. The major players all happen to pop in at some time (barring Thor and Hulk), but a few new faces have joined in the fray. Chris Evans does well reprising his role as the titular character. Robert Downey Jr, and Scarlett Johansson easily have as much screen time with the Captain (arguably more). Sebastian Stan returns as Bucky Barnes, and has certainly beefed up since his last incarnation as the Winter Soldier. A few new faces enter the fray as well. Chadwick Boseman as the Black Panther gets a poignant origin story here. Tom Holland, as the teenage Spiderman, is a welcome addition if you can ignore all other incarnations of the Webslinger (it fits better with the overall story if you do, and you don't won't have to shake your head at the gaping plot hole he provides). Finally, I was quite surprised at Daniel Bruhl's portrayal as the manipulative and intelligent Baron Zemo, and he was definitely the most human role in this entire film.

However, one small issue I had was with the motivations behind the main characters. I did have a hard time trying to figure out what the divide was between these friends, outside of Tony Stark's and the Captain's motivations to keep the planet safe at all costs. I didn't really get why Stark would feel the need to register all superheroes if the government ALREADY knows who each super-individual is, and where they are at all times. Wouldn't registration be irrelevant? Tony Stark is one person who should be AGAINST this idea. After all, he's seen the Chitauri army gifted to Loki via Thanos during the Battle of New York, and he's one of the few people who comprehend the magnitude of this threat that faces mankind from a galaxy away.

On the flipside; Why does Captain America, who's been a government agent from the very start of his adventure, oppose such a move from the U.S ? He's been a soldier in the American Army since World War II. If anything, he should be the one supporting registration, because he is already registered as a U.S infantryman. What's the difference if they are or not? It poses no threat to the Avengers, nor their members, nor the Winter Soldier. If he signed it, he could still go on after Bucky, and keep his allegiance in tact. An avid fan could easily argue these two roles should have been reversed from the comic book approach (where it made a lot more sense due to the sheer number of mutants and super-powered individuals, many of whom live in secret and have lives or families to protect. Cap goes against the government's plans for registration because he sees the act somewhat akin to what the Nazi's did to the Jewish people in WW2), but I'm certain they wanted to adhere to the original comic event somewhat without too many alterations.

The movie could have easily been called Captain America Vs Iron Man, and still have done well as a set up to future Civil War events. I suppose, Marvel Studios wants to plow ahead with its endgame before people lose interest by 2018. All in all, Civil War is an absolute smash from beginning to end, and I think this will be noted as one of the more important entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
"May 19, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Loved it, might as well have been called Avengers 3: Civil War!"
"May 19, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It was a good movie, but the story line was irrelevant"
"May 19, 2016",NEUTRAL,The best Marvel movie yet.
"May 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,One of the best movies ever
"May 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America Civil War is the third film in the Captain America trilogy while also being a direct sequel to Avengers 2.  Of all the MCU films this is probably my favorite now.  Is it my favorite comic book film of all time? That's debatable.  Do I think it's the best comic book film of all time like many say.  The answer is no.  I don't even think it's the best film in the MCU.  While I enjoy it the most I do think The Winter Soldier and the first Iron Man have an edge on it.  Film like The Dark Knight, Batman Begins, and Watchmen (I don't care what anyone says) are better as well in terms of quality.  That's not including the animated films like The Dark Knight Returns, Mask of The Phantasm, Justice League Gods and Monsters just to name a few.
Civil War is an adaptation of the comic event of the same name, though a loose one.  The film does have heroes fighting heroes and the crux of the conflict is this new law that dictates that heroes have to register under the government.  That's where the similarities to the comic stop.  While the film features most of the Avengers it's still primarily a captain America movie.  It's also on a smaller scale as well than the comic and the Avengers films.  People like to say this is Avengers 2.5 but it's really not.  The world is not at stake in this and the action, while awesome, is on a smaller scale than the Avengers movies.
This film does so much right.  The acting is superb from everyone involved.  The character interactions are amazing, better than in the Avengers films in some ways.  The action is top notch despite not being Avengers level.  Everyone is raves about the airport battle.  I love that fight but my favorite action scene is the final one at the end.  That's when the film kicks into high gear and becomes outstanding to me.
I love the conflicting ideologies set-up.  Each side has a legit argument, but neither is entirely sound.  You also understand how these characters got to where they are now.  Captain America no longer trusts the government as much because of what happened in Winter Soldier.  Stark believes that the avengers need more regulation because of what happened in age of Ultron.  He created Ultron himself with no supervision by anyone and because of that the world was almost destroyed and many died.  In that sense it is like Avengers in that it is a grand payoff to everything that came before. 
I also like that this film has lasting consequences.  This is not just a one-off novelty for fans.  Really nothing is resolved by the end and the status quo is now changed.  Things don't just return to normal by the end which really makes this film have the weight it needs and makes it a necessary chapter of the MCU as opposed to just fan service and a filler slot until we get to Infinity War.
To replace Thor and Hulk who are absent for this film we have to new additions, Black Panther ad Spiderman.  Black Panther I like a lot.  The only place I know Black Panther from would be from the Ultimate Avenger 2 animated film.  There I thought he was just okay, but in this film he was one of the best aspects.  I look forward to what he can deliver in his solo movie.
Spiderman I really like as well.  Tom Holland is probably the best live action version of this character, up there with Tobey McGuire's version in Spiderman 2.  I have to see his solo movie before I can declare him the best Spiderman.  The costume looks great, though I still like the Raimi one more.   
Tom Holland takes everything that worked with Andrew Garfield's Spiderman and perfects it.  He's not the naïve jokey aspect of his personality perfectly.  However, what the Raimi version of the character nailed (in Spiderman 2 anyway) is the hardship Peter has with being Spiderman and living his everyday life.  We haven't gotten that with Holland's version yet because in this film he's just a minor side character.  I hope that gets tackled in his solo film.
In this film Spiderman basically like Wonder Woman in Batman v Superman.  Like with Wonder Woman I liked how Spiderman is portrayed, but his only role was to be a part of the big fight near the end like Wonder Woman.  You could have removed him entirely and you'd have the same movie.
However, I do not like Aunt May at all here.  That's a nitpick since she's just a cameo but I was not feeling it.  She was far too young, or at least she looked it.  The best Aunt May to me is still the one from the Raimi films.  Those movies got Uncle Ben and Aunt May down completely. 
The villain Zemo I actually liked.  I wouldn't call him an amazing villain but compared to most MCU villains we've gotten he's pretty good.  I'd put him second to Loki.  Unlike most other bad guys we've seen Zemo actually has some depth to his character and you can even sympathize with him to a degree.  He's not just some Saturday morning cartoon villain that just wants money or power or is just crazy.
Many will be annoyed that his character is very different from his comic counterpart.  Like with Iron Man 3 it didn't bother me too much.  Zemo is not a villain I was familiar with.  In fact, I didn't even know he existed until this film.  Plus, since he doesn't die at the end there's a chance he could come back be more like he was in the comics.
The problem I had with Zemo is you didn't need him in the film really.  This film should have just been about Iron Man and Cap and their teams fighting each other for their opposing ideals.  You didn't need a villain.  Really, having an actual villain actually makes the fights a tad more forced than need be.  He does bring forth a large bomb shell at the end but anyone could've done that.  In fact, that should've been done much earlier in the film and served as some of the basis for the conflict of the film.  It's fine as is, but it could've been better.  
Plus, while his plan is genius, the details of his plan don't add-up in spots.  Since, everything else is working in the film and I was wholly invested it didn't bother me as much.  If I wasn't invested, that would have irked me more than it did.
Not to mention there was this other villain in the beginning that I felt was underutilized-Crossbone.  He was built up at the end of Winter Soldier like he would be a big deal, but he turned out to just be a one-off villain.  He didn't have to factor heavily in this movie but they could have brought him back later.
It also irked me a bit that not a single character died.  That's one thing that's bothered me throughout the MCU.  This is a ""war"" and a major turning point in the continuity so it would have had a bit more weight if someone got taken out.  There was a moment where it seemed like there might be a death, but it doesn't happen.  I swear if someone does not die in Infinity War I will be rather pissed.
Overall, Civil War certainly lives up to the hype.  This was the best time I've had going to the movies in a long time, especially for a film of this length.  It's my personal favorite of the MCU now.  It's not the best comic book movie but it's up there with the greats.  I found it to be the most entertaining of all the MCU films, even more than the first two Avengers."
"May 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Good, but not perfect. Some effect seems not smooth. But overall this is a must see film of the year!"
"May 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Egh. Not that they have much to work off, but it's starting to feel like these actors are mailing it in. Kind of like a game of thrones episode, but instead of wishing we could stay with the characters longer, I'm just happy to get through the scenes as quickly as possible now. This was captain America? Why so bloated with unnecessary characters, and on such weak plot. Just not much to like here at all. How are these making a billion bucks apiece!?!?"
"May 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Marvel is approaching its peak, I feel. They get better at character depth and drama, as they go.  It helps you ignore things like ""Wait.  What was Captain America's super power supposed to be, again?"""
"May 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I think this is the best film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe yet! I liked the previous Captain movies, but this one had the most amazing cast (it really was Avengers 2.5, as many had said) and action elements to really push it over the top to supremacy. I also really liked the political and moral elements, kinda wished they could have just talked about their opinions more! It was jam-packed with Marvel characters, but each was well developed, and we learned of their motivations for the side they chose. Such a good movie. I may rank it higher than my original 4 star rating after repeat viewings.
Watched at Chinook with Sam, May 17, 2016."
"May 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Do you enjoy WWE? WWE? Bunch of contrived (fake) fighting over contrived (stupid) reasons.  By time it was over, I felt like I was the recipient of all those (contrived) blows. I'm thinking Hollywood should respect its audiences more, but with this crap getting stuck r high reviews I guess we'll be stuck with the same movies, applying the same formulas, just with different uniforms."
"May 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,"What can I say. When you kill it, you kill it. This movie hit all of the right notes and, in my opinion, is the best Marvel movie to date, edging out Iron Man and Winter Soldier. It hit all of the right notes for every character and was just true enough to the source material that many of us loved. The Russo Brothers are the best thing that the MCU have going on right now. (You know, since they have poor villains....)"
"May 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!
"May 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,Great addition to the Marvel universe franchise! A definite must-see!
"May 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,one of the best comic book movies ever the characters get a good amount of screen time but the movie is mostly about captain america movie which revolves around his friend ship with his WW2 friend Bucky Barnes. And they introduce two new characters black Panther and Spider-Man Perfectly and they don't feel shoehorned in there. So the movie works perfectly.
"May 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best Marvel Movie to date
"May 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,this movie was everything i hoped for and more great storyline development really found it hard who to root for. stayed fairly close to source material time flew by a grea masterpiece
"May 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Itâ??s definitely a worthy successor to the Winter
Soldier, a great addition to the franchise and universe, very high-caliber (no surprise
there), but it is not the best weâ??ve seen from Marvel but itâ??s up there as a
strong contender."
"May 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Not the worse movie this year, but it's pretty close. Flawed, but the greatest sin of all -- dull and boring."
"May 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Another amazing Marvel film. Captain America:Civil War a brilliant set up to the third Avenger film. Great performance, great CGI, excellent story, and the action sequence looked real. Captain America: Civil War, is top ten marvel film."
"May 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,"My god! Are you kidding me! This is not a good movie. There's so much wrong with it it would fill two pages easily! The Marvel fanatics are pushing this movie hard. I'm so angry my money went to the billion plus it's going to make. I'm done with superhero movies! This sucks, and it's worse then BvS, and that movie wasn't all that good either! A 10 out of a 100."

"May 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,First half of move - BORING!  Tries to take itself too seriously.  Not until the second half when Spiderman is brought into the picture does the film really take off.
"May 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,Now THIS is how you do a superhero throwdown. Lots of action. Great sense of humor. And it tackles some thought-provoking issues. Spider-Man and Ant-Man steal the show.

"May 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,Good solid flick. greÃ¤t effects.
"May 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I give three and half star to scene at the airport. The rest of the movie, not that great. Still for me the best Captain America movie is Winter Soldier. This movie could have been more better, but at list that scene of the airport was great."
"May 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Fun film, the fight scenes made any of the lagging scenes worth it. Spiderman and Black Panther stole the show, even Ant Man had some great bits! Fight scenes are great to watch and the movie doesn't leave you wanting more."
"May 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,Dont know why the 90%. It was ok. Cool special effects.
"May 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,great story but too much cgi
"May 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Great story line, very engaging"
"May 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,More of an avengers movies. Helps if you've seen all other movies in the franchise.
"May 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,"A good film, one of the better Marvel ones actually, but it is essentially The Avengers 2.5. All these Marvel films are leading to the next film in the series, which can be a bit of an issue if you haven't seen the previous ones, or the tv series. And in the case of this one, how is it a Captain America movie and not an Avengers one? Just because Thor and Hulk are not in it? Even though they introduce Spider Man and Black Panther and bring back another hero too.

Anyway, the story is decent. Its good that they acknowledge the damage and loss of life that has occurred in the MCU, but it is a little silly that the event that brings this up is really small compared to the distraction that has happened in any of the other films, but it needed to happen, and it given an excuse to save a bit in the budget from doing a giant city destroying scene."
"May 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,So many good things to say about this film. The action is superb and offers great variety. Each character has just the right amount of screen time dedicated to make it all feel right. The plot twists and revelations are brilliantly executed and offer great consequences. This is just a really good Marvel film that shouldn't be missed.
"May 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This movie does the exact opposite of Batman v Superman. Civil War does not over use action and CGI with little to no story. It is truly incredible how well they were able to balance a plot with great twists to go a long with it. you watch the film knowing that your not going to see another transformers or man of steel, but a classic superhero movie that will appeal you and be one of your favorite marvel movies ever."
"May 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,Everything it needed to be and more!
"May 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I went into Civil War with the highest of expectations after reading fivestar  reviews. After the intial kick-ass, balls swinging rendevoux of the Avengers and their first battle, I found my eyes getting heavier and heavier as the kinetic flow that the Marvel films are so good for, came to a stand still. Understandably, this is the part of the Avengers chapter about moral and emotional conflict, but all interest for explanation  came to a hault as the two and half hour film plodded along. Apart from the wide array of great cast members, characters and special effects, for me the first 20 minutes had the ground breaking action that the final Civil War ""airport"" scene should have had. Still a devout Captain America and Russo Brothers fan, but I came out of the cinema with a come down and not still flying high."
"May 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,"If I was a comic fan I guess I'd feel different, but, as it is, it was a boring, dull Avengers flick."
"May 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,"An amazing well-handled superhero action film, all the characters had great character development, the action was increidble with some amazing action scenes, specially the airport scene. The direction from the Russo brothers was great. The script was so good that there wasn't a dull moment in this movie. The villain, on the other hand, was useless and cliché. But overall, i´s probably one of the best superheroe movie ever made"
"May 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,Team Iron-man!! and Spiderman is awesome.
"May 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best Marvel film to date.... Pretty much all the cast and characterisations were great... with the exception of Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch (watch it for yourself...and disagree!)
"May 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,Some of the worst cgi i have seen. Literally some of the bad cgi takes you out of some parts of the movie.
"May 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I thought this was one of the worst movies I have seen! It is boring, no decent story line, I guess if you want to watch a bunch of people fighting via CGI you will be very happy as it seems so many are. I just thought it was unremarkable. And I loved Captain America, Ironman and Thor, just not this, writers are lazy and the public accepts it!"
"May 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I rate captain america civil war
 it a 9/10"
"May 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best superhero movies i had ever seen
"May 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,The appetite for watching superheroes beat up bad guys on screen has not waned but it has evolved. This latest film in The Avengers franchise involves good guys hitting other good guys over philosophical differences. Is this an improvement? Not hardly. Read why I disagree with the Fanboy audience in a full post on The Next Phase Blog: http://aknextphase.com/avengers-learn-nothing/
"May 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Excellent. A load of fun. I've read the Civil War series and this by far exceeded my expectations, despite it being so different from the original story line."
"May 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Loved this movie, the action, the story, Black Panther. This was one of the best Marvel adaptations ever done."
"May 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,Not convinced. This movie is confusing in a bad way. Characters are introduced haphazardly and Spidey's exit was such a joke. Audience is not given a chance to invest in the plot and super heroes are not given a chance to hold conversations. Entirely too much time is taken to make sure each character is given a fair share of ass kicking in combat. This is no winter soldier.
"May 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Cap-ping off an already very impressive run, Civil War accomplishes everything Batman v Superman failed at and more by incorporating a roster of very different heroes into a ridiculously entertaining and thought-provoking flick that amounts to Marvel's absolute best yet. Dramatic but extremely funny, comic book reverential but not cartoonish, action-packed but intriguingly political, the movie's dense story ticks off so many boxes and yet still gets packaged into a very easy-to-follow thrill-ride. One of the only deficits of the latest layer in Marvel Studios' brilliant world-building scheme is the fact that it asks - not requires - audiences to be up to speed on their back catalogue. Surely, newbies will enjoy the dust-ups and witty character interplay but those already in for the long haul (Captain America: Winter Soldier, Avengers: Age of Ultron, and Ant-Man play integral backstory roles) will reap almost heavenly rewards with the ultimate payoff. Another deficit is the title-Civil War is more of an Avengers movie despite sharing the same moniker as a popular '90s Cap min-series. As for the only other deficit, where one stands - Team Cap or Team Iron Man - everyone wins. However, the former holds the most interesting character arc of any Marvel Studios hero thus far, having gone from patriotic shrimp to flag-smashing super-solider to cynical government employee to moral-driven rebel. In a time when one presidential nominee sports a dubious slogan of ""Make America Great Again,"" this movie both echoes the nation's uncertainty and provides a compelling reason for muscle-bound, gimmick-sporting, and power-wielding beautiful people to throw down.

In this PG-13-rated adventure, political interference in the Avengers' activities causes a rift between former allies Captain America (Evans) and Iron Man (Downey), causing heroes to take sides. 

Every player, from a guilt-ridden Iron Man to the remorseful young Scarlet Witch to proud new freedom fighter Black Panther to a surprisingly sympathetic villain in Baron Zemo, gets woven in as an imperative piece of this mosaic. It's no spoiler to say that Spider-man plays a part (he appears in the trailers and trade ads), but here's a new tidbit: he plays a larger part than you'd think and his perfect integration hints at a spectacular stand-alone flick to come. None of these are deficits, of course-just talking points regarding a nearly flawless blockbuster. As for the promised battle royale (the smoking gun of a title), it proves as popcorn-munchingly glorious as anything your creative brain could have imagined. More importantly, the build-up and follow-up acts as a political thriller that's more interested in high stakes than red capes. 13 films into an inter-connected series, Marvel finds a number that is anything but unlucky. If anything, Civil War shows the studio at its most powerful and its product line at its most satisfying. With Doctor Strange, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Thor: Ragnarok, Black Panther, Avengers: Infinity War - Part I, Ant-Man and the Wasp, Captain Marvel, and Avengers: Infinity War - Part II set for release over the next three years, it behooves audiences to get in line now.

Bottom line: Darling, You Look Marvel-ous"
"May 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This movie was good not just fo
r being a great action piece but for being a good movie. With thrilling action sequences that make you grab your seat as if you are in it, heartbreaking scenes that make you feel a bit sorry for Tony Stark, as well as decent comedy that makes you smile, it is the best Marvel movie ever made"
"May 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Anthony and Joe Russo en-Vision-ed a summer superhero blockbuster that included both action and great story telling. They did exactly that and in the process - making one of, if not the best Marvel cinematic experiences. The Russo brothers do an incredible job at showcasing the plot. They make you relate to the characters and they show the stories of the both opposing sides very well, to the point where  choosing between 'Team Cap' and 'Team Ironman' is a near impossibility. Casting: Chris Evans, probably the best man to wield the iconic vibranium shield, always does an amazing performance - film after film. Familiar faces also never disappoint as well as new faces such as the new Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and very anticipated Spider-Man (Tom Holland). Truly one of the most entertaining superhero movies out there with some of the best cinematic shots of 2016. I highly recommend this film to all you entertainment junkies out there who love great action sequences, a great cast and a big loud score to top it off."
"May 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,so cool!! this civil war
"May 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,a superhero movie that is undoubtedly worth watching and a definite crowd-pleaser. Can't wait to see it again.
"May 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best  Captain America yet!!! Full of action and introductions of new characters.
"May 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,Really Awesome movie want to see the movie once again
"May 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,boring to die.....1.5 hours' sleeping
"May 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Very entertaining, and a far tighter production than much of Marvel's recent output. the Russos have achieved an uncommon balance of plot and action, humor and drama, all of it once again deeply grounded in character. Thank you for canonical Spider-Man. He is awesome!!!"
"May 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,Great movie. Very enjoyable from beginning to end. Awesome story. Very awesome Spider-Man. Worth seeing more than once.
"May 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,Definitely better than Batman Vs. Superman
"May 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Great movie with awesome fight scenes. Spider-Man character was a little bit of a let down, it made him look weak and insignificant compared to the Avengers. The absence of Ruffalo (The Hulk) was a let down. I guess it would have been hard to work Captain America getting his butt kicked and still getting on with the movie. I always knew Captain America could take Iron Man though. Definitely worth seeing."
"May 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,"With a first half that is little more than an overlong political drama and a second half filled with huge action, Whedon-esque quips from a multitude of super-cameos; capped off with a single (masterful) revelation sequence, the main reason ""Captain America: Civil War"" only garners 3  1/2 stars has to do with a finale where...How do I say this without spoiling things?...""Captain America: Civil War"", a movie which contains the epic Iron Man vs. Captain America confrontation; a confrontation which has been at least four films in the making, settles on a resolution that can only be described as ""civil"".

"May 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Another great entry in the Captain America series which is far and away the best superhero movies Marvel has produced since they obsessively started doing them. Does enough to make it seem enough like its own Captain America movie, but also like a mini-Avengers which somehow works pretty well."
"May 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,that Goliath seen money
"May 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The next big film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe arrives in a slam-dunk fashion, with a great storyline and unexpected twists and turns.

After the events of Age of Ultron, a new team of Avengers, led by Captain America, track Rumlow down in Lagos, where they stop him from obtaining a biological weapon, only for the fight to cause a group of Wakandan humanitarian workers to be killed. This results in the United Nations to plan on passing the Sokovia Accords, which will allow them to oversee and control the Avengers. While one group of the Avengers, led by Tony Stark, favors oversight, another group, led by Captain America, does not. After a bombing at the United Nations, which hints that Captain America's old friend and brainwashed soldier, Bucky Barns, is behind the attack. This leads the two factions of the Avengers to come at odds in an explosive and at times complicated, but fun ride.

The cast, once again, as usual, is a standout. Chris Evans still proves that he is Captain America, distilling in him doubt and a questioning manner, while also showing him as a conflicted and true leader. Evans commands the film and ever scenes that he is in, proving that the Marvel Cinematic Universe isn't complete without the character. Robert Downey Jr. once again proves that he is Tony Stark and that no other actor can depict the character. Downey takes a backseat to Evans in good fashion and doesn't try to take the film away from him. This is more Captain America, than Iron Man, with Stark only arriving into the film when necessary and never hogging the film away from Evans. Downey and Evans work well together, while successfully showing the different sides of both characters: Captain America as the leader and Tony Stark as the billionaire, who after the events of Age of Ultron, is guilt ridden. His decision to favor oversight comes from a civilian in Sokovia being killed during the battle, which has a huge impact over the film. Sebastian Stan makes a welcome return to Bucky Barnes, the brainwashed friend of Captain America, codenamed the Winter Soldier. Once again this character proves that the Captain America trilogy is about one thing: brotherly love. Stan's depiction brings a sense of doubt and confusion, since he still trying to piece his entire life together, while it also partly ties certain events together. Scarlett Johansson is marvelous as always as Black Widow, delivering great lines and working well opposite both Evans and Downey. Anthony Mackie is once again amazing as Falcon, Captain America's new ally. Don Cheadle still works well with Downey and in the role of James Rhodes, having replaced Terence Howard in Iron Man 2. Jeremy Renner makes a great, small appearance as Hawkeye, as does Paul Rudd as Ant-Man, lending a sense of comedy to the film and giant surprises. Paul Bettany depicts Vision as an android attempting to come to grips with the world, while Elizabeth Olsen gets to further explore the character of Scarlet Witch, sharing some really great scenes with Bettany. William Hurt makes a welcome return to the MCU as Thunderbolt Ross, now Secretary of State. This approach seems to be done as a way to still make clear that The Incredible Hulk (the black sheep of the MCU) is still part of the universe. Hurt shows Ross as a complicated politician. Frank Grillo makes a great, small appearance as Rumlow at the beginning, while Emily VanCamp makes a welcome return as Sharon Carter and Martin Freeman is introduced to the MCU in a small role as Everett Ross, who will undoubtedly return for future installments. The real standouts in the film are Tom Holland as Spider-Man and Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther. Holland steals the scenes that he is in as Spider-Man, working exceptionally well opposite Evans and Downey, as well as Marisa Tomei, who depicts Aunt May. Holland is comedic, depicting the character as a nervous, geeky, unsure character. Holland seems to be the definitive version of the character, delivering a far better performance of the character than Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield, the two of whom are also fine actors. While some may say that Spider-Man is only featured in the film to introduce him into the MCU and also to setup the planned standalone film, I believe that Spider-Man worked out well in the film and lended a real sense of stamina to the film, especially the big fight. Boseman is amazing as Black Panther, delivering the character with menace and true purpose. Boseman is calm as the character, while the introduction is wild and spectacular. Daniel Bruhl makes a great appearance as the villain Zemo, who has a huge connection to the events of the film. While the character is different in the comic books, I can defend the change that had to be done, since it supports the film's plot and layout. Bruhl's approach to the character, as a calm and calculating villain, as well as the villain itself is spectacular, while he has got to be the best villain that the universe has had to see so far. The idea of having a normal, regular human face off against the Avengers is smart and total genius on the part of the filmmakers. Bruhl is menacing and every scene that he is in, you don't know what he has planned to do next, while you also see a sense of retribution in the character.

Anthony and Joe Russo deliver another slambang film, proving that they are once again, after Captain America: The Winter Soldier, the right directors to continue Captain America's storyline. The great thing about this film is that it is treated like a political war film, which I enjoyed. Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely deliver another tight nit screenplay, with a huge political theme and a well-developed storyline that is serious and perfectly managed. I applaud the filmmakers, the Russos, Markus and McFeely, for not having the entire film appear like a battle, but instead reserving the battle toward the end, with a huge lead up, slowly showing the fall out and downfall between Steve Rogers and Tony Stark in a well-developed and serious plot. The connection between Captain America, Iron Man and Bucky Barnes is also well handled, slowly setup in a perfect manner. The film also does a good way of showing the ramifications and effects of war, especially on a superpowered team. Also, for the first time, we are shown how the damage that superpowered beings unintentionally cause can be looked at, with the filmmakers bringing a sense of political issues to handling the Avengers, in a smart storytelling move. Markus and McFeely also bring a good characterization to Spider-Man, introducing him in a smart decision, while also allowing him to deliver a number of genius and funny lines. The cinematography by Trent Opaloch wonderfully supports the film and events, as well as the various characters. While the cinematography is bleak and dark, it isn't on the same level as Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. The cinematography still has sprinkles of color, though the use of blandness wonderfully supports the events and message that the film holds. The lighting of Siberia is dreary, further adding to the big fight between Captain America and Bucky and Iron Man. The music by Henry Jackman is action packed, with an operatic feel, while also having a strong political undercurrent. Once again the teaming between Jackman and the Russos works.

The film also has the best fight scene in the MCU, the encounter at the airport between the different sides of the Avengers. The approach is well staged and never feels forced, while the inclusion of Spider-Man, Black Panther, Ant-Man and Vision is used to good effect. The fight includes a number of amazing references which I won't spoil, while it also ends in a very surprising and unexpected fashion. The fight between Captain America and Bucky and Iron Man is also well-handled, as is the location, while it shows the lengths that one friend will go to protecting another friend. Both fights are handled in good fashion and with a very good vision. The chase through the tunnel, which also first introduces Black Panther, is also well-staged and acts as another amazing chase in the records of film chase scenes.

The end result is a film that will leaver the viewer wondering how the universe will continue. Since Captain America: The Winter Soldier acted as a turning point in the MCU leading up to Age of Ultron, this film does the same, showing a change in Stark, while also showing Rogers as a new leader. The film ends in such a way with us wondering the directions that the characters will go in and also if Stark will ever be needed anymore, while also showing the lengths that he can go to. The film includes a number of good references to other films in the MCU, while it also acts as a terrific conclusion to the Captain America trilogy, proving that this is the best trilogy within the MCU. In the case of good third chapters in trilogies (Toy Story 3, The Dark Knight Rises, Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King) this film acts a fantastic third chapter to its own trilogy. The film also does the smart move of not revolving around a huge battle, showing the slow build up to the battle and the lengths that characters can go to, in a way showing a war of opinions in political style discussion. The result is a film that is terrific and well-handled, acting as a great comic book film, but also so far as this year's best comic book film. Amazing job everyone. Fantastic!"
"May 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,"it was worth the price for tickets and will be added to our Marvel collection when it's released.
my only take away is Spiderman. i understand starting over with a new spin comics do it all the time. a new universe new choices but we change Spiderman more times then 007!  pick someone and stick with it for at least 3 movies.
I loved the action and the twists n turns. and how  link them together with other movies and shows in the Marvel universe."
"May 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,"A little confusing. Hard to tell who is fighting whom, or who to root for. You kinda like people on both sides, so who do you root for?"
"May 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Even better than its last two films, Captain America: Civil War is a fun and surprisingly funny movie with great action sequences that might be like most marvel movies"
"May 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,If anyone had said that The Winter Soldier was better than The First Avenger yet it was going to be surpassed  by the 3rd installment of Captain America most people would have said you were crazy. Somehow Marvel have done just that. In short there are so many good things about this movie you can't find a favourite part also all of the performances are what you would expect from such a stellar cast. Some characters aren't in it enough for my liking however the introduction of some new faces just shows how Marvel will not disappear overnight and the studio will keep churning out the movie's until there are no characters left.
"May 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This was definetly an amazing movie, but not as good as I thought it would be. Before I saw it al my friends were like, ""This is the best Marvel movie yet, how haven't you seen it yet!"" I noticed it has some similarities to ""Dawn of Justice."" This was certainly a good one, don't get me wrong, but I give it a 9/10."
"May 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,It's very hilarious on this movie and it has a lot of cool action. I love it very much so I gave this one 5 stars. I would give it more than 5 stars if I could.
"May 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,Sooooooooooo not awesomeeeeeeee!
"May 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,Total waste of money.  The supposed villian pisses off all the good guys snd then the good guys do battle.  It was a disappointment from all angles...even in 3-d.
"May 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,This might just be my favorite marvel movie so far
"May 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,Awesome in 3D! Loved the whole story line.
"May 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,Full review on DCFilmGirl.com.
"May 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,"See, DC this is how you do a superheros-battling-superheros movie!  Grade: A-"
"May 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,"BEST. MARVEL. MOVIE EVER!!!
Even Better In 3D!!!!!"
"May 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Great movie, but Disney and Marvel come back to the CGI sins of Avengers movie"
"May 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Ultron was Tony Stark's innovation that was meant to withstand future onslaughts from the threats of the Universe. However, due to the maligned nature of Loki's sceptre, the Age of Ultron wreaked havoc on Sokovia, while the Avengers scrambled to prevent collateral damage as the city was raised to the skies and yet, not everyone could be saved.  Nations become suspicious of the unchecked powers of Earth's mightiest heroes and those who lost their families due to their actions, seek to avenge them. Thus, 'Civil War' is partly an aftermath of 'Age of Ultron' and partly a follow-up to 'Captain America: Winter Soldier' mainly due to Bucky's presence. The Russo brothers enter the 3rd phase of MCU and stick to the formula that has worked wonders for Disney/Marvel in keeping with a brighter, entertaining tone.

We start in 1991, with Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) being sent on a mission to retrieve a serum from a car. The driver of the car isn't revealed quite yet but that proves to be quite a twist at the very end. Current day in Nigeria, a group of Avengers disrupt Brock Rumlow's (Frank Grillo) attempt to steal a bio weapon. Their encounter leads to Rumlow detonating an explosive under his vest and Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) directing its effects away from the busy marketplace. Unfortunately, it leads to the death of several humanitarian workers from Wakanda who were in the building nearby. 
Meanwhile, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) reveals his impressive sample of future technologies to M.I.T. students and generously offers to fund all of their research projects. There, he meets a grieving mother who lost her son in Sokovia, reminding Stark of the failures and uncontrolled powers of the superheroes.
	Too much damage has been done even with their best intentions and efforts. Accountability was thus proposed by a United Nations panel through the Sokovia Accords that would control their actions. US Secretary of State, Ross convinces them of no other way but to sign in its favor. Tony agrees due to his bad decisions and experiences, Captain (Chris Evans) disagrees because of his suspicion of those who rule with agendas. One prefers accountability by external authority while the other prefers the freedom to act as he assumes that the safest hands are still their own. 

	The Accords themselves weren't much to quarrel over since the scenario was inevitable but it's the explosion at the UN Conference in Vienna that really tears them apart. The Wakandan King, who was a strong proponent of the Accords, perishes in the attack and his son T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) is determined to bring the suspect to justice. The suspect being the Winter Soldier. Automatically, Cap saves his bro-friend Bucky on every attack from the government, Ironman and T'Challa's mysterious form of Black Panther. This exciting introduction of a powerful warrior expands the might of the Avengers in general with his formidable abilities and skills. Thereafter, it was upon Stark and Cap Rogers to recruit new members and convince existing ones to take a moral stance in their favor. To make things even, we have Spiderman on team Ironman and Ant-Man on team Cap. Their action sequences are immense fun and Tom Holland's teenage Spider-boy is nimble, agile although quite talkative like his character in the comics. Paul Rudd's Ant-Man takes up some surprising form and plays a big role in the airport fight. This seemingly half hour-ish sequence at a German airport is certainly the film's highlight and showdown of the two teams that is regarded as Civil War. 
Apart from Vision's accidental shooting down of War Machine (Don Cheadle), the entire battle was a low-stakes, fun display of various powers with nobody packing serious punches against the other. Almost all of the superheroes leave unscathed and it leaves us wondering whether it all could've gone down with better results with them in a room with Vision dressed in his sweater vest and trousers, debating their future with the Accords. 

	The plot drags on further as Stark investigates the actual events that transpired before Cap's escape with the Winter Soldier and his findings reveal a deeper ploy by Zemo (Daniel Bruhl) to divide them even further. His revelation of the 1991 incident involving the Winter Soldier opens up traumatic wounds for Stark and it leads them into a more serious combat that breaks the trust between Cap and Ironman. The heaviness of a divided team of superheroes only bears down on us thereafter and it took the Russo brothers over 2 hours 20 minutes to convince us. 
The motivations for many of the characters remain a bit casual for them to really take sides and stand against their fellow Avengers. Scarlett deserves a Black Widow movie but she's losing the grip on her audience as Natasha doesn't have much influence over others. Black Panther's only reason for joining Ironman is to take down Bucky and Boseman is a brilliant T'Challa. Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) is just inconvenienced with all this while Falcon (Anthony Mackie) gets adventurous in his second outing with the Cap. War Machine (Cheadle) represents the Government's interests and is close enough to Stark to influence his decisions. Vision (Paul Bettany) spends the entire airport sequence trying to keep Wanda away from harming anyone and without his superhero suit, looks quite weird adorning a sweater. Spider-Man is just stoked to be called upon by Mr. Stark and Tom Holland portrays the excitement to showcase his powers and the fear of Aunt May discovering them, quite naturally. Ant-Man is just happy to be among his heroes and Paul Rudd brings the credibility of a common guy honored to be working with his heroes. But again, this theme has worked well for Marvel and shall continue to do so because the general audience prefers the levity with the action. 

	'Civil War' does less to lead up to the upcoming Infinity Wars and more to introduce new characters and reboots. In the absence of Thor, who is busy with far greater threats, the stakes aren't high enough for the Avengers right now but they do need to keep themselves in check, even if through an international panel and they must resolve their unsettled differences if they want to be the Earth's mightiest heroes.

8.588 on a scale of 1-10."
"May 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,Freakin best Marvel movie ever great story great action
"May 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Well, it was a pretty good movie.  Acting was great, action was pretty good.  But, like usual, the plot of the movie was much darker than the tone gave it credit for.  I get it, comic relief helps drown out the melancholic feeling.  And, furthermore, it's just more popular.  But this is the very reason why I have the unpopular opinion that BvS was better than Civil War.  Since both came out so close to each other, and are so similar in plot, it's hard not to compare.  Even moreso when everyone was b----ing about BvS but apparently everyone loves CW.  I enjoy that DC likes to give their movies dark tones, because it makes more sense.  If theres people on the streets who hate you because theyre putting thousands of deaths on your head, would u think it's a good time to make a joke?  Well, Marvel does.  It serves to satisfy some and leave others wanting at a Marvel movie that, for once, actually lets its characters act like their entire existence is at stake."
"May 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,La película más infantil de Marvel hasta el momento.
"May 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,boring. too long and the characters are becoming very unlikeable
"May 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I just read some of the critics reviews and saw how they took several negatives and spun them into positives. It's crazy what you can do to serve your desires for what ever reason. This irks me to no end, cos this is a movie filled with flaws and plot holes, but if we're going to gloss them over for whatever sake then I'm giving it a turd and a flush. It's an outhouse review for me! It infuriates me that a dull and boring movie needs media fanboys to elevate it to grandiose level. It's an okay movie, but watching it once is more the enough. And truth be told, if I knew what I know now about Civil War, I wouldn't have wasted my money, cos it's really for Marvel fanboys. Guardians of The Galaxy and Antman were pretty good, but the rest -- you can keep them!"
"May 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Civil War was fantastic, there was a good story to it, it was very entertaining yet also serious in parts. Tom Holland as Spider-Man was brilliant in my opinion, I just wanted to see him on screen more and more. It would definitely be in my top five Marvel movies but top three, I'm unsure about that. I'd need to see it again to make that decision. I would say it was better than Deadpool though, by quite a bit."
"May 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America civil war did had a good twist of its
story line by the end of the movie the characters seem
to fight each other when they suppose to fight off the
main villian of the movie this fight scene seems
to play off with humble rubble"
"May 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,Safe. Being a hero reaps no consequences. Even Coulson's death was trivialized by the tv series. Superheroes *bap* each other around like kittens. This formula is getting really boring.
"May 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It was somewhat entertaining, yes, but a pretty disappointing overall.  I've come to the conclusion that the more super-heros you pack into a movie, the worse it tends to be.  The antagonist just really didn't cut it for me, and bouncing around between a bunch of mediocre super-hero characters certainly didn't improve the movie."
"May 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,Thought Guardians of The Galaxy was the Best Marvel Movie ... I was WRONG !
"May 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,Great movie loved the action
"May 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,It's soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooiooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo bad!
"May 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Very good movie. Despite the action, and it's great, this is not a typical Marvel movie; it is a hard movie in that the storylines are compelling and the choices made by the group are difficult. Paul Rudd as Ant-Man and Tom Holland as Spiderman provide the right amount of comedy relief in an otherwise somber movie."
"May 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Quick review. I liked it but did not LOVE it. Definitely should see and in a 3D theater or IMAX if possible. Got a little too long for an action adventure, and the characters are getting a little too prolific to maintain a level of care about them. Not being overly critical on those two items, more of a cautionary note to the masters of the marvel universe about too much of a good thing."
"May 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,was boring and wooden.
"May 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,"First hour was drawn out too much. Same formula, getting dull."
"May 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,Definitely worth seeing in the theatre...best parts I'll just say involves a spider and an ant.
"May 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,The greatest superhero filn ever made bar none its that good!
"May 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,The best Marvel movie yet.
"May 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,"With great actors and charge of action Marvel has done again, given us an exciting movie with some comedy that doesn´t benefits at all but it has it moments"
"May 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,"La mejor película de superheroes que he visto en mi vida. Estuvo perfecta Capitan America: Civil War , todos los personajes estuvieron fantásticos, igual las escenas de acción y la trama."
"May 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Absolutely not an ""A"" movie. Someone must be manipulating this score. It was very slow at times, the Villain was weak, and the arguments for going into the ""Civil War"" were weak. Multiple people fell asleep in the theatre. Save your money and wait until it comes out for streaming."
"May 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Perfect?  Not quite. Best Captain America movie?  Debatable, after the triumph of The Winter Soldier. But this was LIGHT YEARS ahead of Age of Ultron and brought the emotional investment back into the franchise.  A good movie has you thinking well after the credits have ended and this effort managed that on many levels. Without risk and the threat of loss by the hero(es) you have nothing more than mindless entertainment fit for children. This was an adult movie with good pacing (although slow in the beginning, that built up to one of the best choreographed fight scenes ever brought to the big screen. And with two heroes (each with legitimate concerns) laying it all on the line, you can't get much better."
"May 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,"If you like non-stop action then this is the one for you. It starts off in high gear and never really lets up. Really amazing stunts and for the most part you cannot detect the CGI here.  All the actors do a good enough job, but it's the action that keeps it going. I think the only reason I'm giving this 4 instead of 5 stars is because the basic premise is a bit odd. William Hurt plays an overly officious. . .I guess a government guy, and he, and a lot of others, want to hamper the Avengers with oversight because of collateral damage. So. . .it would be better to let alien demons take over the Earth? Not sure I buy that. Like most Marvel movies this has a lot of humor in in and a new Spiderman which I questioned as being an Avenger. Seems he was in a different version, just not with these guys. But a good movie and it will keep you entertained for a couple of hours. . .stay for the credits as usual as there are additional scenes, two of them in fact."
"May 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,My favorite superhero movie ever
"May 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,"pretty good, for sequel of a sequel ..."
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,"A 2 hour, Marvel themed WWF match.

Utterly boring and with not a single visual to make the experience worth remembering.  The most disappointing Cap. America movie to date.

Complete with token appearance of new franchise star, revelations about MUMMY pivotal to character motivation, but with more exposition heavy ""I'm talking here"" scenes (OOOH watch in amazement as Tony Stark talks to Peter Parker in his bedrooms) less conflict (You didn't sign the Accords.. you're a bad man and need to be beaten up, but let's still be friends about it, K ?).   Beat for beat almost identical to Batman v Superman but with none of that film's redeeming features (the stunning visuals and genuine character motivations).

Seriously, 14 people are sadly killed while the Avengers PREVENT HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS OR EVEN MILLIONS OF DEATHS FROM A BIOLOGICAL WEAPON, and NOBODY.  BUT NOBODY, even raises the question that this might be a tragic, but acceptable and unavoidable consequence of the BAD guys forcing the Avengers to stop them.

It's not as if Stark blew up a 'burb simply as an accident during some research.

Yet B v S gets all the hate and this gets nowt but love.  Go figure."
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,"When DC gives a glimpse of Wonder Woman in B v S for developing the next solo movie, Marvel already has 2 characters in pocket, yes, introducing (1) black panther (2) brand new spider man next year. The huge casts and shaky camera in the beginning weren't that impressing. I personally preferred Age of Ultron no matter how many super heroes they recruited to the fight of civil war."
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Almost a good movie. I feel like MCU us struggling to write a definitive role for Iron Man. Depending on which movie you watch, RDJ is playing a slightly different version of the same guy with a different set of morals and personal beliefs. 

Civil war fails to deliver on the dark theme it presents by giving a loose plot for the team to fall apart. It reminds me very much of Iron Man 3 where it could have been so much better than it was. If you look at the movie as just another movie on its own, it was decent. However, Marvel's unwillingness to take their dark theme to a level that would match the human mind makes this a solid ""meh"" for me. 

If you want WWF with super heroes, this is your movie. If you want deep plots, fully hashed out themes, and creative use of the abilities of the heroes... this is not the best attempt. I have enjoyed most of the MCU movies. There are only 3 I don't own. Iron Man 3, Ant Man, and Civil War."
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,What you will expect from watching the trailer is exactly what you will get when watching the movie
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,Lots of great action. Did not care with what they did with Spiderman
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Great movie, but getting tired of these action movies crossing the 2-hour mark."
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,loved this movie. action packed and great story.
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Amazing movie, the storytelling and the entertainment and the action was nonstop throughout the movie"
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The plot of this movie progresses so slowly, as most of the film is spent with conversations between the characters, and much less of the action that the trailers where advertising. The conversations are so colorless that they eventually gets boring, and your left begging for there to be some action, and there is also a lack of humor in this film. When there is humor, you probably won't find it funny because of how bored you've got beforehand. Not to mention, some scenes in the movie feel somewhat pointless, making you beg for them to move on, and get on to some action scenes. Not to mention Spiderman has nothing to do with the film, he's just there for fan service."
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,Very good movie. I'm more Ironman than Captain America but this is a Captain America movie so it skews that way. Black Panther and Spidey made the movie for me though. Still don't know why we needed yet another Spider-Man. Garfield's Spidey was awesome.
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,The first half was slow and lacked the witty humor common with Marvel movies. I felt disappointed overall with the movie
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,Overall Very Good Movie.
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Grade:  A

Rating:  PG-13, 2 hours 26 minutes

In a Nutshell:  Congratulations, Marvel.  You successfully created another superhero film that includes humor, TONS of amazing action sequences, impressive CGI, thoughtful themes and intelligent questions, all while staying true to the comic book heroes so many love and giving them heart.

This may be declared the first summer blockbuster movie of 2016, as well as one of Marvel's best movies.  The Russo brothers seem to have rescued the Marvel Cinematic Universe.  Each of the Captain America movies has been outstanding and gets better and better.  You can see my movie review for The Winter Soldier here. 

Combine the popularity of Comic Con and other knock-off ""cons"" with the flood of superhero movies in the last decade, and what a glorious time in history it is to be a comic book nerd.


Uplifting theme: 
When to compromise and when to stand firm.
The right to choose for yourself.
Vengeance vs. justice vs. mercy
Friendship
Choices and consequences

Things I liked:
The choreography of the fight scenes was truly amazing. Critics and future filmmakers will probably use this movie as a primer for how to make great fight scenes.
I love that Stan Lee is carefully placed in each Marvel movie with a funny line.  In this film, he plays a FedEx employee who asks ""Are you Tony Stank?""  It's a cute moment.
I love Captain America.   He's so good, brave, kind, loyal, and patriotic.  What a great role model.  I love that grown men in the audience were wearing Captain America t-shirts.  Suit up! There's a scene that will make girl fans swoon all over Chris Evans when his big muscles bulge even bigger while he holds a helicopter to the ground.  (sigh)
I love small details in movies.  For example, there is a bomb blast and you see little pebbles and dust in Black Widow's hair.
There are a lot of jaw-dropping stunts.  That stunt team deserves an Oscar.
I didn't know anything about Black Panther.  His solo movie should/could be really good.  Great job Chadwick Boseman!
Spiderman was really great and provided perfect comic relief.  Tom Holland nails Peter Parker as a young kid and Tony Stark's connection to Spiderman (whom he calls ""Underoos"") adds tasty substance to the back story.  When Tony first meets him, he asks ""What are you? Spider Boy?""  When Peter declares ""I'm Spider Man"", Tony smirks ""Not in that Onesie, you're not.""  Hilarious.
The CGI is extremely impressive.  There is a really cool scene where you get to see Tony Stark as a teenager.
Lots of cool gizmos and gadgets.
Ant Man.  Awesome.  The audience cheered the minute Paul Rudd first appeared on the screen. 
I don't know Vision at all, but I have always adored the talented Paul Bettany ever since I first saw him in A Knight's Tale .
Shout-outs to Don Cheadle (James Rhodes) who is excellent in everything, Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes, the lovable Martin Freeman (Everett Ross) , and Elizabeth Olsen (Wanda Maximoff) who has gorgeous legs.
Robert Downey Jr. gives a solid performance and provides some depth to the story line.
I'm going to have to see it again just to catch all of the clever lines that are hurled at the audience so fast. For example, Tony Stark says to Captain America, ""Why are you so defensive?"" which is hilarious because Captain America's weapon is a shield.  ha ha

Things I didn't like:
It seems like a good conversation could have prevented a lot of fighting, right?
There are some scenes that utilize subtitles that young kids won't be able to understand.
There's a moment where you actually see Scarlett Johansson's stunt double's face.  Otherwise, that stunt double kicks some serious butt and is amazing.
Jeremy Renner is good, but Hawkey's character didn't grab me in this film.
You don't have to be a Marvel fan to enjoy this movie, but it definitely helps.

 

Funny lines:
""Sometimes I just want to punch you in your perfect teeth."" - Iron Man
""I don't know if you've been in a fight before, but there's usually not this much talking."" - Sam Wilson/Falcon (Anthony Mackie)

""Congratulations, Captain.  You're a criminal."" - Sam Wilson/Falcon
""So, you like cats?"" - Falcon
""What?"" - Captain America
""The dude shows up dressed like a cat and you don't have questions?"" - Falcon
""Ok, tiny dude is big now.  He's big now."" - Sam Wilson/Falcon 


Interesting lines:
""Victory at the expense of the innocents is no victory at all."" - President of Wakanda
""In our job, you save people, but sometimes that doesn't mean everyone...but you don't give up."" - Captain America

""I was wrong about you.  The whole world was wrong about you."" - Iron Man to Captain America  (It made me so sad to see those two fighting!)

""Stay down.  Final warning."" - Iron Man

""I could do this all day."" - Captain America
""He's my friend."" - Captain America
""So was I."" - Iron Man
""I should be the one to bring him in."" - Captain America
""Why?"" - Black Widow
""Because I'm the one least likely to die trying."" - Captain America
""Steve, you know what's about to happen.  Do you really want to punch your way out of this?"" - Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow

Tips for parents:   

There is a LOT of fighting, violence, and torture.
There is a bad guy with a burned face that might scare young children.
Some profanity."
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Okay, this is actually an Avengers movie. Yes, Thor is off in a different dimension and Bruce Banner/Hulk is in hiding, but pretty well everyone else is along for the ride. As they did in the last Captain America movie (Winter Soldier) directors Anthony and Joe Russo achieve an uncommon balance of plot and action along with humor and drama. The big problem with this movie is the equal emphasis on character as their are too many characters. Chris Evans (Steve Rogers/Captain America) is the star but as good as Evans was in holding our attention in Winter Soldier, its hard for him to compete with Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Anyhow, the plot has Cap and several members of the Avengers chasing Brock Rumlow (Frank Grillo) the turncoat SHIELD Agent from Winter Soldier (the character is referred to as Crossbones in the comics) to Nigeria where things go horribly wrong and their is a lot of collateral damage. Civilian casualties in superhero movies are glossed over but in this one, the consequences of their battles come back to haunt the Avengers. Tony Stark, confronted by the mother of one of these innocent bystanders and feeling depressed over a breakup with Pepper Potts (so they don't have to explain where Gwyneth Paltrow is) decided to support an international effort to bring the Avengers under United Nations control being spear-headed by U.S. Secretary of State and former U.S. Army General ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (William Hurt reprising his role from 2008's Hulk movie). Cap is opposed to this oversight, having seen SHIELD and the World Security Council undermined by Hydra in Winter Soldier and being afraid that the ""powers that be"" will ask the Avengers to intervene when they are not needed and to stand down when they are needed. Then a terrorist attack is carried out in Vienna, supposedly by Cap's old buddy from Brooklyn, James ""Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan). Pretty straight forward stuff, and of course the mysterious Zemo (Daniel Bruhl) seems to be manipulating events for his own sinister reasons that have something to do with an event in 1991 in a Soviet base in Siberia that has effectively been taken over by Hydra and a mission that the Winter Soldier carried out in the United States at the behest of his Russian Hydra taskmaster. Along for the ride are Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanov/Black Widow, Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson/Falcon, Don Cheadle as James Rhodes/War Machine, Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton/Hawkeye, Paul Bettany as the Vision, Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch and Paul Rudd as Scott Lang/Ant-Man all from previous MCU movies. You can see my quibble about their being too many characters. And they add two more: Chadwick Boseman as T'challa/Black Panther and Tom Holland as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Cap still manages to continue his relationship with Agent 13 of SHIELD, now CIA Agent Sharon Carter (Emily VanCamp) who turns out to be the great-niece of Cap's WWII love interest Peggy Carter (isn't that kind of creepy?). With Martin Freeman as Carter's boss in the CIA Everett Ross (any relationship to Secretary Ross?) and Marisa Tomei as the surprisingly hot Aunt May Parker. There is a cameo by Stan Lee but no appearance by  Sam Jackson as Colonel Nick Fury, he would have put Cap and Stark in their places and their would have been no movie."
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,"best film in the avengers saga so far. 
action packed from start to end. just perfect."
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,Funny and surprisingly involving - the best so far in the Marvel franchise
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Such a fantastic, action packed, fun movie ð???"
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,An excellent entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe.  Love the political aspects of the Captain America movies.  Cool action and SpiderMan is excellently played.  Fans of the Avenger movies will enjoy this one.
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Anthony and Joe Russo deliver another rare occurrence where the sequel is better than the original. Not only does this pick up where the winter soldier left off but where we last saw Captain America in Avengers 2. Tom Holland, Chadwick Boseman, and Paul Rudd completely steal the show. Holland gives a great performance as Peter Parker/Spider-Man."
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,Great movie to kick off the summer season.  Black Panther!!
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,Lots of action and some great one liners
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,Not close enough to comics and takes too many liberties with the characters. The conflict between captain and iron man is rather petty and unbelievable.
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Marvel always does justice to Captain America. As usual there is plenty of action, and the new heroes were pretty good. Like with most movies the villain really makes the difference, and this movie is no different. He has no powers, has a story that makes him some what sympathetic, and proceeds to get the heroes to do exactly what he wants by being smart, planning well, and knowing exactly what his end fame is. A definite recommend."
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,One of the most boring movies i ever saugh.
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,Civil Waaaaaaaaaaaar
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,As expected.. Off the chain!!!
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The world's government have become concerned about collateral damage caused by the actions of the Avengers.  They decide that they must come under UN control.  Tony Stark, Ironman, wracked by guilt over his creation of Ultron agrees. Captain America, who has had bad experiences of government control, disagrees. The superheroes line up on two opposing sides behind Stark and Rogers. A disagreement spills over into conflict after a bomb attack on the UN.

This is an above average superhero movie. It's central theme of freedom to act vs accountability is an interesting one, intelligently explored. It is a film which passes my test of whether I'm prepared to suspend disbelief and go with it - in a fantastical situation do the characters react in plausible ways? - and the answer is ""yes they do"". This is particularly poignant in the portrayal of characters conflicted in their loyalties to friends.  However, this is not a po-faced film. In common with most Marvel movies, it is a film which enjoys itself and brings the audience along for the ride. There are plenty of laughs along the way.

That said, it is too long, there is at least one fight too many involving invulnerable superheroes bashing away at each other. (Although the main set piece smack down which includes the trashing of airliners at an airport is pretty entertaining). The main problem is the plot which, like a galaxy has a huge black hole at its centre. The main villain spends the movie looking for a piece of information, but until he finds it, there is no way he can know it is worth looking for, or even that it exists.

One final point- the introduction of Spider-Man is a definite high point."
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I felt the storyline was developing smoothly up until the person behind the scenes revealed himself. The Avengers are suppose to be Super detectives, Super heroes, then a man who's mourning the death of his wife and child (blaming the super heroes who still managed to save him) springs an elaborate plot that pins the Avengers against one another. 

Character development was 5 stars. Special effects 5 stars. Spider-Man steals the show (kid is going to awesome). But one big hole in the storyline. Overall 4 stars."
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Great chapter in the Avengers. At least 30 to 40 minutes cut have been cut out and told just as an exiting story. It felt excessively long for no apparent reason. The story was still solid, providing a good introduction for Black Panther, but Spider-Man's was sla little lacking. Overall still a good movie."
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,Really good! A very interesting take on the Civil War storyline and I'm curious to how it will play it out in future movies. I encourage anyone who is a fan of comics and the MCU to see this!
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,Saw this amazing superhero flick a while back and was very impressed of how the Russo Brothers managed this large amount of characters extremely well. I did not walk out of the screening without a childish grin on my face of excitement for the upcoming Black Panther movie and Spider-Man: Homecoming. CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR - 4.5/5 STARS.
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,have to see right know
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Visually stunning film, good flow, great action, fun to see in 3D. The debuts of Black Panther and Spiderman were great, and were easily the best parts of the movie.

Despite that, the plot wasn't super strong despite the neat twist at the end. Perhaps I shouldn't have binge watched Daredevil in the same week I saw this, because the quality of that show eclipses this film in a big way. 

Regardless, I would recommend seeing this while it's still in theaters."
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Good fighting scenes, but movie as a whole was very hard to watch. Felt like a ""bridge"" movie that was made to fill in the time between the Avengers 2 and 3."
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This movie like what Critics have been calling this movie the Best Marvel film they are not joking this is one of the best movies I've seen so far in 2016. The story was great, the actors are fantastic, The CGI is amazing, the music is top notch and the fight scenes are just incredible. My favourite part about the movie was finally seeing Spiderman in Marvel Cinematic Universe his actor is awesome I love him and his suit I even love the moving eyes it's all just great and I'm happy that I've watched this movie I give it a 10 out of 10"
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,4.25. Weaves all the characters together well and functions as both an Avengers film and a Captain America film.
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,"the Panther,Vision &Blackwell Widow, is sure naff dope."
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Absolutely incredible. Everything that you think would go wrong in this movie: the large cast not getting proper screen time, the new characters, the villain, the plot.....it all works and is all fantastic. RDJ acted the hell out of this movie, but every actor did a great job, it's just if RDJ ever deserved an oscar, it would be for this movie. I look forward to the Black Panther and new Spiderman movie, given how they were introduced here. Well done!"
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,Another overrated but still fun to watch superhero movie.
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,probably my favorite Marvel movie thus far. Spooderman was a scene stealer.
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,Great but to much was given away in the trailer
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I dont usually like action hero movie but this one was pretty good, def one of my favorite marvel ones. It was basically what batman vs superman shouldve been. It built up the tension btw the two teams over time with some humor and great choreographed fight scenes. Good performances and easy plot to follow even with all the superhero cameos that melded in seamlessly with storyline. Personally i took capt americas side bc i think he was right but its easy to see both sides of this political/moral dilemma. Even the villian was thoughtfully planned out, well done yet again marvel."
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,The second best superhero movie of all time! Second on to The Avengers!!!!
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,Excellent!!! Very well done adaptation from the original storyline.
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,Lacks a compelling story.  A few funny one-liners but this isn't enough to justify all the positive reviews for this movie.  By the end after watching non-stop superhero battles we found ourselves not caring about the final outcome.
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The greatest film of the genre and perhaps marvel studios magnum opus, i just couldn't give it more stars"
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The best Marvel movie yet! A great plot, awesome action scenes and unforeseen ending twist. Two thumbs up."
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,movie is soooooooooooo good
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War = (Avengers - (Thor+Hulk)) + Black Panther + Ant Man + Spiderman

Mathematical equations apart, the anticipation for the end to the Captain America Trilogy had all of the Fanboys drooling for an exciting spectacle, with all the infighting between Team Cap and Team Iron Man raising our expectations to hopefully pan out better than the BvS mess which dropped dead on us in March 2016.
The Director duo of Russo Brothers, who charmed their way into our mind space with the TV Series ""Community"" and Captain America Winter Soldier had a massive canvas to paint and hold all these superheroes within that wrestling mat in a coherent storyline over 147 minutes. 
And deliver they did for sure and presented us two new entrants in the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) who both hold jaw-dropping potential in their own franchise movies in the near future.
First was Spiderman, in a teenage avatar played by Tom Holland who made me substitute Andrew Garfield as the best screen depiction of the Spidey. Period. This kid has the acting chops, juvenile charm, smooth talker like a teen Iron Man and the Spidey-Suit suits him like we have never seen before.
Second was Black Panther played by Chadwick Boseman, who exudes royal charisma coupled with slithery moves and that line at the end ""Let them try"" to Captain America gave me goosebumps lasting beyond my exit from the theatre.
The Airport ""altercation"" between the two teams is for me the best action set piece of all time and once it ends you have your jaw to pick up from the floor, wipe the Pepsi from your T shirt and console your kiddo for dropping the popcorn.
Scarlet Johansson as the Black Widow, alone could have been the reason for me to buy the tickets, and if someone can please share with me the email ID of Kevin Feige, the Marvel Boss, so I can send my PhD thesis ""Why the world needs a solo film of Black Widow?""
This friendship between Cap and Bucky shown in the first Captain America movie formed the bone of contention in the second one and continues to drive Cap on the tough path of conflict against his Avengers mates.
Many would say it a bit overdrawn but when there is so much happening in terms of plot and action, humour and drama, then who is complaining Meeeee Laaard?
When one of them falls to the ground from the sky with a thud, for a second or maybe two, your heart skips a beat with the fear that maybe we lost one, but did we actually did so, I shall not play spoiler sport and leave it for you to find out in your own time.
Falcon gets the coolest toy of them all in the form of the Redwing drone while Scarlet Witch is definitely the most powerful of them all, but then she got respite with the Hulk and Thor missing the game being out of town and planet respectively!
We have been hearing rumours of Jon Favreau, the Director of the first two Iron Man flicks and Robert Downey Jr hinting at the fourth foray in the Iron Man solo universe and after having seen another movie with Iron Man in it, you can be more assured than ever, Iron Man can't be played by anyone else but him. He brings the cool in ice-cool and exudes spunk from his every pore like Ali used to personify inside and outside the ring.
Smart one liners, mind-blowing set pieces, a character curve which is usually left at the door in such action flicks and sets up the playing field so well for the two part Avengers: Infinity War, which luckily for us shall be directed by the Russo brothers.
Scarlet Witch and Vision build their personas further in this instalment and you can sense that they shall have a critical role for the future, while the next Spiderman solo entry (Spiderman: The Homecoming) is the next 'Save the Date film' as we are told from the film-sites that Iron Man also plays a role in that one.
Warner Bros, take note please, as this is how you make a Superhero shootdown without shooting yourself in the foot!!"
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Other than the strange Peter Parker character and weird ""hot"" Aunt Mae it was a excellent movie... Very entertaining!"
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The movie finds the right balance between serious/grim and comedy. Civil War is probably my favorite MCU movie to date. It may not be perfect but it managed to make me forget about everything else completely for 2.5 hours and only very few movies are capable of doing that. Also, kudos to the cast - they did an amazing job with each of their characters."

"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,Great flick... The marvel formula is still alive and well.
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It pains me to write that one of the most anticipated films of the year turned into one of the most disappointing movies I've seen so far in 2016
Despite some amazing action sequences the weak plot, made weaker by the introduction of one of the blandest villains in recent superhero history, prevents this film from living up to it's earlier predecessors. Spidey was a pleasant surprise and Paul Rudd as Ant Man was equally entertaining during their 5 minute cameo... the rest is simply forgettable."
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Best Superhero movie I have seen so far!! Perfect mixture, when it has to get serious it gets to it and when we need some fun it delivers!"
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,Fantastic says it all!
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,Too much fighting where no one died. It's like a kid playing with his G.I. Joes
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,One of the best movie I ever saw
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,Standout preformances from the people who should've had it. Best comic book movie to date
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Bene ma non benissimo. Civil War riesce a introdurre e spiegarci bene alcuni personaggi, ma la trama del film è troppo banale. Tralasciando alcuni errori odiosi ed evitabili (io mi ricordavo che Spider Man avesse i sensi da ragno, non so voi...), il film serve come preludio alla prossima fase di film dell'universo Marvel, ma di per sé è mediocre. Il Soldato d'Inverno ha veramente rotto, e non ci sono nemmeno colpi di scena clamorosi, neanche alla fine. Insomma non convince, ma è un ottimo ponte. Tra l'altro alcune scelte e schieramenti che i personaggi prendono sono quanto meno dubbi, anche se devo ammettere che lo spettatore viene posto davanti a scelte morali interessanti, che è proprio la cosa che ho preferito di questa pellicola, che altrimenti avrebbe preso un 6, non il 7.5 che gli sto invece dando. Da vedere in ogni caso, anche perché resta il miglior Captain America fin ora."
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,Yaaaawwn. All action no substance. Found myself tuning out a lot.
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,Fine movie. Fun. Not great. Felt like a vehicle that got me safely from one place to the next. I liked Black Panther and Spider-Man.
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It was good, but I can't help but think of how much better Cap 3 would have been if they had kept with the Serpent Society story. I'm not a comic reader, but I say this because of how much more focused I think it would have been had it been following up on the SHIELD story, and a more fleshed out version of the Bucky arc. Civil War was still good though, with some great action, and a slightly more in depth story behind it all, when compared to the likes of the Avengers movies.
All in all, it was a very fun, enjoyable romp, which could have been improved with a little more time, but otherwise worked well on its own. A decent final chapter in the Captain America story. I could go on, but this was just a brief review."
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,That airport sequence thou????
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Amazing film.  Packed with characters and action, never dragged even with the long running time.  A departure from the actual Civil War storyline in the comics, but they dumbed it down for the general public, I get that.  This was the movie that Avengers: Age of Ultron should have been, it basically took Winter Soldier (which was also excellent) and upped the ante.  I give it the highest possible rating."
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Clearly, Black Panther and Spiderman made their statements here. Great way to introduce the former; great way to re-introduce the latter. (Ms. Tomei as Aunt May still looks hot in her 50's.) ;D"
"May 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Very good movie. Good action sequences, Nice little twist 5 stars"
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"it was cool for what it was. the tones were all over the place, but it was NOTHING like the comics. i guess i just had way higher expectations knowing how the comic played out. ill give it to Marvel though, they know how to please the masses and critics."
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Genial,muy buena,muy entretenida,recomendable 8/10"
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,This Movie is a Bad Ass!
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,awesome awesome awesome has a bit choppy CGI in the beginning but otherwise awesome
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,3d not worth it. plot line was wack and about everyone's parents. Best part was spider man's 5 minutes of fame. save your money.
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,Too long and boring! The shaky camera work in the action scenes made me feel nauseous.
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Why do I keep letting myself get talked into watching these overblown, over-the-top, indestructible cartoons played by live actors? 
There is no real sense of suspense or interest, when everybody has super-duper magic powers and you know no one is going to die.
Comic books come to life are just not very interesting to me anymore.
They are getting as boring to me as zombies and vampires.  Blah. :/"
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America Civil War happens to lack the ""war"" thing, becoming a tedious series of unnecessary subplots too big for its own premise, and a journey that led nowhere, and won't have a major impact on future Marvel films. Basically, a skippable story."
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"So i can say with a happy smile on my face that this was just as good as i thought it was going to be maybe even better and im so happy about that.

I loved how they did the new characters like Spider-man and Black Panther. I would even say that this is my favorite version of Spider-man yet. Black panther i thought was done perfectly and this gets me really pumped for his solo movie along with Spider-mans. Even Ant-Man had his moments in this.

The only really thing i think was pointless until the end was Baron Zemo. But other then that i would say that this is near perfect.

Oh and did i mention SPIDER-MAN YET? He's soo good and im so ready for his solo movie. Even Ant-Man had his moments in this.

So Overall i would rate 9/10 Just what i wanted and even more.

*After 2nd Viewing*

Still just as good as the first time I saw it. Black Panther still might be my favorite character in the MCU (besides Spider-Man)"
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"THIS is what a superhero movie should be like. Without a shadow of a doubt, the best superhero movie I've seen."
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,Awesome! Black Panther stole the show. Can't wait to see that movie!!
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The Spider-Man scenes are a little out of place as they are forced to spend time introducing him into the MCU, and thereby distracting from the primary story.  Otherwise, Civil War is an all-around entertaining film on par with the Winter's Soldier or first Avengers. At two and a half hours, the movie moves along quickly enough to not seem to run too long.  20 more minutes of superhero on superhero action and one might get a little bored with it, but the film manages to cut it off at just the right point."
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Overlong, overstuffed, all around just not as good as the first Avengers movie. About on par with the second one, I guess. Captain America's motivations are all out of character. Same with Iron Man. Scarlet Witch is grating. The dialogue all around is cheesy and fakey and strained. The whole ""civil war"" between Avengers has no stakes because most of the opposing characters are still friends with each other and appear to be just play fighting for no reason. Everyone looks old. You know it's bad when Hawkeye is the most charismatic one. In particular Vision is awkward because he's some kind of celestial being who presumably could wipe everyone out in an instant but he lollygags around pretending to fight. For some reason. 

New Spiderman is good. Ant man was pretty good. 

All in all this is maybe something you rent when it's in the $1 bin, but it's not worth seeing in theaters."
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,Amazing Movie. Best one yet
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,I love this movie it was and always will be amazing.ð'ð?»ð'ð?»ð'?ð?»ð'?ð?»
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The action is pretty constant, which is fine.  My head hurts a little bit but it was kind of worth it.  It makes me excited for this next phase of the MCU."
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,It's okay... ?!?! I don't know. I never felt like conflict was truly afoot.
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Civil War really is something to marvel over (pun intended). Beautiful visual eye-candy, fantastic script, and some of the best acting a Marvel film has seen in a while. Tom Holland most definitely steals the show as a revamped version of the web slinging Spidey. The film really breathes life into the seemingly never ending superhero fad of the 21st Century. Spunky, charismatic, intense, and sometimes quite somber, Captain America: Civil War is a VERY worthy entry in Marvel's repertoire."
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,Absolutely Amazing Movie. One of the best Marvel movies so far. Loved it!
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,amazing got right to the point and not to long
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,There were some really great scenes but there was a great deal more movie than there was story.
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This is largely the movie I wished Avengers 2 could have been, and I honestly felt the writers of this movie completely schooled Wheedon on how it should be done.  Forget armies of faceless mooks, it's the first time we really see a large-scale fight between multiple unique individuals, and while quite fun and very well handled even that paled to the final reveal and encounter, which was both poignant and cognitively disconcerting.  Probably the best part of the film is that, unlike the actual comics, you can see where both characters are coming from and they aren't presented as unreasonable.  Cap's troubles in Winter Soldier instilled a massive distrust with governing agencies in general and he is of course very invested in his former friend, whereas Tony's decisions are quite sympathetic given the emotional relief from handing the moral responsibilities associated with recent Avengers outing onto a world government structure.  Collateral damage is a hard thing to live with, and even if not the fault of the defenders (it's the villains who initiate one must blame), one is always left wondering if things could have been different.  And then of course you have the Winter Soldier issue itself, and how accountable you feel he should be held for past deeds (which arguably becomes one of the main issues of the film).  Would you hold the mentally afflicted accountable for actions performed when not cognizant?  What if the issue was deeply personal?  Neither issue is hardline-addressed, as morality is not black-and-white, so all uncertainties are left as is as each character pursues what they feel is the right option, whether it is or isn't, and it all flows quite well.

I was also notably surprised with how well Black Panther was integrated into the movie, as I really expected him to be a shoe-horned cameo but instead found a fairly decent origin story tied into the film's flesh.  And Spiderman was probably one of the most comic-like portrayals in every instance he appeared in suit, even if I'm a little infringed by Iron Man's rather deep involvement with the character (he's also really young, which I think I may just have to get used to).  I even liked Zimo, as I feel that it's rare that a Marvel movie presents a villain that can actually catch me off-guard but I didn't really expect Zimo's plan at all, and its resolution resounded very well in the moment of first viewing. 

If I had to fault the movie, it would probably be the sheer, ridiculous over-the-top action that breaks even what flexible suspension of disbelief I still have in this franchise.  When I see people jumping down five stories and then breaking into a sprint like nothing's wrong I'm left rolling my eyes, but when War Machine falls from the sky and impacts the ground in a crater?  No, he doesn't get back up from that, that was worse than when Tony did it in Iron Man 1 in the cave-suit, which was also completely ludicrous.   Sometimes these movies ask us to swallow an awful lot, I think, and that's saying something in any movie where a guy can shrink to the size of a bug and still communicate with others like nothing's different (the better left unsaid in that regard the better...)."
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Solid Marvel outing. Definitely better than that piece of garbage Age of Ultron. I would say this is my third favorite Marvel movie, behind Gaurdian and Cap 2. I'm still back and forth on Zemo being the villain here, but there was a lot to like in this movie. The fight scenes were good. Spider-Man was also added into the movie tactically but he was so charming you didn't mind it. Black Panther was also bad ass. A lot of fun stuff from Ant-Man. Overall fun experience. Russo Brothers are probably the best thing to happen to the Marvel Universe since Robert Downey Jr. Good concept, Good execution."
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Mieux que ce à quoi je m'attendais. C'est bien sûr un blockbuster pop-corn, mais ça demeure encore une fois bien fait et ce n'est pas trop con. Pas de gros méchant intergalactique qui fait tout exploser à la fin, ça fait du bien de voir ça."
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,Really good movie. Compelling and thought provoking since its dealing with a more shades of grey area realization. Awesome movie my second favorite Marvel movie behind Captain America's The Winter Soldier! A must see!
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I went into it with high expectations. It's had some great reviews and I think I know why. INSTANT GRATIFICATION. 

It is a standard marvel movie, some good comedy (Spider-Man is true to the comics), but apart from that it falls pretty badly. I can't see how people don't mention it moves from place to place just like batman v superman but for even less of a reason. The storyline is so bad. I mean the reason that it all happens down to the final battle at the end is so stupid. Especially as the villain is all angry about one thing and doesn't care how many people he kills to achieve his goal which must be the reason he is acting like the villain.

The fight scenes are good as expected but it's the same old story because it has so many plot holes, it's hard to see beyond these. I think it's done well because we are a society that in general wants everything 10 minutes ago. We don't wait for stories to be developed. Until that changes, this wagon will continue."
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"While watching Civil War, I couldn't help but think of DC / Warner Bros.'s desperate failures to catch up with Marvel's unstoppable success, specifically the recent disaster Batman v. Superman. Both films are about allies finding themselves on opposing sides, only Marvel actually succeeds on every level DC fails. Where BvS botched everything from the basic setup (why are these guys so angry with each other?) to nearly everything else that followed, Civil War soars with nuanced clarity: allegiances will fall / form, friendships will break / build, and summer entertainment will be had.
Civil War finds tentpole-heroes Captain America and Iron Man at odds, each coming to grips with their power and position on the global scale on starkly different sides. Neither side is clearly right-or-wrong. Instead, we are presented with a familiar world, in which ""good-and-evil"" are not black-and-white, but largely grey. Even the de facto villain, one of the better in the MCU, finds sympathy through his heartbreaking and understandable motivations.
These disparate sides are each so nuanced and logical, I found my loyalty swinging back-and-forth like Peter Parker at an air show. Speaking of which, Holland's turn as the webbed-crusader is easily the greatest in cinema: young, witty, wiry, and wide-eyed. Our first view of him is a standout, even while placed within the larger context of the marquee ""airport battle"", maybe the greatest superhero melee ever.
The Russos, who have taken Whedon's place as go-to directors for Marvel, have such a strong control of humor, story, character, and action, they've even managed to better their fantastic Winter Soldier here. With them at the helm, any assemblage of Avengers is one to anticipate."
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,It had no real plot.  The villian in this movie was some normal guy who caused a split in the Avengers who should have had his tail whooped and the movie would have been over .  Waste of time.
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Another knock out of the park from Team Marvel... Taking one of the most polarizing story lines from the comics and not only making it work, but making you actually care! Unlike the comic version, this Civil War fits perfectly into the already established MCU and also carries enough emotional weight that no matter which side you are rooting for, you understand where they are coming from- See DC, you can have heroes fighting and have it make sense, be fun, and make money!

But in all seriousness, a great follow up to both Winter Soldier and Age of Ultron, and makes me look forward even more to whats coming next, especially Black Panther."
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Action, humor, plot twists, well written story or whatever you expect, Marvel pays you the complete package on this one!!"
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,Amazing marvel movie so far
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It does what it says on the tin, and well.
I think if you particularly follow this genre (as opposed to being a parent accompanying someone who really is into it!) you would probably give it four or five stars..."
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Who was the arch evil villain worthy of our loathing and spurning all the action?  Most of the fighting was the good guys duking it out.  Did not buy Tony Stark getting all moist about his parents and that driving his anger.  If not for some fresh air breathed into the action from Ant Man and Spidey, this would have been a most stale experience    Most memorable moment was the cameo--What does that say?    Marvel flicks all blending together"
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"it was decent, but that was to be expected. looking forward to future Marvel movies."
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,9/10 Easily the best non-Xmen Marvel film. Controversial statement - I liked Batman V Superman just as much ;D
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,Great story w action so outrageous I caught myself laughing out loud
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"A remarkable achievement in transcending the super hero genre with a sublayer of big and current themes in diplomacy, psychology and concequences of war. Well written, good character development and amazing action sequences. The perfect summer movie."
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"First off, Happy Astronomy day. 
Second, I saw captain america: Civil War last night.
I was actually more impressed with Batman VS Superman. It was almost the same plot, actually.
It wasn't bad.
Don't mistake my posting. 
There were some interesting choices made in this film.
I love how Captain America has stepped up his game as far as displaying his strength, durability, and I would have sided with him.
The Spider Man injection was en par with what I would have expected, and gotta love seeing Marissa Tormei.
And I still think Vision is way too human too quickly.
Overall, I just was not blown away.
At first I would think it's because I'm more mature now (older), but Star Wars blew me away, so....?

Captain America: Civil War is definitely worth a trip to the movies. But I can not consider this a high wow factor."
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Its the first time i am writing a review for a movie , cant be a better pick to start off with . Captain America : Civil War , is definitely one of the hardest scripts to tackle and pull it off with such grace and impeccable narration. The pace of the movie evolves and spreads out at a very positive rate . You don't see it being sluggish at any point nor does it blow out of the roof without reason. Of course, the movie has those insane moments that live up to the hype and of course the effort put into making them. My only little concern with the movie was the initial screen time of Vision , it just felt the script or his character was out of place on his initial scenes and they did not really bring it up how the rest of the characters were played or moreover put into the movie plot. Apart from that that the script , direction, character personalities and of course the action sequences do make it a worthy Phase 3 kick off for MCU. Doesn't matter if you are a marvel fan or not there is something in it for everyone to enjoy.

Cheers"
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,Marvel has done it again!
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Went to the shows last night, and though I had seen some negative reviews, a lot were positive 5 star ratings. I figured it's an action superhero movie with Captain America, so I went with my family. Well, it's an Avengers feature and it's 2 1/2 hours long, and it's anything but a masterpiece. I saw BvS and I enjoyed Batman. He was a badass. There were no expectations when I went to the cheap showings, but for Avengers (it was an Avengers movie) there was high expectations. The kids were so so about it, and the wife and I hated it. We were soooo disappointed. Maybe I should of read more reviews, cos I agree with a lot of the negative reviews. Definitely not a great movie. Two thumbs down."
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,Good flick and Black Panther was done well.  Hulk's absence was a bummer.  Fight scenes were well done as usual.  Not feeling Vision at all.  Dude is weird!
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,The only flaw i found was how the handled Baron Zemo. Everything else was diamond perfect
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"this movie is way too long , the story was horrible and not clear , vision trying to be funny was a desaster, the fake love story between scarlet witch and him was horrible. The explication of Zemo arrive too far in the movie . Aunt may was sexy wtf , spidey lose vs falcon WTF X2 . agent carter die and poof 2 second later captain love another one . I can do this all day ;) 
 the only good point of the movie was Iron man who seems more mature and the last fight scene"
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,Marvel universe expands with this latest outing. A moral tale of who decides who when and where our heroes should act echoing the real world actions of super powers rather than super heroes. Who do you choose Cap who believes in freedom to act or Stark who believes in a controlling body to make those choices ?
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Everything about this movie was great. Great character development, acting, fight scenes, plotline. really enjoyed it. way better than that other civil war-ish movie"
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,LOVE THIS MOVIE !!!??????????Cool movie!!!????????????????????
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Must say even as a DC mega fan, Marvel's Civil War was freaking off the chain. The script was actually better written than the comic series that I was a huge fan of so that was great to see. The only small, nitpicking criticism I can give it is that it seems to have absolutely no consequences for all of the events that happen during it. Nobody gets killed or even life threateningly injured and even the relationships that are damaged are easily fixed and forgiven before the end of the movie. Still this doesn't really seem to bring down the spirit of the movie but does take away any real seriousness to it."
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,Great movie and portrayed the comics perfectly! Best superhero movie ever!
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,Not my favorite genre. Wife and son would probably give it 4 stars.
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America Civil War is the thirteenth film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, with a screenplay by Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely. 
In Captain America: Civil War, disagreement over international oversight of the Avengers fractures them into opposing factions - one led by Steve Rogers and the other by Tony Stark.
Civil War is definitely one of the best Marvel movies to date, and absolutely on par with The Winter Soldier which was also great. They are both on top in the Marvel Cinematic Movies ranking of mine so far. The conflict between these well beloved characters is done in a brilliant and fantastic way by the amazing Russo brothers who took the cheese out of the first Captain America movie , made one serious and great second movie, and build upon them both with the third outing. 
Everyone does a great job here, Chris Evans has made Captain America his own same as Robert Downey Jr for Iron Man. It features a very big ensemble cast and not one of them is anything less than great on the role. The fight scenes are also some of the best ever made in a comic book movie, even better than in The Winter Soldier. Especially the airport scene is just mesmerizing and totally stands out from everything else that's going on. Spider-Man is also unbelievably well done and Tom Holland is just fantastic. I am one of the few people who actually loved The Amazing Spider Man movies, and really got mad to hear that they are going to reboot the character again but I can see now that it was worth it. The visuals are great from beginning to end, the music is also good as usual. The villain is something that most people though it was the weakest point but I strongly disagree with that. He had reasoning as to why he is doing those things, and he pushes the other characters in new directions which is also necessary. 
I generally adored this movie, and even though I am a DC fan, there's just no denying that Marvel knows what they're doing and that is why they are much more successful right now."
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Action/Adventure from the gate. You will not doze off in this one for sure as there is plenty of visuals to engage you. I liked the special effects, did not care for the story line so much as it was based on the world rejecting the Avengers protection based on the collateral damage they cause. I was not exactly buying the premise of the good guys battling each other because of a disagreement. Seems like a shallow argument for such a rift. More like Family squabbles among Super Heroes instead of Civil War. Also the introduction of Spider-Man was a bit contrived. Worth the watch if you are a Marvel Fan, but still yearning for the next."
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,Captain America is very marvelous and wonderfully crafted. It is executed very well.
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,awesome from beginning to end! Only wished Hulk made an appearance!
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I was a big fan of the first Avengers, but a little less so when it came to the second. The big reason why I note this in a discussion of Civil War is that, if I am being honest, Civil War might as well have been categorized as a third Avengers. Now, for me this brings up a few interesting notes when it comes to my feelings about this film, the first being that Civil War is not just an amazing movie, it is likely everything that the second Avengers wanted to be (or should have been).  

The other side of this discussion then is how it fits with my feelings of Captain America: Winter Soldier, which happens to be one of my favourite super hero films. What I loved about Winter Soldier is how it married the political thriller with the super hero motif. It was serious and complex, but oh so fun and thrilling. Given it's Avengers type ensemble/cast, Civil War is less complex, but not necessarily in a bad way. It is a super hero film (first) with some interesting political/social/personal dynamics layered in. In this sense it moves away from the feel of Winter Soldier, which is not so much a negative as it is a reality. But at the same time it 

Don't get me wrong, I understand why they fit this film under the Captain America line of films, as it does purpose to push the Captain America story forward. It simply has a larger goal as well, which is to position itself as a jumping off point for Marvel/Disney to move in some different directions. Probably the greatest compliment I could pay the film is that for as much as the film is intentionally positioned, I don't think there was any point in the 2 and a half hour running time that I felt like anything was forced (even the appearance of Spiderman, which has little to nothing to do with the story itself, was so well done that it feels like it belongs). 

Thematically the film makes for some really interesting discussion. While there are some grand fight sequences that pit a ton of characters against each other, the emotional core sits in the relationship between Iron Man and Captain America. What the whole concept of the civil war does so well is ensure that both sides feel like they have equally valid points. Not to give anything away, but the film does a super job at setting up the viewer to really empathize with both sides, which is an emotional investment that comes to fruition in the final third of the film. When the film begins to bring us in on what is really going on underneath the emotions, it makes the rest of the film that much more meaningful. 

With all of that said, I think Spiderman deserves another note here. I knew nothing about the casting going in to the film, but suffice to say that the big change here is the casting of a younger Spiderman. I am a Toby Mcguire guy, and have nothing but great things to say about Raimi's Spiderman. But I have to admit, there is something in this kid that just feels inspired (and thankfully removed from Garfield's far more serious take on the webbed crusader). It just works, and I think a big part of why it feels fresh is their decision to go younger (while also bypassing the origin story) and far more innocent. I think his presence in the film helps to bring balance to what is actually a very serious discussion, and the way they position him with Tony Stark (as the older, wiser father figure) was a smart decision that is rewarding in the end. 

A note on the new addition as well (Chadwick Boseman). I found this character really interesting. We get just enough of him to want to know more, which is fitting in that his story will be getting the stand alone treatment in a coming film. There is a certain urgency to his story that begs to be fleshed out a bit more, as everything that motivates him to become the Black Panther remains somewhat conflicted and untended. It will be interesting to see how he develops down the road. 

Again, Civil War is a really good film. If one sees it as another Avengers instalment, it is different and unique enough to set itself apart from the fun romp of the first. It is focused and disciplined enough to set itself apart from the (over achieving) second. If one sees it as a Captain America film, it travels a different path and a different tone than Winter Soldier, but carries enough of it's emotional and political complexity in to the ensemble cast to make it all work together in a meaningful way. The film's two and a half hours don't feel long or stretched out, and the big fight scenes are just fun (hello Paul Rudd), entertaining, humorous and important enough to be memorable. And lastly, for as much as the film is intended to prepare us for the multiple different streams of stand alone films to follow, Civil War is far more than just filler. It manages to fit nicely along side any of the previous films that have before it, and that is a testament to the strength of the Marvel on-screen universe."
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,This was the perfect set up for The Black Panther.
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Awesome! All the right mixes of comedy, action, and drama. Loved every minute!"
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,a bit on the trump side of political theater.  a sort of might-makes-right
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Surprisingly amazing. Less Captain America (phew), more Avengers (good thing). Great to see Ant-Man again, and the the new addition of Black Panther is very strong."
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Good solid movie as expected of Marvel but it was underwhelming considering all the hype. Good action scenes and decent plot but poor CGI and a very undeveloped and trashy villain pretty much faceless and useless. Lost its novelty halfway through the movie as things got a bit too predictable and this is something Marvel has to fix. Scared of killing off major characters or even recurring ones and the ""happpy ending"" where Cap goes off with his merry band is silly and feels unsatisfying and unresolved."
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Action packed throughout, although I missed Thor and Hulk's bantering."
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,Great movie nonstop action very intense lots of violence.
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,Had to be one of the best Marvel movies ever that's why I only gave it four and a half stars because I'm sure the third Avengers movie will probably be the best ever so I'm waiting to give it five stars.
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This movie is probably Marvel's best movie to date, the movie is faithful to the comics to a good enough degree. The plot is relatable to modern times issue of security versus freedom as well as how easy it is to destroy friendships over disagreements almost to the point of murder. This movie also showcases an impressive revision of Spider-Man and a new addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe The Black Panther. 20 Century Fox can learn a lot from this movie."
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I am a big fan of Marvel, that's why I hate to say Civil War is not satisfying enough. First, the idea of Civil War itself is not what I expected before. Second, the story did not develop very prettily I still do not understand why they exactly need to be in the ""Civil War""? And third, unexpectedly, is the CGI. Come on, Marvel Studio still has bad and rough CGI scenes? For example, the Spiderman's suit and the storm Iron Man flew into.

Overall, this movie is very entertaining and it's a huge step for another superheroes to get into the franchise. Can't wait to see Black Widow solo movie though :))"
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"4*

This almost makes up for Avengers: Age of Ultron. Almost.

Unlike Joss Whedon the Russo's seem to understand these characters and make them more relatable."
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Apart from 1 or 2 fight scenes, all fight scenes were unrealistic and impossible. I didn't liked it at all. waste of money"
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Many mistake the fact that Marvel Studios makes this look easy to under-appreciate the the mammoth task of balancing so many characters throughout a two and a half hour affair, and managing to be true to every last one. Character motivations and interactions are handled deftly and with an intimacy that speaks to a true understanding of the source material.

The writing is superb and aware, and the execution by those in front of and behind the cameras is on point. Marvel is killing it."
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,One of the best Superhero films out this year. Wildly entertaining fights scenes and interesting plot.
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,This is easily one of the most well-executed films that successfully balances an incredibly large cast of characters while still giving them each their time to shine and each have their motivation fleshed out.
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,I would give it 10 stars if I could.
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Great movie with awesome acting, action, comedy and heart."
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"An action packed battle, but was it worth it? I think not."
"May 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Such a good movie, thank you Disney/marvel"
"May 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,The perfect comic book movie. 5/5.
"May 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I did not care for the plot at all. Also, the fighting was not realistic. I understand these guys are ""super"" heroes but, no one could survive what happened to some of them during the fight sequences.  All in all very disappointing movie. I felt like this was thrown together with some ""A"" list actors to make money but, not much thought given to the plot. You can only have so many fight scenes before it gets really boring."
"May 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The first time I saw Captain America Civil War I can honestly admit I wasn't head over heals about it. I found it quite long and not compelling. The plot seemed to try to be dark and intense. However it didn't seem to work for me the first time. However the second time I watched it I changed my mind, I found the movie more entertaining and the story more compelling. The end took a dark twist. Which was very startling. There was a great setup of why there is an internal choral between characters. I saw both views and they were both displayed well. I really like the new Spider-Man. And there were a lot of great scenes. All in all the movie was very entertaining. However it wasn't mind blowing awesome like most say. It was fun to watch, however it still had the marvel formula. I would give it a 69%"
"May 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,omg.. thee best movie out !!
"May 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,Overall and EXCELLENT movie ... for anyone that doesn't know anything about the real plot line.  If you know the real plot it's a fairly big disappointment.  I thoroughly enjoyed the movie had my damn bladder had not co-operated with me tonight.
"May 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,10/10 Bring on Phase Three!!!
"May 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,amazing in ever way possible
"May 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"super fun, generally. creative fighting. plot holes, you know. but I kinda just enjoy this aesthetic. themes touched upon, though I thought the iron man side of the argument was underdeveloped. would have loved to see his point of view in action. love the characters, great performances overall. don't love it, but I want to watch again for the ride."
"May 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"What raises Captain America Civilian to War above other action movies are the real emotions involved.   Bravo especially to Chris Evans, Sebastian Stan, and Robert Downey Jr., as well as the writers and directors, for taking Marvel to a next level.  Heroes versus villains has been done a million times.  This is heroes verses heroes and it is heartbreaking."
"May 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War was an Amazing film!! really an outstanding movie!! 
enjoyed every second and minute of it."
"May 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"To be exact I probably say this is a 4.5/5.

This movie works on so many levels. It is so amazing and is a great follow up from Captain America: The Winter Solder. There are so many great and amazing moments in this film and they all work and it doesn't fill to crammed in. The Russo Brothers have done what Joss Whedon was unable to do in Age of Ultron which is find a way to connect all these MCU movies in a way that makes sense.

The movie starts off with all of this political drama that is going on in what are some of the most emotional scenes I have ever seen in my life. There all so interesting and they work on so many levels. The film makes you almost want to well up in tears at times with just how good it is.

I will admit it does going on a little too long, but it still keeps you invested and makes you want to no more and learn about these characters, and how they are feeling.

This movie also makes Iron Man 3 relevant again. Something I thought Ultron would do but didn't. In the film we get this broken down Tony Stark who is wounded and hurt so much by what had happened previously. He has lost Pepper now and finds himself alone without anyone else. He is more angry now and more unhinged because he created Ultron who almost destroyed the world.

This movie makes you understand why Iron Man has chosen to take the side of the people and protect them by locking the avengers up.

However it also lets you see Captain America's side who is against the government because he seen the corruption within them after Hydra had taken over. You also see that he desires to protect Bucky who he loves dearly.

Both have there reasons and you get that and you really don't want them to fight and it makes you feel so sad when they do.

The standout stars were great.

Black Panther had a full arc here. He started on one path and ends on another. It is amazing and makes a full circle that is interesting and compelling. Chadwick Boseman also gives off a great performance and accent as well that makes it even better. I really liked that Black Panther didn't tell any jokes or quips. He didn't care he was all business.

Spider Man was also great too. This is the Spider Man I wanted since I watched Spectacular Spider Man in the 90s as a kid. He is young, a kid and not so overly hot make actor. He is just the nerdy Peter Parker and I like that.

Scarlet Witch and Vison's relationship was also great. I liked the humor there.

I also liked Black Widow who gave her all.

Really just all the Avengers did well in this film.

This film does a good job mixing its humor with its serious moments. One never over takes the other. It all works in many ways. There is a really good mix of everything her that I really had enjoyed.

The film does have some bad.

Baron Zemo I didn't mind him.. I liked him more than Lex Luthor in BvS, but he wasn't needed. When I went into this film I was going in ready to hate Baron Zemo. Why do these films need a villain. You already have heroes v heroes why do you need some really bad villain to be in it. That being said for the plot of the movie it worked and it worked it spades. The film manages to use the destruction caused by the Avengers to be the crux of why this guy is here and is willing to tear up the Avengers.

I also really didn't like the big giant title cards when they changed locations. I thought it was really strange. Just have little words geez.

Anyway that is my review of this film. I really enjoyed it. I thought it worked in all cylinders."
"May 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Civil War was just baffling in its incompetence, both as a film and as a service to comic book fans."
"May 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,Captain America: Civil War has blowed me away. Action in the beginning to the end and with some humor. One of best superhero movie so far. Marvel has once again done it again.
"May 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,And the best part of it all was Thanos was nowhere in my After Credit scenes.
"May 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Marvel does it again with another fun action movie that's not quite as good as The Winter Soldier, but still a blast."
"May 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,Much better than the last Avengers movie.
"May 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,Absolutely amazing. The Scarlet Witch is officially my favorite character after watching. Best superhero movie ever made in my opinion.
"May 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"If it wasn't for the case my tickets were free, I would feel I also wasted money. It was excessive in length, boring, excessive use of shaky cam to the point of almost nausea inducing. I would probably say it was acceptable for an at home movie but nothing more."
"May 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,The greatest juggling act in the history of super hero films.
"May 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Tony Stark's unyielding position on not breaking rules goes against his personality as THE rule breaker. And to be so adamant to want to fight his comrades was not believable. Fight scenes were good, but that was about it. The discord among the group seemed like a distraction, and while they were all fighting each other, you were waiting for it to be over and to get to the main point of the story, which ended in more fighting each other to a pulp. It was a big let down."
"May 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,Darker than previous Marvel movies but still awesome. Only drawback... missed any of the previous Marvel related movie...you will end up missing a huge chunk of the storyline...so catch up before you head out to see it.
"May 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Bit of a slog. Far too long. Spiderman just checked in for the heck of it. Enjoyed Cap , antman and black panther. Didnt find the villiain very interesting at all. Step down from winter soldier"
"May 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"De Marvel Comics, 'Captain America: Civil War' nos trae el enfrentamiento entre dos grupos de superhéroes, cuando aparece un fuerte conflicto de intereses entre quienes deciden someterse a las leyes y organizaciones internacionales, liderados por Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), War Machine ( James Rhodes) Tom Holland (Spiderman) Vision ( Paul Bettany) y Black Panther vs. el grupo liderado por el Capitán América (Crhis Evans), Winter Soldier (Sebastin Stan), Falcon ( Anthony Mackie), Ojo de Halcón ( Jeremy Renner),  Bruja Escarlata ( Scarlett Olsen) y el Hombre Hormiga ( Paul Rudd). La división se da cuando el segundo grupo cree en la incriminación de Winter Soldier como fachada para cubrir algo mayor que puede generar, para variar la destrucción del mundo. Conflicto y amistad son los ejes centrales de la película y, aunque pareciera que se repite el enfrentamiento de Batman vs Superman, la resolución del mismo es mucho más compleja y realista que 'mi mamá también se llama Martha'. Mucho uso de humor y de desarrollo complejo a más de la espectacularidad de efectos que tiene"
"May 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Aka Avengers 2.5, Aka Iron Man 4. Either way, I regard this as one of the top Marvel movies behind Winter Soldier and Guardians of the Galaxy. It gets its characters, motivations, and theme correct. Some action scenes can be a bit cheesy, but in a fun way. Go see this."
"May 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,Dissatisfied on movie to many
"May 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,Vengeance that's it. It's the whole story but it's still a great movie.
"May 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,Check out my review on my website: http://harrigansmovietvblog.wix.com/harrigansmovietvblog#!Captain-America-Civil-War-Review/c1aod/572b89c50cf2803377ca3c3f
"May 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Better than the average marvel movie, but quite frankly it's the same recipe, the ingredients are just mixed in a different order."
"May 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I hated it! Preferred the two previous Avengers movies, though they didn't compare with Guardians, Dark Knight, or Deadpool.  Can't recommend it."
"May 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The Avengers 3, uh, I mean, Captain America 3 was pretty good."
"May 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America is a thrilling action movie with a surprisingly complex and interesting story. We see all the avengers and a couple of newcomers having to choose between ""free but illegal super hero"" or ""supervised but legal super hero"". This creates a rift between them and results in some amazingly spectacular fights. Slowly it becomes clear a plot twist is in the making and at the end it delivers. The action and CGI are great, but not really that special anymore, because we have all seen countless marvel universe movies. So it begins to wear out a little. But nonetheless a great movie, definitely worth watching. But all credit goes out to the surprising story that is for once not about saving the world. Let's hope the next marvel movies can keep this good thing going, cause there will probably be a lot of them."
"May 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,Simply the film that Dawn Of Justice should have been.
"May 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best Marvel movie yet!
"May 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,Excellent movie. Awesome action scenes and acting. The airport battle was probably the best battle scene I've seen. Spiderman and Ant-Man really stole the show. Awesome.
"May 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Nobody wanted to love this movie more than me, and it's an unenviable position being a huge Marvel fan and having to admit that I didn't really care for this movie.  My list of grievances is long, but the main takeaway is that, while this was a fine movie in its own right, it isn't Civil War.  There are barely any similarities to the comic event which can be considered either devastating or fantastic depending how you felt about it.  I feel most people watching this won't have read the comics and thus won't care about how it stacks up against them, and for those people this will be a great movie because they had no real expectations about the movie's content in relation to the source material.  Those of us who DID read the comics and liked them I suspect will be pretty disappointed across the board.  Now for my specific gripes (spoilers will most likely result).  I realize this is Captain America's movie, and a Winter Soldier sequel in specific (I loved Winter Soldier) but it felt like most of the other characters didn't really need to be there or didn't do enough to justify showing up.  It felt a lot like Expendables for me in this regard.  Big hype with a dream lineup of heavy hitters on board then half of them don't end up doing anything.  My beloved Vision spent half of his screen time rocking a sweater vest trying to keep Scarlet Witch under house arrest, then when he finally got some action screen time all he accomplished was TKing a teammate.  Agent 13 and Crossbones didn't need to be in this movie at all since they did nothing of value  and were actually detrimental in a couple ways.  Crossbones was COMPLETELY wasted since he was only in 1 unnecessary scene (see my gripe on the catalyst event later) and they've apparently killed him off.  Agent 13 did nothing but steal one of Cap's most famous speeches and wasted it in another screen time hogging scene that didn't need to be including and added nothing.  Crossbones and Agent 13 didn't need to be in the movie to begin with (aside from potentially deliberate misdirection) since the assassination of Cap plot and The Confession weren't included.  The catalyst event for registration was stupid (10 dignitaries getting blown up?  That sort of thing happens all the time IRL.  In the comics it was 600 children getting vaporized which was way better justification.  Why not use Hulk/Iron Man in AoU trashing half of a city? Would have made way more sense and eaten up a lot less time getting to the good stuff),  Baron Zemo was super lame as the big bad puppeteer, though I suppose they're building him up for future use.  The scene with Iron Man analyzing Cap's fighting style was botched and defeated its own purpose.  Both post credit scenes were dumb (I was especially disappointed by the Stan Lee cameo in this one).  The list of gripes goes on and on.  All that being said, the action scenes were great if too few and far between.  Ant Man and Spider-Man stole the show in my opinion for what little time they were around.  In conclusion I'd give it 3 stars which I consider generous for how little I enjoyed it overall.  Great movie in its own right, but they should have called it something else and dropped the pretension to it being Civil War.  Unavoidable comparisons to the supposed source material ruined this one for me."
"May 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,Sucks. Boring. Dumb. Disney. Wack.
"May 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The latest mission by the superheroes on the Avengers results in the deaths of numerous civilians and a diplomatic nightmare with the African nation of Wakanda. A new set of regulations ratified by 118 countries seeks to put superheroes under tighter review and scrutiny, but only half of the Avengers want to comply. Captain America (Chris Evans) opposes the measure and finds himself an outlaw once a bitter terrorist uses this controversy to frame Cap's brainwashed friend (Sebastian Stan) for the assassination of Wakanda's king. Captain America: Civil War has the sly banter and the impressive set pieces that are now expected of Marvel movies, but it also has some strong character moments that the cast sells with utter conviction. Popcorn blockbusters don't usually have this much depth in them."
"May 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,Everyone loved it. It was pretty cool. A lot of filler between action scenes.
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,The Best of any of the marvel movies. Great twists to keep you guessing. I'm going to see it again!
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"To be honest, I am rounding up significantly because I really did not want to see this movie. (I was ""taken"" by a family member who wanted to see the movie.  And ended up being the one who paid.  For IMAX.).  I am not in this movie's wheelhouse.  I am not a Marvelacolyte looking to squee over unneeded characters squeezed into the movie for a bloated fight scene whose bright, joke-filled tone seemed in jarring contrast to the more somber tone the rest of the movie seemed to be going for.  (Hey, Parker, I know you're technically a minor and, since you didn't sign the Accords either, you're not TECHNICALLY supposed to be here, but WANNA GO PUT YOUR LIFE ON THE LINE AGAINST TRAINED KILLERS?  You can fight Hawkeye!.. who has a wife, kids, a pair of unused waterskis, and no reason whatsoever to back Cap over Iron Man.  And, Ant-man, you're here too!.... Apparently... For some reason.)  I found the CGI cartoonish.  The contrivance of Tony Stark putting together a giant multimedia floorshow/ school play about one of the most painful experiences in his life for a roomful of strangers hung my suspension of disbelief out to dry. (Although, the likeness of young Downey was rather spectacular.)  When it all came echoing back because his beloved parents were actually killed  transporting Super-Winter-Soldier-Serum in their trunk, which everybody seemed to have known about it in advance of the reveal except those directly impacted by the event, I think I sprained a muscle rolling my eyes.  The Black Panther's suit looked ridiculous, especially when he popped out his little kitten claws.  In the end, we again had another completely lame duck villain, this time who seemed to want to avenge his family by instigating a slap fight between those he blamed for their deaths despite claiming the country in which they lived and died had been doomed long before the Avengers came to town. And he needed to go to that bunker and shoot the Winter Solder Squadron because... reasons...  Would have been too interesting to see them actually fight at some point in the future, maybe?  There is no true loss or consequences in the end (Rhodey suffered an unbroken free-fall from the sky, and is probably DEAD!... well, paralyzed... okay, he fell... once... because he wasn't paying attention... and then walked away making jokes about a courier mispronouncing Tony's last name.  Meanwhile Bucky is frozen, again, and the Avengers are split up, again.  Only this time they're shuffled differently so we have the Secret Avengers instead of the New Avengers).  Vision wears a cape that looks like Great-Aunt Irma's thrift store brocade curtains.  Wanda is sorry for hurting him (because the comics say they must be in love), but makes no mention of missing her dead brother.  Cap is now in love with a different, blonder Agent Carter since the other one died (and the comics say that they are).  And scene.  The end. Cut.  Print. Same old, same old Disney-Marvel movie."
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I'll start out by saying the story is great. Dealing with the backlash of saving millions but killing many in the process as well divides the team up on what they should do regarding the Sakovia Accords. Everyone did an amazing. From Chris Evans to the most miniscule characters, awesome. For me, Black Panther, Ant-Man and Spider-man stole the show. 2 scenes particularly with Ant-Man that are iconic in comics. Tom Holland is just the perfect Peter Parker. The perfect blend of kid genius and witty comeback kid. Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa was just lights out. Amazing. What is holding me back from giving it a perfect score is their usage of one of my favorite Cap America villains, Crossbones. They could have done so much more with him, and they didn't. That left me pretty disappointed. Otherwise, stellar"
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Yup, this is as good as a superhero movie can be! Not only is there terrific action, but there's also a great storyline and good character development. I thought the graphic novel's story was terrible, so I was a little apprehensive about this. But Marvel came through!"
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The plot was a little silly and seemed like something conjured up by a Saturday morning cartoon villain. Still, chop off 30 minutes of nonsense and it would have been a much better film."
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,Well made superhero movie but ending as always fairly predictable. The movie settled for happy ending rather than darker ending similar to the well written original books. Its' obvious producers are thinking of sequels down the road and not artistic achievement.  I myself am getting tire of these predictable and formula  movies.
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"A must see. Funny, action pact movie of the month."
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,Probably the best superhero film to date.
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,what i expected but nothing more.felt alittle long tho
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"What an entertaining movie. Although not technically an avengers film this is a film that is several marvel movies in the making. While not a direct adaptation of its comic book counterpart, CA: Civil War provides one hell of a ride. The movie is filled with not only fantastic action but also great character moments including the introduction of two new characters (Spider-Man and Black Panther). Although new characters are introduced and the film does have a few different storylines the incredible directing of the Russo brothers manages to keep it all in check. Never once did I feel that one storyline overshadowed another or that a character felt shoehorned into the movie. In the end the movie could have done a little better with adding more consequences but ultimately it never takes away from the film or the enjoyment I had watching. It was a thrilling way to cap off (pun intended) the Captain America franchise. See the film immediately, hell see it twice."
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,fantastic. action packed. entertaining.
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Marvel knocks it out of the park once again in this third Captain America film that feels more like an Avengers film minus a few key members (Thor and Hulk). The stakes aren't as high as you may like and some of the fights feel more like a scrimmage, but the final 25-30 minutes alone are masterful. Robert Downey Jr may be the show-stealer here, even though this is technically Cap's movie. The new additions in Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and the best Spider-Man we've had yet (Tom Holland) work really well with the guys we've seen in previous films. They do a good job in walking the line between Iron Man and Captain America's opinion in the way that you don't really know who is in the right here. It's not until the end that you realize who was right. This really isn't a set-up movie for more to come, but instead it leaves you wanting more in a good way. Anticipating the next movie."
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR REVIEW: ""SUPERHERO PERFECTION!""

Captain 'Fucking' America.  

They managed to take a Captain America movie and not only make it the best Marvel movie ever, but hands down the most perfect, emotional and visually stunning superhero movie to date.

[Before I go in to the nitty gritty shit, I will be avoiding any correlation to Batman v. Superman, because in all honesty, Marvel in general are on a completely different level than BvS.]

Let's start with NO spoilers!

This movie not only did justice to Captain America himself, but was able to give every single character an arc and service each and everyone of their stories and character moments.

The movies' writing was top notch, well balanced and deeply moving, but also had heart.  I think writers, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, deserve so much credit for taking all of these moving parts; characters, story beats, humour, seriousness and telling a thought provoking and engaging next chapter in the MCU. They bloody killed it on the writers floor.

Joe and Anthony Russo (directors of Winter Soldier and the future Infinity War two-parter) absolutely nailed this one too. They brought everything that worked in Winter Soldier and took it to the next fucking level. These two beautiful men were able to capture the essence of this politcal struggle on such a personal level that no other superhero director has been able to do before [No, not even Chris Nolan's Batman trilogy.] There are literally a ton of moments in the theatre where I'm like, ""holy fuck, these guys seriously need to be put in check."" They nailed such a distinct tone and self awareness that I don't think any superhero film or even action film in general has ever been able to do. This makes me that more pumped to see them take on a space epic like Avengers: Infinity War.

With that said, this story couldn't have done it with the amazing cast. It is so hard to choose a leading contender. I would say the highlight goes to Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chadwick Boseman and Tom Holland. Any scene they were in had me deeply captivated by their sheer emotion and vigour (RDJ & Boseman) as well as heart and humour (Evans & Holland respectively.) I found myself on Team Iron Man when the movie started but ended up on team no one because of how well each actor delivered the weight and depth of their character. I found myself deeply moved by Tony Stark in this movie. Usually I found his ego funny and bothersome at times, but in this movie there were times I literally wanted to fucking bawl my eyes out for what this man was going through. He is seriously a fucking mess, and Robert Downey Jr. absolutely slays Tony Stark in this state.

The action is beyond bloody perfect. No doubt the best action I have ever seen in cinema history. I would go as far as saying, some of the coolest fucking shit I have ever seen in my entire life...

So that is my extreme spoiler free section. Now I'll go point form as to all the details that really stood out to me and made this such a fucking beautiful piece of superhero cinema (If you haven't seen the movie, close this page and comeback when you have!)

-SPOILERS ALERT-
+ The opening fight scene with the New Avengers is so dope. It has that exciting action energy we got in the opening of Cap 2. This opening sequence however, was a lot more badass and definitely set the bar for the rest of the movie.

+I love how the Scarlet Witch was centre stage in this movie. She causes a massive fatality in Lagos by throwing a bomb holding Crossbones that was about to kill cap into a building. She is such an integral part in the spark of the Civil War.

+Seeing what Tony has been up to since the end of AoU was neat. That simulation of him when he was in his 20's was so cool.

+Tony had so many good emotional beats. Anytime he got emotional, I got misty eyed man. You could tell he felt so guilty about all of the collateral damage and that the Sokovia Accords were the only way he felt he could atone.

+I fucking ate up all of the scenes where the Avengers were sitting around a discussing the Accords. I think this cast plays well off each other. It is such a treat to watch the Accords intervene in their relationship and cause some tension.

+Vision dressed like a boss.

+Vision and Wanda kitchen scene was an awesome fucking treat. I love their dynamic and think it is such an interesting relationship that is tested once the fighting starts.

+BLACK FUCKING PANTHER. Not just that but T'Challa is such an amazing character to watch on screen. Anytime Chadwick Boseman is on screen, I get more captivated and enticed by stellar, genuine and emotional acting. As for Black Panther, damn is he tearing shit up like a total G. That chase scene literally had me holding my breath.

+I was so interested in the scenes with Zemo and the Winter Soldier flashbacks. It felt like a mystery was brewing and I just wanted to know how this all tied in. It was perfectly paced and sprinkled into the movie.

+Watching Cap decide to not sign the Accords was so hard to watch. In the best way possible. I was sitting in my seat wanting all the Avengers to sign and get a long. But I knew that wouldn't happen. It's Civil Fucking War man. To see Tony want Cap to sign so badly, and to see Steve just on the total opposite side, looking out for Bucky and Wanda's interest made such an organic rift between them.

+Talking about being organic, I thought each character was truly organic when it came to their development. No character said something they would never say, and each of them reacted to the Sokovia Accords the way they should. It was so awesome to see such a realistic approach to this storyline and that each character was serviced with such love and care.

+Peggy Carter funeral was emotional as fuck.

+Sharon Carter and Cap's kiss...FINALLY!

+The typical bro nods from Bucky and Sam was priceless!

+The humour in general in this movie was fucking top notch. I felt like it was not forced and too in your face like Age of Ultron. The Russos and the writers did such a good job of making sure the humour never overshadowed the seriousness of the situation. Characters made jokes as the situation allowed them.

+The minute Scott Lang came on screen and fanboyed over everyone was amazing. I love Paul Rudd in this role, and he adds such an awesome humour to the team.

+I absolutely loved when Vision had Wanda imprisoned and Hawkeye came to save her. When Wanda used her powers to force Vision into the ground, damn was that such a powerful scene!

+PETER PARKER, SPIDER-MAN, QUEENS, TONY STARK VISITING, SEXY AUNT MAY, PETER AND TONY TALK, SPIDER-SUIT, WEBS, NO BACKSTORY, TOM HOLLAND KILLING IT WITH THE AWKWARDNESS, HE IS BEING RECRUITED, SPIDER-MAN TIES UP CAP, SPIDER-MAN INTERACTS WITH EVERYONE, KICKS FALCON & WINTER SOLDIER'S ASS, BATTLES GIANT-MAN, EMPIRE STRIKES BACK REFERENCE, CAP AND SPIDER-MAN FIGHT, SPIDER-MAN QUIPPS. SPIDER-MAN IS FUCKING EVERYTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

+Honestly, Spider-Man needs another point. They absolutely created the definitive on-screen Spider-Man. Holland is perfect. The tone is perfect. His involvement in the big fight scene is fucking creamy as shit. I love everything about him. Kevin Feige is a God for making this happen. I'm super stoked for Spider-Man: Homecoming.

+This brings us to the big airport scene. That scene was probably the greatest thing I have ever put my eyes onto. Best action scene ever. It was so perfect. The music was on point. Every character got their moment to shine. I literally can't believe a scene like that was put on screen. The best part about it, is that this action scene is not just a static fight placed in the movie. It is a scene that drives the plot forward. Everything the Russo brothers do in this movie is never meaningless, it is all for the story's sake. I also loved that after 12 movies of development, this amazing scene was so well earned. Every single character had a reason and burning motivation to be in this fight. They weren't fighting for the sake of it. I have never seen any writer or director craft such a beautiful sequence that was so badass to watch yet had so much heart.

+Giant-Man...holy fuck, Giant-Man

+Rhodes emotional crash to the ground. I thought is more emotional that he was paralyzed, then actually died.

+I like how it was Vision's fault. Vision had such powerful development in this movie. He is struggling with his feelings he never knew he could have.

+I like how Black Widow let Cap and Bucky escape by fending off Black Panther. Usually I'm not a huge fan of Black Widow, but she killed it in this movie. I liked her dynamic with the Black Panther.

+ Cap & Bucky scout out Zemo.

+Tony decides to go rogue and help Cap & Bucky when he realizes Bucky was set up the whole time.

+Seeing Team Cap in jail was hard. I loved when Clint told off Tony. That was definitely Hawkeyes crowning moment in the entire MCU.

+It was so relieving to see Tony and Cap get a long for such a short period of time.

+ It finally pays off to see Zemo's scheme the whole time and his motivation. It was refreshing that he had some major development as a villain.

+The Winter Soldier killing Tony's parents reveal was fucking stellar. Just when you think this movie can't pull out any more tricks, they throw in this twist.

+The reveal was apart of Zemo's entire plan to get the two Avengers' leaders to rip each other apart. This fight was so fucking emotional. You could see Iron Man who just didn't even care anymore. Cap was trying his hardest to defend Bucky, because he knew Tony would kill him. This kind of emotion mixed in with an epic fight scene, made for such an awesome climax. It was perfect right until the moment cap puts his shield into Tony's chest reactor.

+When Tony tells him the shield does not belong to him...damn that was some emotional stuff. Robert Downey Jr. got some really gut wrenching lines. My stomach dropped when he said, ""I don't care, he killed my mom."" Fuck.

+Black Panther preventing Zemo from killing himself was such a poetic moment. It's so epic that T'Challa would rather him stay alive and suffer, then be dead and freed. Good writing.

+Stan Lee cameo awesome as always.

+Cap trying to make amends with Tony through a letter and giving him the option to reach out to his team was cool. You can tell that Tony is still unsure and that the events that transpired in this movie really impacted the Avengers and their relationships with each other.

+The two after credits scene were great. Seeing Black Panther and Spider-Man's story being teased even more was such a great way to end off this amazing motion picture.

+As a side note, I thought the style in the movie was so awesome. The full screen typography when introducing a location just added such a stylistic touch. The cinematography was unparallel to any Marvel movie I've ever seen.

VERDICT:

Captain America: Civil War really hit home. The action, the humour, the story, the characters, the stakes and the emotion was pitch perfect. The additions of Spider-Man and Black Panther made this movie even more stellar. Not only does this work as an entry to the larger MCU, but as a movie in general. This is easily the best MCU movie to date and arguably the best superhero movie there is.

"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"With effective depth and entertaining action sequences, Captain America: Civil War is another exciting chapter into both the Captain America franchise and the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe.

B+"
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This one of those films that you're sitting after it finishes and wondering, ""This doesn't have wall to wall action-there's too much talking-shouldn't I hate it?""  Then I remember this is Captain America and the Russo brothers and wish we could clone them so they could do almost every Marvel film.

 Like Winter Soldier, they have the right mix of action, humor, and drama. I should be disappointed on how they portray Zemo-he's not flashy, he's not a raging egomaniac. I kept expecting this til the very end of the film, yet I wasn't angry when it didn't happen. Much like Redford's character in Winter Soldier, he's alot more cerebral than your typical comic book villain.

 Now that Feige has full control on the direction of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I'm really curious on the new directors for Thor, Dr. Strange, and Black Panther. And I have no doubt that the Russo brothers will handle the Infinity War just fine"
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,same formula from all the marvel movies. Do something different marvel.

"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Like all movies, Civil War has it's flaws. However, the editing and flow of the film were both very strong.  The standouts of the film were Ant-Man, Black Panther, and yes...   even Spidey was an added bonus to the third installment into the Captain America franchise.  I look forward to seeing where the MCU goes after this wild and exciting roller coaster of a film."
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"captain civil war is la mejor pelicula del universo cinematografico de marvel por que la historia esta muy bien planteada , mantienen la esencia del comic , todas las secuencias de accion estan perfectas , humor preciso en la pelicula , introduccion adecuada y la mejor de los nuevos personajes , la interpretacion de los actores es muy buena , el unico pero es el villano ya que decepciona donde no tiene argumentos solidos para serlo."
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"the Russo brothers have, once again, proven to be capable of making an incredibly entertaining comic book film, despite not having the rights to certain important characters (the fantastic four in particular)."

"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It turned out to be more than watching Marvel mastur... well, let's call it self -gratify (after all, this is a public site) onscreen. [More on UrbanRhetoricBlog] BY FAR, the highlight of this movie is the newly anticipated stand alone Black Panther film. Chadwick Boseman (who has played Jackie Robinson in 42, James Brown in Get On Up, and Thurgood Marshall in the upcoming biopic Marshall) was excellent as Black Panther. From what I remember about the Black Panther character, he was a real bad ass.  He had toys like Tony Stark and the finances to match, he had skills like Captain America, but he wasn't genetically enhanced; he's just naturally superior. [More on UrbanRhetoricBlog]"

"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This is not a horrible flick, but it is, at times, a snooze fest. Don't take your kids to see Civil War. They'll drive you crazy with their whining and, ""When is it over mom!"""

"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,well first of all the movie wasnt called cw the name is bucky war personally i liked the movie but not enough like the winter soldier it was like playground and hiding the reason for the war was nothing only bucky a bromance war  about captain america clearing the name of his bestfriend just boring anyway the things that i loved was spidey black panther black widow scarlet witch they was amazing the end lso was very good  i see for a first time an angry emotional tny stark i really wanted to kick ass of captain america or bucky they were assholes also tony stark was asshole but that men both was much assholes so the conclusion from myreview about cw is that cw is very overrated film not  great film i hope on infinite wars to not bethanos like ultron or zemo
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"So much fun! I love the acting, action, story, characters...just top notch film making here."
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I understand fans going ga-ga goo-goo over this latest Avengers movie, because they love the characters, but I believe it's worse then the last one. It was lacking something. Maybe it was just some of the same old stuff.  The one-liners kept taking me out of the moment, and the fighting style was the same with all of the characters, and the CGI was pretty bad. It was kinda disappointing. It's doing great at the box office, so I guess it's all good. I can't recommend Civil War though, so it's a no for me."
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Some of the fight scenes are awesome and one is the best ever in a Marvel film. But there is a very long, boring build up before you even get to a fight and the parts in between fights are for the most part lacking any tension or drama. Weak, convoluted plot that doesn't pay off. The direction is very drab, like most Marvel films seem to be these days."
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Great movie, I would watch it again"
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I loved Captain America Cvil War because its a movie that complety obliterates the opinion I had about this movies, that sequels in thse movie are totally bad. In all Marvel movies I only liked  the singular one like AntMan and Guardians of Ggalaxy and the new spider man ones and the last of x men. This movie proves that we can still enjoy a good blockbuster with a serious tone. Besides the ridiculous title, Captain America Civil War has great action, including the best action scene i saw in hero movies, a good plot, good humor, a good smart vilian and opens the door to more movies like these. looking forward for the next chapter. Civil war his by far the best movie with thse two charaters , the cap and iron man. Recoommended indeed.  Forget the 3D, doesnt gives nothig new."
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This is the latest installment of the Marvel/Disney franchise. The script is well written and allows the movie to keep the audience engaged as it twists and turns and you slowly see all the dots connect. This is all done while you experience yet further character development that builds off the last couple movies. As usual you'll see further Marvel characters introduced into the plot and of course there are the spectacular action scenes. Spoiler alert, it doesn't have the same level of action of previous movies but you're not likely to care."
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,just simply awesome!!!!
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Marvel ya tiene hecha la formula del exito y esta no es la excepcion, Spiderman de lo mejor, DC deberia aprenderles algo"

"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Amazing! It's full of action, has great characters and can be funny at the same time have a good dramatic weight."
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,the best marvel movie i have seen yet
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"(SPOILERS AHOY). I did not have a lot of hope for this movie. I'm beginning to get a bit jaded by super hero films. Well not just beginning. But this film was quite a bit better than the usual fare. Frankly, I'm getting bored of hearing about some really powerful thing that some really buy guy (always guy) wants and how the good guys are going to stop him and if not the world will essentially die. So it was great in this movie that the fate of the world didn't hang at all in the balance. It was also nice to see a superhero movie with a fight between people who didn't have the exact same powers (worst offenders for this were ant-man and deadpool).

I have a few gripes but nothing major. My main gripe is that the conflict seems a little forced. I mean, okay Iron Man meets a woman pissed off at the events in Sokovia. But does that mean you end up firing lethal weaponry at your friends? Even if you know your friends might be a bit less vulnerable to them. Seems unlikely the avengers would *actually* go to war over this. 

But overall I enjoyed it, and was genuinely surprised when we saw the other winter soldiers and what had happened. Generally good stuff."
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Too, too, too much love..."
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Top notch, and gonna be hard to beat."
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,Can't wait to see this one!  Superhero movies are the best! Test review for FB.
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,Incredible movie with a compelling storyline.
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"So when they promised us superheroes fighting one another over some differences...I was ecstatic. I am not really a HUGE fan of superhero movies, I tend to watch only for the villains. However, this movie had me rooting for the heroes. Well, the less annoying ones. I found the film very entertaining, the action sequences were there, even though I don't care for the whole shaky camera work especially in 3D (dizzy party). I was still in awe of the stunt work. I loved the infamous airport scene and every character, every hero fit perfectly into place there. The humor is there, the action, the story (slight flaws) but I was invested. It was the one...can I say Avengers film? the one movie where it had a serious tone, it didn't feel cartoonish or animated and it felt like the real deal with how things were settled and how actions have dire circumstances. Yes, I did find the whole bromance annoying maybe Captain America has a secret love interest in Bucky cause no way was all this worth it right? I think for him it was more than just the government taking over it was his love for a friend and at that point, it had me back and forth between the annoying team of IronMan and the stubborn team of Cap. Now for the main villain, I am soo glad they didn't give him a gimmick or some lame costume. He did what most villains have failed to do and I hope they continue with his character. I needed a little better backstory but still just nitpicking here with the villain. Well, I'm sure ya'll seen it already and have read 100s of reviews already so this was just me dipping into the pool."
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War
Initial Reaction: Who is North and who is South?

Main Characters
	Captain America/Steve Rogers, Iron Man/Tony Stark: Two of the heroes of the Marvel Universe.  They are played by Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr.

Plot Summary
	When an attack on foreign soil goes wrong, it's just another example of how destructive super hero fights can become.  Along with massive destruction in New York City (as in the first Avengers film), Washington DC (Captain America: Winter Soldier) and a foreign land (Avengers: Age of Ultron), its clear citizens are scared of superheroes because there's nobody to hold them accountable for their actions.
	So when a new law is brought up, the Avengers are split on if they want to sign up.  Leading the pro group is Iron Man and leading the other side is Captain America.
	However, the rift between the two sides grows as more violent acts occur all over the world.  And the questions arise about a bombing at a UN building - just who is responsible for that?

SCORING
Main Characters
	These two a great as the two leaders who butt heads against one another.  They maybe friends, but that friendship may not last very long.  SCORE: 10

Supporting Cast
	The other heroes of the film are great because each one brings about something new and different - a new viewpoint of the world or just some levity (something ""Batman Vs. Superman"" needed in the worst way.  SCORE: 9

Plot
	The film sometimes drags on because new law has to be explained in great detail.  But the action sequences more than make up for this.  There's one fifteen to twenty minute sequence at an airport that's the best I've seen in a long time - if ever.  SCORE: 9

Originality
	Sure, this film feels like another Avengers film, but this one deals with more divisive issues - and it makes the ""heroes"" more well rounded and human than most other non-Marvel superhero films.  SCORE: 8

Violence Factor
	This film has great fights between the heroes, but it does take the time to show what could go wrong when there's massive amount of destruction due to those superhero fights (something that's rarely addressed in these types of films.)  SCORE: 9

Other Moral Issues
	This film does a great job of bringing forth a controversial subject - and providing both sides of the issue.  There's no easy fix - or easy way out of this mess.  SCORE: 9

Final Score (out of 60): 54			% Score: 90%
Marvel: the Pixar of action flicks.  By that I mean they almost always make great action movies (I'm intentionally ignoring the last Fantastic Four film)."
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,To long and over rated kiddie crap. ( Ant man and Spiderman ? really ) Bat v Sup : Dawn of Justice Better and more for Adults.
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,Probably the best marvel movie to date
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,A little long but nonetheless an amazing movie with enough action and a great storyline and also Scarlett Johansson. ;-)
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,mas de lo mismo que decepción
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"obviously, the film's a lot of fun.  it's a nice cap (pun intended) to the trilogy in that it combines some of the heart of the first (in this case the pain of a rift between friends) with the brains of the second (here the moral quandary of power and governance).  downey delivers as usual and the members of the supporting cast shine unexpectedly (especially the new spider-man that i wanted to keep at arms length yet won me over in capturing the childlike wonder and awkwardness that has made peter parker so enduring) but I found evan's rodgers, who is supposed to be the principle character, unconvincing and emotionally one-dimensional."
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Marvel's apology for Whedon's atrocious Age of Ultron, and their best movie to date."
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,Looking forward to the next one!
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,intrigue like no other Marvel film.  some of the best 3D ever. storyline is twisting like a tornado. together these make the film a must see.
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Loved the set up and pay offs from the beginning scenes or previous movies. the jokes made me laugh, it was a fun movie but also hit the mark on the emotional parts. I Like that this villain wasn't just crazy, there was a reason for what he did."
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,Fast paced and entertaining comicbook action. A perfect entry in the MCU.
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I am a big ""Tom Hanks"" fan, but found this movie to be very disappointing. The movie seemed to drag on and then they did a hurry-up ending which left you wondering.....what was the point??"
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,great movie. Action meets great writing.
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,Decent dialogue with over-the-top action makes for a good super hero movie. Elements of the story were questionable and the inclusion of Spider-Man seemed out of place.
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,Same ole same ole. Weak story. I guess if you like the same old tired fight scenes then this movie is for you. I was bored out of my mind.
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,WAY better than Batman v Superman!! Not as good as Winter Soldier IMO but still a decent Marvel movie that I'm looking f'ward to owning.
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Ambitious but rewarding and entertaining as well as smart and engaging, Captain America Civil War is an unforgettably spectacular cinematic bonanza that is as epic as it is emotionally and narratively sublime."
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Bad guys win, government oversight is good, Cap ends up a criminal on the run. Very disappointing movie to me. I am a loyal comic book geek and love all super hero movies, but with all the unlikely plot lines I would not rate this one highly."
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I guess I'm the only one that was somewhat bored with this movie. We kept jumping cities and they made Spider-Man, a child genius, into an idiot kid. Only two scenes jump out in y mind.. The airport and the final fight. Otherwise, I will forget the whole thing in another hour."
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,Like all Marvel movies they hit it Spot on again. It's funny with A LOT of action and good story !!!
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The Captain America Marvel movies just seem to get better and better! This installment has almost every one of the Avengers except for Thor and the Hulk. All the actors give marvelous performances reprising their superhero roles but it's Chris Evans(America) and Robert Downey Jr.(Iron Man) who hold the film together as they argue and fight over who is right and who is wrong. Even though it's team Captain America vs team Iron Man, this film has one of the most entertaining fight scenes in movies I've ever seen particularly scenes with Tom Holland(Spider-Man) and Paul Rudd(Ant-Man). These two give hilarious performances during their fight scenes that just cracks you up. The film story line is well written, but it's also very dark. It hurts when you see best friends fight each other, but they'll get through it. Overall I believe  this one of the best Marvel movies ever made. Be sure to sit through the credits cause there's two endings to the film you should watch. This is the summer Blockbuster movie of 2016! My grade=93%(A)."
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It was ok, but probably my least favorite avengers movie. Slow start, lots going on, hard to follow. Some humor."
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Yes I did it! I actually laughed twice! I was also amazed by the motorcycle chase trick and the Iron Man movie 'magic'. When you have Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), War Machine (Don Cheadle), Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), Spider-Man (Tom Holland), Vision (Paul Bettany), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), each with a super power you know there will be a lot of battles and there are each given a chance to show off their 'specialty'!

There are so many superheroes that mere human beings like Maria Tomei has nothing more than a cameo while John Slattery, Alfre Woodard and Hope Davis get a few minutes more and Emily VanCamp might even have 10 minutes on screen total with Oscar Winner William Hurt actually seems to be a major character in the movie bit that may only be because he is part of the reason there is a civil war with the superheroes divided into opposing camps.

Between the heroes and, oh yes, a few villains, plus the huge cast, the fights, chases, buildings tumbling, glass shattering, special effects, it is no wonder the film takes 2 hours and 30 minutes.

To me the standouts were Robert Downey, Jr., who can do no wrong on film, Chadwick Boseman making a great impression and Anthony Mackie who may have done a lot of work in front of a green screen but is flawless. I am a fan of Emily VanCamp and Paul Rudd as Ant-Man always gets a smile out of me.

I feel I have given Marvel comic book characters and that ilk a fair chance but aside from ""Ant-Man""and ""Deadpool"" I can do without them. Liking, even laughing, maybe about 20 minutes out of a 150 minutes of a film really isn't a recommendation."
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,Only good part was spiderman. I was constantly bored until the last half hour of the movie. Tried to pack in too many superheros into one movie
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War is a solid addition to the MCU. There is a good mix of entertaining action, and complex political issues that creates a good atmosphere."
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,I've always felt Don Cheadle was a terrible casting mistake but this time around he's less annoying.  The new additions are well worth their screen time.  Overall a great film.
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,flawless movie if i had one complaint i it could have been 3 and 1/2 hours long i left wanting more and cant wait until the next big marvel movie
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I'm puzzled at the high praise. It doesn't compare to Guardians, Deadpool, Antman, or the Dark Knight trilogy. What gives? If you're a fan, go watch it.  If you're not a fan, forget it! It's a below average movie. Sorry guys the truth is the truth."
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,They should've called it captain America v iron man.    It was hardly a civil war. Just saying
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It sucked, heroes had no motivation at all"
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,I love you Marvel!!!
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"After watching Avengers: Age of Ultron, I thought no other Marvel movie was ever going to top what I felt when I watch Avengers for the first time and this movie DID IT. This movie is amazingly spectacularly.... AWESOME!!!!"
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The moral core of this film makes it, for me, the best of the Marvel films to date."
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"If it looks like the Avengers movie, smells like the Avengers movie, quacks like the Avengers movie...It's probably the Avengers movie. Marvel's latest installment in their shared cinematic universe shares an awful lot cinematically with their previous movies but now with new DLC. How many times can you watch the same obviously scripted dialogue and CGI demolition smash fest before you start wanting more? Was it a fun movie? Of course it was. It was also fun when I saw it on screen for the first time in 2012 and again in 2015. 
Daniel Brühl steals the spotlight though as the best Marvel villain since Tom Hiddleston's Loki. Excited for more of him, Spiderman and Black Panther too of course."
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Brief review of the movie:

The ups: Spiderman (good choice and aunt may is hot), black panther (kick ass) and Black Widow (just because is Scarlett Johansson).

The downs: The bromance between the Capt and WS is just way too much. Tony Stark looks old and jealousy takes over him. Main fighting scene is good but its not like they are REALLY trying to hurt each other so it just meaningless. Then there is the end, I believe in the comic book after is over the avengers don't get together for some time. In the movie well it only takes a letter with some sweet words and a phone to forget what just happened.

So with this said, it a ""rent-it-watch-it-in-your-couch kinda movie""."
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"A billion and a half dollar blockbuster! Yeah Marvel. Include my 100.00 plus I spent with my family attending last nights Civil War. An average movie that no one particularly enjoyed. Not that it was horrible, but the hype and love dished out for this movie is not warranted! I feel bamboozled, because of that  half a star! Two thumbs down."
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Entertaining and with a very strong third act, but some characters are poorly rendered and the ideological conflict is almost nonexistent. Is more a sequel of the Winter Soldier storyline than an adaptation of Civil War (in any capacity). Not bad, but smoewhat a missed chance. Zemo's plot is tremendously incoherent."
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War's Emotional Level Matches With It's Intense Action Scenes, Excellent Writing And Great Sense Of Humor."
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Me gustó mucho, pero no tiene nada, NADA que ver con el comic Civil War. Es más un ""Winter soldier 2"". Igual no tengo quejas, es entretenida, tiene acción, tiene chistes, TIENE AL CAP, y tiene a RDJ que es de lo mejor que le pasó a las películas de Marvel. Pero igual, #TeamCap
El traje de Black Panther está muy bueno (?)"
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Action was incredible and easy to follow unlike other shakey action films, hilarious, and fantastic storyline. Must see"
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,Absolutely amazing. So many Marvel characters. One of Marvel's best movies ever.
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,I have watched all of the Marvel movies now up to Civil War.  Saw this movie the other night and loved it. I also read the comic book and it's interesting to see the differences and similarities between the books and the Hollywood storyline.
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Airport scene is just for fan appeal. The other parts of the movie is moving human drama and character interaction. There are major spoilers here, and they are so effective that it pushes Civil War into cinematic depth no other MCU film manages to achieve. It made Iron man vs Cap fight because of true reason unlike BvS, and at the end the audience will root for both sides instead of one, GUARANTEED. It proves that a good villain doesn't need superpowers. It proves that epic action scenes don't need to cost citizens lifes. Spiderman shines so brightly it made other characters inferior and the action sequences fast-paced and excellently shot. I know ppl love to see multiple heroes fight each other, and that's probably what hinders the movie technical quality since that's what makes it popular. But nevertheless, civil war is Marvel's best effort to date."
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Marvel doesn't disappoint. Really, really good."
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This was a very good movie, the sequels are dead on from the previous movies and the addition of the new characters was just phenomenal. Also, who ever did/does the casting is a true visionary."

"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"this is the best superhero movie to date with all these heroes. this films just has enough screen time for each character and the story is amazing.
Grade: A+ 
Percentage: 97%"
"May 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I didn't see the other Captain 'merica films, but it was still easy to get into this. The fight scenes were fantastic except for the fact that it's a given that these main characters can't get killed. I found myself wishing for a potential GoT-plot twist.

There are so many frickin potential ships  in the universe, it's INSANE. I don't know who to root for, but here are a few: Black Panther/Black Widow, Captain America/Black Widow, Captain America/Scarlet Witch, Captain America/Sharon Carter, Ultron/Scarlet Witch. Basically if they had one conversation with eye contact, the thought ""Could they...?"" crossed my mind. 

Also, I think I finally have come to appreciate Chris Evans' biceps. Wowza."
"May 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,"After watching it, I realize it is actually not that bad. More entertaining than I expected."
"May 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I seriously DO NOT understand how this got such high rating, this movie is piece of crap same batman vs superman, that seriously wrong behaviour among avenger team and how they came to splitting is so bad and unrealistic its insane... Hey dude is brainwashed he didnt know, no we still attack him, put everyone on ignore it just pisses me off... movie makes 0 sense, same as b vs s..."
"May 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,"there comes a point when you sit in these superhero movies and wonder not only what franchise you're currently watching but could it be possible that i have already seen this? spiderboy was cute, tho."
"May 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Funny moments, good plot, great action sequences and effects.  Another win for Marvel."
"May 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,Surprisingly well balanced film. Balanced in a way that you understand each character motivations. If you were Cap then you'd do what he did in the film. If you were in Iron Man situation then you'd do the same as Tony did in the film.
"May 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,"captain america: kid revenge war,  i don't gonna say the action scenes are best or captain ideology and iron man ideology conflicts, the deeper facts in bucky life all things just shit, total shit . Think a man who lost his family and start a war between avengers by making bucky in, just to get his own revenge , it look like a kid create a mess and avengers clean it by fighting their own and spiderman how can you ask a kid to fight captain knowing that its captain america movies and his ass gonna hurt. story is lame , best scene bucky lost his arm, and in last no one gets hurt because revenge is bad thing 100 marks to show this."
"May 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,????? ?????? ??? ??????
"May 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,"When I first saw the trailers and the hype around this movie, I was really excited to see it but when I got out of the theatre I was a bit disappointed. Let's state the goods parts of the movie: I enjoyed the fights a lot, they are well-organized and diversified. Spiderman and Ant man were great even though we see them little, I also appreciate the general humour in the movie which was a bit ""avengers like"" but it works nicely. The fact that Iron Man is more ""serious"" character in the movie also appealed me 

Now what made me sad? First I'm not a hard core Super Hero follower and fan but I usually go and watch them anyway because I enjoy them. In Civil War the story was kind of poor in my opinion, there is a big gap and I feel like they don't achieve anything in the movie, I was hoping for a real war between two clans and was really disappointed. It is not even really about two different opinions in the end but more about a personal fight between the two leaders and, in the end, they aren't even mad at each other's!

To conclude, I think the movie might be one of the best marvels if you are a fan because it may sets up something for future movies, etc.  But as a ""casual"" I think the movie is overall a bit empty but the personalities of the heroes, the action and the humour make it enjoyable by everyone."
"May 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Aunque no deja de ser un Blockbuster, es mucho mejor que Avengers 2."
"May 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Almost everything about this film is jaw-droopingly entertaining, and the relationships that Marvel has been building up for nearly a decade come to a satisfying and logical boiling point. Well worth viewing - easily upholds the legacy begun by The Winter Soldier. For anyone that afraid this would turn into an ""Avengers 2.5"", don't worry - the film reminds you that it's staunchly about Captain America and The Winter Soldier throughout. There's enough political intrigue and inter-character drama to keep you interested between the stunningly well directed action scenes, and Black Panther sneaks in from off camera and steals every scene he's featured in."
"May 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,"my favorite part about this film is that Spider-man has never been better. but you've probably heard all the good things about this film,  so I'll give you the bad, because this is not a perfect film and also not the best comic book film either.  first,  they used way too much shaky Cam in the action scenes. the most pointless and most boring villain ever. that villain is only one of MANY unnecessary characters. half of the minor roles could've been cut completely with no impact on the story at all. also too many mentions of characters from avengers movies who couldn't be in this one. all this leads to a movie that's about an hour too long. I do like this movie.  just not as much as everyone else seems to."
"May 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The flights looks great! The whole story line try very hard to pull everyone together, but pull everyone together ONLY.
It's more like Avengers 2.5 than Captain America 3..."
"May 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,I got the y but I'm sure lots havnt seen it so won't spoil it but it was s very good movie better then I had expected
"May 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,great movie but don't go to hartlepool cinema to watch it they had 3 movie start times and not 1 was correct ended up watching it at teesside.
"May 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I loved this movie and left me feeling very satisfied. I definitely want to see the next installments in the MCU, what more can I say except if you haven't seen the movie yet go and watch it. I promise it won't leave a Dawn of Justice feeling, and no one has a mother named Martha in the film."
"May 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,So amazing I really recommend it.
"May 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Really just a brand expansion, that is just a 2 & a half hour set up for the next marvel Film. Either way these actors are so imbedded in their characters, it's hard to imagine them playing anyone else but the superheroes."
"May 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,One of the best films of the genre.
"May 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This is the Cap's most unfun outing and huge step backwards compared to the previous Avengers films. Weak characters, too much talking, few fights and only one that's worthwhile, the worst film iteration of Spiderman yet and a misuse of what was supposed to be an exciting turn for Tony Stark's character. It's phenomenally weak compared Batman V Superman, a movie which it apes in a stylistic sense."
"May 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Seldom does a film with so many characters actually work. That means everyone gets their moments and new characters, Black Panther and Spider-Man, benefit from an economical character development. Informing the audience about these characters backgrounds and what drives them in limited time.Beyond the characters the story has a completely organic structure. Events that we, the audience, have witnessed have consequences. The Avengers are not free from accountability. The Russo's have mastered putting a larger than life world in our reality without me questioning whether it's realistic or not. Friendships are tested through loyalty, duty and honor. This is character driven political action-adventure at it's best."
"May 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Capt. America is a Hypocrite.

Remember this scene from Age of Ultron?

Stark: But that up there, that's the end game. How are you guys planning on beating that?
Capt: Together.
Stark: We'll lose.
Capt: Then we'll do that together too.

Then Civil War came and he eats what he said by not asking help from those close allies he considered ""friends"" and instead recruited a thief. WTF Capt? You didnt tell your while team coz you ""knew"" they wont believe you? Really? 

1st, true friends, no brothers in arms may not agree on everything, but you are supposed to trust them that they will also trust you.

And 2nd, I didnt know Capt developed a new super power? Predicting the fufure? Capt, you didnt just failed to trust your friends, you also pre-judged them essentially."
"May 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Civil War isn't perfect, but for longtime fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it's a dream come true to see these guys and gals duke it out. The theme of friendship, also, leads to an emotional climax that will make you question what it means to be a hero."
"May 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,"More than ever, it's like watching a comic book come to life onscreen. Marvel's most grown-up outing so far as it asks some interesting questions while being okay with not providing easy answers. Also THAT'S how you do Spider-Man. This is the first time I really feel as if Peter Parker jumped off the page."
"May 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best Marvel movie yet.
"May 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,By far the greatest installment in the Marvel Universe thus far! Just wow!
"May 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,typical comic movie with too much CGI
"May 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,"In general, Civil War is a mess, but, damn, is it a fun one. Don't go into this thinking of it as a Captain America and Iron man movie, think of it as an Avengers movie, with (probably) the last appearance of RDJ as Iron Man. 

To re-state myself, yes, this film is a mess, but, unlike BvS, the action isn't just a few scenes that don't last very long... the action is massive, intense, and fun to watch. I know allot of people have said this already, but, during that airport scene, my jaw was dropped because of the pure awesomeness. 

Now, time to discuss why I believe this movie is a bit of a mess: all the characters... not just a few of them, ALL OF THEM... even the ones you don't know much about! It feels like the writers had to stuff one too many introductions in, and, while allot of them hit their mark, by the middle mark, these new-entries were feeling a bit tired. Also, while the action is amazing, I do feel as if there were one too many fist-fights in this film... I mean, it isn't much to complain about, because all of them kicked ass. 

Another thing I really loved about this film is the story. The past few movies I feel could be summarized in just a few sentences, with a few details you can tack-on AFTER you write that sentence, but this? I believe the writers found a decent balance between amazing fight sequences, and also decent story writing. The villain was interesting, and (though, you may find a few little plotholes) had interesting motivations. To top this off, (asides from the original Avengers movie in 2012) I believe this is one of the funniest Marvel movies to date.

In conclusion, I enjoyed Civil War much more than I thought I would. Sure, the soundtrack is still slim and forgettable, and people who skipped on the past few films might ask a few questions while watching (like ""who's THAT guy?"", for example), but, it's still a fun romp.  If I were to imagine a battle between this vs BvS, it's like BvS got into a gun fight with a knife in place of a gun... in other words, there's little competition because Civil War's already won."
"May 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,"simply mind-blowing; face, neck, and chest.  two times, two times!"
"May 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,"A brawny, intelligent action spectacle balanced by a solid grasp of deeper themes, ""Captain America: Civil War"" plants itself firmly in the upper ranks of Marvel cinema."
"May 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Well marvel has really out done themselves,this is an excellent display of a great superhero blockbuster. The Directing for a movie of this scale is superb,there is a lot in this movie it has the job of introducing new characters, creating a conflict, and progressing the characters.Which is all done with grace.Now this movie does has some dark moments, but they don't dwell on it too much, just enough. All of the new cast was really great,Black Panther is very solidly introduced as well as Spider man,which is one of the best parts of the movie. The story does have a lot in it which can lose you sometimes,and there are a lot of characters to keep track of.But over all this is a wonderfully put together and is a great time.It is a wonderful time that moves the story forward."
"May 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,The airport battle is fucking epic.
"May 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,Great movie. Loved it.
"May 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,It was amazing! Civil War had everything I expected and more. Definitely one of my favorite movies and (in my opinion) the best marvel movie yet.
"May 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Marvel's Captain American 3 is full of action and has a lot of comedy punchlines. I loved seeing antman , spiderman and black panther. The animations and fighting scenes are well done and the movie keeps you entertained till the end. A great addition to your viewing pleasures."
"May 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best Marvel movie I've ever seen
"May 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,Instead of Captain America 3 this movie should have been called Avengers 3. I know it is based on the comic Civil War but I had rather have had another stand alone movie for Captain America. Other than that it was a good movie and worth watching. Now I would like to see Captain America and Wolverine team up in a movie:
"May 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,Marvel fails again with no villain and dare to be great with a story line. Always have to wrap things up in a pretty bow does Marvel.
"May 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best movie this year so far
"May 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,Do I really need to write a review? This movie was perfect go and see it
"May 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Meh. Just a few great thoughtful lines, but other than that it's all stunts and CGI. I guess I'm getting old for these superhero movies now."
"May 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Best Marvel movie, action was great, character progression was great. There could be a bit of improvement with the Steve Bucky friendship, but everything else was great."
"May 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Worst movie I ever saw! Way too long, no story line. Very boring!"
"May 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,"One of the best marvel movies to date! 
But it draws some wrong conclusions on my opinion. 
The movie made you genuinely concerned for the well being of the characters, which for marvel is a first."
"May 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The film was just amazing. Well paced, good character development and Black Panther and Spider-Man kicked butt."
"May 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Pretty badass, I dug it."
"May 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,"A lot of EXCESSIVE jokes and a median script. Made this movie SO MUCH inferior to ""Batman v Superman""."
"May 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,"so glad the Russo brothers are taking care of the 2 next avengers movies instead of Whedon, they are far superior to him."
"May 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,not expected what it has to be or maybe it just a good movie. not a fan of marvel universe but we need cool movies than a drama
"May 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It was a good movie, but there were so many hero drop ins and new characters that were not flushed out that to the lay person who hasn't been engrossed in Marvel comics since they were 9 might be wondering, ""What is all this?"" Airport action scene felt contrived. Black Widow shaky camera work adds to her twitch movement amidst a cast of heroes that can actually do ""stuff."" RDJ and Evans jive well. RDJ finds perfect counterpoint to bloviating attitude with  new Peter Parker. It's a good movie. Winter Soldier was better. After a while you lose empathy for Barnes and Rogers's struggle, and start to feel the same way you do when  you're watching CNN Pundits break the same news over and over and over throughout the course of a day."
"May 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Didn't destroy the comic book arc the way hat other comic book based movies do. A lot of focus on character development, even though these characters have be developed already. But in a way of how they interact with each other. 
Con:
The best 3D scene is the major fight. Other than that, IMAX non-3D will work also."
"May 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,near damn perfect...watch it on a group outing. perfect pacing.
"May 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Review: Avengers 2.5 (aka Captain America: Civil War)

""sigh....."". I must've said that at least a dozen times while watching this movie. Captain America: Civil War is a very well made superhero film that has many superbly choreographed action sequences that showcase the characters' powers very well that is unfortunately devoid of any real emotional impact. I have not felt this indifferent watching a Marvel Studios movie since Thor 2. And although I appreciate Marvel changing up the formula by making the stakes smaller and more intimate, it didn't save Civil War from being a rather underwhelming experience.

Firstly: Yes, this is a better movie than Batman v Superman. It has a better script, better acting, and a more appropriate tone. But unlike BvS, there was not a single moment where I thought, ""Wow, that was awesome!"" or ""I want to rewatch that part."" BvS had several moments like that. And although Civil War never reaches the annoyingly stupid depths of Thor 2, but this may be my second least favorite Marvel movie to date.

I'm having a hard time critiquing this movie because I'm already starting to forget large portions of it. The first hour of this very long movie bored me to death, but it does pick up nicely later on. Overall, the movie isn't BAD. I'd say for most people it's perfectly watchable and entertaining. The high stakes from the previous Avengers movies have been brought down to Earth for a more personal conflict between the team itself.

The movie is titled ""Captain America: Civil War"", but this really is an Avengers ensemble. Cap actually doesn't stand out no more than anyone else, actually less so. Cap may be the center of the conflict, but it's Tony Stark who ultimately drives most of the story forward. The standout character has to be the new Spider-Man. He's young, energetic, and likeable so far. Let's hope that carries over into his upcoming standalone movie because the Spider-Man character has never been one of my favorites.

Vision is once again the best character with the best dialogue and is once again underused. Black Panther makes a respectable debut. Black Widow is serviceable yet forgettable. Falcon and Rhodes are once again decent token sidekicks. Scarlet Witch gets to use her powers more this time around, but gets practically zero character growth. Hawkeye and Ant-Man feel to serve no purpose other than to even out the opposing sides and to do some admittedly sweet looking moves during a big fight scene at an airport.

And Civil War just may have the most underwhelming, uninteresting, boring villain to date. It's as if the studio is seeing just how lazy they can be with their villains. 

My big problem with Civil War is that nothing seems to carry any emotional weight until a not so surprising revelation at the end. The entire film has a sterile bland feel that lacks genuine drama and intensity. It may be exceptionally well made on a technical level with plenty of little things to enjoy, but it's definitely one Marvel movie I won't be watching again anytime soon.

Score: 6/10"
"May 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,Nope! Complete fanboy fodder! Overrated big time!!!!
"May 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,its like been a 8 years boy when you see this movie.
"May 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Unlike many of the previous films, the Civil War felt a bit dull. But the circus is in town and 
you got to go see it."
"May 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,"A great way to kick off phase 3. Marvel fans will rejoice, their reluctant movie partners will have a smile on their faces too."
"May 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,Que paso? Una pelicula como las otras y no tiene corazon. Aburrida.
"May 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,One word: MOTORCYCLE!!!!
"May 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It takes a little while to get going, but when it does, everything falls into place and is pitch perfect.  Maybe Spiderman was unnecessary, but he was one of the films best elements, and they got the characterization perfect.  I'm now eagerly anticipating the next Spiderman movie."
"May 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,Utterly terrible.  Worst Marvel Cinematic Universe movie to date.
"May 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I was eager to see this movie, which surprised me because I'm not a sucker for the ""superhero-vs-superhero"" frenzy that's currently dominating the genre. However, Civil War plays this new-found trope like a fine tuned fiddle. MARVEL has always had a confidence in its fare, but here it is thrusted into a new gear, sporting its prestige on its chrome sleeve. Quick notes: This is Robert Downey Jr's most exemplary performance as the acerbic billionaire Tony Stark to date. Black Panther is the outstanding disappointment here; poorly conceived and integrated into the universe, and dare I say miss-casted. The next iteration of Spider-Man, played by the engaging Tom Holland, is a big heaping ball of vital potential for the aging universe, I just wish Spidey's powers were more internal, and less strap-on gadgetry. But hey, that's why there's such a thing as ""future character development."""
"May 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,I thought it was going to be a lot better then what it was.
"May 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Superhero movies should be fun, and this one is, for sure.   Even in its bleak moments of despair or desperation, it doesn't feel like the weight of the movie is on the viewer's shoulders."
"May 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,Saw it yesterday and loved it!!!
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I thought this was brilliant. Like everything superman v batman should've been, but fell so short of. Great twist and storyline."
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"So Captain American pisses off Iron Man or is it visa versa.  Either way, it makes for an entertaining movie and one of the better Marvel films as of late (better than Ultron).  That's right folks. Ballwars break out at a massive scale between these superheros and refreshingly, they care when innocent people are killed.  That actually plays big into the story and gives the bad guy an interesting character arc.  Should people in spandex be regulated by a world conspiracy government or should they go off and blow up city blocks just to save the entire world.  Good question.  No one seems to think that saving the world is more important than killing a few innocents so it's game time.  Also, if you are a cat person, there is a catman in this who likes to save cat's from trees when he isn't playing ultimate ballwars with the Winter Soldier.  Enjoy.  Even though I haven't seen Batman vs Superman, I can probably tell you this will be way more worth your money."
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,this movie was awesome!
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Terrible movie, made Ironman a bad guy, way too many super heroes...."
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I really needed this after Age of Ultron. No big complaints...and I loved Spider-Man, Black Panther, and Ant-Man's inclusion into the team."
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,Spiderboy was the best parts
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"action packed, amazing action sequences."
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I absolutely loved it! I wasn't expecting anything special from Spider-Man or Ant-Man. I honestly thought those characters  wouldn't fit the movie, but I have to thank Marvel for making me excited again about Spiderman, and for giving substance to both characters in the movie, even if they weren't the central feature of the film."
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,Possibly Marvel Film Studios best movie yet. DC and Warner Bro's should sell their film rights to Marvel.
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The Russo brothers take the reigns again on this continuation of the Captain America story, and although Cap is the super followed most closely, the Avengers ensemble plus some newbies to the Disney/Marvel studio universe make it more a continuation of the Avengers plot. In my opinion this is a big improvement dramatically and action-wise over Joss's Age of Ultron effort. Since it is all about the split between the superheroes, the villains (or maybe simply obstacles is a better label) Zemo played by Daniel Brühl and Secretary of State Ross played by William Hurt as well as Crossbones and the other super soldiers are not memorable. Civil War asks what is the line between hero and vigilante? Is there redemption for brain washed assassins like Bucky Barnes? And is forcing those with super powers or super suits to register with the government the right thing to do? Many of these characters are well-developed now for movie audiences after multiple film appearances. We know them, we love characters on both sides of the divide even if we are not familiar with their comic book origins. There are life and death stakes. Even the newer characters like Tom Holland's version of Spider-Man, Paul Rudd's Ant-Man, and Chadwick Boseman's Black Panther are immediately appealing. There are many big action/effect sequences that are exciting and advance the plot rather than being messy free-for-alls. Kevin Feige and his team at Marvel have a great grasp on the storytelling arch in this cinematic universe."
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Batman v Superman had great elements, potential, and the promise of great things to come. The concluding chapter to the Captain America trilogy has all that and works as a great movie on its own. It may not be completely fair to compare the two but Civil War easily shows have you can have a complex plot, a large cast of characters, and entertaining action and still make a great film."
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,Marvel Studios delivers once again and of course they do. They haven't let us down in a long long time. My only wish was that it had more characters on each side. I'm team Cap. 5/5 A-. The whole cast delivers & the new spider is phenomenally cast.
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Great action, some occasionally funny dialogue, and great acting. But honestly felt like a little taste for things to come in the upcoming Avengers film rather than a Captain America film.
76/100"
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Best Marvel film to date. The plot is a bit thin and the villain underwhelming, but the only point of the movie is to have fun watching the Avengers fight each other. I really enjoy the direction from the Russo brothers."
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Civil War is a mediocre film with some great, although misplaced elements throughout. The action scenes, apart from the one at the airport, are poorly filmed (like the entirety of the movie, which looks visually boring) and ruined by an awful edit. The soundtrack is generic and also boring; technically, the only thing thats are good are the sound effects; even the VFX are way too noticeable. What was supposed to be an epic and ideological confrontation feels too small and ultimately disappointing when its revealed that its all being (not very well) orchestrated by Zemo, which is one of the worst and most cliché villains you could have asked for, with a ridiculously complex plan...to show a two-minute video. None of the motivations are very strong, and even Spider-man, which is amazing by the way, is shoehorned in the story and is completely unnecessary to the plot. Civil War's worst mistake though is what is becoming Marvel's most dangerous one: it feels pointless. By the end of the movie, not much really changed, and even if the journey matters more than its destination, it's mostly a boring and confusing one."
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,Action...Drama...Comedy...all packed into one great movie. Marvel does it again.
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,saw it in 3D IMAX....BEST SUPERHERO FILM EVER (SO FAR).  THIS ONE GOES TO ELEVEN....

"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,MIND-BLOWING! Go see it if you haven't already!
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"""Sometimes I want to punch you in your perfect teeth,"" says Robert Downey Jr's Iron Man to Chris Evans' Captain America early in Civil War. At the risk to betraying my hashtag sympathies, I couldn't agree more. Captain America is likely the least interesting of the main Avengers, a do-gooder beefcake with a kinda-dumb aesthetic. His fish-out-of-water tendencies are his redeeming feature, and he's vastly outpaced in that department by Thor. He's a bland hero, which makes him a fine center for the action of others but a difficult sell to carry his own movies. The First Avenger was fun enough thanks to its WWII period setting, and Winter Soldier similarly had fun with format while placing half of the star-power demands on the ever-capable shoulders of Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow. It's no secret that Civil War is an ensemble piece, and much more of an Avengers movie than a Captain America one. What's surprising is that, while Civil War still doesn't quite sell Cap, it's the best Iron Man movie since the first one came out eight years ago.

The central argument of Civil War, Iron Man defending regulation of the Avengers while Cap demands autonomy, is sold surprisingly convincingly and with as much gravitas as possible without being too ridiculous. The Avengers leave a wake a destruction with little culpability; Tony Stark recognizes this at long last, after creating the last Avengers supervillain in Ultron, while Captain America (ironically) is untrusting of government intervention. It's a neat inversion of their character types, but one that makes sense in context. The decision of #TeamCap or #TeamIronMan really does come down to how tethered to reality the MCU is. If we can believe that the Avengers are some incorruptible moral force, then UN oversight is clearly a terrible plan, especially given that we know that William Hurt's Thunderbolt Ross is a bit of a megalomaniac. However, the movie pays much more than lip service to reality, putting the Avengers to task for the collateral damage they are responsible for. For Cap's side, extra motivation comes when Bucky Barnes re-appears as The Winter Soldier, possibly framed for an attack on the UN, while a mysterious operative played by Daniel Bruhl lurks on the sidelines. Barnes is probably my least favourite character in the MCU, a mopier Steve Rogers with a too-coincidental origin story, and his re-appearance is a bit too much after taking a major role in the last Cap outing. But he's a cog in the big machine this time, and suffices as a plot device to divide the extended Avengers (sans Hulk and Thor, plus Spider-Man and Black Panther).
What is really remarkable about Civil War in the context of the MCU is how it keeps the stakes relatively small. Floating cities and alien invasions are nowhere to be seen, and while Bruhl is an effective and memorable villain in the underwhelming Marvel pantheon, the conflict is nearly entirely between heroes. While not nearly as many faceless lives are at risk, the battles seem to have real consequence and are miles more engaging than anything in Age of Ultron. The action scenes in the first half are a less involving, as they mostly involve the team fighting goons with guns, but when hero-on-hero action starts, Civil War finds its feet fast and produces the most flat-out enjoyable MCU scenes since the first Avengers.
It helps that Marvel has crafted its squad so carefully. While some of the motivations for the minor characters are fuzzy (notably Hawkeye and Ant-Man), these characters work best when together. Paul Rudd's Ant-Man is more enjoyable in his five minutes in Civil War than the entirety of his own movie, and Anthony Mackie proves himself once again as the secret weapon the Cap movies. The two big new additions, Tom Holland's Spider-Man and Chadwick Boseman's Black Panther, are both great, even given semi-awkward introductions. Spider-Man in particular is a joy, easily stealing the movie and injecting some much-needed new blood. The scene where all these personalities meet is worth the price of admission alone.
If the MCU films haven't worked for you, Civil War isn't likely to wave the problems away. They're still dumb fun which uses physics any way it wants and takes itself maybe a smidge too seriously, but they nicely avoid the darkness that plagues their DC bretheren in favour of sheer joy. While Cap is as uninteresting as ever, the cast around him is exceptional and the interplay on display is fantastic fun. The movie doesn't hit the reset button, and nicely sets up future MCU films by leaving some distrust sown among the heroes. I'm sure a big space alien will force everyone to make nice again soon, but mining trouble in paradise has led to one of the better Marvel films, even pieces are getting tired."
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Marvel hits another home run. As a giant DC fan, I would recommend this movie for the half hour of Spider-Man alone."
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Love it love it,just wish they were not fighting eachother like that. Love how they put everyone in it."

"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,El mejor inicio de la 3ra fase del UCM
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Thought-provoking and very well played. Captain America Civil War had me with so much emotions. The final act was truly a shocking moment. Their were dull moments in there that might put some viewers to sleep and that's the first hour in the film. Second hour is amazing and fun. The best MCU film ever made! Never in a movie had made me think about the characters so much, that when they fought they had a good reason too. Its so memorable and unforgettable!"
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I'm telling you folks. This is not a very good movie. Long and boring. I watched it last night. Maybe I was tired from Saturday night, but I dozed off a couple of times. Skip it unless you're a comic nerd, then I say, enjoy!"

"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I really loved this movie, go and see it right now"
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"They've prolonged it , but didn't fail to entertain!"
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Review time!...this is redunkulously long, sorry....also I get geeky about the fighting...I really like the fighting.

Marvel did it again with another brilliant movie. I'm not sure what to say to be honest. I got nothing to bitch about...It was amazballs...um...ok how bout this, I'll rate the characters and state why they're superior to anything DC has done. I need a little fuel for the fire and nothing gets me going like acknowledging how much DC is fuck'n up. Here we go...

CAPTAIN AMERICA
He's everything Ubermench aka MOS should have been. He stands for something, he's a ""good man"", he inspirational upbeat and positive, he believes in people and stands by his friends, and he's all ""heart"", like with boxing, not the Captain Planet version of ""heart"". In Civil War you get to see Cap at his finest. A culmination of 3 movies of character building that presents you with a protagonist you ""actually care about"" (MOS), emphasize with, and understand. Because of who Cap is you know Why he does what he does. That's how you build a great character That's why GREAT characters are ""GREAT!"" I'm talking to You Zack Snyder! ... egotistical prick. Cap was great and I love his fighting style. He was kind of a brawler/wrestler with drop kicks and throws direct and powerful attacks with a flashy acrobatic moves tossed in here and there. His shield attacks were creative and fun, just like in the comics.

IRONMAN
Ironman was great. RDJ had his serious face on for this movie and his augments for registration or ""the accords""were valid, eeeven though he did kinda cause it all. All the fighting styles were unique which was one of the things I loved most about this movie. Ironman used mostly haymakers and alot of hand blast and some of his arsenal. I felt like I do when I play Marvel vs Capcon 3. All the different fighting styles make it more interesting. The only comparison to DC that I can make is the relationship between the 2 pairs of ""heroes"" In Civil War there is an established relationship in BvS there's nothin. Cap and Tony had history and chemistry B&S just had alot of hypocrisy ""I don't like you cus you're dangerous! Well I don't like You cus YOU'RE dangerous"" #moms...gtfo' here. If Ironman wasn't an intriguing character then Cap wouldn't have been an intriguing character and the conflict would have sucked. This is what 2 heroes fighting each other is supposed to look like.

BLACK WIDOW
Scarjo has one of my favorite lines in the movie...

Falcon: anyone tell you you're kinda paranoid?

Black Widow: Not to my face. Why? Did you hear something?

Lol, I thought that was so fucking clever. Her fighting style is Brilliant. BW would have to have an incredible amount of stamina to pull of this fighting style in real life. A lot of fast movements and throwing her body around. Just when I thought she was using her leg/straddle/flip move too much she changed it up making it never the same move twice. She really fights like she has to put someone down quickly. I would much rather see a Black Widow movie than a Wonder Woman one. I could give 2 shit about that version of WW in MOS. BW is witty, capable, and hot not to mention a little shady which makes for a very interesting character.

...I think this review is gona get long in the tooth. You're a real trooper if you're still reading ...:D

FALCON
Holy-E fuck'n Shit I Loved Falcon in this!
His abilities/powers/ tech/ whatever got so much cooler!

""Wing shields?!""

SO fuck'n Good! All the tactical stuff too!

""Wing Rockets!?""

""REDWING?!?!""

*PANTS*...OMG, some poeple might hate, but Falcon may be slowly becoming my fav Marvel character. Holy Christ he was cool as shit and his fighting style while using his wings was awesome. He's not a close quarters fighter, but he seemed highly adaptable and versatile. I really like this character. His relationship with Cap was well established and believable and I see him as more of a partner and friend in Civil War than a side kick.

BUCKY BARNE/ THE WINTER SOLDIER
I've heard some people complain that he didn't emote enough or he didn't have a personality that made him easy to emphasize with. These people need to shut the fuck up and go watch the first movie which establishes Cap and Bucky's friendship. He's been the Winter Soldier since then and the Winter Soldier's brain has been ""scrambled!"" He's messed up in the Head! he's not bubbly and charismatic cus he's trying to deal with the guilt of killing a shit-ton of people cus some quasi-nazis used him as a meat puppet! His fighting style seemed a bit more vicious than everyone else. Alot of heavy punches and throat grabs made him seem very menacing. TWS uses his metal arm alot when fighting, even using it as a shield which I thought was really cool #buckyforCap2018or2019orsometimeintheforseeablefuture

HAWKEYE
Hawkeye is ""scappy."" He was a distance fighter shooting arrows that never missed(awesome). Even tho he lost every hand to hand, battle, it was fun as shit to watch. Hawkeye doesn't give up! Even when fighting The Vision who ridiculously outmatched him. I love watching him try to kick ass and his use of arrows was clever.

BLACK PAN-nope!...not yet

WAR MACHINE
War Machine's arsenal is atrociously sick. There's a scene where someone tries to hit him with a semi-truck or semi-truck trailer, no, I think it was an ""Entire Frick'n Semi-Truck"", Trailer and All! and he machine guns and missile/rockets that thing to absolute ""shit"" lol, it was Beautiful. Rhody and Tony's friendship, again well established, was great and it hit me right in the feels when that scene from the trailer came up. I had no idea how they were going to play that. I can't bring myself to ruin it.

VISION
Ok, so I've been giving alot of glowing praise to this movie, but vision is one of my small complaints and it's a little dumb.....

...........why was Vision wearing clothes?

It didn't make him look more human! He looked So weird and out of place! Like when people put clothes on dogs. College professor sweater aside, I like that they are building a relationship between him and Scarlet Witch cus it's straight from the comics and keeping the characters close to the comics is important, ZACH SNYDER. Vision fighting style was mostly power based or a show of power. Slow deliberate movements power blast and phase and density shifting. Vision was trying not to hurt anyone while also trying to intimidate, I think that's how I would do it.

So much typing! lol, my fingers hurt!...almost done

THE SCARLET WITCH

I loved TSW. She was the power on Caps side and Man did she use it! She's hurl'n cars and fuck'n up vision, she's kinda unstoppable. I do have to admit I miss that scary aspect of her from the post credits scene of CA2: The Winter Solider and the beginning of AOU. That eerily quick jerky movement she had is gone and I hope they bring it back. She doesn't punch or kick anyone it's all power moves which is cool cus it shows how much she can do...Scarjo is still WAAaaay hotter tho, just say'n.

...time for the main attractions...

ANTMAN
Lol...*sigh* ...holy shit
From the time Antman came on the scene to the last time you see him he's funny and clever and a pure fucking joy to watch. He's that kind of joy you get when you're eating a really good cookies and cream milkshake and ur get'n sad cus your almost done with the milkshake and then you realize the bottom of the cup is filled with oreo cookie bits...
...
......Still with me? Good! That's how awesome Antman is!!!! Just when you think he couldn't be anymore awesome HE DOES SOME MORE AWESOME SHIT!! I'm not even gona say nothin else! All um gona say, final word on Antman!...""orange slices""

*mic drop*

SPIDERMAN
Perfect.

What more could you possibly ...Fucking... WANT!?

...ok I'll give you a little more.

Was he too young? NOoopE!
Did his eyes look ""not right""/ridiculous? NOoope!
Was he too ""quippy?"" NOoope!

He was Everything Spiderman was supposed to be and fought multiple people! Falcon, The Winter Solider, Cap, ANTMAN! He was on Fire SON!!...fye-yaaaaa.

Well I think that's it. I covered all the heroes. Um,... the villain was IMO the best villain so far. His character had a lot of heart he's did some irreparable damage(maybe, probably not tho). So yea, thanks for reading. I can't believe anyone would read all of this. It's like a frick'n novel, ha, ha. I guess my next review will b-NO!NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOooooooooooooOO!

I saved the best for last SON!!

BLACK PANTHER!!!!! Bitches!!

Yes! Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaasssssssssssss! bitch.
Black Panther was So fuck'n Bad-ass. I've been waiting to do this review cus I need to calm down. I've seen the movie 3 times and I could be wrong, but I think he's getting better every time I see it. I'm pretty sure he waved at me like Chris Reeves did at the end of the first Superman movie...

Black Panther, when he fought, was an embodiment of Bruce Lee(He even struck a Bruce Lee posed before his fight with Bucky), Jim Kelly, and Wesley Snipes fighting with attitude and a lot of kicks. He just might be the best hand to hand fighter.
I was so worried they'd fuck his character up cus he's the Best Black superhero Ever made! DC has NO Equivalent to Black Panther, NONE!! I'm just so glad Marvel didn't make him the comic relief, STAR WARS: FORCE AWAKENS. Or a crying whiny bitch, WALKING DEAD. Or light-skinned or White(no offense to any light-skinned or White readers, but this is important), MOST HOLLYWOOD MOVIES.

Black Panther was a strong , confident, capable, non-sidekick-like Black character that doesn't die, HORROR AND X-MEN MOVIES.
And it's about-Damn-Time.

I love Marvel for giving me the movies I've been waiting to see since I was a child and I intend to throw as much money at this movie as I possible can. If you've read this far, you are fucking ""amazballs"".

Later ;D"
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,This movie is for kids.
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Marvel knocks it out of the park yet again.

In this latest installment into the MCU the Russo brothers attempt to make a movie that incorporates what feels like a dozen different characters and make them all work.  Do they accomplish this?

You're damn right they do.  Not only do they manage to make a movie with all these moving parts work.  They manage to make us care about those moving parts.  Everything from the dramatic elements, to the beyond astounding action, to the humor, and to the new characters introduced, this shows what happens when a movie fires on all cylinders.

Not only does the movie fire on all cylinders.  It manages to make a movie that has so many characters still focus on the human story between brothers.  What brothers am I talking about?  The brotherly relationship between Steve Rogers (Captain America) & Bucky Barnes (The Winter Soldier), and the brotherly relationship between Tony Stark (Iron Man) & Steve Rogers.  The writers narrowed in on what makes these characters tick and broadcast it to the audience in an almost a perfect way.

The evolution of the characters we have come to know are shown in full force.  From the guilt that Tony Stark feels about all his actions in previous films, to the distrust that Steve Rogers feels towards governmental control.  These two evolutions between these characters have now come to a head and explode in an ending that is entertaining to watch, but also heartbreaking at the same time.  While Stark feels he has been betrayed by one of his closest friends, Rogers feels that he has to protect his best friend Bucky at all costs, and the consequences are dire. 

So the characters we have come to love have a place to shine, but how do the new characters do?  How does Black Panther and Spider-Man do in this film?  Well, they just so happen to steal the show.  Tom Hollands Spider-Man is something of pure joy.  The decision by Marvel & Sony to make this incarnation of Spider Man a teenager in highschool has shown to be a decision of genius.  Tom Holland nails this role down completely and it is shown in his conversations with Tony Stark, and the way he is throwing out one liners in battle.  Round of applause for Tom Holland as Spider-Man, but the real star was Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther.  Boseman details everything about this character perfectly.  Everything down to the accent, to his presence in a room, to the ruthlessness in his fighting style encapsulates the Black Panther perfectly and after seeing this movie, the Black panther solo film is now on my most anticipated.

The only negative about this movie is a rushed romance arc that really had no place being in this movie, and the main villain in this movie, i never felt his plan made sense and relied too much on coincidence.

Overall this movie is a fantastic movie and worth of your money.  Go see it first chance you get.
My movie rating is a 4.5/5.
Justin Ramos"
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Tackling a film with such a boisterous character count is no easy task, even for a studio powerhouse like Marvel. But, the same studio that brought us several other heroic blockbusters delivers once more and proves that no roster is too big for them. Every character gets the screen time they deserve and plays a welcome part in the story. MCU's new Spiderman is a total treat and one of the film's highlights. The spotlight shines on Captain America, however, and his fight to preserve the liberty of himself and friends. While the climax is a tad underwhelming, this film is proof that Marvel Studios is the reigning blockbuster champ."
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,best to date from marvel studios.
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I swear that whoever plotted the MCU, they should be given some special Oscar for keeping the fans coming back time and time again.  This was as good as or better than any other Avenger movie."
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best superhero movie ever!
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,http://www.clevelandmovieblog.com/2016/05/captain-america-civil-war.html
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Best Film to come from the MCU yet. The Russo Bros. know exactly what they're doing and it shows. Repeated viewing highly recommended (I'll be going a second time). I don't even know where to begin to describe how much fun this was to watch and I'm hesitant to try...if you're reading this, then just go see it already"
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Out of either of the first two Captain America movies, this one surpasses them both. However, I still am giving this a god but not great rating because I still cannot stand Captain America. A little communication would have helped him and his friend a lot. Iron man was amusing as always and the extra characters made up a nice touch. Spider man was great! The team convolution and the mixed messages about each characters goals were a bit annoying and the fights didn't always seem intense based on the fact that they all knew they were friends. Overall, this was an entertaining glimpse into the marvel heroes but not even close to the best"
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Marvel never seems to fail. Better than BVS. But slighly overrated by critics i would have given it 81%. Loaded with action, but nowdays, directors are not focused on villains they want to put a fight between super-heroes themselves"
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"An amazing culmination of the MCU so far, with some of the best action and character sequences to date.  The film does a stunning job at getting you emotionally invested into these characters, in a way not many Marvel films have pulled off. It's incredible that the Russo brothers, and the screenwriters, were able do all of this.  It's impossible not to appreciate the sheer magnitude of all of the characters on screen, and all of the separate storylines weaving perfectly between each other. 

I can't say the film is without any negatives.  Even with everything important going on, it can drag a hair here and there.  That could mainly be due to expectations though, and wanting to see the next big fight sequence (especially when you know the masterpiece Airport scene is just ahead).  While the film can have some perfect CGI, it can also have some jarring CGI work that somehow made it to the final cut. *MINOR SPOILER FOR ENDING*  As for the ending, while there are consequences and fallout to the film's events, the last 5 or so minutes are shaped and presented in a way that leaves the film on an oddly hopeful note.  One that almost cheats the audience of the dark and powerful scenes that came before it. 

Even with those minor flaws, the film worked, and that is a spectacular achievement on its own.  On top of all that, the film gives us the best Spider-Man yet and an incredible and breathtaking portrayal of Black Panther.

Civil War is one of Marvel's best.  One that carries those spectacular action set pieces, but doesn't forget it's characters in the chaos.  If the Russo Brothers can pull this off, I am shaking with excitement at what they have in store for the finale of this MCU saga."
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best super-hero movie since The Dark Knight!!! So frickin' good! Tom Holland as Spiderman was amazing (no pun intended).
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,My least favourite Avengers movie- still good but not great.
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I think this movie is a lot of fun and cool but I hated baren zemo. in the comics, zemo was very cool but they changed him into a guy that made the avenger fight one another. by the way, Spider-Man was freaking awesome"
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"After some processing and some mental digestion I can confidently say that ""Captain America: Civil War"" is the best super hero movie since ""The Dark Knight"" and has become the golden standard for films of this genre. Be warned, if you are a fan of the good vs. evil, this film will disappoint you. It is good vs. good, hero vs hero. Whether it's intentional or not Marvel studios has set out to destroy the popcorn movie, making the line between art and entertainment blurry and unrecognizable. Most impressive is the way the film flawlessly adds depth and a personal element to every hero involved.( and there are a lot.) Marvel's resident funny guys Iron-Man, Ant Man and Iron Man feed off each other exceptionally well to create what is probably the best comic relief I've ever seen in a super hero film, which is a great distraction from the heart wrenching fight to the death between beloved heroes we've all come to adore. My only complaint is the title, mostly because it is in no way a story about Captain America, but a story about the Avengers, and their personal struggles to fight for what believe in while protecting others. ""Civil War"" had my approval and I highly recommend it!"
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"BRUH!!! 
Amazing movie from beginning to end!!! #TeamIronMan"
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"While it does feel more like an Avengers sequel much of the time, the central conflict centers around a rebellious Captain America. This is still very much his film, and the personal conflict between himself, Bucky, and Stark is what really drives the drama. The action is sometimes a tad too chaotic, but it's always a lot of fun. Overall, this is one of the best films in the Marvel cinematic universe."
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,best movie about the civil war ever
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I saw Captain America: Civil War on opening day and, until now, I had held off posting a review to it. The reason for this is that I wanted to give the film much time to sink in. I wanted to absorb what the filmmakers had to offer and really consider what they brought to the table this time around. The fact that I left a superhero film, made by Marvel Studios no less, and had the desire to stop and think about it is a testament to what this movie brings, and is certainly noteworthy. This is not to say that the film's content, or its narrative, is polarizing, controversial or hectic, but rather that it is a meticulously-made film. So much happens, and the movie is successfully so many things at once.

Civil War is the thirteenth instalment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and to say that there has been much built up for this film would be a massive understatement. At its core, it is a follow-up to 2014's Captain America: The Winter Soldier and 2015's Avengers: Age of Ultron. After several battles, much destruction and casualties met in cities around the world, in the previous films, people are frightened by what the Avengers are capable of. The government decides to push for the Anti-Hero Registration Act, a law that limits a superhero's actions so that the population is reassured that there is restrain and control to the Avengers, and they cannot be held accountable for vigilante activity. Disagreement over international oversight of the Avengers fractures them into opposing factions, one led by Captain America and another by Iron Man.

The film's greatest strength, surprisingly, comes from its story. In many ways, Civil War is as large, action-packed and entertaining as the Avengers instalments that came before, but now we are exposed to a non-cartoonish plot and the movie explores thought-provoking themes. This is part of the reason as to why I held off reviewing the film immediately after seeing it, as it is one that demands to be reflected on. I love The Avengers and Avengers: Age of Ultron, but even I will admit that if you take out all the wonderfully-crafted characters, gorgeous action and music, one could take notice that they are dumb plots, albeit well-written. On one hand, they are meant to be silly plots, as their premises are relatively straight-forward, easy to understand and demonstrated as clear-cut, Black and White: Good vs. Evil. In many ways, the Avengers movies are similar to 1977's Star Wars. With that said, I would equate Captain America: Civil War with 1980's The Empire Strikes Back. This is a darker, more mature instalment. Beyond the cruel and personal intentions of a mostly low-key villain, there is no good or bad side to the main conflict. The film does an excellent job making the viewer understand both sides, without at any point giving leeway to one end more than the other. From a narrative standpoint, it's a good problem not to know who to root for and how this story is going to end. 

This is not to say that this is a film all about politics. At its core, this is a film about friendship and relations. About how new ones can build, old ones can fall, some can be maintained, and the situations people can be put in when we are finally exposed to the measures they would take to get what they can and keep whatever else they can. Because of this, it is also a story about how clinging on to just about anything can reveal one's true colours.  Of course, none of this would matter if you don't care for these characters. The good news: You DO care for these characters. They're well-written, well-constructed, differentiating and memorable. Much of this is also due to great acting performances. The acting in the MCU movies has always been good enough, but this was the first time I felt the acting. The filmmakers understood that this was a story that needed to be felt in order to be delivered, so time is taken to get to know these characters and all the actors are provided with a balance of comedic moments and dramatic moments, and almost everyone shines.

One could argue that Civil War is a noticeably slower-paced film than its predecessors, but I found it to be a necessary evil, as the build-up is strong, makes for great character development, and it added atmosphere to the overall arc. Spread across this powerful story and all its little bits is good-quality action that never lets up. Albeit a little bit too much shaky camera in the earlier action scenes, the viewer is always capable of making out what's going on-screen and feels every hit and blow that is delivered. This is very fine action in a superhero movie. There is so much variety and every superhero has at least one shining moment, without one's display lessened compared to another.

For all these reasons, and more, Civil War is a near-perfect blend of the extravagant entertainment that was The Avengers and the serious, politically astute Captain America: The Winter Soldier, both of which were my favourite films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I understand that some may glance over this instalment for not bearing the Avengers title, but just how The Avengers was the payoff to the build-up which was that film's predecessors, Captain America: Civil War is the same. With no disrespect to Avengers: Age of Ultron, Civil War is a more worthwhile and significant chapter in the MCU, with that film surprisingly acting as build-up for this one.

Though not a perfect movie, Captain America: Civil War is the closest Marvel Studios has gotten to that state. It gets my full five-star rating and is arguably my favourite superhero film to date."

"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"A moral dilemma in which neither side is really ""right"", and each side truly believes in what they're fighting for.  The fight scenes, especially the airport scene that's been heavily featured in the previews, are super fun and highlight the different powers of the heroes."

"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America continues to prove to be the MCU's most worthwhile franchise with Civil War, an action-packed and engaging ride that smartly understands the moral dilemmas of these larger-than-life characters"
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"""Captain America"": civil war. You would think that Captain America would be the at least be one of the main focuses in the movie. I was sad when they made him a side character in his own movie. I was also upset that they took a very important storyline and turned it into a mid afternoon soap show. A for Baron Zero I felt like he had no development, and wasn't even the real villain in the movie. I really couldn't tell who the main antagonist was.

on a positive note I can full get behind spiderman and Black panther. they both succeeded in their complicated roles with flying colors. 

Cap deserves his own stand-alone movie to complete his trilogy not Ironman 4"
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Somehow, an amazing plot. Definitely a clear, cleaver and interesting story line. For someone like me, not super heroes fan or comics literate, detailed enough to understand the characters and conflict.  Despite of the amazing plot, and maybe because of the complexity of it, you can't really connect or take a side.  Audience hasn't a real emotional connection affecting the experience of Civil War"
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,Not what I expected. No villains in this movie.
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,Movie was awesome. Right from the start it pulls you in. The battles were great. Not in the dark like must battles are. You see everything. Love the storyline. Kept you on edge with a emotionally twist. You have to love this film.
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,A great take and a fun ride. It was confusing at times and I wasn't convinced that Stark suddenly grew a conscience.
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Terribly simplistic and drab, as always, character interactions are entertaining, but when the plot tries to present a nuanced conflict, it borders on ridicule.  The movie eventually dismisses it's own implied depth and arrives to a blunt and thoughtless resolution that undermines the characters they've created... It's a cheap crowd pleaser, but a dumb one at that."
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The reason it works so well is that we've come to care about these characters across several films, and what they go through and the decisions they make are genuinely affecting, for this movie universe and the audience. Captain America: Civil War isn't the best film in the MCU, but it's the most emotionally impactful and rewarding one, functioning as a superb sequel to the two Captain America and the two Avengers films, while working as its own thrilling and entertaining blockbuster that balances the politically serious narrative with the comic-book fun."
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Loved it so much. 
Given that the theme of the year seems to be superhero versus superhero, I was slightly cautious (despite being a diehard marvel fan). But the viewpoints of both sides were both very well argued, thought out as well as having substantial evidence."
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Thought provoking, compelling, funny and emotional, this third installment offers something unique and well written into the MCU. Not in a while have I seen a film this large with great new characters, well fleshed out old ones and a story so dividing in the best sense. Good job Russo bros and great job marvel."
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"kind of dull, wouldn't recommend unless you're a marvel /superhero fan"
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Even with all other the Avengers and superheroes in it, it still felt like a Captain America movie not an Avengers movie."
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Actually pretty good.  I felt that the two notable new characters, Spiderman and Black Panther, both felt like they slid into the film very gracefully and did nothing but add.  The film is rooted in character and ideological conflict, and while there's a bit of evil mustache twirling to get there, there's no magic thought control or evil sorcery to get there.  It's paced well, and feels really good.

The action's a bit muddy at times, but not to the point of dysfunction.  This is Avengers 2, best to avoid Age of Ultron and just watch this one."
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,What can you say! Another awesome movie from Marvel! Beautiful story telling with great humor in between!
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"fantastic,  msg to DC Comics, GAME ON BITCHES"
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War was a great entertaining movie for the whole family to enjoy.  It was a little too long of a movie for my eight year old.  He stuck trough it till the end.  It was action packed!  Can't wait for the next installment of this movie.  The one thing this movie should have toned down was all the political, government, and UN propaganda.  I guess it's expected like all the previous Captain America movies."
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,this movie is way better than batman v superman!
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Everything you ever wanted from a team superhero movie. They finally got Spiderman right. A little miffed that Black Widow filled the fem comforter roles while the only other woman on the team was locked up being ""protected""."
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Civil war was much too convoluted for it's own good. The conflict between Iron Man and Captain America didn't need to involve more than 4 characters. As a result you get a half-hearted fight of people who really didn't want to fight each other. They strayed so far from the source content that the added characters lost their meaning. In the comics Spiderman was the heart of the entire story as his decision to reveal himself and sign with the government signaled several people to believe in their cause. His later decision to switch sides was a turning point in the story none of which was touched on in this adaptation. If Spiderman and Black Panther weren't thrown in to promote their future solo movies would anyone have even cared? Black Widow and Hawkeye aren't needed and if they simply sent them on a mission to find the Hulk the story wouldn't have changed all. All that being said, Black Panther was excellent. The final fight between Iron Man and Captain America was very good even though they got the winner wrong."
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Really enjoyed it with my 3 boys.  Fun movie,  and gets away from the standard format of fight,  loose, lick wounds,  fight win. And the new guy is great..."
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I don't usually review movies but I had to for this one.   it is by far one of the top 3, if not the best superhero movies to date. The fight scene was one the greatest movie events in the past few years, not just super hero movies, movies in general.  The movie is a blast where every character is perfectly exemplifies every character in a flawless and amazing way."
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This movie is phenomenal, the characters are well-developed you have emotional attachment with them. The movie is still a definitive Captain America movie but each character has their own moment to shine."
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Unlike batman v superman, I don't think it took itself seriously enough."
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"One of the more entertaining films in Marvel's super hero movie cannon... This one makes up for the travesty of the last Avengers film with a film that is full of characters and a lot of fun... The Captain America vs. Iron Man conflict is set up believably and within character for each of them... and the film does a good job with all the other multiple marvel characters that show up.. for such a crowded film they manage to get character bits in for everyone and introduce Black Panther and Spider-Man also. The main villains plan is awfully convoluted and seems like it relies on a lot of things happening that he had little control over... but thats probably the one flaw in this film one of the better super hero movies made, and certainly the best from Marvel's cinematic universe."
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Marvel has done it again! The Russo Brothers are two for two now as they have taken so many characters and put them into the same movie and made it a coherent, non-jumbled story. Captain America is indeed the main focus of this movie but the amount of added depth that they have given to Tony Stark is amazing. He is seen in a whole new light now, The relationship between Cap, Bucky and Iron Man is astonishingly beautiful and i cannot wait to see what comes next. The action is some of the best i have ever seen in a superhero film and there was a lot of it. The villain was complex and brilliantly acted by Daniel Bruhl. This is one of the best Marvel movies to date and one of the best comic book movies period. 4.6/5"
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,really good action and good acting by the cast with decent direction on an halfway decent storyline!
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Good storyline, great fight scenes and a good mix of pathos and humor.   Equal parts fists and quips, this is classic Marvel story-telling.   Verdict: a must see for any long-time Marvel Fan."
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,it was pretty awesome!!
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Great plot, great effects, great acting."
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I was Mind Blown.This is the Best Marvel Movie to Date!!!!! Very well made, the connection to the other movies (MCU). The Action sequences are Amazing , Cap and Buck VS Iron-Man WOW, the best one is the airport sequence, that truly is the best battle ever made in a Marvel movie. The development is made perfectly. There are many emotional moments as WOW moments. Spider-Man is the best one ever,( Like the Comic) He is amazing in this movie and the Jokes are well delivered (Reference to Star Wars and other Movies.), great adaptation. Ant-Man steals the show and surprises and Black Panther a true Bad-Ass. Must see Guys, Is a very well made movie , you understand each hero motivations. Some Minor Nitpicks but that's all. Overall 10/10.( See the other movies, very recommended) ( This movie Blown Away, Can' t wait to see it again) ( See it in the biggest screen you can)"
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Winter Soldier stands on its own and a great superhero movie, but can one watch Civil War without seeing either of the Avengers movies (or other solo films). Its the most connected solo movie of the MCU, but it was handled perfect. No over crowding, smooth introductions, the story flowed well, cool action sequences... It may have been more an Iron Man movie (or just Avengers) rather than CA as it seemed his role was limited, but whatever. There was no need for a true villain here as subject of gov't involvement and resulting conflict was enough. Another great installment in the MCU."
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,Everyone's motivation is so contrived as to be unwatchable.  How did Tony Stark become so dumb?  Or Capt. America?  Or any of them.  Just a mess.  I now feel like Marvel is just stealing from us and feels no obligation to even try to make a good movie any longer.
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War marks the end of the Captain America trilogy of Marvel films.  It simultaneously brings an end to the story that started with Captain America:  The First Avenger while also serving as a jumping off point for Phase 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

With a run-time of 2 hours and 37 minutes, Civil War uses every bit of that time to tie up all the emotional loose ends of the past 5 years of Marvel movies.  A daunting task for the Russo Brothers and writers' Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely,  but they succeeded by delivering an epic morality tale centered around the two biggest names of the MCU.

Picking up right after the events of Age of Ultron, the Avengers team is called into question after a botched mission causes innocent casualties.  This leads 116 countries drafting the Sokovia Accords, asking all superheroes but namely the Avengers, to register themselves and be held accountable to a government sub-committee.  Naturally, as the title of the movie implies, this causes some mixed feelings in the group.

Civil War gets its title from the famous Marvel Comics run of the same name, but make no mistake, this is a Captain America movie that manages to surpass its predecessors in nearly every way; from action, to storytelling, and especially emotion, you believe that every hero in this film is keeping it 100 and over the course of the film it's easy to find yourself either supporting or sympathizing with both sides of this internal superhero soap opera.

Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) believes that since he and his fellow Avengers are the only ones capable of stopping world threatening disasters, having a group of figureheads control their freedom and decision making process could end up in resulting in more loss of life.  Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.), having eliminated his own companies weapons programs in light of seeing what unchecked power can do, disagrees with his long time friend, and their divide splits the Avengers crew into two camps.

That divide is deepened after a bomb goes off at the Sokovia Accords signing event, and the implicated culprit is Cap's old friend, Bucky Barnes aka The Winter Solider (Sebastian Stan).  This event springboards the balancing act of the film; incorporating the spy thriller aesthetic of the Captain America films, and the all-out action of previous Avengers titles, the Russo Brothers succeeded in laying out pieces of story candy and emotional levity in a natural way that rarely feels forced or out of place.

A common complaint against these superhero packed films is the fair distribution of screen time for each character, and how they contribute to the overall emotional impact of the story.  The luxury this movie has is that the movies before it have already built those characters; we know who they are, where they're motivations lie, and how that influences their decision making in these times of internal crisis.  Each character's choice of side and the reasoning behind it was never surprising, and when your movie is built around such a diverse cast, the solid foundation built in the previous movies greatly helps each individual scene and aleaves any potential psychological confusion for their characters and the audience watching them.

Newcomer Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) will have his own solo film to flesh out his character, so he's given the simple motivation of vengeance against the man he believes killed his father.  Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision (Paul Bettany) play a conflicted couple struggling with what they each believe is the right way, but unable to come to the middle for the betterment of each other.  Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and War Machine (Don Cheadle) are loyal to Steve and Tony, respectively, and that friendship is unwavering even if they don't necessarily agree with the lengths each is willing to go to to complete their goals.  Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) can't turn off being a double agent and her fluctuating moral compass works for and against our title heroes when its suits the, or her own, greater good.

Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), and your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man (Tom Holland) join the fray but are mostly there to fill out the respective rosters for the movie's biggest set-piece fight at an airport terminal, and without a doubt, the best action sequence in the MCU to date.  Each heroes abilities and tricks shines through with epic grandiosity, and though it does run a little long, you are never bored.

There's a villian in this movie, Colonel Helmut Zemo (Daniel Bruhl), and by the end of the movie you understand his motivations and why he has a grudge against the Avengers.  Unfortunately, it falls flat.  The movie could have created the same tension relying solely on the plots of the previous movies and sticking in a completely random character instead of a villian that only die-hard Marvel fans would appreciate.  However, this is a Captain America movie first, and Zemo helps bridge the gaps between fights and keeps Steve, and the audience, focused on finding out who framed his friend.  It would've been nice if the writers hadn't shoehorned the cliche of the main characters figuring out the true evil in the last 30 minutes, but it was used as a means to the create the climactic end.

After the superhero dust has settled, the MCU is divided and the impact of the events of the film should ripple into the Spider-Man and Black Panther solo films, and in 2 years when Avengers:  Infinity War Pt. 1 releases.  The impact of the film is somewhat dampened by another movie cliche that I won't spoil, but is ultimately not an overall detriment or takes away from the last 2 hours and 30 minutes.

In conclusion, Captain America: Civil War is the best superhero movie to date.  Combining the emotional and political intrigue of the previous Captain America films, along with the action and set-piece moments of an Avengers movie, the Russo Brothers achieved what many have tried but none have succeeded at.  A near perfect 1:1 of a comic book to the screen, packed with action and emotional resonance that builds upon itself as natural as what would happen when one turns a panel.  The new bar has been set and its an Amazing start to the summer movie season."
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"With Captain America: Civil War, Marvel has sent an open letter to Zach Snyder and DC Comics.  ""Dear morons, This is how you make a movie in which heroes fight each other.  Note that this movie has a coherent, intelligent, believable plot, fantastic effects and action, and yet manages to also include humor, romance, drama, and shocks.  Also note that it is not a joyless wonder.  You idiots.""

At a running time of just under 2 1/2 hours, I found myself saying, ""It's already over??"" when the credits rolled.  That was how engaging the plot was.  The acting was also astounding; not an easy feat with a cast larger than the starting line of most professional football teams.  Character motivations are clear, well developed, logical, and (most of all) believable.  You can find yourself standing on either side of the civil war, and feel justified in your decision.  Those motivations provide the fuel for the fire that drives most of the action.

Not that the movie is perfect, however, and it is in the action itself that I find the largest flaw in the movie: shakycam.  I would gladly, for two cents, strangle the sick, silly jerk who first came up with the idea of filming a fight with a handheld camera and shaking it so much that it's nearly impossible to see the action.  Fortunately, it is not overdone, and they do not use too much jumpycam, so the action remains comprehensible and appreciable.

And FUN.  Wisecracking and deadpan lines are interspersed into the fights, keeping what could be a depressing work of friends fighting friends into one that still manages to stay upbeat, though you still find yourself wishing they could all just get along.

The movie plays very well to those who are intimately familiar with the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and even better with those who have a familiarity with the source comics.  But even people who are unfamiliar with those should still enjoy this film if they have at least seen the previous Marvel movies.  (Those who have not will have a few questions, no doubt.)

Be sure to stay through the credits, as well.  There is the usual mid-credits extra scene for which Marvel has become so very famous/infamous, and in this one there is also an end-credit scene that more than makes up for the lame Howard the Duck scene at the end of Guardians.

As always, your mileage may vary."
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This movie is what a superhero movie should be.   In a film filled with so many wonderful things, perhaps nothing was as well-done as managing to weave so many characters so seamlessly.  Each not only had a chance to shine, but also felt completely believable.  You not only know where everybody stands; you know WHY they stand there--and it feels completely natural.  It's a superb movie, and one worth seeing multiple times.  Go.  You won't regret it."
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,Loved it so much I saw it twice in less than 48 hours.
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,May be the greatest Marvel movie ever
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The best comic movie I have ever watch. the Russo brothers directed another gem, as they did with winter soldier. A definite must-see even if you are not familiar with MCU."
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,best comic book movie ever
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This is the best superhero movie made. A lot of people will not see the depth of what is going on in this movie because they might not know the characters in detail. The storyline is extremely complex (in a good way) dealing with vengeance, loyalty, friendship, freedom, security and politics. The action is really impressive. I want to see this movie 4 times."
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Epic fun, definitely plan on owning this one."
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"So disappointed ! The second movie was great, but the third one...well, it has committed the worst crime that is possible for a comic-book based movie: it was boring, 2.5 hours of boring nonsense. 
I don't know what the screenwriters were smoking, but they definitely didn't share it with the actors, who did look like they'd rather be somewhere else right now."
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best of de best...intense
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Russo Brothers strike again with an intense political thriller. Well choreographed action scenes, quality acting by the lead actors, good build up and fantastic spiderman. Only flaw in this potential masterpiece is Baron Zemo and some questionable choices by characters."
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Not only is Captain America: Civil War the super hero antidote to this years horrid Batman vs. Superman: Dawn Of Justice, it may just be the best superhero film to be released since the almost decade long fixation Hollywood has had with superhero films since Iron-Man began."
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"the story is anorexic compared to the comics it is based on. RDJ shines the acting is cool, the anorexic plot is solid... but it doesn't deserve to be called civil war. it is more of a misunderstanding..."
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,this movie is by far the greatest comic book movie ever shout to the cast and Russo brothers ..for keeping a wonderful balance movie...
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"A Marvel Cinematic Universe delight one should not miss,,"
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,best superhero movie since the 2002 spiderman movie
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America Civil War - 
The systematic dumbing down of a great comic book story to make it more palatable for a generic move going public. 

Lots of new ways to throw old punches, A few surprises and a really great spiderman . Overall a fun way to spend a few hours but nothing i will remember for years to come #brainonpause

"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This movie may be a little overrated, but it was very enjoyable. The action scenes were choreographed incredibly and the plot was smarter than the usual Marvel film. The plot was a little cluttered at times and the motives of the various villains were kind of unclear. It was also hard to follow for those who didn't know much about the Marvel universe. But it wasn't bad. (Also, where are Thor and Hulk?)"
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Was weird Winter Soldier for knocked out when the helicopter crashed, but it moved the story along, and why is that they avoid calling each other their comic book names, like Cap called Black Panther ""your highness"" rather than Black Panther, which woulda been much cooler, and then Black Panther should've known who Hawkeye was, and the Baron Zemo should've called Iron Man that instead of ""Mr. Stark.""  The opening fight scenes seemed a bit choreographed, but the fighting got better as the movie progressed, and there was classic themes in the movie straight from the comics, as was the Cap and Iron Man's stalemate scene was a classic moment in the books, loved it."
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,This movie was fun and entertaining I wish they nailed the last two ironman the same way they have nailed the last two captain America movies but having tony stark as such a big part of civil war made up for it! Spider man was amazing ! Ant man is official an avenger!! This movie is what avengers 2 shoulda been !! Love it who ever gives this a bad review needs to slap there mother for giving birth to them ð???
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This Movie was an absolute joy ride, the Emotion within each character, the setting, the stakes and what it's all come down to. the way that they introduced new players such as Black Panther and Spider-Man was beautiful, having that emotional yet still action packed plot and along with a few laughs. That Airport Scenes were a work of art, putting Avenger against Avenger. I can Honestly say this is the best Marvel Movie and I would gladly see it again."
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America : Civil War was to no surprise, amazing! I admit that I enjoyed this more than Batman v Superman yet I feel these 2 shouldn't be compared. Anyway, this movie is solid and a good addition to the MCEU, I must admit that this is my first MCEU movie that I have watched in awhile, I didn't watch the previous movies other than Iron Man 1, 2 and 3. As beautiful and emotional this movie can get, it has flaws like every other movie. Go watch this movie if you haven't already, it'll make u get more into the MCEU or Marvel in general."
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"""Wow!! A Super-Hero movie"" days are gone with one releasing every month
and the interest levels getting saturated with the audience. In these
times, the studios, artists and technicians are always trying to find
ways to out-do each other, come up with something fresh and innovative
each revision which sometimes work. Marvel seems to be a clear winner
in the genre war against DC which seems to be imploding with its
heavy-handedness continuing the strategy successfully used by
Christopher Nolan in the Dark Knight trilogy. On the other hand, Marvel
seems to have understood the pulse of its mass audience better and kept
churning out blockbusters with relative ease - but not sure how long
the same strategy works.

The storyline is very close to ""Dawn of Justice"" and many other recent
superhero ventures dealing with people's tolerance towards vigilante
justice and accountability for collateral damage. After an operation to
thwart a mercenary from stealing a bio-hazardous virus goes bad in
Lagos, Nigeria leading to deaths of innocent civilians, the Avengers
are held accountable and an accord is passed to give control of their
missions to a UN committee. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and Natasha
a.k.a Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) sees reason in this request and
plays ball but not Captain America (Chris Evans). When a bomb explodes
in the accords convention at Berlin, and Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan)
comes out as a prime suspect, battles lines are drawn and each member
of Avengers are forced to take sides.

What Marvel is getting right in the Avengers series is the treatment -
after all these characters and story lines are straight out of comic
books. While they try to build mature character arcs and brings in a
serious plot involving death of some characters, the treatment is still
on the lighter note focused solely on quick and cheap entertainment. If
a viewer takes especially this storyline seriously, there couldn't be a
sillier premise with the two groups of Avengers fighting each other but
not seriously enough to hurt each other. Another attribute that Marvel
has been doing so good is how to write a script that gives enough
screen time and importance to this plethora of characters.

Starting with the technical departments, the special effects are slick
and on par with other recent movies. A special credit goes to the
writers for coming up with a smooth screenplay with so many characters
each having their space. While it features some of the best actors that
Hollywood could offer, there isn't enough in the script which requires
them to play out of their skin. Most of the actors are veterans in this
series who has established characters and mannerisms, so rather than
indulging in their performance analysis - I would rather go over some
new characters in the Avengers series. Chadwick Boseman as Black
Panther doesn't come off as menacing as he wants to be without the
costume, but the effeminate mannerisms with the costume makes it highly
inconsistent. Paul Rudd (Ant-Man) has built his entire career on his
comic timing and the writers have ensured they leveraged the most out
of it. However the revelation has been how good Peter Parker a.k.a.
Spider-Man (Tom Holland) has been integrated into the Avengers universe
with lots of wit, charm and heart - which the web wielding audience
favorite is know for. Overall the pace is brisk, the battle scenes of
the actual premise is entertaining and silly at the same time while
other action scenes are worth a watch, the actors seem to be having a
good time and it shows in their performances. The makers have
overstayed their welcome for sure with the repetitive gags and banter
between their lead characters across multiple Marvel movies, I am not
sure if I am ready for more of this.

Entertaining and silly at the same time while the writers manage to not
make a mess out of this huge ensemble cast."
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,best marvel movie yet
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,esta muy recomendable
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Marvel does it again with another in the Avengers storyline. This time it's a battle between Ironman and Captain American against a backdrop of public outrage due to past carnage during Avengers vs bad-guy battles. The characters are reasonably well developed, the story is plausible and the superhero cross-over is refreshing. Kudos to the Marvel Universe for its ability to sustain itself this far. However, its essence is not as fresh as it once was."
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,Spiderman was the glue.... erhm or web... that held this movie together! :)
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best Avengers movie yet & amazing new Spider-man and Black Panther!
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I thought it was decent but not great.  I liked the plot line to have a government oversee and direct them, it added a couple of cool new characters, and it was loaded with stars.  But, it got quite repetitive with all of the fighting and a little overlong.  I'm not very excited to see the next one. 7/10"
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,Captain America - hands down the best Marvel since Guardian of the Galaxy. Non-stop fun and action. Can't wait to see it again.
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Outstanding must see film,  Wait! - a must see three times film!"
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,One of the best Marvel movies to date.
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"GODDAMN!  I feel worn out....and ready for a #WinterSoldier solo movie. Aside to Warner Bros:  THIS IS HOW YOU MAKE A MOVIE ABOUT HEROES FIGHTING EACH OTHER.

 You give them each real issues and valid, but conflicting points of view so the story is actually a little complex; it's not wholly clear at the end who ""won,"" and you have something to think about when you get home.

This was the Avengers II we should've gotten.  They even included a variant of my favorite speech from the Civil War comics ""event"" !"
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Very overrated. Communication was so unreal, that the plot seemed to be just a cluster. Action scenes were okay, but nothing better than the previous Marvel films."
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"A visually and narratively entertaining movie that not only brought all our favorite Marvel characters to one place, but also gave them clear motivations. It's the Avengers movie Age of Ultron couldn't quite be and so much more."
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It's great to see a movie series  that actually progresses its character's story line( although it does nothing to advance the Avengers infinity stone plot line). An awesome stand alone action flick. 

Gripes:

Aside from the Mandarin or any other villain from the Iron Man series, this villain is the lamest thus far- they could've so easily tied Loki or heaven forbid introduce a new villain from the INFINITE ROSTER of villains available from Marvel Comics. 

Where are Thor, Hulk and Nick Fury?

Where are the guardians of the galaxy?

WHY IS IT SO HARD TO CONNECT THESE FILMS OUTSIDE OF AN AVENGERS MOVIE????!?!?!?!?!"
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"although some good action,humor, and fairly decent story, the movie falls completely flat in final act. story is obviously a set up for next avengers but just had no danger to fight ,just internal drama....weakkkkkkkk.   almost dozed off a few times.  not aweful just Extremely anticlimatic."
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,Great movie again. But it still hasn't beat the first Avenger. Chris Evans never broke character or seemed out of character. I must say that this has been on of Marvels biggest battles ever.

"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This movie was full of adventure, it was funny, it was full of people with good acting skills or I certainly enjoyed their skills.

Certainly worth watching."

"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Rooted deep in the human drama of what makes us tick, and filed to the brim with brilliant action, gorgeous spectacle, humor and emotion, Civil War is one of the greatest Marvel films yet, and one that grows more intelligent the more you think about it."
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,It is good but I think a little too much was going on.
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This is a great movie and a great superhero film because for the first time in a long time, all of the action scenes actually had me excited. Other superhero film's action sequences have become so textbook and uninteresting that they ultimately become boring. Yeah sure, it would be easy for me to make fun of DC here but even in something like Age of Ultron the action scenes are enjoyable, they didn't really blow me away. All the action scenes here had me on the edge of my seat. The chase scene through the streets of Berlin, the battle in Lagos and the airport battle were all fantastic! Big thumbs up to the excitement factor. But every action film has to have it's drama and I like it here. Although I may not have liked the premise as much as The Winter Soldier's, Civil War's story does have enough intrigue to keep me watching. It also gave me some twists that I should have seen coming the more I thought about it so props to the movie for that. Overall, this is a very well made action superhero flick. One of Marvel's better entries. Also, best Spider-Man we've ever had on screen."
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This is what happens when you put virtually the same plot and script to Batman vs Superman into the hands of a capable Director. Replace Batman with Tony Stark, Superman with Captain America and Winter Soldier, Lex Luthor with smart, mysterious agenda man (won't spoil), and in the end say... ""You know what? We don't need a Doomsday in this film... or Doomsdays... as it were"" and you essentially have the same film.... but good; very, very, good"
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"No disrespect to DC Comics, but Captain America: Civil War is much better than Batman V Superman. It was executed better in regards to how super-heroics can have serious consequences, including innocent lives being lost."
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,So awesome. Captain America is my hero.
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,saturated with your favorite Marvel heroes and boasts a solid narrative/theme on what friendship truly means.
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,Great movie!! Still not as good as Avengers 1
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,Saw this with my wife and some friends over the weekend. I think this movie is the best comicbook movie so far.  The action is amazing and the plot twists will knock you off your feet.  SEE THIS MOVIE!!
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"One of the best MCU films so far, CIVIL WAR balances its big cast with a compelling story, fast action and moments of humor. This is the movie that will change future MCU films in the future. Its themes of friendship and loyalty are at the center. The movie does a good job presenting both sides of the coin and it never tries to favor one over the other. The highlight is the airport fight which includes Ant-Man and the introductions of Spider-Man and Black Panther. But with all the characters, this is still a Captain America movie, with Bucky and Iron Man being two of the strongest supporting characters. It doesn't matter which side you choose, we all win at the end. 

Grade: A-"
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,This should have been called Captain Ameirca: Pain and Anger Management.  It was long and lacking in heart.  Typical comic book fluff with little humor.
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,Felt like watching an overly long made for TV movie.
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,It's Marvel! What's not to like. I will say this is probably one of the bleakest of the Marvel franchise. Really exciting and fun to watch in the theatre. Sorry no spoilers.
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Great movie, it's just impossible for me to believe that Captain America could ever beat Iron Man in a fight. That made it difficult for me to fully enjoy the movie."
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Let's get these out of the way first. The action scenes, particularly early on, rely heavily on quick-cuts & have a shake to them that can be disconcerting. It is a little too convenient how the climax plays out, with all the necessary players converging on one spot when there really was no particular reason for them all to be there. It also may be a bit heavy on the in-fight quips, as while I expect that from Spider-Man, it does seem like there's a bit too much between the others as well. It's also slightly convenient how the airport was evacuated so quickly, but at least there's a narrative reason FOR it to be evacuated.

That said, what a breathe of fresh air this was. For my complaints about the fight sequences, I really didn't have trouble following the action at any point, as it's more in the style of the Bourne movies, where there are enough long shots that you can tell what's happening. There is a LOT happening here, but the film manages to weave it's two central stories -- differing views on oversight for the Avengers, and Cap trying to prove Bucky's innocence in a bombing -- into a single complementary narrative. I'll admit both Ant-Man and Spidey seem a little tacked on, but even then the reasons for their presence make enough sense that it's not jarring. Black Panther's introduction is phenomenal, and his character's appearance, movement, and even sound design is so well done at times you swear you are watching a cat hunt it's prey. The fight scenes, with the possible exception of the first which is really a re-introduction to some of the new Avengers, are all great, and they have enough confidence in their visual effects crew to have them take place mostly in daylight. The big battle involving all of the Avengers (save Thor and Hulk) is outstanding. Best of all, though, it never really does paint either the Cap-vs-Tony battle as being wrong, as you do understand why each feels the way they do, and neither is fully correct either. Moral ambiguity played well.

At the risk of a minor spoiler, I am a bit disappointed though that it didn't take one big risk. Whereas another film went down that road way too soon, here it's the thirteenth film in the series; I do wish they had pulled that trigger. No, I'm not counting Quicksilver in AoE. I also wish they had fleshed out Cap's reasons for objecting to the oversight more, as there are certainly enough historical reasons for him to be distrustful (HYDRA, anyone?). It spends a lot of time justifying Tony's position, but it seems to just assume Cap's is going to be the default.

Still, for me, this was extremely satisfying. It's not my favorite MCU film -- that's still Guardians of the Galaxy -- and I'm not even sure I like it more than The Winter Soldier, but it's up there."
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This is definitely the best movie I have seen this year. Funny, so funny that you need to see it again to catch all the jokes bc people were laughing too hard to hear the other jokes. In the first 15 minutes I knew it was better than batman v superman. The Black Panther, Spiderman, and Antman are amazing. It was like if Jason Bourne had superpowers. Only 2 things keep this movie from being perfect. 1. There was a lot of shakey cam in the first act. 2. There were some slow parts, but they were still good. Winter Soldier was my favorite marvel movie, civil war might of just eeked it out to be better. It was amazing."
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Packed with interesting characters, good acting, the fundamental dilemma the story stands on is interesting. The only bigger flaw the movie has is the one which it shares with all Marvel movies - too many explosions and too few conversations. As a result, character development suffers and ethical dilemmas are explored a bit shallowly.

I'm still praying for a Marvel movie which will not primarily try to attract Transformers fans but rather aim for success at the Oscars."
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,I liked it better than Superman vs Batman
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"If this had been billed as Marvel: Civil War, I might not have the nagging feeling that the lead character was under-served. Having said that... this is a remarkable movie. That it does not crumble under the weight of it's own plot & excess of super-heroes is a testament to the brothers Russo as directors. It's a more satisfying picture than Avengers: Age of Ultron, and Black Panther/ Spider-Man do, in fact, steal the show."
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,Just amazing.  The fastest 2 hours 26 minutes.  I wish it was longer and can't wait for the next one.
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The kind of movie other superhero movies wish they could be. 
I have found the Captain America movies to be a cut above most hero movies so I had high expectations for this one and it was easily one of the best. 
Marvel does a phenomenal John of tying movie plots together and this one tied a bunch up nice and neat, especially the last Avengers movie. 
Although it was titled, Captain America, it could have been called , Iron Man 4 with its deep dive into Tony Starks personal life and history. 
This movie in no way paces the comic series which would have probably not translated well on the big screen anyway. The concept was used with far fewer characters than the comics and the ones that were used pretty much followed over in the movie with regards to their allegiances. 
The movie ends well and ties things up quite well I felt. The teaser after the initial credits was okay though I'm not sure what it was leading to for future movies other than to reinforce the new characters."
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,this movie was way too long and the moral of the story was zero accountability.   how disappointing!
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Great movie, the action-fight scenes are awesome."
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Fabulous. I love the integration of the characters. The storytelling is stupendous and nonstop. I like how throughout the movie there's tension somewhere, even to the bitter end. And the moviemakers have created curiosity, if not tension, as to what's next. They've got me interested."
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Great movie, lots of twists and turns, keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole movie. Great to see some of the new heroes as well."
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The Russo brothers deliver a spectacular superhero showdown with beautifully choreographed action, deep characterisation, and a welcome thematic resonance. I had written off the MCU; it was a very pleasant surprise to discover it still has some legs."
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,Totally Awesome Movie!
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,Too much hype.  Fun movie But Overdone philosophical conflict. I am more impressed with premiss of  Captain America Winter Soldier as it plays into my paranoia
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,Saw it twice in three days
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best Marvel movie for sure. I loved how they were able to make it in a way that it was tough to choose a side. I still think it's tough for non-comic book fans to e really buy into these films. It was cute my friend thought that Hawkeye was Green Arrow but she knew who Spider-Man was.
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It's good, nothing out of this world, when they fight each other is what we're waiting for the whole time and is over in about 20mins maybe, but overall yes gotta go see it, but for me no repeats"
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,This is the best performance in a Marvel film for RDJr since Iron Man. There are too many characters but the Russo brothers deliver one of the best SH films to date.  I'm surprised more critics aren't calling out Marvel for not calling this movie what it is: An Avengers sequel.
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"As the MCU goes, this movie is damn near perfect. I really REALLY enjoyed it!"
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,By far the best Marvel Studios film you will see.Only complaint is you want more. So many rich characters with important growth that it leaves you wanting more.
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War is intense, emotional, and in a way realistic that not only ascends from its prior installment but the cinematic universe as well. The performances are amazing and the chemistry between the cast is incredible and definitely translated well on screen."
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War is hands down the greatest superhero blockbuster in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It balances comedy, action and a well-developed storyline that creates nothing short of a masterpiece. Where other franchises have stumbled and failed, the MCU has risen to the occasion, showing us that superhero movies are capable of more than what others are led to believe.

9/10"
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,Better than Age of Ultron. Awesome movie
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,One of the best cinematic adventures I have seen in a while! With action storyline feelings drama everything I could even begin to imagine was there! Just awesome
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Warning: Spoilers ahead.
I thought judging by money wasn't the ""right"" way to judge a movie. If we're judging according to what matters.. It was typical Marvel / Disney. Bright and colorful with a few laughs and some drama. The score was the same ol same ol. Story was simplistic: A man who lost his family and wanted revenge. Thats it? Really? After Black Panther (who was actually bad-ass) caught the guy, then the end of the movie just hurried it's way along. Not very deep or complex, but then Marvel isn't trying for that audience. Its all about sales right? The action scenes were great. IF you liked age of Ultron, then you'll enjoy this. Age of Ultron was better the second time around. Civil war? well... lets just say I absorbed it all much easier. No need to see it again. This was enjoyable and worth watching but please.. stop saying best Marvel Movie ever. Guardians was a better movie.
Who really owns rotten tomatoes.com?"
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,This is the best Marvel movie we've been given. It hits the right notes at every single turn. Everyone is involved for a reason there is always motivation for that person being involved and the villain of the movie is fantastic. If you're tired of each villain just being a different version of the hero then you'll love this villain. Its just a fantastic movie. Its all you've ever wanted in a super hero movie.
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,Favourite Marvel film to date.
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,A wonderfully-crafted introduction to Phase 3 that takes the series in a new direction.
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,Those fight scenes are epic. Each fight scene grabs the essence of the character perfectly.
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Very well done. Action sequences and the incorporation of characters, especially Spider-Man, were very well done. Good use of comedy at points, but the movie does drag out a little. I thought the choice of ""villain"" was interesting. Bruhel was very good in that role."
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Freaking awesome.  Didn't want to see it, hate to see my favorite characters fighting each other but this was perfect. A movie that after you see it, you want to see it again."
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I just found out Marvel fanboys are flooding this site and others and giving Civil War 5 stars. It's a 2 1/2 star movie, but because of the idiots that prompted me to go see this movie early today, I'm giving it 1/2 star. I should have waited for the DVD to come out, but ""no"" I had to go see this great, great movie. Me and my two friends were utterly disappointed. It's too long and ultimately not worth the time and money. Go see the Jungle Book or Zootopia!"
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Following up what was a spectacular sequel, ""Civil War"" is a mighty third installment of a series that no one could have foreseen being this good. Philosophy and ideology are questioned and tested, and the undertone of political divisiveness is a strong parallel to that of the real world. Atop these noteworthy attributes are some fantastic action sequences that make this one of the definitive comic book films ever made. A superb entry into Marvel's growing library of films."
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,really good plot and action
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"There's about 20 minutes of a good movie with Cap, Buckey, and Iron man.  The rest is just boring"
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"this was bad movie, the script was terrible how can capitan America let live winter soldier. so wrong too many characters fighting to save this man 
too much really I expected a better ending!"
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"If you've seen one Marvel movie, you have seen them all."
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I say let the fanboys have their crap, but as for the rest of us, let's save our money. Maybe then we'll get less and less of these average to bad movies! Don't fall for the hype. This is not a great movie or even a good one!"
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Didn't knock me out of my socks, but still enjoyable.  Felt like a better follow-up to the first Avengers movie, than the actual Avengers sequel."
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,HOLY S@#T! That was a pretty awesome movie. It had you hooked all the way through. I loved the GIANT surprise at the airport.
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,this was definitely the best Marvel film made so far. my son and I may see it again
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The Captain America films are always more serious in tone for a Marvel film, and rightfully so with it's main character carrying the weight of the world and pure righteousness on his buff (praise ð???) shoulders. Civil War is the best evolution of this series, yet. The critics are right - the themes are emotionally satisfying. Action sequences are done well. The cast of actors deliver nonstop strong performances. And come on, Marvel listens - the diversity in heroes is better than ever. AND this is the best Spiderman, yet. I applaud the choice to make him younger and closer to the source material in dialogue and persona. And Black Panther, wow. What a great addition. I'd thought those retractable cat claws (that reminds me of the manicure that is in vogue right now ð??±ð???) comical until I saw Chadwick Boseman's BP. ð???

Overall, while full of action, Civil War plays like a slow burn for me with the storyline unraveling in a rare way. I wouldn't go as far as to describe it as complex, but pretty damn intricate for a ""superhero film."" I am pretty satisfied.

Only complaints are 1. It's definitely an Avenger's film thinly veiled as a Captain America marquee but is this really a bad thing? 2. I'm slightly uncomfortable with the amount of violence movies now accept as normal - esp once I realized that holy shit, Spidey is like 16 and literally caught up in violence, nbd. Talk about inception.

I'll end this long post with honestly, I couldn't stop singing ""friendship never endssss ~"" in my head throughout the film - Vengeance. Redemption. Trust. Friendship. It never ends."
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,The best yet what a way to inter new super heroes into the mix and how the government try's to take over control of something they know nothing about. It gets better and better the more I watch it.
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Atrocious, bloated, iterative Marvel genre piece wherein there is some conflict that divides the Avengers, and they set against each other in foolish battle scenes.  At 2 1/2 hours this tests the resolve of any mortal.  The mind deadening quality of the dialogue, wooden rendition by the actors, and reliance on violence to settle all problems doesn't help.  Even excellent 3D doesn't help this one.  Leave it to the kiddies and the Trump voters."
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,#CaptainAmericaCivilWar is a non-stop nerdgasm that somehow keeps all the fantastical elements grounded in a thought-provoking political reality. It's crazy how well this movie works. Bravo.
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,this movie exceeded my lofty expectations. tho not true to the comicbooks this film adapts the civil war storyline perfectly to fit the MCU. Tom Holland appears to be perfectly cast as Spider-man..and the introduction of Black Panther is well done. Scarlet Witch and Vision are growing into powerful additions to the overall Marvel universe. everything about this film is spectacular! Excelsior!
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,an overhyped movie with little stakes and fluctuating themes. at time this movie is serious then a few minutes later it turns into a forced comedy. its essentially another movie in this overbloated universe with an ugly air port confrontation while this movie sets up more movies in this universe.
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This is an amazing movie, it make me feel like i was 10 years old again."
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Best Marvel film to date! Spider-Man was ripped straight from the pages of the comics and I love how well they integrated Black Panther and Spider-Man into the story. Although the movie doesn't follow the Civil War story arc from the comics exactly, it's still a must watch not only for marvel fans, but for fans of the superhero genre as a whole. There are also many references that only fans of the comic will understand so be sure to keep an eye out for those."
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Good movie, but somewhat overrated.  I gave it three stars, because it is a good movie, but I say it is overrated because many believe it is the greatest superhero movie ever made.  That, I just don't see.  I read a review where one person said that the reason he feels this way is because of all the superheros in the movie.  Really??  That's how we are going to start rating movies now, by the number of pretty, colored costumes?  In the movies, as in life, quantity does not mean quality.  That being said, it was indeed fun to see all these heroes going at it.  Here's the problem with such a scenario though.... there is never any winner and, this, never any closure.  What I mean is that all these heroes are kicking each other's butts, but they just keep getting back up.  There's a saying in sports....a game that ends in a tie is like kissing your sister.  Well, it feels like all of the fights between heroes in this movie end in a tie. Simply put, I find that incredibly boring.  The other problem with the movie is the story. There are many a simple minded person out there who will see the story as one that is worthy of something greater than a comic book movie, but those people are not really paying attention.  First, the underlying story of why all of this is taking place is as old as movies themselves.  Moreover, it is a direct ripoff of why Wanda and Pietro wanted to kill our heroes in Avengers 2.  Second, Marvel just tried to get way too complicated in this movie, with too many characters, in too many time periods, in too many places.  It's all just too much to keep up with at times.  There are also too many holes in the story.  Slight spoilers ahead..... why were Stark's parents carrying something that special around in an unlocked case in their trunk?  How did Zemo know all about the winter soldier project?  How did Zemo get the funds to do all he did? How did he infiltrate Shield?  How did Cap know where Bucky was living?  Why didn't Ant Man simply shrink instead of allowing his legs to get tied?  Black Widow is in a truck when a grenade blows up inside.  It's so powerful that it blows the doors off, yet she's completely fine....how?  And those are just questions off the top of my head.  I had a bunch more while watching the movie. One was this.....at what point are we going to start saying how ridiculous it is that Iron Man can make a suit, or in this movie, a part of one, out of almost nothing?  I realize it was only a glove that he made in this movie, but I'm supposed to believe that everything needed to make it and, moreover, to power it, fits into a small bracelet?  Speaking of Tony Stark.....isn't it a bit ridiculous how much money he apparently has?  At this point it's like he has the same amount as a small country.  The guy spends close to a billion dollars on some project to reconstruct/change his memories.....for whatever reason......and it's nothing to him?  Really??  He then goes on to fund all grants at MIT?  I mean come on, especially since his company no longer makes the same things that made it so successful to begin with.  I realize he's ridiculously wealthy -- his net worth is estimated at 12.5 billion -- but sometimes it's all a bit too much.  Also, when did Falcon's wings become so heavily armed, and is there anything they cannot do?  It's not that it's not cool, and I fully get that we have to suspend reality when watching these films, but doesn't it seems as though Marvel has decided that nothing has to be explained to us anymore? I mean, I realize that in the comics The Vision can phase through objects, but in the movies they never explain how he gets this power.  And anyone saying it is because of the Infinity gem is not paying attention because possessing a gem does not mean you can do anything you like. That's why Thanos needs all of the gems to become omnipotent.  Because each one asked the holder to do different things.  Another thing, Tony Stark can build things that even from a science fiction movie standpoint seem beyond the realm of possibility, but he can't make something so that War Machine can walk again without falling?  Speaking of that, wouldn't the beam from Vision that took out WM also have done the same or worse to Falcon?  But if he was just going to take out Falcon's thrusters, why did it blow right through WM's suit?  But look, like I said earlier, even with all of the above I would never say this is a bad movie.  It has the ability to bore one at times with uninspired dialogue, and some of the earlier fight scenes are overkill (i.e. Cap and Bucky in the stairwell was not necessary), but the movie as a whole is definitely entertaining.  It also has the correct amount of laughs (not too many, not too little), something that I've criticized Marvel about in the past.  Would I say to go see/this film?  Absolutely.  Just don't be dazzled by all of the pretty, colored costumes and be prepared for no real winner, and except for WM, no one even getting really injured during a fight that essentially destroys an entire airport.  Moreover, be prepared to not experience that feeling of exhilaration and joy similar to the moment in Avengers when Cap tells Hulk to ""smash,"" and Hulk starts taking out the bad guys with a vengeance, because a) neither character is a bad guy, and b) the hero you are rooting for punches his enemy, but his enemy doesn't stay down??  There is no time in this movie that provides the type of feeling typically associated with other movies of the same genre.  No time to punch the air in triumph and take that sigh of relief knowing your side has won.  No closure."
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Thought  it was was  ok , first two were better . Also thought BvsS  was way  better ."
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,Too much talking. Hard to follow. let spent the movie trying to figure out why they were really fighting. should have been called Avengers: Ego tripping
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"6.3/10, my review: http://wp.me/p1eXom-2p0"
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Fantastic movie! Great way to follow-up what was a disappointing movie in Age of Ultron. The story was fantastic, the introduction to Black Panther and Spiderman were well done. The only issue I had was that they didn't really follow the actual Civil War storyline but that doesn't stop it from being an amazing movie."
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,Pretty entertaining but unfortunately suffered from having to live up to the Joss Whedon legacy.
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,It may have been a half hour too long but the fact that so much of it felt like i was watching a Jason Bourne movie but with super powers was more than a little satisfying.
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,Captain American became a self righteous child. I was annoyed by him throughout most of the movie. The acting was wonderful and the story was good but CA was a baby. Grow up!
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Smart complex story telling with interesting  deep characters and brilliant action.  The film certainly has it's flaws, with some confusing logistics and some hand waving logic.  You can't deny that you are thoroughly entertained.  Just be careful, you might end up with some serious arguments with your friends on the issues presented in the movie."
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best Marvel movie so far.  The fight scene alone is worth the money to see it in the theatre.
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Winter Soldier is the farthest away Marvel has strayed from their stereotypical blockbuster superhero movie; this is what made this movie amazing. It strayed away from the tracking shots of beating up mindless henchmen, or trying to squeeze every single line with a little pun, or inside jokes to get the audience to remember throughout the film, even though they just want to see where and how the Marvel Cinematic Universe will progress. This is what hurt ""Age of Ultron"" and what makes Civil War the best MCU movie I've ever seen, because it does the opposite. Another thing Age of Ultron did that ultimately killed it from being a great Marvel film, was that it tried to set up two films while juggling other events in the film. Civil War was supposedly set up in Age of Ultron, but the set up was so vague it had nothing to do with the actual new film, rendering Age of Ultron useless. Civil War didn't set up anything, that is certainly a rarity for superhero movies now, and aided it in making it phenomenal. The acting was great as usual, but the dialogue and story was just so damn good that it pushed these actors into roles we had never seen before. People will whine, and bitch about the villain, and yes, he was at worst forgettable, but not all bad guys have to be menacing. It worked for the film, and that's all you need when everything else is outstanding. I cannot think of a more worthy rating than an 11 out of 10 for this film. At times, I forgot I was watching a Marvel Movie, and sometimes a superhero movie altogether."
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,Great movie! Loved it!
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,Marvel's best movie yet!! Captain America: Civil War delivers the action and humor better than ever!!
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,simply the best marvel movie yet.. and one of the best movies ever seen.. unbelievable :P
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,the story is thick as lava and keeps you entertained and interested for the entire movie
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,Awesome movie.  If your a comic book junkie or basic superhero fan you will enjoy this one.
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,Great movie. The action and plot were just awesome. A must see film.
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This is an extremely fun roller coaster ride if you're a fan of the recent surge of superhero movies, and even if you're brand new to the genre Civil War does their job of meeting fanboy expectations while also introducing new heroes for general audience members. The beginning might seem to lag just a bit, but once all the players are introduced everything picks right up. I suggest this movie to anyone and especially if you're usually entertained by most action or superhero films.  In two words: Great Flick."
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Yet another incredible installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I had heard/read a lot of things about this film going in, one of those things being that this is essentially just a mini-Avengers film. While it definitely has a large cast of Avengers, this is very much a Captain America movie, with some Tony Stark thrown in. The rest of the cast largely plays a supporting role for those two. The rest of the film falls in line with what we've come to expect from MCU films. Great acting, continued phenomenal character development, incredible action sequences, and bits of humor thrown in just the right places. The first half of the film was a bit slower than I would've preferred but once Spider-Man and Ant-Man come into the film, the rest is perfection. #TeamCaptainAmerica"
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"If you enjoy seeing superheroes hit each other a million times and not feel an ounce of pain, then this over-the-top film is just for you."
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Damn this is a GREAT movie, literally the only thing I didn't like was the giant white text that took over the entire screen when they were telling you what location or year they were in (although that's just me nitpicking), and also I didn't like the fact that it was too good. Like my top three super hero movies of all time would be Batman: The Dark Knight, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and now Captain America: Civil War, the thing is though, Civil war tops all of those movies for me by like 50 percent,  and now I feel like every other comic book movie has to live up to this one, or maybe even top it, which i think will be very hard to do. Granted, this is an event type movie, with like every super hero in the MCU in it, so I don't expect all the stand alone movies to be as good as this (i.e. Black Panther, Spider Man, Captain Marvel, etc.), but now I expect Avengers: Infinity Wars to be this good or even better and so on and so forth."
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best movie so far!!!!!!!!! I believe that each Captain  America sequels get better and better. I love see the new Spider-Man. I enjoy the epic fight scene with cap team vs. iron man team. It was very enjoyable to watch than batman v superman. Overall I love this movie and want to see again. Also this month  the new release x men movie is coming out
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,Excellent! Lots of fun.
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,Way over rated. It was kind of about nothing. There wasn't really a point. I expect a lot more. This. disappointed more than Age of Ultron and Iron Man 3. Spiderman's character was comic relief. I didn't really mind. I actually liked him. Best character was Black Panther. The only redemption. His was the only part that made any sense.
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,This is my favorite movie so far! Spider-man was awesome. Antman and Black Phanter where great to.
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Civil War is what the fans wanted, a real fight between all the marvel heroes, focus on Captain America, all characters have their time to shine, new characters such spider-man and black panther are introduced so good, making you want to see their solo movies."
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,this is one of the best sequels of Captain America.
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,Outstanding!!! Loved every minute.
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Civil War gives us everything that its genre can offer. Awesome fight-scenes, thrilling turn-outs, deep feelings... and a new ally, Black Panther, whose graceful motions are simply stunning. Well, not too manly, but stunning."
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,Movie was boring and way to long. Not enough action for a Super Hero movie.
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,Love this movie. One of the best marvel movies ever
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Civil War is not only the best Super Hero movie ever, it enters into a space of best ensemble movie of the year! 
We have a long way to go and a lot of movies but if you can point out a bad scene or poor performance you paid far too much attention and missed the beautiful picture and lead in to so many more movies on the horizon!  
Batman and Superman are tired and Marvel just keeps swinging for the fences.
This is the best yet!"
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,Tom Holland was great. Black Panther is a stone cold baller.
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Awful movie. Fell asleep twice leading up to the big battle. The fights were shot horrible, shaking everywhere, Robert Downey again the only saving grace. A simple money grab...soundtrack for the movie of this magnitude was also non existent. Save your money!"
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,it's even better than the Winter Soldier which was off da chain. You gotta see it.
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,Just as good as we were all hoping. Spider-Man was the real star here he stole the show.
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,Awesome movie great action!!
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,It was AWESOME! A dozen times better than that depressing Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,In my top 5 Marvel movies
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"An exceptional film. Topics of family love and loyalty, revenge, accepting responsibility for your actions and others resonate for me. Additionally it sets up Iron Man apart from the rest of his team when the team will need him most, just like in his vision from Age of Ultron."
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,Didn't even make sense
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"MoViews: Captain America - Civil War

Expectations were definitely high - and I'm glad to say that they were definitely met. I've said this before, and I'll say it again. You can have the fanciest special effects, beloved characters, great costumes and cinematography - but without a story, a film can potentially die. The great thing about Civil War is that we have all of the above, with a very well written story to stitch everything together. Even though the movie is over 2 hours long, the storytellers do a good job of keeping things moving at a nice pace.

WARNING!!! SPOILERS AHEAD!!!

Even though it reads like a Marvel-style telenovela, it is definitely well written. The moral ambiguities that tear the Avengers team apart are real for those deeply involved in it, and at the center of it all is Bucky, the Winter Soldier. There is definitely a big on-screen bromance that is the basis of the entire movie. And even before the 'big secrets' are revealed, we are emotionally compromised to take one side or the other. In the writing, the storytellers make sure to pit us against ourselves to ensure we feel what the characters are going through. Both sets of teams (and for argument's sake I'll keep the media's labels as #teamcaptain and #teamironman) are fighting for what they believe is right - and both teams believe that the other side is wrong. And truth be told - they both have a point. 
The writers were also smart in easily eliminating two big hitters from the previous movies: Thor and the Hulk are conveniently not called into this situation. The addition of Ant-man into the story is a well placed move, especially with his new powers. And in place of the two notorious absences, we have some worthy replacements: one with a great story and key character development all the way to the end - easily my favorite addition thus far to the Marvel Universe (#teamblackpanther), and the appearance of a powers-newly-acquired Spider-man with a young acne-visible face and the running of the mouth that makes him famous. However, his appearance is not only refreshing, but endearing. And, by admission through the clip at the very end of the credits, we'll be seeing more of this new Spider-man soon. Now the question remains: with Bucky now safely stored away and in good hands, will the next movie keep the two sets of Avengers split, or are they coming back together to fight a common foe?
We shall see. For now, my opinion: 
Don't Miss It (4 out of 4).
He Dicho."
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"As a comic book fan this movie was not that good. It did not follow the comic books, not even close. It really wasn't that much better than Batman vs. Superman. I guess Disney does own all the critics!"
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Fantastic action, humour, drama and an emotional rollercoaster"
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Marvel did a great job with Civil War plot. Steve Rogers and Ironman have enough screen time to deliver best action. This is serious threat to DC universe.
Spiderman gives good cracking sarcastic joke. Sarcasm battle should happen between Spiderman, Ant Man and Ironman - All man :P
Both post credit scene are good. Expectation for Infinity War is getting high."
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Beginning was to slow for my taste but overall great action and very funny, it's a must see."
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Civil War's greatest strength is its not the Avengers. What I mean by that is that at the heart of this action packed thrill ride is three characters (with a fourth hovering on the outside) and the Russo brothers dos a great job of using the full teams when they needed to then taking them off the table for a gripping final sequence. That's not to say they're discarded. Each character is fleshed out nicely, with show stealing performances from Ant-Man and Spider-Man. Many were weary about how Rudd's Scott Lang would fit into the team, but he comes up BIG in terms of comedy and spirit.

Definitely the greatest MCU thus far."
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"All I have to say is .... AMAZING.... Never has a movie made me scream, cry and twitch. Best superhero movie ever.... Best action movie ever"
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,actually really good wasn't expecting this to be all that good and I was pleasantly surprised
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I came away from this slugfest underwhelmed.  Compared to Bat v Super, I find it hard to understand the way critics have responded to each film.  This installment of Capt. America is my least favorite of the three. It did have great moments and whenever Ant-man or Spiderman graced the screen the movie excelled.  The villains were not well developed and the plot suffered from having to have the villain monologue an explanation at the very end.  Chris Evans was great and this is no reflection on him but more a critique of a confused script and a movie that could not decide what it was.  For parents.... beware, lots of violence with the depiction up close of an assassination of a character's parents."
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This movie had my excitement levels on maximum overdrive so much that I wore a captain America shirt to the theatre and cheered for him like he was Hulk Hogan in the 1980's.
For a marvel fan this movie had it all good acting, good story telling, great characters, great action sequences. I had a nerd-gazzom over that air port scene which was perfect."
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,Ok. But a bit confusing at first
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,Rather than the standard get this item to save the world. It dove head first into one of the either loved or hated marvel comic book topics.
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,A powerful and deep examination of loyalty and friendship. Civil War does what BvS could not do; bridge the gap between the opening sequences and what we all came to see. The newly introduced Black Panther and Spider-Man were a breath of fresh air. Overall it is difficult to deem Civil War as anything other that the best Marvel film yet... since Iron Man.
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,2.27 hs...and you feel the movie is too short and want see more and more! Best Marvel 's yet!
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Loved the movie.
It is a good sequel to the winter soldier.
Marvel has given screen time to each heroes and spidey is one of the best in the bunch.
The conflict we expect among ourselves is there.
Any one going into this movie will be split most definitely on which side was right."
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,Oh so good! Spider man and Black Panther steal the show.
"May 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"What could serve as the detriment to some hero-stuffed movies, actually works to the advantage of Civil War. Part of what is so delightful is how easily the characters, the majority of which weâ(TM)ve come to know over the course of 13 Marvel Studios movies, interact and play off each other. Scarlet Witch using her powers to allow Captain America to super jump into a high-rise building. Hawkeye firing a miniaturized Ant-Man on an arrow inside Iron Manâ(TM)s armor. Spider-Man using his webbing to wrap upâ¦OK that one is too good to spoil here.

After this sequence, which would be an extremely hard act to follow, directors Joe and Anthony Russo wisely dial back the scope of the film. Instead of trying to go even bigger and bringing every single one of our heroes back for a fight against a giant, spiny, CGI glob, the focus shifts to our three main protagonists: Tony, Steve and Bucky. While more than one character manipulates the events of this film for their own nefarious purposes, it all comes down to these characters, ultimately Captain America vs. Iron Man, and their own beliefs, personalities, neuroses and paranoias coming out to play. Tony expresses resentment over how his father, Howard Stark, liked Steve Rogers more than he liked his own son. Steve repeats a line a pre-Super Serum Steve told a group of bullies who were beating him up in an alley (âI could do this all dayâ?).

This is not some hastily assembled superhero brawl to sell more movie tickets; These two have been bickering and brawling over the course of two Avengers movies â"" one of their very first conversations includes Cap telling Stark, âPut on the suit, letâ(TM)s go a few rounds.â? â"" and that all comes to a head over the course of the film, whose finale feels earned rather than a corporate mandate."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Really good movie. Lots of action and a lot of info to process. Favorite parts were anything Spider-Man and Black Panther. Only downside was expecting to see a very important death but didn't :-/
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"'Captain America: Civil War' is the latest in Disney's seemingly endless Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU for short) and the third film in the Captain America solo franchise while also serving as an almost direct sequel to last year's 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' which followed on from 'Marvel's The Avengers' and will soon lead to 'Avengers: Infinity War'. Make sense? While I'm sure nobody needs explaining as to what the MCU is, we have finally reached the definitive point where the casual fan might start to get a little bit confused. ""Why is there a new Spider-Man.... again?"" I've heard many people ask, ""Why is Iron Man the baddie?"", ""When will Iron Man fight Batman or Superman?"" etc. 

Now to the people who ask these questions, this movie is not for you. But of course Disney/Marvel Studios don't mind the fact that you'll watch it anyway, enjoy it, become slightly confused and then go about your lives as if nothing has happened until the next super hero film is released. These movies have become hard to review simply because you have to try and see it as its own film, but that is not what they are anymore. They are all part of a bigger picture, and while that ambition was far more admirable nearly a decade ago when Iron Man took the world by storm, it is still quite a remarkable achievement that they have been able to release consistently... let's say decent, movies every year. I guess you could say now it is more like a TV series with feature-length episodes. 'Captain America: Civil War' is one of the better entries we've seen so far.
For the first time in the MCU it feels like something is at stake. This issue has plagued the franchise and prevented it from becoming so much more than it currently is. Personally, there are some decisions I wish had been changed to really raise the tension to the next level, but compared to what we have seen in the past, this is where things have finally started to pack a bit more of an emotional punch. We knew that we would see Iron Man fight Captain America in this movie, but it's the conflict between Steve Rogers and Tony Stark that breaks our hearts. It's a fresh feeling to actually care who our heroes are fighting and what they are fighting for, with the mandatory 'villain of the week' aspect scrapped this time around, for the most part at least.

The marketing for the film had audiences scratching their heads as to why this film was titled 'Captain America' and not 'Avengers', I can safely say that it definitely is a Captain America (or maybe an Iron Man) film. And thank goodness, because despite featuring what are essentially extended cameos in an undeniably entertaining action sequence, the film definitely would've struggled to keep a strong focus and consistent tone otherwise. The fight scene at the airport was glorious to watch, but it definitely felt like it was from another film. It does feature a few of the Avengers in larger roles, but this is all about Cap and Iron Man and their conflicting beliefs.
 
'Civil War' doesn't necessarily break any ground for the franchise but it is as entertaining an instalment we have seen so far. And most importantly it brings in enough fresh ideas to keep even the slightly more cynical fans interested for at least another round. The Avengers sequences, while insanely entertaining, were a little jarring, and that does not bode particularly well for the upcoming 'Infinity War' two-parter, which feels like it is really going to struggle to balance all of these characters. At the end of the day, you know what you're getting into with this one, so don't expect this to change your mind about super hero movies."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"2hrs of boring Dialog, 10 min of so-called fighting and 16 more minutes of more boring conversation. Snore fest."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I am a big spiderman fan; the new spiderman is fresh and hilarious reminds me of the ultimate spiderman comics.  Black panther was one of the most faithful comic adaptations ever on par with deadpool.  Black widow had some really great fight scenesand showed how strong she is.  Be expecting a black widow solo film!  Scarlet witch got a lot of screen time and they are fleshing her character out which is great!  Iron Man was as solid as ever!  He made the overall story very compelling!  Captain America, Bucky, and falcon were amazing together almost like a little family.  Had some of the best comedy in the movie besides of course spiderman! Antman was sooooooooo awesome great comedy and shows how he can keep up with the big leaguers.  Scot Lang is his own kind of tactical genius especially with is suit. The russo brothers have their sh*t down!  On complaint why didn't Baron Von Zemo have all of his powers.  This movie was great it is a must watch!!!!!"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,This is going to be the best spiderman in the history of marvel. He NAILED that part.. All n all this movie was amazing
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"4.5 to base off other comic book movies from this year so far, not as good as deadpool, way better than bvs."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Everything a superhero movie should be and more.
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Absoulty loved the movie!!!!
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,This movie was so good that it made Ben Affleck cry .
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"great action packed, with well put story line, but lacked some visual effects, and spider man was not well put in the story."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,It was so good. It ripped the heart out of my chest and stomped on. Though I could have done without the really rushed romance between cap and sharon.
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,If Trump wins the election I hope Captain America is the first to cross the border. He kicks ass and I think would look great wearing the maple leaf!
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Although a bit bloated by 20 minutes or so, there's still a lot to like here.  The main battle in the movie's namesake war does not disappoint.  The new characters introduced, especially Black Panther, are compelling.  The action is well directed and the conflicts between the characters (unlike another tent pole this summer - lookin' at you Batman v Superman) are well earned."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,The graphics and the reality of the world was incredibly believable. Acting and stunts were flawless. I especially enjoyed the new Spidey. But how can any Avenger fan enjoy watching them beat on each other. I hated the whole premise of the plot. My favorite part was the first Easter egg.
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Saw CAPTAIN AMERICA CIVIL WAR today--a real knockout! Amazing job by the directors and writers of juggling many characters and giving so many either character arcs or strong bits to advance your knowledge of the characters. Downey is such a fine actor that he sells why he backs the government's side--but you know that Cap knows best! Nice beats from Vision, Ant man and Spider-Man (tho' it's sad to be older than Aunt May!) The villain isn't into world 
domination for a change,'tho some aspects of his plans could be clearer.  The big battle made me squeal like a kid! One of the best super hero films to date!"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Best film in the Marvel universe yet. Really great to see the handle that Fiege and the Russo brothers have on the content, characters and themes. By infusing totally new elements into familiar storylines they have reinvigorated the entire universe, propelling it into new directions for future spinoffs. Highly recommend, and super pleased with my experience."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best Avengers movie so far!!! Loved it.
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,second favorite marvel's film for me right now
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Really fun, but honestly I thought Batman V. Superman was better, only because the Marvel movies are starting to feel pretty much the same. I did love the Spider-Man introduction though, even though it totally feels a little forced (""Oh look, we have the rights from Sony to use Spider-Man now, so here he is!"")."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"A well made movie that isn't afraid to break the rules. Stay to the end, there is a teaser."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,If Banner was there none of this would've happened!
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Third time's the charm as Captain America suits up in an epic and ideological face off with the iconic, joke-slinking billionaire, Iron Man. Marvel is no stanger to a larger-than-life ensemble, but the way Civil War magically weaves together it's magnetically-captivating characters is far more exceptional than both Avengers and the recent blunder of its rival, Batman V Superman. The Captain America sub-series have always been a mature staple of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Civil War both embraces its roots of political entanglement with the sharp understated humor of its more charming guests like Antman and Spiderman. With that being said, the choreography of the many adrenaline-pumping fight scenes are creatively stylish with anÂ attention to detail. In particular, there is an apartment stairwell scene and the final showdown that will have you biting your nails. All of the characters are well established with buyable motivations, which in turn butt heads the motivations of others. This growing web of interactions will lock your attention as the film properly acknowledges the consequences of its predecessors. It's pleasantly enjoyable to witness a Marvel film earn the emotional weight demanded by its story and the characters - something I found to be a work in progress for Marvel in the past. Here, it is exquisitely achieved with brisk pacing and a non-cartoonish approach to its themes and dialogue. The irony is Civil War is everything Batman V Superman should have been. And yes, if you want to be jaded, there are small gripes in midst. Simply put, Captain America is the best in-house Marvel movie to date and an accomplishment in what it wishes to achieve. I'm happy to report more that Civil War is definitely worth your time and money."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Good movie overall but did seem a bit scattered. No so much as BvS, but enough to notice. Would like to see a little more grit brought into the marvel universe."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"CAPTAIN AMERICA WAS GOOD
WINTER SOLDIER WAS GREAT 
CIVIL WAR IS EPIC!"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"while not as compelling as Winter Soldier, Civil War is still an excellent addition to the MCU. it's a bit long and stuffed, but it's never boring and the stuff it's crammed with is pure awesome sauce"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,The movie was a mess. Bad story telling and bad filming. Saw it in 3d and was not worth it.
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Not enough Spider-Man
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"All the nuance of a tank barreling down the highway with a hint of sass and a dash of razzle dazzle; Cap and Co come flying through, guns blazing in an epic sequel with enough explosions, insubordination and belly laughs to make Michael Bay stand up and cheer!"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Howard Stark (	John Slattery): [to a young Tony Stark] You know, they say sarcasm is a metric for potential. If that's true, you'll be a great man some day.

I liked this much better than ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"".  From the beginning, there was non-stop action, while the story arc seamlessly blended in the dialogue.  Thoroughly enjoyable, action-pack and entertaining. Missing a few notable high profile characters- Thor and Hulk, but Spiderman (Peter Parker played by Tom Holland), Black Panther (T'Challa played by Chadwick Boseman) and Ant-Man (Scott Lang played by Paul Rudd) more than made up for the the two mega stars' absence...maybe even made the film better (IMHO).  The storyline was bit more somber in the beginning but midway through the film there was a fair amount of humor; best delivered by ""The Man"" himself-- Stan Lee.  Overall highly entertaining, worthy of the price of admission."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Civil War has lofty goals, perhaps too lofty for audience expectations. But that is where it excels. It gives you almost everything you expect and then breaks your expectations for what popcorn films can achieve."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,I will buy the blue ray of it.
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Will watch again later today.
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The short of it? Hands down the best Marvel Movie ever!! 

OK, the extended NON SPOILER REVIEW (Short of it?) IF you were subjected to the horrible humpback whale after birth / festering elephant carcass in the Nevada desert which was Batman v Superman :Dong of justice then Run to the theater... No seriously GO NOW AND SEE THIS TWICE!!! Stop reading and go now!! 

Still here? Ok,  the balance of characters, humor, action, drama and plenty of laugh out loud moments (true LOL) is impressive! The airport battle scene from the trailers is alone worth the price of admission.  You feel every characters struggle and motivation and the ""battles"" are bloody and people do get #$&@! Up!! 

There's some awesome surprises and now, finally the definitive Spider-Man is on film! He's perfect here! So is Black Panther whom I can't wait to see in his own movie! This movie is EVERYTHING you hope for and sadly everything Bats v Supes wishes it could've been!! I'm down to see it two more times!! GO. NOW!!!!"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"really good, long movie but wanted even more."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Quite possibly the best marvel movie to date.
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,See the movie! It is excellent!
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Great movie.  Surprisingly good. I really enjoyed the characters, and I enjoyed the tension between the good guys when what is ""good"" is sometimes not clear.  This movie is also clever.  Go see it."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Great movie,well put together"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Greatest Comic Book Movie ever!
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Once again Marvel succeeds where DC fails. A tight script that is able to masterfully weave in so many different characters and storylines.
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Another great marvel movie! Easily the best Spider-Man portrayal so far. I am disappointed that they changed another quality villain and made him seem very lame, but over all it was awesome. I could have easily watched another 2 hours and 40 minutes. Second credits scene was the best of all second credit scenes, worth the wait."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Everything that a great superhero film should be. There is a surprising depth of honest emotion that comes from heroes taking responsibility for collateral deaths. After this movie the genre can't ignore the people the on the battleground in the background any more. Then there is great humor throughout and the action is more meaningful and sometimes fun than in any super hero movie to date. This is the best of them all Marvel or DC.
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Hand down the best movie of the year. It was exciting and good from the start to finish. Well crafted! Such a great gift to the fans. 
Thank you for the amazing delivery! 

First movie that I didn't go to the bathroom ð???
(It should not be compared to batman vs superman. There is not comparison to be made!)"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The batman forever of the cap trilogy. Honestly the movie comes no where near as close to the comic that its named after! Its a good movie thats falls to the hype leading up to it. Marvel has had better movies. But at least it had spiderman. If you had issues with bvs, youre gonna have issues with this. & so far, marvel could only get loki, red skull, & obedia stane correct when it comes to its villains."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Ni es la obra maestra que te tiran en este sitio (al dia de hoy 91% de aprobación) y comparación obvia, que BvS fue una película muy mala. Es mas de lo mismo en el universo Marvel (colores fuertes, escenas de acción excelentes, poca solemnidad, ""onliners cancheros"", diversión para las masas), pero por eso no deja de ser entretenida y la verdad que la pelicula ""garpa"" y hay que verla en el cine. Cinematograficamente cumple. Excelente la inclusion de El Hombre Araña (ay ... Marisa Tomeii!) y Pantera Negra. El malvado muy pobre, el desencadenante del conflicto entre Cap America y Iron Man es decepcionante ( y pensar que muchos se reian de Martha en BvS! je). En fin: 8/10 - Medio puntito mas que mis adorados BvS-"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America Civil War, once again by the Russo's brothers at the helm of directing another captain America movie. The russo's his brothers to prove that they can make an excellent avengers movie. Seeing this film brings me joy. Lately when I came out of the movie theater, I came out saying that this is the best Marvel movie I have ever seen in my life. Despise from my favorite all-time favorite superhero film is the dark Knight directed and written by Christopher Nolan. And I never have a second one, but till today. Captain America Civil War is my second favorite superhero phone I have ever seen in my life. And I never once in my life is a marvel fan. I do enjoy reading the comics, from Marvel and DC. I was really hoping for this film to be much better than Batman versus Superman. Citing on from the comic books I was fighting on Captain America. And this is not focus more on the avengers is more focus on the relationship of captain America. There's only one little flaw that did bother me for sex in the film and I was just the main villain. But at the end he had a purpose for being in the film so good for the Russo's brothers for writing that in a very strongly for their film. And for Tom Holland's Spiderman holy crap this is the best Spiderman I have ever seen in the cinematic world of marvel at I am not kidding around here Tom Holland proves to be the best Peter Parker/Spiderman we have ever seen in theater history of Spiderman. As for this film altogether does very well I am extremely excited for the next Spiderman film of Spiderman homecoming and it ventures part one and two by the Russo's brothers I am can't wait for those films to come out and I can't wait to see what marvel can Stirup for its audience. Lazy gentlemen the only movie company that really want to make really good movies but never have a desire of having awards is Disney, and Disney does care for their audience and I do care for Disney what they are doing what the Marvel cinematic world and Star Wars they are doing it right and I am having a smile on my face saying it. Well done Disney and well done marvel this is an excellent film and this is going to be on my top of my list of this year for best films very happy. I extremely recommend seeing this phone before go straight out to Blu-ray in four months or so. And please for the arrivals of DC, which I associate more too. Please learn from Disney's and marvels makings of making a very good cinematic movie of superheroes. Please learn from the Russo's brothers for making out well entertaining and heartfelt movie I was superhero. Christopher Nolan did it right same of the Russo's brothers. 
 
Tom holland you are the man!!

Grade 
A perfect 10"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Interesting story of superheroes with super awesome action sequences, but too many characters have its own false."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,I almost cried from extremes of each emotion throughout the entire movie.
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Well this movie didn't feel right, wasn't feeling the love between Cap And Winter, don't drink the KooL-Aid it was ok."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Fanboys are filling cyberspace with their nonsense. Not worth seeing.
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I have to admit, the Superhero genre is a tough one for me. Not particularly a fan. Civil War has it's moments, though. I loved the new Spiderman. He's a total dork, and that's really lovable. The new incarnations of Spiderman on film, I think, have major potential. Thank God the Andrew Garfield days are over. Also, Paul Rudd is back and funny as ever as Ant-Man."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best comic book movie EVER MADE... And quite possibly... Just flat out one of the best films ever made.
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Overly complicated plot that leaves you asking why
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Must keep thinking about it....
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,This One's Gonna Make You A Fan!
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"meh
ok movie with Great action scenes but abismal plot"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"By far, the best ensemble Marvel movie that has been put together thus. The Russo brothers took upon themselves a seemingly daunting and impossible task and nailed all the beats. If Marvel doesn't hand the reigns of showpiece films off to these brothers after this, I will be very surprised. This felt like a coming of age for the style of movies Marvel has been striving to make. The closest they have come to a swan song for the genre thus far. It nailed the tragedy in a compelling and very human way. I went into the movie expecting to side with Captain America, the ending however provides the gravitas needed to leave the audience leaving  the theater, strongly compelled in rhetorical modes of persuasion by both Team Cap' and Team Stark. It is the tale of two brothers and it is at the same time a tale of contemporary America and the unacknowledged consequences of our lingering imperialism agenda. 
Some may draw issue with the underdeveloped villain in this movie. I would argue that in retrospect of his master plan, he is per-chance, one of the most compelling and human villains to grace the superhero cinema stage in recent memory. The expertise with which he carries out his master plan is wonderfully sophisticated and compelling. 
The highlight of the movie, where it all pulls together and forever cements within my mind that the ensemble superhero movies is something indeed possible and successful is the airport scene roughly halfway through the film. No character is under-utilized or under-appreciated. The signature action-infused comedy which has become Marvels trademark has never been better. Especially with the welcome additions of Ant Man and Spider-Man. 
Speaking of Spider-Man, and oh is he someone that should be talked about, rest assured, Spider-Man has been done right this time round. Although I find the merits in Garfield's performance and Maguire will always be the definitive Peter Parker, newcomer Tom Holland makes a compelling case for himself. The friendly neighborhood arachnid has never had better dialogue. Each line hit with all the paradoxically brilliant wit, awkwardness, intellect, and humor that fans of the comic books have been yearning for so long. It will be interesting to see how more screen time given to the face behind the mask will pan out (my hope is equally on-point).
As a further testament to the crew behind these movies and the masters at the helm: the Russo brothers, Black Panther and Spider-Man were introduced and developed to the necessary level while at the same time avoiding detraction and unnecessary sidelining of the main plot. If anything is a testament to the films mastery, this seemingly small matter, I would in fact argue is the films greatest boon. 
And while the film does have it's flaws, particularly an easily resolved issue at the end after the main climax, these hitching points are far and few between and are as unnoticeable as they have ever been. My only lingering complaint: this is not a Captain America Film, but damn if it needs to be."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Captain America: Civil War truly ranks as one of the best films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the superhero genre!!!
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Perfect.  What a phenomenal film in every way.  Character development, pacing and action sequences are all top notch."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,One word: Excellent!
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"If you have watched the trailer, you have watched the movie. Only those who go to movies to see some SFX action will like this movie. This ain't civil war. This ain't even war. This is just a dog fight over a stupid thing. The actual civil war (from comics) was nasty, much bigger while this one felt like a ego fight between Iron Man and Captain America. Externded version of what you see in the trailer is what you get in the movie. There is nothing more to it."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,I enjoyed this movie enough to score it 3.5.  Without tossing any spoilers out just yet I will just say they did and did not do some things that would have made this movie that much more in my opinion.
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"the action, comedy, plot, and characters were all done perfectly. best marvel movie by far!"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,The best Marvel movie so far.
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I love all of the Avenger related movies, but this one just didn't do it for me.The storyline and cinematography lacked. I'd call it a B- / C+"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Can't even lie the movie was great. Aside from two minor complaints I can't really say anything bad about this film
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It was amazing. Fun but intense. Definitely Avengers 2.5 but awesome movie. Tom Holland is a great Spider-Man, Black Panther was great. Bring on phase 3!"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Honestly a perfect movie had nothing but fun watching it!
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Marvel did it again! They just keep getting better and better! So much I could talk about, so much happened and every bit of it was better then the next. They introduced Spider Man, and nailed it! Black Panther, again nailed it!  The writing....phenomenal!  Casting, couldn't of been better and the direction, great!  They're firing on all cylinders here in this movie and as of right now are swinging at the knees and can't be stopped.  If you haven't already seen all the other movies leading to this, you could still enjoy it, and not be to lost.  They still have room to grow here too that's what's amazing.  They didn't even use the Hulk or Thor, that's two major players who didn't get 1 second of airtime and there was still so much to take in.  I've already typed more then I should, get up go see it, spend the money and enjoy.  Lot of crap out there to waste money on, this is well worth it.  Absolute slam dunk, home run, best Marvel movie to date surpassing the Avengers 1.  

P.S - I was team Cap going In and I'm still team Cap going out"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,I really don't know what to say other then is movie was awesome!
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best yet. 'Nuff said.
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Great storytelling with just enough action, great way to introduce new character especially Black Panther"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,LOVED IT! This is Marvel's BEST movie yet!
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Deep story with emotion.  Marvel does it again.  The movie doesn't seem 2 and 1/2 hours because you're invested in the story. Both black panther and Spider-Man were introduced very well and I can not wait for their movies.  The winter solider has so many more layers added to his character.  Ant man!!!!  Great action.  Great movie. Go see it.
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"the Russo Brothers have managed to take an approach few superhero movies have done in the past; while most have been thankful the Avengers have saved mankind countless times others have a big concern that they live outside the law and need to answer for the damages they've left in their wake
the film smartly talks about a real-world concern we have as Captain America puts it, ""The safest arms are still our own."", meaning is it really better to have a higher form of government authority oversee everything we do to ensure the safety of the world? Steve Rogers has been through hell and back fighting Hydra in WWII, bringing down Hydra again when SHIELD was infiltrated, and now questions whether or not giving up individual freedoms is better or worse
Iron Man's guilt is also starting to catch up with him as well feeling that if he and the others don't keep themselves in check from time to time things will spiral out of control
meanwhile with Rogers allies and Stark's both are at odds with conflicting ideologies an explosion takes place during a UN peace signing escalating tensions even further
one of the members, T'Challa of the nation Wakanda dons the Black Panther persona going after the Winter Soldier/Bucky Barnes believing he is responsible
Scarlett Witch after a mishap during a mission in Lagos struggles with controlling her abilities afraid of whom she might hurt in the process but she has Vision guiding her and warning that strength invites challenge, challenge incites conflict, and conflict breeds catastrophe
everything has a price so the movie doesn't have you agree with just one side of the argument, you see both sides even if they may be right or wrong
the middle of the movie is actually better than the climax which is a real shame because more of the excitement lies in the clashing of ideals both physically and mentally
someone else is pulling the strings pitting our heroes against one another but he's just not that interesting as a central villain, the same cant be said for Crossbones at the beginning, he looks cool but is sadly wasted
the real reason to see this movie though is the debut of Spider-Man whom the fans have been begging for to be part of the Avengers for a long time and boy does he make an impression! you'll be jittering with glee while also geeking out at the hero vs. hero action set pieces
there are two very good twists in the plot as well that rightfully tears the team apart getting them to where they are
I still feel the Russo Brothers could have gone a bit darker as well as further with the heavy themes yet this all still works making two sides of a coin
like Captain America points out this job says people have to be saved but that doesn't mean everyone
tough decisions still have to be made for the greater good"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Every character in the film is fleshed out perfectly with each getting their moments, but focuses on captain america since this is a captain america movie. the action, visuals, and cinematography is amazing! The airport battle scene one of the best, if not, the best action scene I had seen in film history. Spider-Man and Black Panther is awesome in the movie and I cant wait to see them in their own solo movie. the villain was also good. better than most villains in the MCU only behind Loki and Winter Solider. I give it a 10/10. Go watch the movie. It is worth it!"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Great action and lots of joke, but I found the story kind of meh"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Another good Marvel movie! Winter Soldier is still my favorite Marvel film, but this is a close 2nd. The airport sequence was pretty epic!"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This film is one of the best comic book movies I have ever seen.  This film is what I wanted Avengers: Age of Ultron to be, from the massive cast of superheroes to the fantastic action scenes.  As for what everyone was waiting for: Spiderman!  Spiderman has always been my favorite Marvel hero, and I have been waiting to see a perfect Spiderman/Peter Parker on screen.  Toby McGuire had the emotion, Andrew Garfield had the humor, but Tom Holland has both, I loved him!"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The movie was a bit long and I wish Thor, Hulk and Samuel L Jackson were able too I make an appearance but overall Civil War delivers. The addition of Spider-Man and black panther was more than welcome and the story was complex and a fresh change from the good guys v's bad guys formula that a lot of marvel movies have followed. I am interested in where the avengers will go from here, and I can't wait to find out."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,It is for sure my favorite movie of the year
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best Comic Book movie Ive seen since The Dark Knight
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"And That's how you progress the storyline.. ?#?NoSpoiler?
Spiderman was awesome (so near to the comics, funny, geeky & 
Aunt May was hot!!), Black Panther, hot damn! Dem Vibranium suit.
Each and every character was developed, their relationships explored 
Fight choreography was so awesome, Russo brothers knew exactly where to place the camera and to imagine that half of the heroes were added in the frame later
It was Dark when it needed to be and Funny when it was natural to be.
Best Superhero Movie of the year/ (quite likely top 3 all time)
While it was a Cap Movie, I am still ?#?TeamIronMan?
It pays off brilliantly if you rewatch the movies in the right order and recently too, To compare Tony Stark in IM1 and This and To see Steve evolve from CA1 to this is mind boggling 

//////SPOILERS AHEAD//////////


Origin stories of Black panther and Spider Man were handled so good. Black Panther's origin was explained extensively as less people would have known about it and Spider Man's origin story was fluid, When pete just says ""something happened and I got my powers"" (you're like ""yeah I know) and when tony starts to name him (""spider boy, spider nib etc)
Winter soldiers Bike Catching Scene, Black Panther chasing him, Airport and Final prison fight, I can watch them on loop for hours.

In the end I feel good about Russo Brothers directing Infinity Wars, But even for that would be hard to Top this"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War's best quality is providing humanity to our characters and taking the audience through the struggles of each individual. It's a movie about superheroes not a ""superhero movie."" It was a fun experience and a fantastic introduction to phase 3."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Is civil obedience always moral? That is the question central to Captain America: Civil War. The two main characters, Captain America and Iron Man, approach the  matter with vastly differing perspectives, which put them in opposition with one another and forces their friends to choose sides. Although Cap is the main character, this does feel more like an Avengers movie. Also, one cannot watch this without comparing it to Dawn of Justice. Other than the number of heroes, I would argue the greatest difference is the amazing depth of characterization endowed by the writers, actors, and director onto each of these heroes. The rising tension throughout this movie allows the audience to empathize with both main characters as they go Mano a Mano - and Mano sin mano - by the end. Very enjoyable!

B"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,i loved the new spider man
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,hands down the best hero movie ever
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Awesome. Awesome to the max.
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I see where the fanboys are out to score Civil War in the upper 90%. To the public at large -- beware! This is not a horrible movie, but it is far from good! I can't recommend this movie. Attend at your own risk!"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Too long, too slow, too much fighting, too little acting and too boring gives this two stars, which is too generous."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America Civil War is in some ways the best film in the avengers franchise, i did however have criticisms. the camera angles during some of the fights were disorienting, cross bones was a useless villain, and a few scenes drag on too long. But inspite of that the characters are realistic with each side having a reason for what their doing and strong dilemas, the action variety in the fights made them fun to watch, it knew when to be dramatic and when to be comedic. a fan of marvel wont be dissapointed."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,captain asshole all I'm going to say
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This movie is exactly what a vs movie is supposed to be. The Charectors are motivated by there own ideas. While something outside of them is makeing those ideas come to a head. 
The only down side of this movie is pacing, It does not hold well. Entire segments and scenes drag on for far to long. Surprise and shock scenes are not that because by the time you get to the big surprise you are all ready spent from the previous moment. Not as good as other Marvel movies. IT could have used with a better Editor."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,This I want see mybe Tomorrow is Happy Mother Day from my Super Hero mom I want see mybe Tomorrow after Lunch time or This Week!!!
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,This should have been the second Avengers movie.
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Solid movie, great acting, the directing was the most compelling of any MCU movie so far.  My biggest issues is with the plot line. There are a couple MAJOR plotholes that anyone with a brain will be able to discover on your first viewing.  The critics are being overly generous on this.  Is it worth seeing? Yes, but it is on par with BvS to me.  Both had shortcomings and both had certain things going for them."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"""So what are my thoughts on it? This isn't just a great superhero movie. It feels like a genuinely great, compelling action flick with great humor and some excellent drama. The ""Dark Knight"" comparison gets thrown around a bit too much. But here is actually applies in more ways than one. Even if you're not usually a fan of these sorts of movies, there's still plenty to appreciate and enjoy. The acting is terrific, all the characters have purpose, and after much thought, it may be my new favorite in the MCU. Took 8 years to finally beat out ""Iron Man"" for that spot."""
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Saw this movie today and it is honestly my favorite comic book movie of all time! I went into this expecting something different, boy am I glad it turned out differently than I thought it would. Great job Russo brothers. Spider-Man!!!!!!!!!"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,AMAZING!! I loved it!!
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"What do I have to say about this movie...
Hmmmm 6 words: Best Superhero and Marvel Movie Ever!! 
This movie got everything right: 
- Spider Man is awesome, funny as fuck and comic book acurate;
- Black Panther was the shit, loved every scene with him;
- Scarlett Witch stool the movie for me because they showed who powerfull she is;
- Captain America was and still is right about everything; 
- Stark was a complete egomaniacal, self-centered idiot that was wrong the entire time and he didn't wanted to admite it; 
- Bucky was awesome as well and also I cri evertime for what happen in the end credits scene ??
- Oh and by the way, no spoilers here, I have to say this: Ant-Man! OMG!
Overall, the movie was great, the action was amazing and well shot, the CGI was great as always and the soundtrack... just amazing!
So i'm gonna give Captain America 3: Civil War an A+ and 10/10!
It's amazing just go see it for yourselves, you won't regret it!!"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,If you like marvel movies you will love this movie. Plain and dinple
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Movie was fantastic!
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I fail to see where reviewers have praised Civil War as having a non-cartoonish plot.  It's exactly a comic-book plot, ripped out of a comic book of the same name, with comic book level writing. It's disappointing. It is absolutely not a Captain America movie, regardless of what the producers tell you.  It's as much about Stark's ""struggle,"" probably more. This *could* have been Iron Man 4 and no one would have noticed.  Marvel just did too much this time around.  This movie is a collection of interesting scenes strung together over two hours...then dragged out over two sections of the credits.  In a movie where the most fun is had when characters based on Ants and Arachnids are on screen, I can't help but think that Marvel was thinking more about their connected universe than creating a good individual movie."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Huge improvement over Age of Ultron, which I was somewhat disappointed with. This one's tons of fun from start to finish!!"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,A pile of garbage!!!!!
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"stunt team. Spider man, black panther, with a solid script and performance."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Loved it! One of the best Marvel movies to date. 4.5/5
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Really well done all around.  Great action film with a good story of unresolved differences and secrets leading to infighting among the ranks demonstrating how it's not easy when trying to maintain a team that's supposed to be fighting for a common goal.  They can massively disagree on how to reach that goal causing real strain in their team dynamic and personal relationships.  Good drama fueling great action.
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Multiple characters are masterfully balanced, and the new heroes please at every turn. The story falters a bit at the end, but the action never lets up. Without a doubt, Civil War has the best action sequence of all superhero movies, but I'm not sure if it succeeds in making its climax a smaller, emotional beat."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"A true achievement on using so many characters in and letting them all have truly outstanding moments. Then to top it off with a good story that not only served as a Winter Solider squeal, but as a Avengers squeal, and Iron Man squeal. Best Marvel film to date for sure."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,What every Marvel movie should strive for. Perfection.
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"While the beginning is a bit slow with a lot of build up, the pay off is most definitely worth it. Sporting the biggest (and best) superhero showdown to date, the best on-screen Spider-Man/Peter Parker experience yet, and the introduction of a brand new superhero to the MCU, Black Panther, Civil War has almost everything going for it. However, even with the 2 hour and 30 minute run time the movie, at times, feels rushed and underwhelming. It has little time to explore the new and interesting aspects it has introduced (Black Panther and Spider-Man). While the movie is action packed and has a coherent story (Unlike its DC counterpart) many of the characters feel left out and underused. However, the Russos did a brilliant job with what they were given, and what they have accomplished should be applauded. Hopefully now they will have the experience needed to handle the enormous cast of the third Avengers. 4.5/5 Stars"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I'll call it!!! Best comic book movie ever done. Complex, but it holds together. Action packed, but I could follow everything. Emotional, but not sappy. Incredibly tense, but loaded with natural humor. Two great new characters: Spider-Man and Black Panther. Exhilarating!"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Amazing movie! Spider-Man was incredible! Best marvel movie to date!
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Exibe uma inteligência para tratar de suas questões filosóficas tão boa quanto sua facilidade em ser engraçado, sem forçação de barra. Belas cenas de ação e um elenco redondo."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,fantastic movie I loved it. looking forward to the next
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Great movie! Go see it.
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,10/10 best spiderman movie EVER!!!!
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Awesome!! We loved it!!
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Magnificent.  Kudos to the Russo brothers, who make sure that the crowded cast members all get moments to shine--and produce some incredible action sequences.  Steve Rogers continues to be the most morally upright character in this universe.  Tony Stark continues to degress.  But every character's position makes at least some sense when you stand in their shoes.  Spectacularly done."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Excellent movieð???ð???
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,It was an amazing film that left me breathless. The introduction to Black Panther and the story behind Tony and the Winter Solider was stunning. It is a film that will be seen again and purchased.
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Movie studios must be manipulating rotten tomatoes. This latest captain America movie was so long and boring. Maybe mindless action just doesn't do it for me anymore. It definitely doesn't deserve the low 90's (especially from critics) from rotten tomatoes. More like high 60's. Long story short... IT STINKED!
P.S. 
the character ""Vision"" played by Paul Bettany, He reminds me of the  Ghost on ""Mike Tyson Mysterys""  
in fact the whole movie is on par with an episode of Mike Tyson Mysterys... as is its audience"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"certainly ""the same ol"" in some instances, but simultaneously seems to hit home harder in certain parts (something I've come to expect specifically from the Cap installments). Kudos to not making the many introductions feel overwhelming (spider-man, ant-man (previous movie, or no), black panther), the Rhodes moment, and the fact that the linchpin of the whole movie - the philosophical/existential argument - I felt was handled well. Also, the balancing act the Russo's had to pull off between making this both a Captain America movie and an Avengers movie (and one that didn't over- or under-use any of the ensemble, really), also kudos."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Everything you expect and more. The actors all killed their roles. The scenes were epic,well shot and directed. The comedy was spot on. Many of the newer characters finally took hold of the roles. Black Panther and Spiderman were amazing. ........Aunt May......."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It was intense, had great action, and an amazing story that fit all the personalities within this movie"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Most probably Marvel's most mature film to date, Captain America: Civil War sits comfortably among the best superhero movies, delivering a thought-provoking, emotionally complex storyline while delivering a fun movie in the process."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Marvel back at it again with the hit movies. All the characters in the movie where very interesting there for making it a wonderful movie experience
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,So so much fun! So worth it! Maximum super heroes & Robert Downey Junior - what else can you ask for? Thor & Loki? Loved it.
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"A legjobb dolog a Marvel Filmes Unicerzumban a Vasember 1 és a Galaxis ?rz?i után (Ez azt jelenti, hogy az összes többi Marvel filmnél jobb, kapd be Avengers)!"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,What a amazing movie i seen this movie on Friday May 6th 2016 Spiderman introduction was awesome same with black panther this movie was freaking amazing
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"genuinely surprised how coherent the plot was.(story was my main worry going in) I do have few nitpicks and certain things I personally find weird or stupid because I am a cynical human being but they do not take away the experience I had in the movie theater. The Captain America Trilogy is the only superhero movie trilogy in my humble opinion that improved in each movie (yes, better than the dark knight trilogy because the third movie was weak). First movie was just ehh it's decent, second was spectacular, and third blow both avenger movies out of the water. Highly recommend it"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I'm not quite sure why all the rave reviews are coming in for this movie. Granted, there are some very good action sequences, albeit with some glaring poor CGI effects, but the presence of a weak villain and a questionable finale make for a very good, but flawed film. If you haven't read the comics, it would be hard to understand how Zemo, a person who lost loved ones in a previous Avengers battle, could nearly take down Earth's Mightiest Heroes. Again, this isn't the comic books and we are simply led to believe that Zemo uncovered the Winter Soldier's dossier, framed Bucky, and used the Avengers to nearly destroy each other. Very hard to believe. In addition, the writers didn't see fit to flesh out Zemo in the film whatsoever. The other writing flaw that occurs in the film involves the Winter Soldiers. After Bucky reveals the presence of several other Winter Soldiers, the audience is led to believe that there will be a big showdown between the Avengers and the Winter Soldiers. Instead, the finale is a big letdown when Zemo reveals that he killed all the Winter Soldiers in their sleep before the Avengers arrive. Weak tea. The audience never gets to see the full power of the Winter Soldiers or a damn good battle. 

Aside from those flaws, and the addition of a wimpy, weak kneed Spiderman (who somehow has regressed in age through the years) and you have some terrific action sequences and the presence of new infused blood in the group (Black Panther and Ant Man stand out) and you have the basis for a good superhero popcorn movie with some dark overtones. It must be said that the story involving the power of superheroes and their repercussions has been beat to death in the superhero genre. To its benefit, the movie does have some good one liners in the humor department and it works to lighten the tone in certain points of the film. It's a good movie but certainly not great. The first half of the movie drags in parts but the battle scenes more than make up for the excess length.
Grade: B"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best superhero movie ever. A emotional and entertaining ride.
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I loved it. You have to see it, that's all I'm saying. I'll be giving a much longer and more in depth review later."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Fantastic action, story and character development. The best of the Marvel series so far with the exception of Guardians of the Galaxy. It was wonderful to see the heroes as vulnerable humans with a range of emotions and conflicts. The ""villain"" of the film has his motivation slowly unfold throughout the story and it's both heartbreaking and surprising how it comes to a head. I highly recommend it his film."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Marvel is on a roll, another great film!"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Honestly i thought it was the Best Captian America movie yet!
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Dug it.  Thought some of the action pieces went on a bit too long, but Spider Man was great and Black Panther was great."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,An incredibly fun movie experience that sticks to the tried and true Marvel formula of action sequences offset by comedic intervals. However it falls drastically short of the high point Captain America: The Winter Soldier reached. An airport fight sequence and an interesting twist at the end elevate it above mediocrity but this is pretty much your typical Marvel fare.
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The goods ,great action ,lots of fighting ,surprise twist and turns ,well acted ,not as good as winter soldier but better then age of ultron 
If geek will enjoy it ,a little two long 
The bad 
Millar civil war better but from comic book and 
And one pet peeve 
@Marvel hey marvel if going make us wait for end credits ,give us something ,instead of some dumb ass spidy signal ?? for civil war 
Agreed with team cap on this I'll though iron man less of prick in this one more human"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,the first 1/3 is a little draggy but the fun then build nicely once the whole ensemble is in action.
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Emotionally gripping as it is thematically compelling, Captain America: Civil War is not just one of the best Marvel movies ever - it's one of the best superhero movies ever made, with career-defining performances and a braveru action scene that ranks among the best in film history."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,I a getting a bit bored of all these superheroes teaming up and crossing over into each others films. Marvel should just save that for The Avengers franchise. In saying that Antman was a breath of fresh air. Spiderman has still never been cast right and is an annoying twink cunt.
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"We watched it last night, I liked it... but a 91 rating... hardly."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Redeeming factor:  Black Panter....loved him.  (mild spoilers) Everything was going good till I found out Captain America is not really at all WHO he's been made out to be in all of the other movies.  Why everyone has to subdue themselves to his will is beyond me.  Turns out he's a self-righteous, deceptive, liar who only thinks about himself and his friend Bucky, no matter what the price, how many people get killed and/or paralyzed, or have been murdered by Bucky.  I won't give out any spoilers, but I will say that the scene involving the Starks was very emotional for me and the information that follows in an exchange between Capt America and Iron Man BLEW ME AWAY and really ruined the movie for me.  I was SO disappointed and literally sick to my stomach with the plot twist.  I will never see Capt. the same way again.  He's one of the bad guys now in my eyes.  In addition there was a lot of swearing beyond what my 7-yr-old child should have to put up with at a movie like this...not child-friendly like the others have been.  Really disappointed overall and sad because I really liked all of the Marvel Movies up until this point."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,They did it! This movie succeeds in every way that Batman vs Superman failed.
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Great flick, best use of Spiderman yet in a film!  Black Panther was used correctly, as strong as Capt. America,  as smart as Stark but with the WISDOM of a man worthy to be King!  This movie is not for small kids."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"One of the best superhero films I've ever seen, made possible by the brothers Russo, its amazing cast of characters, and a culmination of all the previous MCU movies up to this point. The established characters allow for the main characters' conflict, and it handles that perfectly. It's dark done right, unlike a certain other recent superhero flick that I shall not name. Black Panther and Spider-Man were great. The large cast of characters also works really well thanks to balancing, chemistry, and solid direction from the Russos. In many ways, it's the Avengers sequel you were hoping for, but didn't get with Age of Ultron. This film has solidified my confidence with the Russo brothers. I feel very comfortable that they can make the upcoming Avengers films work. Some nitpicking, the score isn't especially memorable, and the shaky cam could make it difficult to understand the action on scene, but most of the time, it was solid."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,One of the best superheroes movies ever made.
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best comic movie ever made!
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"LOve LOve LOve it 
Amazing Movie ð???ð???ð???ð???ð???ð???ð???ð???
Im team CAPTAIN AMERICA and IRON MAN I LOVE BOTH OF THEM 
DAMN CAPTAIN AMERICA IS HOT ð???ð???"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best part were the creative action scenes but were overshadowed by the one-dimensional characters and stakes. Plus the fact that these films are too long and there's so many of them now that they seem to be all bland and the same.
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Pretty damn awesome the whole 2.5 hours.
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Great movie! I wished that Vision had more of a stronger fighting role, though.."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Amazing movie. Great action, great story and a lot of fun. Highly recommend this movie. Best Marvel movie and maybe best comic book movie ever made :)"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,It's quite pre-mature for Steve to act in a movie with his alias as the movie title. Lots of compassion for Tony.  Spidey is definitely a highlight. I'll definitely go watch for a second time.
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"""Civil War"" is (thus far) Marvel's crowning achievement: an astounding blend of consequential moral weight, character evolution, and action brilliance enhanced, rather than burdened, by the foundation set from previous films."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Beyond amazing! The way super hero movies should be made. Perfection at its finest!
Marvel does it again."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Directors Anthony and Joe Russo rub the genie lamp and bestow its audience with three wishes that transcend the expectations of even Captain America Winter Soldier. Civil War is a film that must be viewed with optimism and a sense of perspective to truly understand the tremendous amount of weight these characters bare along with what precipitated a War.It's imperative to note that this is the Largest and final piece to the puzzle of everything build upon from the layers of avengers to age of ultron.The chronology of captain america civil war is outstandingly plausible and this can be attributed to previous films giving explicit omens of something to come.The prelude of the film displays the assertion  of ""Are superheroes saving us or are they most likely endangering our safety,this question is thrust upon the audience unexpectedly when scarlet witch makes an unintentional impetuous mistake and causes lives to perish,furthermore,throughout the film we see the emergence of Peter parker/spider-man quintessentially portrayed by tom holland who wholeheartedly embodies peters docile,dubious,insecure and whiz kid type personality while also organically representing lee/ditko's spider-man ripped right from the pages of comics utilizing his jocular attitude for levity.The wakandan sovereign t'challa whose country suffered deeply after the destruction of his city in age of ultron,we see that he comply's with the government registration of superheroes being under supervision and act only under government command and rule.This knocked upon philosophical question of ""Should superheroes be working under zero accountability and unlimited power"" evokes this feeling of realism and estrangles the ensemble of distinguished sides of opinion.This next quarter of the film is a triumph at conveying a deep rooted ideological odyssey of the predominant characters of this film Iron man and Captain America.The way it's explored on why their is quarrelsome tension and polarity between the two is remarkable,In essence captain america has and always been symbolic of man's soul,his notion of moral integrity and compassion for allies or friends such as bucky the winter soldier is something that he won't or can't allow being taken from him again no matter how dire the circumstances may be,which is yet again a guiding reason for caps unrelenting behavior to suspend the law for sake of his own selfish desire.While Iron Man in this film is symbolic of man's mind thinking within logic,reason and the sensible response in order to actually function as a team safely with the notion of preventing more deaths while captain america believes that deaths are inevitable.In conclusion Captain america civil war explores a plethora of political themes and philosophical differences but beneath the explicit storytelling,sublime cinematics youll find that civil war represents a strong theme of the significance of friendship and how it's a contributing whole on keeping our civility."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Awesome! So much fun to watch.
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This film earns every plaudit it has through multi-layered storytelling, a conflict that allows watchers to choose a side like a choose-your-own-adventure film, interactions between a wide cast of Marvel characters that allow for incredible rewatchability, and a fundamental respect for the characters as human (and synthetic) beings whose perspectives serve the unfolding drama rather than resorting to the cliche reduction of letting their powers define their perspective, allegiance, and story arc."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"spiderman, black panther were excellent. everything else, ehhhhh. fights were not satisfying because they were constantly interrupted by someone jumping in"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"An improvement on the stodgy Age of Ultron and a better superhero rivalry film than Batman v Superman, Civil War sees the Avengers line up behind Captain America or Iron Man as the government seek to control our motley crew and Steve and Tony are on opposite sides.
Unlike Batman v Superman, Marvel know how to have some fun, with Paul Rudd's Ant Man and Tom Holland as Spider Man bringing the quips. However, like BvS, you don't quite buy these heroes actually wanting to kill each other. 
The Winter Soldier was a much tighter plotted and more complete film; Civil War has too many characters that might please the fan boys but lost me a bit. 
I'm a big Iron Man fan but Robert Downey Jr is a lot more serious and less fun here - but as usual is the most charismatic actor. Meanwhile Steve Rogers obsession with his pal Bucky despite him having committed many many crimes is rather ... Interesting!
Some have raved over this film but for me while I did enjoy it, it is not even the best Captain America film."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Only four because of spider man. Those parts were good.
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Completely awesome, may be the best of them all!!"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best superhero movie of the year
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Super fun ride!  So many great characters!!
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"One of the slowest, longest without reason and worst Avenger series I've ever seen. I really wanted to see how Spider-Man plays into this and the new characters. They were all lame! The whole story and how they team up against each other was weak and I think it had 70% talk, 30% action and being a late viewing I fell asleep at times. Not worth watching at all. Wait for download or bluray."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Holy cow this is such an awesome movie!
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,This movie was outstanding. I give it a ten out of ten!
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Already saw it twice! So Good!!!
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I've got to give it some time to be sure, but this might be my favorite Marvel movie. It does a really good job balancing some really great action scenes with humor and drama. And it does an even better job than I expected of introducing the new characters."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Love Iron Man. I didn't like that he didn't Win the battle. :(
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"An overly complex, dense, occasionally excellent but generally just decent movie that has a truly dizzying number of moving parts.

This is the least stand alone MCU movie yet, relying hugely on people having seen all of the others (and possibly even some knowledge of the awful Agents of SHIELD series).

Chris Evans is likable as ever in the lead role but this movie he doesn't quite manage the sort of gravitas that he has shown previously (especially in the superior Winter Soldier).  Robert Downey Jr does his usual twitchy, fast talking bit that I got wise to years ago.  The supporting cast do their best with Bozeman (Black Panther) and Holland (Spiderman) both scoring big with their debuts in the series.  Scarlett Johansen (Black Widow) doesn't really do much but the improving Anthony Mackie (Falcon) actually comes across as a serious character this time.

I can't stand the on screen Vision character, he comes across as old school Star Trek and it doesn't work.  But Elizabeth Olsen's Scarlett Witch does well in this one.  Paul Rudd's Ant Man just kinda shows up for no reason but he brings superb comic timing and likability as ever.

the ending is very much setting up other movies.  Again.  At the expense of this movie.  But it is a good movie"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I've been waiting 40 years for these kind of movies!!! It is really good but 2 1/2 hours is a little long for me. It really would have been really great if ZEMO had the purple sock on his head :). My son came up with that when he couldn't remember his name ""PURPLE SOCK HEAD"""
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Loved it and I regard it as good as winter soldier which is my personal favourite MCU movie. Black Panther and Spider-man were the highlights as I thought their action and motives/personalities were spot on. We now have a Spider-man that follows the comic character perfectly. The action for me is 10/10 and in my eyes, it has the best action ever when compared to other comic book films. You may go in on one side and come out changing to team Cap or Iron Man, you will suprise yourself and the Russos do an AMAZING job of shaping the audiences opinions. 

HOWEVER, this is NOT a perfect movie. The amazing acting and action make up for some of the plot holes and problems in the movie. The character of Zemo is completely flawed and his actions are simply far-fetched as he predicts the outcome for the whole fight and last time I checked, he did not have the support of Professor X. Also his motives were cliched and boring as we see the same backstory as usual as his family were killed which magically turn him into A PSYCHO. I also think they killed of Crossbones too early and would have liked for him to have teamed up with Zemo to fight Cap.

This was by no means a war as none of the heros were killed and in the airport scene (which was sick), it did not feel like they were trying to kill each other. I know this can be justified as they were friends but in that case, it was a conflict, not a war. 

The ending for me was a little off too as Iron Man seeminly just forgave Cap at the end after he almost killed him after finding that Bucky killed his parents (which was an awesome twist btw). The CGI was mostly great like when ant man became Giant Man but at some points, it looked like they could have improved the visuals slightly.

Overall, I recommend this movie immensely as it shows off the great acting and action in the MCU and although there are plot holes and flaws, it was a very enjoyable and exciting film. It really sets the scene for Phase 3 and creates a platform Marvel can build on as Black Panther and Spider-man have quickly become my favourite characters in the MCU, as they quite rightly should be. 9/10. Maybe an 8.5/10 but I will have to see it multiple times to have a proper number in my head."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Finally got to see the movie and I can't say it's replayable content, But I love it, The most replayable content from Marvel was Iron Man, Avengers, Ultron, Because their action and all, and the Best was CW, WS, GOTG. Civil war is a better movie anyway even if it's not replayable."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Don't pay attention to the bad comments, if you're a fan will love it..."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This is an absolute masterpiece of a movie. It perfectly sets up the future of the MCU, while still being an amazing standalone movie."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"LOVED IT!!!!!! Definitely gave us a great story with humor, action, and a twist at the end! An unpredictable twist at the end. It was great!!! Seen it twice! Can't wait for it to come out on Blu-Ray!"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,wow -   awesome movie
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The best marvel movie yet!!! Not gonna compare it to Batman v Superman , they are to very different movies that have different good parts. Give it a 9.99/100"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,10/10 would see again
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Long, but well paced. Everything about this movie was masterful. Disney has done a really great job with Marvel. This movie is perfect for the family, pleases the comedy seeker, has action, and gives the fan boys what they want. It has everything and more. Well done!"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Definitely one of the better MCU movies to date, if not the best. Sure I had my problems with it, but overall a really enjoyable movie."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Boring fighting for no reason.  Needs any sort of real bad guy.  Useless destruction.
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"great movie. the only issue I have was the ending. it fit well, but I dislike Cap even more now. Spider-Man was what I've been waiting for, Black Panther was perfect, Ant-man was hilarious and the whole crew did a great job. I wish I could give it 5 stars, but *spoiler alert* Cap is still alive haha"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Good! But awkward. Like watching your parents argue awkward. #teamcap
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Saw it in 3D last night, and I am disappointed in the movie and shocked at the positive reviews. This was easily the worst Avengers/Cap movie yet. Dark themes had been set up for both Iron Man's and Cap's characters in Ultron and Winter Soldier, but instead of paying off, we get a brief conflict based on a mistake that is resolved with no real consequences, other than that most of the Avengers continue to operate without official government sanction, as they did before. Essentially, Civil War is an extended chase scene in search of a narrative or character development, unless you count the new romantic development (which I think is lame). The premise for the movie is that the world is afraid of the heroes who saved them from aliens, Hydra, a robot army, and a biological weapons attack. I can understand some fear of their powers, but they've saved the world multiple times. To blame them for collateral damage when the alternative was global annihilation seems bizarre. The reaction to this fear is the UN negotiates a treaty that will make them employees of the United Nations, which must have been a public process, but seems to catch them all by surprise. Conveniently, Hulk and Thor are not in the movie, because it would be impossible to enforce a treaty like this on a demigod and an indestructible monster. When Thunderbolt says to Cap that he's basically lost the equivalent of two 30 megaton nukes by losing track of them, the proper response would have been, ""They're people, not property. They can go where they like. And how do you propose I tell the demigod and the monster what to do?"" The team members, who have been through so much together, realistically would have hashed it out among themselves and, even if they came to different conclusions about how to respond, they would not physically go at with each other over those choices. An old villain shows up for 90 seconds and dies without consequences. A new mysterious villain shows up and successfully plays the Avengers and the entire world for suckers even though he is just some guy, not a genius, by framing Bucky, getting himself close enough to Bucky to control him after Bucky is captured, finding Hydra secrets like he's a superspy, acting on those secrets to lure the Avengers to their doom. His plan even involves them tearing themselves apart from the inside, which is, oh, the third time we've seen that. The undercard fight between team members at the airport is filled with quips, which really struck me as the wrong tone - if these people fought each other, they'd be extremely torn up about it. Then the title match between Cap and Iron Man happens because Iron Man finds out the Winter Soldier killed his mommy when Bucky was brainwashed, even though Stark's actions have killed lots of mommies both before and while he was under mind control (and in fact the whole plot of Civil War is driven by revenge against him for just that thing! And we already saw this in Ultron!) There are some good action beats, and T'Challa was wll done, but the addition of Spiderman and Ant-Man to the crew seems more gimmicky than anything. People liked Spiderman's youthful enthusiasm and naivete, but I think they went about three ""oh man, it's so great to fight you"" moments too far. There was also a disturbingly higher amount of shakycam in this one, and the 3D really added nothing - in fact, I don't know why you'd need to see this in a theater at all. Overall, it was a surprisingly thinly scripted film with a lot of meaningless action and no real payoffs. I almost expected Wonder Woman to make an appearance and reconcile the bros. Wait for it to come out on video."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"same old formula.weak plot,weak villain,cheesy 1 liners,takes no risks.huge disappointment,"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"perfection, love it love it........10/10"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Great action sequences, not so much in the story department."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Pari hassua kohtaa, mutta pääasiassa yhtä tylsyyttä. Huono. En muista koska olisin elokuvissa viimeksi katsonut kelloa noin montaa kertaa. Väen väkisin oli yritetty miettiä juonikuvioita, joiden avulla saadaan a) kaikki surpersankarit yhteen ja b) taistelemaan toisiaan vastaan. Edes ihana Robert Downey Jr. ei pelastanut."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Good plot, every hero played to their best potential, action sequences were top notch however the move dragged for too long"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"A perfect way to start summer. It is action packed from the beginning. Integration of multiple Marvel characters is great. Overall, a great entertainer!"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Superb, Fantastic, mind blowing. Don't watch in 3D, no such great 3D work. Felt awful for Spider-man, he was badly mocked :P 
All the characters are given equal importance with such star-studded avenger-like movie. The WB should learn how to entertain. Watch it and have fun!"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,One of the best Marvel movies to date! With a fantastic introduction to Spiderman and Black Panther.
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best superhero movie in a long time especially for the tremendous action sequences. Good humor too. Sound was excellent. . Filmed in IMAX. Got to see it in IMAX preferably 3D IMAX. Saw it at 9 am in the morning and it was more than 1/2 full. Don't miss this one.
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The movie is jam packed with Marvel characters, yet all of them get their moment to shine. No one gets shorted. The new characters, Spider-Man and Black Panther, are awesome. Where the movie really excels though, is its emotional depth. You really get to see these characters in ways you havent before, as their ideals, and their emotions, are tested."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Properly met expectations. Would definitely go watch again and buy a Blu Ray copy when it's released!
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Marvel you did it again one of the best if not the best on the MCU to date
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,one of the best movies
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Amazing Funny action move loved itð~?ð¬
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,People who complain and say it's for kids also spider man isn't CGI don't judge a movie until you see it otherwise stop talking it was amazing the story was great and there wasent a time where I wasent on my toes
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Exactly what I wanted, every actor was incredible, the motivations were well explained, the action left me in awe, and the writing was as good as ever. Marvel fans NEED to see this movie."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Phase 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is off to a great start!
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,DAMN GOOD MOVIE!!! Spidey was played perfectly & Black Panther was sooo bad ass! BRAVO MCU!
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This is the thirteenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The number 13 is typically an unlucky number for some, yet Marvel is in top form with its third Captain America film. With so many characters it may seem like the next Avengers film, but Captain America/Steve Rogers (Evans) and the relationship he has with best friend Bucky Barnes (Stan) is front and center. Bucky's known as The Winter Solider and has been on the run following the events of the previous film, The Winter Soldier. He is believed to be the man responsible for an explosion at the United Nations headquarters in Vienna killing the Nigerian leader. Steve knows that Bucky wasn't behind the explosion and seeks to find him before the authorities catch him. The man behind the explosion is Captain Helmut Zemo (Brühl) who's after secret HYDRA reports from a December 1991 mission involving Bucky.

This isn't the only problem plaguing Steve; the Avengers are starting to unhinge after witnessing and realizing their actions and attempts at saving the world come with a cost. Many innocent lives have been taken and an incident in Lagos, Nigeria left a shattering death toll. This all leads to the creation of the Sokovian Accords. If this passes, it would mean that the Avengers are no longer a private organization. The government would step in and control them. This concept drives a sharp divide between Captain America, Iron Man/Tony Stark (Downey) and the rest of the Avengers.

For those following along closely at home, we have now entered Phase 3 of Marvel's Cinematic Universe. Marvel continues to make smart choices with the direction of their franchises. The Winter Soldier has been lauded as one of the best in the franchise, so it was a wise move for producer Kevin Feige to keep that creative team in place with directors Joe and Anthony Russo and writers Stephen McFeely and Christopher Marcus. As I think back on the entire Marvel canon, the Captain America entries have been the strongest and most consistent as they continue to evolve and raise the stakes for our central characters. You can't just keep making the same ""good guys vs. villain"" film over and over or else they start to all feel the same. To a certain extent we have that here with Daniel Brühl in the villain role. The real conflict and heart of the movie falls with Steve's relationship with Bucky and the core group of Avengers. Like many long-lasting friendships, there are times when you realize you vehemently disagree on a position. The film tackles that very concept and it's a sharp move to ask the audience to take on that journey of how we act when we're wrong but think we're right. There's an impactful image of each side lining up as if they are in a shootout at the O.K. Corral.

A majority of the fan favorite characters are back with the exception of Thor and the Hulk. Steve continues to play the role of loyal friend to Bucky as that's the one friendship he can't let go of from his past. It's easier for him to turn against Tony. This is Robert Downey Jr.'s sixth film playing Tony, and we're starting to see a very different side to the character. He's worn down, exhausted, and no longer the hotshot playboy that we're used to from previous films. He's really starting to feel the ramifications of what Iron Man has done to his personal life with Pepper Potts and the lives that have been taken due to the Avengers.

Civil War also acts as the introduction to new heroes who will be getting future movies in Phase 3. Chadwick Boseman (42, Get on Up) is donning the claws as T'Challa/Black Panther. T'Challa's father is the Nigerian leader who is killed in the U.N. attacks. It's a relief to feel like he is given a proper arch in the film with a true conflict at hand against Bucky. The other noteworthy appearance is that of Peter Parker/Spider-Man. There had been some studio disputes involving the rights to the character who was previously played by Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield. While it seems redundant to have yet another Spider-Man, Kevin Feige is taking a new spin on the character by reminding the audience he is actually a high school kid. This time he's played with a spritely sense of humor by newcomer Tom Holland with Marisa Tomei popping up as lovable Aunt May. For those who were hesitant or feared he was a one-scene cameo, he is given more to do than what's been shown in the trailers.

This film clocks in at being the Marvel film with the longest runtime at 146 minutes. In case you hadn't noticed yet, the film has a lot of ground to cover with the multiple storylines and characters. It all coalesces together well without feeling gimmicky or a ploy to add unnecessary characters which I was originally afraid of with all of the hype surrounding the film. This can easily happen when screenwriters try to bite off more than they can chew, but I never felt lost or confused by their choices. The pace is kept up and never drags, as the action sequences are swift yet controlled in how they are edited together. I never felt like any of them suffered from being too long, which plagued Avengers: Age of Ultron and many other superhero films like DC Comics' Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.

I'm drawn to the superhero movies that feel like they have plausible stakes at hand. I am far more invested when the emotion and conflict is grounded in reality. Yes, you can have fun with a man who can shrink down in size, use a deadly shield, or fly around in an iron suit, but finding the proper balance is key. Directors Joe and Anthony Russo have masterfully crafted their film and found that balance. Despite the serious tones and heavy weight put on Steve Rogers and Tony Stark, there is still so much humor in the film thanks to the witty script and comedic entries of Paul Rudd as Ant-Man and Tom Holland as Spider-Man. It's a globe-trotting spectacle which fully utilizes every Avenger, side hero, and villain along the way. Just when you thought you might need a break from the superhero genre, it pulls you back in again. I need to find time in my calendar to see it a second time.

Is It Worth Your Trip to the Movies? It's the best Marvel film in years.

RATING: 4 out of 5 TICKET STUBS"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Since this is a Marvel movie, you know that it's going to be well-made. My problem with Marvel though is that instead of really ""wowing"" us, it's just perfectly fine. Overall I felt the movie was a retread of Cap 2 in the first half, and a retread of avengers 2 in the second. Obviously the plot points have changed but the basics are there. They jump a lot from place to place in a really annoying ""in your face"" way, the CGI was a bit too obvious this time around, a lot of joking around at very serious moments, and they didn't actually explore the themes of what superheroes should be allowed to do as much as I thought they were going to.
There were also a lot of similarities with plot of Batman v Superman. Really the only changes were that each side has a team of people helping them.Yes, Captain America did a lot of things better than BvS, but it wasn't as epic in scale.
I liked Tom Holland as Spidey more than Peter Parker himself, but we'll see how that character turns out in his future films. His appearance in the film was where I had the majority of my laughs.
All in all it's a movie you gotta see but I honestly expected it to be a lot better."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Only good part was with spider man at the airport hangar.  The rest of the movie is a bit of a flop.  I thought this movie wouldn't have been better than Superman vs Batman but totally didn't even come close to it.
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It does well on handling this huge Marvel event. Even though the sides and motivations were blurry, Russo brothers did their best with this crowd. It's hard to tell a story with multiple major characters and put amazing action in it. The movie could be better if only it had four hours of screentime. Is it perfect? No, but this is the best that can be done (with twelve Avengers!) and it's one hell of an action summer blockbuster! 
Final review: Certified Fresh."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Great movie! Russo brothers seamlessly weaved Avengers movie around story about Cap n Bucky. Nothing seemed forced. Loads of action with just the right amount of humor. Moviegoers won't be disappointed!
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Expected a lot more considering how insanely good The Winter Solider was
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,One of the best marvel movies easy
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"the winter soldier is still the best marvel movie !
civil war started of with a bang but sadly like the hobbit series some of the cgi ruined it for me IL make a couple of points 
1 Tony's head looked like it was floating on the iron man suit 
2 black Panthers fight scenes reminded me of the terrible cgi in blade 2 
3 the airport battle although very cool just felt forced in my opinion and have of the hero's didn't really have a good reason to be there 

additionally the whole plot is basically built around large scale destruction and what do the hero's do they funk up an entire airport"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,I did not like this movie it was avengers 3 not captain america civil war
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Action was good story was over dramatized. Is all vengeance bad? Another attempt to show a one world authority knows best to the masses.  Chris doesn't want to be Captain America anymore but they give a soft ending. Short of the funny added by the new characters not a must see in the series.
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This movie really did an amazing job at balancing storytelling and action sequences. Every character had something to do, no matter what.

The best part was the dynamic that Captain America, Iron Man, and The Winter Soldier had with one another. The scenes were versatile, and stunning to view."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Do you like amazing set pieces? Does large ensemble casts intrigue you? How about a film that uses the large cast well, and even gives everyone a moment to shine as a character? Do you appreciate good writing? Good directing? Some of the best hand to hand combat America can offer? How about a scene that was shown in the trailer but still be done so well to the point that as a fan of both good film making and characters that you are left overjoyed and didn't know what to do with your hands? If all of that applies to you then you'll effing love this film. Arguably the best Superhero movie ever done."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,I'm going watch it again this opening weekend.
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Thanks to the exhilarating action, a smart and thought provoking story, and great performances, Captain America: Civil War proves to be even better than The Avengers."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,A character-crammed action tentpole that doesn't disappoint yet nor match the expectations from the Marvel universe. Though the DC Comics cameo of Spiderman was a fun surprise.
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Civilwar was the amazing payoff that AoU should have been. Marvel uses their toy box full of heroes very well. The Airport scene is the greatest scene in any comic book movie.
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"When it's channeling the Avengers, it's a lot of fun. Great action and humor. When it's channeling Winter Soldier, it really begins to suffer. But ,ultimately, I enjoyed it, though these movies are starting to get a little boring and stale. I hope they switch it up sometime soon."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,so good. best cap yet
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I thought this was a solid movie. The fight scenes were incredible,  Black Panther is awesome, and Falcon gets some nice upgrades. Ant-man was kind of a waste and distraction. I like how some of the secondary characters were more involved. I also liked how the super humans were more human. Definitely a step up from Avengers 2 and one to see it on the big screen."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War after thoughts: (SPOILER ALERT maybe) totally free of expectations, from the start, I was visually filled & felt like a kid in a toy store on Christmas in NYC!!! STRONG STORY & NOTHING YOU WILL EXPECT!!! Huge question asked: take a side & how can I, but as this film progressed, you are torn but you will feel for both our main characters. How did Cap get main title for this huge Avengers Universe!!! T'Challa aka Black Panther & Spiderboy, oops, Spiderman - Did Not Disappoint!!! All heroes played valuable & essential parts!!! MUST MUST MUST SEE & yes, I will wash & repeat!!! ð???ð??¼ð???ð??¼ð???ð??¼ð???ð??¼ð???ð??¼ of 5 (5 of 5)"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"An absolutely phenomenal movie. I was afraid that given previous films that certain characters wouldn't have their chance to shine, or would be given brief moments as a cameo means, but I was wrong. Every single superhero had their chance to shine, and shine they did. From Chadwick Boseman making his debut as T'Challa/Black Panther, to the inclusion of Paul Rudd as Ant-Man, and then witnessing the glorious moment of having Spider-Man finally make his appearance in the MCU; this is a fantastic and wonderful movie to behold if you're a fan of these films. It's very rare that a movie trilogy get's better with each installment, and Captain America is certainly one of those. I'd highly recommend this movie to Comic book fans, or anyone who wants to see some truly incredibly choreographed action!

(Full disclosure): If you see this movie in 3D or IMAX, be prepared for a little bit of a headache. Some of the action scenes use a lot of shaking camera movements, and it can be *quite* a strain on your eyes. Aside from that, go forth and enjoy!"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"While Civil War was indeed well done  in terms of the amount of special effects , it was lacking and substance.  I am fond of the Marvel superhero movies but I will not give a good rating where he does not deserve one. I wanted to be invested in this movie however despite it all I felt more disconnected by the rapid pace And your constant amount of jumping from scene to scene. I understand that this is a superhero movie and that is warranted of it however it does not make for necessarily the best film. And your constant amount of jumping from scene to scene. I understand that this is a superhero movie and that is warranted of it however it does not make for necessarily the best film"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Yes, the epic showdown between our fav Marvel heroes is superhero movie nirvana, but it's also a mess. Make no mistake, this flick is a behemoth, but it's also 2 great films that've been uncomfortably forced-fit into one. With SO much to cover, I'll go over the most important stuff. The Captain America storyline unsurprisingly (and disappointingly) gets shelved several times to make way for...well, everyone. This is a film with enough main characters to fill several other movies. There's noticeable shifts in tone that go from playfully fun/exuberantly funny one minute and then suddenly shift gears to brooding intensity the next. It's as if one film was already made and other pieces were continuously added on. The best way I can describe this flaw is an over decorated Christmas Tree that's so heavy with decorations that it's about to fall over. Another flaw has to do with the screenwriter's disregard of the source material. Without giving anything away, Marvel Studios finally flinched this time and decided to play it safe here. The good stuff? It's the newcomers that steal this one. The extraordinarily talented Chadwick Boseman KILLS it as T'Challa/Black Panther. If his role here is any indication, 2017's stand-alone Black Panther film is gonna be first on my personal most-anticipated list. He's a densely layered, compelling hero with maybe the coolest superhero costume to date. Tom Holland is...pretty good as the young Peter Parker/Spider-man. Although miles from Tobey Maguire, what he does offer here is terrific potential and far better than anything Andrew Garfield brought to the table. Apart from the epic battle between our heroes, it's the last 20 minutes that truly rival The Winter Soldier for sheer depth and drama. The finale is genuinely heartbreaking as Tony, Bucky and Steve square off because they have absolutely no other choice. Don't get me wrong, this is a great summer popcorn flick, it's just not as good the original Avengers and (depending on your attention span) may leave you with a splitting headache."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,such pretty fireworks... and that was about it...
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Big, flashy and totally outrageous - remember, it's a comic book story! The Captain is mesmerizing!"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Finally an actual superhero versus superhero movie and a great one at that.
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Civil War challenges Guardians of the Galaxy for the title of ""funniest Superhero movie ever"", in fact there are so many laugh out loud moments that we laughed over the next line of dialogue quite a few times. Terrific performances from the all-star cast and riviting action sequences abound. It take a little while to get going, but after the first 45-or-so minutes it really takes off. Tom Holland steals the show in his scenes as Peter Parker and Spider-Man, really building the excitement for his upcoming solo effort. A really good entry into the MCU."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"""Underoos!"" And why do the Cap movies have the best fight scenes? Beware of creeping continuity-dependence."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This the Best Marvel movie Since  ""Spider Man 2"" (Tobey McGuire)... Spider Mam! Black Panther! Ant Man/Giant Man!!!! Great Movie!!!!"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,YYYYYEEEEEAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Like most the movies that preceded Civil War, the movie ultimately succeeds at being a fun joy ride through the cinematic Marvel universe with funny quips and well done action scenes, but sacrifices cohesive and tight storytelling for loud noise."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"A total waste of time -- by far the worst of the Captain America movies.   The plot twists are slow to develop, in fact the whole plot could have been worked out in ten minutes.  Unnecessary, continual violence.  If you had not seen, or did not remember, the characters from the earlier movies this movie made no sense at all.  A real disappointment."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This movie franchise just continues to top itself in action, suspense, and comedy.  Must see if you like these things!"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War is fantastic! It is a perfect balance of Action, Drama and Humour. The thematic stream of guilt and revenge that flows through it really keeps you interested throughout the movie. Its most crowning achievement is how the writers managed to make the final confrontation between Steve Rogers and Tony Stark so personal and tragic that, even against your better judgement, you will come to truly believe that either one of them is truly going to willingly kill the other to put an end to the conflict. It also wonderfully balanced the airport battle scene between all the characters so that none of them are superfluous, each of them get their moments against multiple other characters (With great displays of powers; old and NEW!). The introductions of Black Panther and Spider-Man are equally exciting and just make one so impatient for their solo movies; and Baron Zemo who introduced as the ultimate psychotic, vendetta driven, nihilist was a daring and masterfully executed tour-de-force! 4 ½ stars!"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Civil war is hands down among the best in the MCU, and possibly one of the best all time super hero action movie to date. I went in team Iron Man, as the conflict came to a head I was torn. I didn't want my avengers fighting each other. However the fight scene were excellent. Each blow felt devastating, it really displayed the power each character has. The addition of spider-man was spot on. Being a comic book buff I can see the culmination of powers needed for future threats (Thanos). It was a very human story just as large as the avengers movies that kept the action personal. Marvel has the formula down. Top marks."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,This is how its done dc. Captain America has the perfect blend of action and story telling while focusing extremely well on every single character in the film. All the action feels gritty and grounded in reality and the pacing is amazing. Well done Marvel you have done it again.
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,This movie was almost perfect!  Tony was funny again... Paul Rudd was awesome!  Falcon rocked!  Loved pink panther!  And they really made Spiderman work..(which I REALLY didn't think they were gonna pull off).  Loved Black Widow.  Clint earned his place on the team.  Winter Soldier was awesome.  It is extremely rare that I go to a movie and not dislike a single thing. I didn't even like Ultron.  This movie was in fact the best super hero movie and quite possibly one of the best movies ever! LOVED it!
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Watched it twice already and gonna watch it again. Definitely the best in the Avengers series so far.  Great adaption of the comic and amazing fighting scenes . Real characters buildings there as well. Loved it!!!!
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Cons
The build up is slow
A hand full of one liners
Tries to much to be funny 
Tries to make jokes when not needed

Pros
Good fight scenes
Good back and forth
The  jokes that landed where good"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Great movieï¼?will watch againï¼?
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"So good! Really, really good! So incredibly good, it makes you want to tell DC Comics: just stop trying already..."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"+So much exhilarating action, I'm pretty sure I stopped breathing for a minute! 
+The fresh faces of Tom Holland's Spider-Man and Chadwick Boseman's Black Panther give the movie more heart, suspense and excitation of what's to come.
+Surprisingly with such a huge cast, everyone gets a good share of screen time
+Engaging story that gives you the dilemma of who is right? 
+wow, just wow!
-score was really good but seemed a bit off at times
=More than full price

Overall, people you have to watch this in theaters. There are so many moving parts  in this movie that it could have easily been a disaster but directors Joe and Anthony Russo gave it such fluidity and heart that ended up with a movie that brings in the laughs, the action and raises the question: what's better?
A government sanctioned team of heroes that does the bidding of whoever is in control to reduce damage or a self managed group of superhumans that deal with any trouble they see fit to reduce casualties."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Still TeamDeadpool
Whether your team cap or team iron man, you can't deny that civil war knocks it out of the park. The thing I liked best was the amount of tension between both sides, cap and iron are committed to their views and rdj and chris Evans give it their all. 
The storyline is significantly different from the comic it's based on. The thing that bothered me, other than spiderman is the pace is akward, it wasn't as well directed as winter soldier. 
Excited for black panther though"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,I would give it 10 stars if I could!!!
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Expected more, but better than AoU"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,It was a great movie but the best thing about it was Spider-Man he made it amazing!!!
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This third installment of the Captain America series is so layered, that it makes the screenwriters of ""Batman v Superman"" look lazy.  I have never seen three African-American superheroes in one movie, so this is historical.  And where did they find the kid playing Peter Parker / Spiderman?? PERFECT CASTING CHOICE.  Spiderman and Black Panther almost steal the movie.  Great balance between lighthearted moments and dark, serious, emotional moments.  This is a really, really good superhero film.  Almost too mature in nature for most young children though.  A lot of dark themes explored."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"la suite du Soldat de l'hiver....
Daniel Bruhl est aussi attachant que dans le Commando des Batards qu'on a le gout de lui fesser un coup de pelle dans face ....."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This is one of those series that only gets better with each movie. Loved Winter Soldier, loved this."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Not drinking the Kool aid. I don't know if I'm watching the same movie as the other reviews.
Case and point: Opening night packed theater and, when it was over, everyone just got up and left. No excited banter, no cheering.....everyone seemed deflated.
Aside from one AMAZING fight scene, this was a long, self indulgent snooze-fest. Spoiler: The introduction of Spider-Man is the highlight. Get in line now for the full length Spider-Man reboot.
Black Panther needed much more character development...he seemed to just go from A-Z. This movie overall just had too many story lines and nothing EVER GETS RESOLVED!!!! Nothing significant happens!!! It just ends!!!! The hand to hand combat scenes were blurry with shaky camerawork. 
It appears the studios attitude was ""if we through enough superhero's at the audience, they will love it"". 
Ask yourself this- How long should a Marvel movie really need to be (to make sense) when it has 10 superheros in the storyline?? Exactly....pack all that into just 2 hours and it's a complete mess.
Wait for the Blu-ray."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I enjoyed the movie, love action. I just didn't like Captain American hurting my Iron Man. I am a die hard Iron Man fan. lol"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,excellent but very slow for a marvel film.
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This was straight up garbage of a movie.  The story made no sense, why are Tony Stark and Captain Crunch fighting I thought they were buttbuddies. The Hulk looked so CGI like he took steroids. Too much action not enough character building, too many plot holes and buttholes, why is Ironman killing bad guys, and why are there so many dumb jokes? Was this supposed to be comedy?
Not once did I feel that Cap and Ironman had legitimate reason for fighting each other. Ironman was seconds from killing Cap but then decided that he was 
too cute to die. The make up and make out. super gay. Save yourself the time and Money by not watching this shitty overhyped movie. 

Go stick an enema up your butt, and cleanse your colon! That would be a better way to spend your Friday night than watching this SHITTY attempt of a comic book movie."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Action packed and overstuffed with all the fixings with a pretty solid plotline.
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"So, the 17-or-so minute airport fight scene in 'Captain America: Civil War' that everybody's talking about, does in fact live up to the hype. That sequence alone is worth the price of admission. The rest of the film's 2-plus-hour run time hits a consistent, if not-quite-as-spectacular fun spot. I very much liked, but was not overly wowed by, pretty much everything: exciting action scenes; solid character moments; interesting philosophical arguments about independence vs. control -- all good stuff. Upon reflection though, I feel the picture does consciously avoid some of the pitfalls in other Marvel movies, and even does the extra work to smooth a few past ones over. For example, using just a few lines of dialog, this is the most ""Hawkeye-like"" that Hawkeye has ever been in a Marvel movie. Comic fans will know what I mean by that, and it's impressive to me. Black Panther and Spider-Man are introduced here perfectly; another huge plus. Unlike a few things in 'Winter Soldier', no glaring inconsistencies or moments of questionable logic immediately come to mind. This could be a film that I'll like even more after I stew on it a while, maybe watch it a few more times."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Wow! Best super hero movie I've ever seen.
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I felt this was a cartoonish plot and tried be made more of a comedy than the actual action movie it was - And action it surely had. MCU has done well with keeping fight scenes to a minimum, but not in this movie. Far too much mindless raging ""action"".

Back to the discussion on the story;

Without giving spoilers, I felt it was not a powerful enough storyline... It was pretty much revenge, revenge, revenge for about 60% of the characters in this film, and it seemed to go all over the place, it did not know what direction to stay in - Good against the good, good with the good, good against the good... I'll add repetition to mindless raging. Also, there were a few things that just seemed to fall into place without explanation just so the movie could have its story work... Well it did not work for me. I need all pieces of the puzzle given in order to vision what has been put together.

I did however feel they did well in introducing Spidey so that the audience can get a feel for him before his upcoming movie (yet another Spidey movie) hits theaters in the near future. At the same time though, I do not honestly feel it was necessary for him to be in this movie, and I feel his introduction was the only reason for his appearance, for other than that, he really had no part. Ant Man as well, he was in the movie for pretty much one scene and as mentioned before, an attempt at ""comedy"".

Black Panther, however, I feel they did not do as well with introducing him to the audience. I mean, many people know Spidey's story more than his, yet they spent a good ten or so minutes on a scene with Peter Parker and really nothing on Black Panther's intro. Yes, I know they are releasing his own movie and will surely explain more in it, but again, Spidey is getting his own as well.

So, pretty much, I feel this to be the least favorable Captain America movie, even though Iron Man was featured in this one. Cap was selfish, arrogant and honestly just annoying at times, different than what he has been in the other movies we have seen him in. Oh, and I know it was the attempt of the whole Civil War thing, but too many players were on the field in this one... Another unnecessary casting (just to name one other out of a few actually) was Hawkeye. I am sure he was glad Ant Man was there, only because Ant Man became more of the nobody and least known hero (based on MCU) this time around. 

I will say it was better than Batman vs. Superman... But what wasn't (except maybe last year's Fantastic Four... Blah!)?..."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Wow! Civil War is the best of the 3 Cap movies,"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Kind of misnamed (it is really Avengers: Civil War) but quite entertaining.  The fight sequences are sometimes long and the movie feels very long because of it.  Ironman is definitely the most interesting character and Spiderman was great!  

And props to Marvel.  12 movies with a plot line that stills moves forward and no random rebooting. 

Also,  nice costumes on the lady hero's!  How nice to see that you can be a super heroine and not wear super insane and impractical revealing costumes!"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,This might be my favorite Marvel movie yet.
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Civil War was a fun, more dark and depth sequel to the marvel cinematic universe. With great action sequences, great dialogue between the main characters, the story and the funny second act, makes Captain American: Civil War the most entertaining film this year so far 9.2/10"
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"""Civil War"" doesn't hit the highs that ""The Winter Soldier"" had for a Captain America movie. In the end, I'm judging this as a third installment in a trilogy; not a continuation of an expanded universe story.

As a conclusion to the ""Captain America"" movies; 'Civil War' does a fine job at [strangely] tying up loose ends and giving an open-ended conclusion. There are elements in such third movie where it feels more forced to cater to other star players, but the film still benefits the 'Captain America' crew; making this ultimately work. Kudos to the Russo brothers for finding a perfect niche in telling essentially three stories in one.

Three stories in one? Yep. There's a Captain America sequel, a Spider-Man (version 3?) prequel, and a Black Panther prequel in here. Here's the thing though: where SO many other movies have struggled to find their footing in setting up movies within movies, ""Civil War"" accomplishes this feat FLAWLESSLY. Spider-Man and Black Panther are integrated into the plot that makes the narrative that much more interesting.

In the end, the ultimate 'villain' makes for an anticlimactic ending; it's as if the pitch for the movie demanded a struggle amongst the heroes we love...but the toy sales demanded that they all were still 'heroes' in the end. I like the idea of no character being really 'correct'...but that's looking too deep into a movie that's meant for a HUGE audience. This IS the triumph movie that will probably ultimately be the best summer movie of this year. It's worth one...two...or three watches."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"More or less the movie the MCU has been building up to the most at this point. Captain America: Civil War is possibly the first film in the franchise that feels like its the product of serialization, with past films and character growth finally having a strong input on the overall storyline. Aside from this marketing material though, Civil War is a damn good summer movie filled with witty banter, gorgeous set-pieces, and enough nerd-out moments to make the comic-con crowd yell ""BEST MOVIE EVER!"" It's also possibly the first genre film to juggle so many characters and story lines and make it work as well as this. It's not precisely tight, and Marvel still struggles to gives us a compelling villain, but Civil War is technically their most impressive and satisfying film yet."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Better than it had any right to be!  Lots of fun and action, with some challenging themes."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Nearly flawless. THIS is how it's done. Balance, pacing, beauty forged by story and relevant gravitas."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"As a huge Marvel fan I walked into the first showing of Civil war on Thursday night with very high expectations for the film, sky high expectations, but Marvel and the Russo brothers fail to disappoint. Despite the high expectations it still managed to surpass them beautifully. Kudos to the Russo brothers who did such an amazing job brining to life some of our favorite heroes to the big screen and doing it in such an exquisite way. With a running time of over 2 hours, this Marvel film does an amazing job entertaining you and keeping you 100% occupied and focused that those 2 hours seem to fly by quickly, which many films have a hard time succeeding and only cause boredom and desire for a film to finish. But the complete opposite comes from Civil War. You will be occupied watching this film and it will cause not even wanting to blink once cause you can miss an amazing moment of the great action sequences that our favorite heroes perform. I would recommend everyone to see this film, whether or not you're a Marvel fan, failing to do so would make you, I don't know, a bit ignorant."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Wonderful, Just perfect. I wish Ant Man had few more scenes though."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Best of the Marvel saga thus far. Great action and great story. Hero vs Hero, done right."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Action packed fun! Very entertaining!
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Awesome movie. Well made. Onto Ragnarok next.

To: All negative ratings. 

 Know your comics history of CA: Civil War before you speak negativity. The books has so much information and so little time to crunch them into a single movie. Appreciate things the right way."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Perfect. Just perfect.
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Simply put, this is one of the best comic book films ever made. With a more serious and darker tone than most Marvel movies, ""Captain America: Civil War"" manages to deliver incredible action and intrigue."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"At this point, you pretty much know what you're getting. Captain America: Civil War has great action sequences, interesting interactions between characters and excels in the  management of tone and atmosphere. It also lacks what many of the movies in this franchise lack, like formal identity, depth of themes, and has the same problems in the character saturation and overall sense of ""safeness"" in its narrative construction and decisions. Yes, it is as solid as these films get, but by now the sense of wonder has faded a little bit, and the people behind Marvel seem like they're not going anywhere that strays from the formula."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,FREAKING LOVED IT.... Going to see it again tomorrow :)
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Joe & Anthony Russo once again give us a great Marvel film. Captain America: Civil War or what I like to call it Avengers 2.5 delivers what we would have liked to see with Avengers Age of Ultron. At times the film could get a little repetitive especially with the Characters making jokes which could sometimes get annoying but makes up for it with the great action sequences and the intense moments in the film. When this film gets serious it does. Once again this film also made me very happy with all the characters that were included, especially Spiderman. Surprisingly I actually like Tom Holland as Peter Parker and do see potential for him in the next Marvel films. Chris Evans does a great job with his portrayal as Captain America as so does Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man. A very fun movie which you will enjoy and makes me even more excited to see what the Russo Brothers have in store for Avengers: Infinity War 

I give Captain America: Civil War 4 stars"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Excellent movie. Without a doubt the best Marvel movie so far. Great story dealing with so many superheroes but they have sufficient time on the screen.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"After captain America 2, this is bullshit. There was no point to this movie at all. I was well written and beautifully shot but at the end of the day it was just more set up. I didn't feel like it needed to be made here. And I thought batman v superman was bad, this is just sad. It was just fun that's it but I didn't leave the movie feeling like it had a message or made me feel good. I was probably just expecting more honestly. But for what it is i mean it's watchable."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Am I the only one who found this movie mediocre? Tom holland Spider-Man and Downey steal the show
I love it for the tech and for the bringing everybody together but the plot; like Spoilers: why captan freakin America lied to his friend and defended a rogue agent against his own team who he knows is tryng hard to do the literal MOST JUST THING. Also understanding and having a movie stand alone is really important, something which this movie doesn't do very well granted it is part of a larger us verse but that doesn't mean I'm freaking exhausted. I just got fired from my job, my gf broke up with me and I've had 9 Jobs in to years and 3 gf. I can't seem to hold onto anything and I just saw this movie with my now ex and another ex. It was fine I guess but my attention was divided between them because I am alone and a powerless person who needs the approval of ogres to exist.  lonely so maybe im just not in the mood to rate this move alone and drunk in my room while listening to alan watts speeches about nothingness. And I also found out my other ex is dating a younger hotter richer guy than me...So shut up"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"meh
it was as good as batman v superman.
spider man stole the show the 15 mins he was in it. Black Panther was great. the last 40 mins of the movie was great. first half really dragged."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,batman v superman was better
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best one of the series
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"So many good things about this movie.
Antman and Spiderman are the stand outs"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Marvel proves yet again that they are able to give the fans what they live about their cinematic universe while incorporating new ideas and characters.

As a die hard Marvel Comics fan, I will say that I was a tad disappointed in some of the changes they needed to make to one of my favorite story lines, but it makes sense when you consider that they still don't own the rights to Xmen or Fantastic Four.

The introduction of Black Panther left us satisfied while still wanting more (a rare balance), and we finally get the perfect Spiderman/ Peter Parker combo."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Great movie! Good story and tons of action. People actually cheered DURING the movie!
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Horrible! Boring. ClichÃ©.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Movie was fucking amazing. WIll have to watch a few more times to really soak the amazingness of this movie. I have so much on my mind and this is all I can utter right now.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"6/5. Civil war is the best MCU movie by far in terms of action and intelligence, but what makes this a great  movie is the truth and conviction of the performances and its highly emotional bordering on heartbreaking stakes. Bring tissues."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Talking talking talking. Overall the action is below the expectation
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,had its moments. its a really detailed story. recommend seeing it during the day.

"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Loved it and can't wait to see it again
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This movie is very different than the comic book, but it's very driven for the characters like Iron Man, Captain America, and more. The Russo Brothers did a job for this film. Clearly, this became the #1 Marvel Cinematic film so far."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I really, really, really enjoyed this movie. It's not the same epic scope as the story was in the books, but they still hit a few of the same beats, story wise. Favorite things about the movie have to be Spider-Man,  and Ant Man.  They finally found the perfect Parker and Spider-Man.  Third times the charm i guess.  I'll write more about the movie later in my blog, but I had a blast, and you should too."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"WOW - a thrill ride basically from start to finish. Some twists, some turns, great lines, some ""new"" characters.  LOVE this. Can't wait to see it again."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Just amazing. It's easy my favorite next to Guardians and man Spider-Man was just perfect
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Phenomenal. Everything in this movie is super well done, Infinity War is in good hands."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best Marvel movie yet!!!
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It was OK, kinda lame. You would think after saving the world together you would be better friends."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,THE BEST MARVEL MOVIE EVER!
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Without Spiderman and Ant Man this movie would be a dumpster fire. Massively disappointed. Amazingly its a complete rip off plot wise even with a ""why did you say that name"" moment, daddy and mommy issues and villain ""masterminding"" the heroes fight. Only difference was, this movie actually lived up to all the criticisms BvS got. I can't believe people are honestly saying this movie is great. Its meh. Its watchable. And considering how incredible WInter soldier was, meh does not cut it. Did Disney brainwash everyone into thinking Civil war was BvS? Because this is the movie that deserves that 28-29% score. Dissapointed. Almost angry over how disappointed in this movie I am."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Easily my new favorite Marvel movie. After a few more viewings I may be able to decide if it's my favorite superhero movie, which it's definitely top three. The writing and directing makes this movie the brilliant masterpiece. The ability to give every character a particular motivation and story arc that made you care about each one no matter how much or how little screen time they got was beyond impressive. The story was tense, amusing, sad, emotional, and perfectly paced. I can't say enough about the acting from everyone on screen, Robert Downey Jr as always putting out a stellar performance. Tom Holland, in his first scene, easily won me over and is definitely the best Peter Parker/Spiderman we've had on screen yet. Chadwick Boseman does a fantastic job introducing movie-goers to Black Panther, I cannot wait for his solo movie now. Also really happy with the character development of Scarlett Witch, Elizabeth Olsen really helped improve her story. I could write paragraphs on every actor/actress' performances. The action scenes were all done great, but the airport scene in particular is probably the best action scene I've seen in any movie, and definitely the best one in any superhero film. I can't say enough good things about this movie, but Marvel knocked this one out of the park. Highly recommended, go see it!  P.S.-Stay for the very end of the credits, we get two after-credits scenes. P.P.S.-Stan Lee's cameo is one of his best ever."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Wow, just wow. That was a fun ride the whole way. The scene at the airport was already amazing and the rest of the movie put this over the top. T'Challa and Spidey were awesome. Looking forward to their films. The interactions between Falcon and Bucky were great. Cap could have gotten lost in all of this but instead he still manages to keep the spotlight through it."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"VIDEO REVIEW NOT A WRITTEN REVIEW: Civil War was a film that I've been looking forward to since the first Avengers came out in 2012. It has been a long wait and finally it has come. I thought the movie was above average but I also did notice a couple of issues with it.

"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Incredible....Simply incredible.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"More please. That pretty much sums it up. Notice by the title that this is a Captain America movie and not an Avengers flick. You wouldn't know it by watching it. The tone is dead perfect, especially compared to another recent capes and crusaders adventure that shall not be named. All characters being introduced into the expanding Avengers universe are done well. Special note goes to Paul Rudd as Antman and Tom Holland as Spiderman. The Marvel writers are generous enough to spread humor around, but Rudd and Holland really server up great comic relief. Holland is possibly the best on screen Spiderman to-date, although that may be a side effect of limited screen time leaving us wanting what... More please."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best Ironman Movie ever!!
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Good movie, decent story line with good plot twist, lots of action.  Better than superman vs batman. Marvel still got it."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,It was a good movie but definitely a big NO NO for spiderman.  Overall was a teenager movie.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War

Marvel goes dark.

Captain America: Civil War is the third standalone Captain America movie from Marvel Studios. It could also be looked at as Avengers 2 1/2 with the inclusion of such characters as Iron Man, Scarlet Witch, Vision, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Ant-Man, Falcon, Winter Soldier, War Machine, and with introductions of Black Panther and Marvel's newest iteration of Spiderman. Captain America: Civil War is a lot of things, but bad certainly ain't one of them.

Civil War is one of the darker more compelling offerings that Marvel has given us since 2014's Cap 2. And it's only fitting that it was directed by the same team of Joe and Anthony Russo, who no doubt know how these movies are supposed to be when the tone calls for it. The Captain America films in particular are very interesting because they're the only movies in the MCU that follow a continuous arch. And while Captain America's/Steve Roger's story is far from over (obviously because of Infinity War in two years), Civil War brings the standalone Captain America trilogy to satisfying conclusion.

Civil War addresses a major issue most people have with superheroes these days. It was also an issues touched on my Batman v. Superman earlier this year. The issue being; to what extent are superheroes useful if they get the job done but leave miles and miles of destruction and death in their path. The aftermath of the Sokovia attack by Ultron in the previous Avengers movie has left the team scarred, particularly Tony Stark/Iron Man. And after a recent incident in Wakanda where the team was dispatched to apprehend a few terrorists, people ended up dead on their watch once again. This leads to the United Nations proposing a Superhuman Registration Act. Similar to that of the Superhero Relocation Program in Disney Pixar's The Incredibles, in which the superhero's acts are monitored by the government to ensure there are no more casualties in their missions to come. This new law doesn't sit well with Steve Rogers/Captain America, who believes that The Avengers should be free to save the world without supervision by the United Nations. Tony Stark/Iron Man however believes they need to be put in check. And so a Civil War breaks out among the Marvel heroes. And their conflicting ideologies make up the emotional core of this movie.

Marvel movies have a lot of things going for them, one of which is sheer entertainment value. These movies don't need to have these huge complex storylines (i.e. Batman v. Superman) to be good. They work perfectly well as popcorn flicks. But more than every once in a while Marvel breaks the mold and gives us a movie that is both entertaining and thought-provoking. Civil War is one of those movies. They way they juggle the different views of Stark and Rogers and their various teams is brilliantly realized. You can't really choose a side here. And right when you think you've figured out who's in the right, the other side states their side of the story and soon you're not sure who to root for. Easily the most compelling storytelling since The Winter Soldier.

Of course, my favorite part of any movie is the acting so I'll talk about that for a bit. There isn't a weak performance in this movie. Everyone does their part brilliantly. Robert Downey Jr.  shows sides of Tony Stark we've never seen before in his previous five performances, as does Chris Evans as Steve Rogers/Cap. Of course there's the rest of the epic cast which rivals that of the first and second Avengers movies put together! Scarlet Johansson is back as Natasha Romanov/Black Widow and kicking a$$ as usual. Elizabeth Olsen is brilliant and gorgeous as Wanda Maximof/Scarlet Witch. Paul Bettany brings unexpected bouts of great humor as Vision. Paul Rudd returns as Scott Lang/Ant-Man and nails it (particularly in one laugh-out-loud scene). We also have Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes/Winter Soldier, Don Cheadle as James Rhodes/War Machine, Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton Hawkeye, and Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson/Falcon. BUT THATS NOT ALL!!! No, if you thought that was it we still have Chadwick Boseman's breakout role as the vengeful Black Panther and of course Tom Holland as the greatest version of Peter Parker/Spiderman I've seen since the first Sam Raimi film or from what little memory I have of the nineties cartoon. I expect great things from all these characters in the future. I'm particularly interested in what Marvel has planned for their new Spiderman because this one is definitely a keeper.

All in all, Captain America: Civil War is a pretty great movie! I personally prefer Winter Soldier for various reasons but I would certainly rank both films in my top five Marvel films or even top three. Definitely a worthy addition to the MCU.

****1/2"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,mehhh the movie was good but i expected more as always i think captain america is the worst avenger just because chris even is a shitty actor hes a complete faggot which fucked the movie up a bit but otherwise the rest of the characters were awsome but other than that movie was good
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"http://letterboxd.com/zbender/film/captain-america-civil-war/

Ah yes Marvel movies. I've mentioned many times before that I've grown tired of the spitting out of Marvel films. I mean fuck the last film I've seen from Marvel looking through their filmography is 2013's Thor: The Dark World. I know, I know. I still haven't bothered watching any of the past 3 years of  Avenger's type films (or Guardians of the Galaxy). Watching Deadpool wouldn't help. I think I'm just an X-men guy. However, how would I fare with Captain America: Civil War? Let's see!

So I needed a lot of backstory. That may have been a problem coming in. No Winter Soldier, but thankfully my BF is able to fill me in on what's gone on in the past three years of this universe, and I want to be interested but it's tough for me to get into it. So I try to get into the movie based on what's on screen alone, and what the fuck I fall asleep?!? Yep. The characters just don't interest me enough, and then there's political agendas to be met when we're pulling a Man of Steel with: holy shit these heroes could get out of control.. Regulate their actions! I guess this is the ""thought provoking themes"" some critics talked about, but honestly it was a conversation that I've had in my head multiple times, and nothing new was offered.

But then the movie was saved when we introduced Spider Man. Holy shit, Tom Holland saved this movie for me. I've been a Spider Man fan since Sam Raimi's movies and Spidie woke me up. I also never thought I would say that the hottest part of this movie was Aunt May. Holy shit. Okay moving on. Then it picked up and needless to say I then started having a lot more fun with it. Marvel humor was starting to hit, and the intensity started picking up. My favorite characters that I'm most interested looking at for future reference is Iron Man, Spider Man, Black Panther, and Ant Man. Fuck, Paul Rudd has come a long way since being Phoebe's boo. 

Slow in areas and exciting toward its conclusion, Captain America: Civil War pulled through at the end. I will wholeheartedly admit that I have bias against the Marvel universe. Hell this review may not be very helpful. However, Spider Man alone wants me to get back at it. Oh and did I mention Aunt May?!"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,One of the best Marvel films yet!
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Solid Story this time. Best Capt America movie By Far. Best Super Hero Action scene Ever!!
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Have to say best comic book movie to date. The story is well adapted and the directors deliver yet again. A movie that will be remembered for many years to come. Keep it going Marvel!
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,i Want to see That movie
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"With these big studio movies some people will think just about anything can be a spoiler, so I'm going to just warn about spoilers from the outset, and not waste time deciding when I've gone too far.  My non-spoiler opinion, though, is that Civil War is a good movie with some flaws.  I'll be anxious to watch it more in the future and solidify just where I would rank it among the other Marvel films.

Civil War is a movie where there are extremely spectacular moments that mostly outweigh the negatives.  Ordinarily these flaws would bother me a lot more, but in this movie they feel more like minor stumbles.  Repeat viewings will tell if the missteps stand out more or disappear. So let's review the negatives first and then spend some time heaping more praise on the movie.

Problem #1- The story takes a long time to set up. I realize that the story is kind of intricate and the complex motivations need proper explanation, but I kind of felt like I could see myself fast-forwarding to the good stuff now that I've seen all the slow parts once.

Problem #2- It's kind of frustrating when you find out the villain's master plan and you can't trace back how he could have possibly arranged things to occur as perfectly as they did in the film. I definitely see that he was taking smart steps in order to create discord amongst the Avengers, but I don't see how he planned on and arranged to get Bucky, Cap, and Tony all in that bunker at the end. 

Problem #3- I don't know why but the first two action scenes are loaded with the handheld-shaky-cam-with-rapid-cuts crap that Marvel is usually good about avoiding. I was dizzy, and utterly irritated that I couldn't really follow what was happening. Luckily they dropped that junk as the movie progressed.

Problem #4- They did a very poor job of making it clear why Cap (and his cohorts) were so opposed to the Accords. All they needed was Cap to verbalize the fact that licensing a person's existence is not the same as licensing inanimate objects (like the weapons that Tony keeps mentioning.) Unfortunately it came across more as a personal issue that hinged on saving his friend Bucky. When we got home my wife, who did enjoy the movie, said she hated Captain America. Not what I think they were going for, but even I was leaning towards Iron Man's side by the end.

So those are the primary issues I struggled with in the movie. I'm leaving out the fact that the ending was not exactly happy, which I wouldn't normally like, because I was impressed they had the guts to NOT resolve everything as the audience expected. Some of my issues were more noticeable than others, but they were dwarfed by the following great things...

Awesome #1- Marvel continues its amazing streak of movies that cover dark and emotional topics yet maintain a level of lightness and humor. It seems cliche at this point to say it, but Marvel continues to crush DC because their films are actually FUN to watch. I did not expect to laugh as much in this movie, but I did.

Awesome #2- Everyone's going to say it, but that's because it's true: the fight sequence in the middle of the movie at the airport is just stellar. I followed the whole thing, everybody had their moment, and I never wanted it to end.

Awesome #3- The entire plot (aside from the one glitch I mentioned about the villain's iffy plan) was constructed brilliantly. The movie transcended simple action sequences and had deeper emotional stakes that will last for some time in the MCU. The film even caught me by surprise with the little twist about Tony's parents at the end. That moment hit me hard because I didn't see it coming, and it was set up perfectly to earn the ensuing fight sequence.

Awesome #4- For my entire life I've always been an avid Spider-fan. He's been my favorite super hero over all others since I was a little kid watching Spider-Man cartoons. And this rendition of Spider-Man is the best ever brought to film. Every second he was there I loved it, and the moment he left I wanted him back in the story. My wife even told me, ""this is the first Spider-Man I ever genuinely liked.""

There was certainly more, but I don't want to walk through the whole movie here. It's an interesting film that didn't feel like any of the other MCU films. Civil War has its own style and should impress most movie-goers. It's definitely one of the better Marvel films."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Amazing film, this movie clearly divides the superheroes, and it's the type of film that's meant to be debated with. I love this movie. The movie does a good job showing both sides. However, I'm more team Iron Man myself, but I can see where people who are team cap are coming from."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Why wasn't this just an Avengers movie? There were more than enough superheros/villains for 3 movies.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,A movie that had it all and put it together well. A pleasure to watch and no Martha!
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Good solid chapter to the Marvel story.  Although there are lots of characters to juggle, it feels like they all blended well and made the most of their screen time.  Fun!"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Wow, talk about overcoming expectations. The fact that critics have been accused of taking bribes from Marvel to write positive reviews about their movies seems to be a desperate attempt to flatter DC movies, and make them feel better about their obvious lack of sales at the box office. Marvel clearly knows how to write a story, while giving their fandom what they want at the same time. Civil War is a blatant example of just that.

You really cannot help but go crazy over seeing how these characters have grown over the course of all of these movies. The action is spectacular without drowning out the other elements of fun. It put its focus on a single idea, and even when you thought it was going to trail away from that idea, it surprises you by going right back to it. The sideplots do not out stay their welcome, in fact some of the sideplots are very welcome. Every character was incorporated well, even though it made the movie runtime go on for a bit long, it did not make the movie drag. 

In the first few scenes, yes, the pacing was a little off. This was when everything needed to be set up, and after it was set up, the entire movie took off running, and the action was glorious. 

It was not a perfect movie, but any real complaints to be had are nothing more than nitpicks. It is a perfect addition to the Marvel collection, and a great movie all around. Yes, you need to watch the rest of the Avengers and Captain America Movies to know what is really going on, but that's the price of being a third sequel. As third movies go, this one is among the very greatest of its kind."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,The Zemo story line didn't make sense; the secret video in Siberia was absurd even for a Super Hero movie.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Probably one of the most solid movies in the ""Avengers"" lineup. I was pleasantly surprised to see that plot, character development, and ingenuity did not take a back seat to the humor. All in all I left the theater satisfied and I hope the other Marvel movies follow ""Civil War""s standard of quality."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Because of all the idiots that are giving it 5 stars, I'm giving Civil Wars a 1/2 star. Though in reality, all it deserves is 2 stars. It was hard sitting through this fluff and ill conceived movie."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Wow! Civil War was fantastic! Gonna see it again
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,The movie was a good addition to the series. It jumped around often. The inclusion of Spider-Man was a bit much. Captain America 2 was better. The theme of the internal struggles of the characters was well done.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,This movie was fantastic. Recaptures the feeling from the first Avengers movie and maybe even better than Guardians of the Galaxy. Can't wait to see it again.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,A war about ideals that leads to wounding revelations too deep for even a superhero to ignore.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War makes great use of the copious amount of heroes in the film. With a plot that challenges the audience moreso than previous Marvel entries, the film asks the audience to choose sides which creates interesting bits of tension. The titular hero and Iron Man lead the film, while Black Panther and Spiderman add some fun to the mix, however Marvel is once again plagued by dutiful obligation. Sometimes these films become unable to stand on their own due the sheer amount of backstory amongst the several thousand sequels and other MCU films. While hugely enjoyable and containing themes that stand out, Civil War never does anything groundbreaking in execution. Rating: 74"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Really Really good just more Spider-Man
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Another superhero behemoth that risks it all with multiple egos, storylines and battles. Yet the Russos hit a new record by stretching the limits of the genre without ripping the film apart. It might not be innovative, or convincingly answer its own ethical issues, or offer an ending that lives up to its grandiose title. But for the most part Civil War is an ambitious and notable example of the everlasting power of the cinema of attractions."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Synder, Take lessons from this movie. This is how Superman vs Batman should have been. The continuation of the universe matures and blossoms brighter."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Me canso de los Avengers, y los fanboys que llenan el ciberespacio. Bastante de estas pelÃ­culas de superhÃ (C)roe. Â¡Adelante a algo mÃ¡s, algo mejor!"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It's actually a lot of fun, expect some twists and turns that look like they don't make sense but are still worked out and quite enjoyable!"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Though it has its own problems like Batman v. Superman, Captain America: Civil War pleasantly kills your time and offers an interesting premise and villain"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,it was alright had a lot of action but the story was ok not great I like the spiderman and black panther appearances
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,this movie blows away Batman v Superman hope you're listening DC this is how you make a real movie
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Just saw it. It's very good... For what we expect from marvel. Funny. Predictable. Great management of so many characters and this Spider-Man is almost as good as Toby McGuire. Almost. Loved Black Panther. Great fight scenes. Would I see it again? Nope. Will I watch Batman v Superman for the 9th time? Yes.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,I don't know if anybody was paying attention but this movie was a subliminal message about how the soldiers have post traumatic stress how some of them were forced to do things they don't want to do by the government gives these orders and then take the orders back and then twists it on them. ! this movie was a reality a what are US soldiers go through I wonder if anyone else picked up on that?????
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Fucking. Amazing. 

What else really needs to be said?!?!?"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Probably the most serious of all the Marvel films and maybe the best one yet!
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Complex, emotional, treats its characters and audiences like adults and by the way awesome action."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"One of the better superhero films in recent memory, with at least one great new character introduction and a decent plot.  The primary driver of the story is 'character versus character' rather than 'character versus CGI', so I found that the film held my attention better than a lot of the big screen city-smash-fests that have been plaguing theaters in the last decade.

The fight choreography was a little frustrating due to excessive use of increased film speed, but otherwise it was a decent superhero movie."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"So well-balanced. Every character gets their moments, and they don't feel crammed in or out of place. And yet it still feels like a ""Captain America"" movie because his viewpoint is front and center. And fun! Take note, DC."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Just left a bad taste in my mouth.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It was better than I expected I guess. It wasn't as terrible as Ant-Man or Age of Ultron, but as a film, it's really not much more than a showcase of the characters and set pieces. The plot is still pretty contrived, and I didn't really feel that the motivations of the characters were genuine, seeing as most of them just change their minds on the whole killing each other thing whenever the script says they have to.

But as far as showcases go, Civil War did have some pretty good scenes. The fights were pretty coherent this time around even though they were big and flashy, which I guess we can thank the Russo Bros. for because they seem to be good at that shit. I guess I liked Spider-Man ok even though he's so absurdly out of place in this movie, and the entire thing was just a big advertisement for New Spidey.

Most of the characters in the movie really didn't need to be there, and case in point, most of them seriously show up in time for the big airport fight(AKA the scene the movie was made for) and then exit about as gracefully as they entered. And the big mastermind plot of the film is honestly secondary to the whole superhero fight thing, to the point where Zemo might as well have not even been in it. 

On top of all that, the interaction between the characters really felt wooden for most of the film. They kept trying to do the trademark Marvel humor thing in the middle of scenes where it didn't fit, and as a result most of the humor fell completely flat, not only to me, but even the rest of the people in the theater didn't seem to laugh at the designated spots. However, unlike say Ant-Man where I can't remember a single genuine laugh, Civil War did eventually manage to deliver some true comedy with the ""Can you move your seat up"" line, so it's not completely hopeless.

Overall it's a pretty stupid movie, but it's a pretty damn competently made stupid movie. I don't feel like my time was wasted on it, but it still suffers from Marvel's escalation fetish. Wherein each new movie has to be bigger and more epic and feature more characters than it truly needs. I thought this movie would be the one to overdo it but it managed to stay just shy of being bloated."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Truly Amazing movie ! one I will see multiple times.  Perfect movie.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I thought the movie was pretty good, and I grade it a ""B"". Unfortunately, I read too many reviews in advance, so I was expecting this to be better than it was. That made it a little disappointing for me. This was the exact opposite effect of BvS. I saw so many horrible reviews, I was expecting that to suck, so I was pleasantly surprised when I liked it a lot. 

The problem with Civil War was I feel like I've seen this movie before. It's conflicts go back to the first Avengers movie. So whereas the fights between the protagonists in that movie were AWESOME, the fights in this movie were nothing new, just extra heroes. 

On the positive side, Captain America is always one of my favorites from when I was a kid. He was really good. Falcon was much more interesting than I thought he would be. The sbarky Downey quips were kept down, which is good since that is getting played out. For once, Black Widow didn't have any sexual tension with one of her male teammates. She and Hawkeye (and Falcon) were  excellent. Black Panther was interesting, and his appearance didn't  feel forced.  I liked seeing Spiderman, but the way that was handled was both a positive (because Spidey is always awesome) and a negative (see below).

On the negative side, the action sequences were just okay. They weren't great or even really good. They were okay. The airport fight scene was not as good as it was cracked up to be, though it had its moments. Spiderman and Ant Man were kind of shoehorned into the story. They were both kind of like the Flash scene from Batman v. Superman in that they were forced into the plot for sake of expanding the character frame of the movie. However, since Marvel wasn't trying to kick start a franchise, the resulting roughness was a little less necessary (but Spidey is still awesome). 

My kids liked it pretty well, and the general consensus was an 8 or 9 out of 10.

In comparison to other superhero movies, it was about as good as Spider Man 2, Ant Man, Batman, Batman Returns, Batman Forever, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, The Amazing Spiderman. It was better than Spiderman 3, Avengers age of Ultron, Captain America 1, The Incredible Hulk, Hulk, any Thor movie, Iron Man 2 or 3, Superman III and IV, Amazing Spiderman 2, any X-men movie, and Batman and Robin. It was not as good as Superman 1 or 2, any Nolan Batman movie, Spiderman 1, or Avengers.

To compare it to the recent DC Universe movies, it was almost, but not quite, as good to me as Batman v. Superman. It did not have the rough hewn edges of the Batman v. Superman movie and it was better in character development, but the action sequences were a little off. I go see these movies to watch superheroes using superpowers, so I want the action to be excellent and it wasnt. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great either. I would say Man of Steel (which I really liked) was better than this, but not by a huge margin. I think I just prefer the more serious tone of the DC movies, and the lighthearted Marvel tone is wearing thin for me. 

In other words, like I said, I always feel like I have seen the Marvel movies before. It was still entertaining. It was pretty good. I was not blown away, but that is not necessary to make a movie worth seeing. Your kids will like it."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Awesome in every way........... Love It..... sorry Iron-man but it's Team Cap for me all the way
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,I could probably watch this movie 20 million times and I'd love it even more each time. I am just so proud of the film and I didn't make it. I want to buy the Blu-Ray already. Please? Yeah? Ok I know I need to wait ð??­ð???ð??»ð???ð??»ð???ð??»
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The absolute best and most inspired part of the Captain America trilogy that puts a fitting bookend to one of the better Marvel multiparty sagas, and only makes one shudder with anticipation what the next Avengers sequel will have to offer!ð~"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"incredible! Marvel knows how to make a great superhero movie, and did it again."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,good visuals and fight scenes. iron man was an ass. both cap and iron man petty most concerned with their friends or their mamma. what the hell. turned our heroes into wussies!
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Incredible movie. Marvel continues to thrive with their films. Frequently outdoing themselves. Believe all of the hype. Definitely one of the best comic book movies of all time. Fantastic story, well written characters/dialogue and tons of fan service."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Easily the best movie of the MCU and maybe even the best comic book movie ever made.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"After a lackluster initial installment in the franchise, Captain America surprisingly set the standard for Marvel super hero movies with The Winter Soldier. Civil War ups the ante once again, raising the standard not just for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but the super hero genre as a whole. It's fun, fast, energetic and full of all the action and well-timed comedy that we love about comic book movies."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The worst line is""I can do this all day."""
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best marvel movie so far...looking forward to black panther movie.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,the best mcu movie yet and that is saying a lot
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"THIS should have been AVENGERS 2, though it couldn't have happened without the events of that movie occuring. And they finally get Spider-Man right."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I rarely give a 5 star rating but this movie exceeded my expectations. 
Good story, good characters, new characters and it was NOT all comical and silly like past Avengers movies.  Hope you see it and more important hope you enjoy watching it."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I felt that this movie was exceptional, and has definitely proven Marvel knows what it takes to make a superhero movie. I didn't think they could top, let alone keep up to par with the winter soldier, and they proved me wrong. I'm glad they finally have spiderman in their universe. spiderman was portrayed as he should be, and black panther outdone my expectations. I loved it to the end, and want disappointed. I will be going to see this film again, and be just as happy and excited as I was the first time."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Can Marvel do no wrong? The Russo Brothers nail it again.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I won't call it ""greatest superhero movie"" I've ever seen, but again Marvel does a great job of storytelling and giving each character the right lines and space for you to appreciate their space on the screen.
Very excited about the role Black Panther plays in this movie. And the Spider-Man addition is beautiful...so is Aunt May (flipped the script on that one).
Still couldn't give it 4-stars on first viewing in regular iMax. Maybe I feel differently in 3D. You tell me.
Overall, 2 thumbs up!"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Perfect Comic Book Movie.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"My problem with ""Civil War"" is the third act, the villain even has an interesting motivation, but is told in a too expository, and the final, which only proves how Disney put his finger on this film. Not to mention that all the political discussion of the saga that is very well suited in the first act, is lost in the course of the film and he had seen only a blockbuster. The fact is that the film is extremely fun, the characters are well developed, the action sequences are innovative and have excellent introductions to this universe that Marvel built, the Black Panther is certainly the best arch there and the ""Spider-Man ""it's all I as a big fan of the character wanted to see, he's young, he's funny, he has a nice uniform and is still responsible. Best character adapted to theaters today. Overall, I was a little disappointed, but nothing like ""Age of Ultron"" or the unpardonable ""Iron Man 3"". I just think it should have been less ambitious and have made a movie just the captain to close the bow with Bucky. For what reasons ""Captain America 2"" is the best Marvel? Because it is innovative and you just do not expect anything from him, then he gives you that punch in the belly and you to finish the film is thinking. ""I continued"" But ""Civil War"" enters the top 5 of Marvel, but not the best studio. My note to ""Civil War"" is 8."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Great movie. It did a wonderful job setting up the future of more marvel films, and felt like a complete story on its own, unlike Batman V. Superman."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Truly awesome. Tough. This is how you do it, DC!"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,A spectacular and sensational superhero film in every sense of the word!
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"More of a full on Avengers movie rather than a standalone Captain America movie, and it was pretty darn good. I found myself torn between Team Cap and Team Iron Man, but in the end, I kinda think Captain America is kind of a douche for sticking up for Bucky Barnes."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Perfection from start to finish. The story, special effects, and action sequences were all firing on every cylinder. Better than any of the other recent Marvel movies, it even manages to cram lots of characters in without feeling forced. Everything seems to flow so naturally and effortlessly that I wonder if subsequent Marvel movies will feel like a letdown. It even manages to be emotionally involving.

I'd like to imagine Zack Snyder sitting in the audience and saying to himself, ""Oh, I see what I did wrong, now."""
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,TEAM SPIDEY. TEAM. SPIDEY. EEK.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Amazing, exceeds all expectations !!!!"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It was watchable, good cg and action. Not a blockbuster but ok."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Solid Liked that it was grittier/less glib than the last one.  Dragged a little in the middle.  I liked Batman Vs Superman better but still it was worth seeing
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Makes up for the disappointing Age of Ultron. The airport scene is FANTASTIC! Might just be my favourite Marvel movie and definitely the best in the Captain America Trilogy. Spidey was my fave :)
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Was even better than I thought it would be. The Cap movies have not disappointed.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Awesome flick! Just over 2 hours but moves so fast it feels like 45 minutes. #teamironman
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Awesome fun movie, great reason to have stark and cap go toe to toe, spidey, antman and black panther stole the show when they were in it.  The villain was also amazing, quite possibly their best one yet...and simply because he was written well....except for one issue I had.  

The only reason this wasn't 5 stars to me was the plot hole/paradox to the villains plan.  I won't post any spoilers but lets just say he had no reason to search for the specific thing he was searching for without already knowing what it was...which in turn made it pointless that he search for it."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Very perplexing.  I saw this opening night with high expectations knowing the Civil War comic storyline.  There was certainly a lot of action, but very little substance despite what I was reading from other reviews.  There were way to many characters vying for screen time and the new Spider-Man was just obnoxious.  At the end of the movie I realized that after two and a half hours, nothing really happened.  It is always a pleasure to see Stan Lee in his cameo, though.  As a fan of superhero movies, I'd give this a B- with very little repeat viewability.  It would be hard to sit through again."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"All the action was there, but the logic and the heart was not. Had some good moments and characters, but the movie came off as formulaic and unsatisfying fluff."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,as usual marvel is just more evolved with how to tell super hero stories. This is a excellent film that's setting up a theme that will last for a few more Avenger movies.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Marvel just totally ripped out DC's balls, like for good!! And the D-Box! MotherFucker!!"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Saw it in XD 3D and was GREAT!!!   Spiderman and Black Panther worked very well in their intros.   Airport battle best ever!  Go see it!!
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This was a Cap movie that didn't loose much from its sequel. Which was you're belief in the Cap. The only doubts I had was who was playing Spider-Man and the costume. Only thing about the spidy story wrong was his ""over attractive aunt"". Thinking about it, you feel a lot of wrong with that. A let down in it is the villains plan. All in all, the movie itself was worth watching."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,greatt moovie. wow moovie of the year i think
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Thrilling, exciting, kinetic, funny, surprising, and at times, heartbreaking. All this adds up to what is IMHO, the best MCU movie yet. While this is the third Captain America movie, it plays out much like an Avengers film and yet keeps Cap front and center. Alongside Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr gives his best performance as tiny Stark/Iron Man. In fact everyone is awesome in this movie. It may seem that there are too many characters, but everyone gets their shining moment; no one gets shafted. The two newest additions, Black Panther and Spider-Man fits in like a glove. Regarding the latter, Tom Holland *killed* it as Peter Parker/Spider-Man and is probably my favorite portrayal of the character on the big screen.

The 'Civil War' part of the movie feels earned as everything that has built up over the course of the past 8 years finally comes to a head. I was firmly on Team Cap going in, but found myself flip flopping as both sides had valid points. Should The Avengers answer to governing bodies that may have their own hidden agendas, or should the remain autonomous with no oversight? The movie gives no definitive answer, but it does change the dynamics of the team moving forward.

In the end, Captain America Civil War continues Marvel Studios winning streak by giving us a crowd pleaser that also elicits a wide range of emotions and leaves us looking forward to see what happens next.

Oh, as with all Marvel Studios films, there are 2 end credit scenes; one mid credits and one post credits. Both are worth staying for."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The characters are well integrated into the movie and believably motivated, and the action sequences are amazing. Spider-Man steals his scenes. Still, it's painful to watch your heroes beat each other bloody. Cap II was the better movie."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Hands down best Captain America movie, best Avengers movie, best Marvel movie and just overall one of the best movies I've ever seen. It does everything it tries to do perfectly. Everything come beautifully together at the end in an epic well-directed action-packed finale. It is just THAT good.
Rating: 11/10 (no serious go watch this movie. Now!)"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Would have been 5 stars if it wasn't for Aunt May,"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Great movie a must see. Whether you're a fan or not you will enjoy this movie.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This story is particularly good and interesting, These characters are all well developed by now and they have built this commodore that it almost makes you feel it's unbreakable and they are the ultimate heroes. The writers did a great job in weaving a tale that delved into much more depth of each character's personal journey, conflicts and struggles that will eventually pit them against each other. Having seen all the previous movies will definitely make it easier to follow as their stories are intertwined in one way or another. They also introduced a new character - The Black Panther, I believe he will make a great stand alone series in the future. A refreshed and younger Spiderman was also introduced, aside from comic relieve, i didn't feel he was really necessary but it is scheduled to be the next franchise in line so it made sense that they included the character. As with all the other Marvel movies, the special effects and sequences makes it worth while to see it on the big screen."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best Marvel film yet! #TeamCap
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,FAAAAWWWWKKKKK YYEEEAAAAHHHH
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Hands down, best Marvel movie since the 1st Avengers! May even be better than that one! Go see it!"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I admit, I'm not a big fan of the heroes fighting each other.  I don't need internal drama and struggle.  Just give me a big bad to fight and good verses evil.  That said, the comic this film was inspired by was still entertaining and they do a great job translating it to the big screen.  Paul Rudd, as usual, steals the movie and there's a great intro to a new character to the Marvel film universe.  I do have one major problem though, it seems with each Marvel film, we have to up the profanity.  My 8-year old is dying to see this, but he'll have to wait a couple of years for something that could have easily been avoided."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"yest EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIIIICCCCCC!!!!!! damn qu'ils ont enfin Réussis à faire le Avengers movie que tout lmonde attendait!! :O (C'est littéralement Avengers 3 ste films la.. mélanger à la BD de (Captain America : Winter Squad)

l'histoire est assez complexe à souhaits, mais EXTREMEMENT intéressante contrairement à BVS... le new spider-man.. c'est le spider-man des CARTOONS DES ANNÉES 90 ENFIN!!! celle que tout lmonde VOULAIT!!! :O

Black Panther: Suprenament EPIC et ya assez de contenu dans ste film la pour vouloir avoir mon intéret pour le Black Panther film!!

Les scènes d'action: EPICCC.. On voit enfin le carnage que des superheroes peuvent créer juste entre eux donc imagine quand Thanos va arriver!! :O


Bref, ils ont réussis à faire un des films de marvel les plus ENTERTAINING depuis Guardiant of the galaxy!! (le 1st IRON-man viens de tomber number 3 apres avoir vue sa... 1: Guardiant of the galaxy 2: CP:`CIVIL WAR 3: IRON MAN 1)"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America:Civil War is an amazing film with minor flaws throughout. I strongly recommend seeing this movie, it is the best of the MCU so far."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Outrageously good movie 2nd best superhero movie I saw, story was good ,action was off the chain & a lot of it"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Am I missing something? 2 1/2 hours that I will never get back... Do yourselves a favour and take a book so you at least get some kind of story.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Best way to summarize this is that it's like a VERY yummy Buffet in Vegas.  It's not quite the fine dining (artsy movies), and it's not a quick drive thru type of movie.  Everything tastes pretty good... But there are some things that are a bit drawn out, and some things that makes you wonder if the writers stuck that scene in just for that extra Ooommphf... But in the end, you are satisfied, and you will come back for seconds later on because it was just an overload of comic book kickassery.  

Comparison to another movie : Empire Strikes Back.  (Sometimes Literally)

Best scene : (Non - spoiler) Best group fight scene since Lord of The Rings Return of the King.  It was Epic.

Lots of emotion, lots of heart, you feel for the characters, and appreciate the gravity of all of it.  Something that another movie tried to encompass with a ""MARTHA"" scene, and that didn't work too well."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Great action cuts, fantastic direction marvel is finally headed towards"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Absolutely fantastic movie.  It's action from start to finish and every character entertains.  It's more an Avengers movie than a Captain America one......but who cares!!!
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,There isn't a grade scale with a number that reaches high enough to be given to this movie. Sublime in every form.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,I loved it!  This is what a superhero flick should be!  (DC take note.)
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Amazing!!! I thought with such a large ensemble it would be too crowded of a story but it wasn't. People tend to forget how amazing the graphics are because they are so spoiled.  So good. Ant Man and Spider man where great and very comical. 2.5 hrs and it was entertaining the whole ride. Black Panther was also pretty awesome. Marvel is killing it right now!
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR (3D) -- The dynamically illustrated pages of the comic books from my youth were fully realized on the big screen in this superhero flick, better than ever! Personally, I didn't feel this was a better movie than Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice... it was different, but marvelous in its own way. It had humor, clever actions sequences, surprising plot twists, and a bit of a rebellious edge to it. Even though I think this film was great... it actually made me appreciate Batman v Superman even more. Although Captain America had enthralling action set pieces with tricky camera moves, Batman's cinematography focused more on artistic visual design with color and light. Captain America's crowd-pleasing character's ague about the politics of a government justice system, while Batman's downbeat characters battle over the philosophy of what it means to be a ""just"" citizen. The quieter moments of dialogue in Captain America were peppered with humorous jabs at each other's egos, while the conversations in Batman were peppered with witty dialogue loaded with social commentary. Different, but not better than its rival. Less cerebral, but more fun, for sure."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Disney/Marvel brings Captain America: Civil War to theatres with a tremendous amount of star power, marketing and expectations. In the wake of the critical fumble of another comic book-based squabble movie as well as coming off the successes of The Winter Soldier and Avengers: Age of Ultron, Captain America and company have some mighty big shoes to fill. 

As televised, the film is ""everything a summer blockbuster should be"". But to add to this, the film is also one that is intelligently crafted and narrated in a voice that is mature, insightful and honest. The Russo brothers retain their knack for balanced story-telling by throwing in truly emotional weight into a script that is engaging and exciting. Virtually all of the characters receive a fair bit of shine in Civil War (as was the case in The Avengers). Even the newcomers to the MCU (Black Panther, Spider-Man) are treated to a reasonable amount of depth and backstory to justify their involvement in the conflict. Marvel's flare for wholesome laughter and humour does not take away from the significance of the conflict at hand; it breaks the tension when there is tension to be broken. Detractors of Marvel's style of cinematic experience forget that the jokes and punch lines don't come at inopportune moments; they're there to enhance the ""fun"" of going to the theatre. 

With a running time of 147 minutes, Civil War is just as long as the aforementioned Batman v Superman but without the dead space and lulls that made BvS 'feel' long. As a movie that pushes 2.5 hours, the story takes many turns and focuses and refocuses on varying standpoints which can make it a bit jarring and difficult to perceive the larger picture. Some have criticized the title for its emphasis on Captain America when the film is the obvious successor to Avengers: Age of Ultron. But does that preclude the fact that at its core, the film continuously encircles the decisions of Captain America to guide its narrative? Yes, Tony Stark is the other half of the Civil War coin. Yes, many of the characters introduced and made relevant in Age of Ultron are now front and centre in this film. Yes, Spider-Man is kind of shuttled in unnecessarily and then proceeds steals away with the sequence in which he is featured. But Cap is ever-present throughout this tale and it is his relationship with both James ""Bucky"" Barnes and Tony Stark that gives rise to the story and its eventual conclusion. The Russo brothers have come up with a true sequel to The Winter Soldier while not discrediting or neglecting the events of Age of Ultron. This rather large task needed to be handled skillfully otherwise it would have ended up as another Avengers movie and it can be confidently stated that they did just that. They told a Captain America story with essentially the largest supporting case of any superhero film.

Though the film is not without its minor flaws, it does give movie-goers a glimpse of what may be possible in terms of bringing together a large cast of characters portrayed by equally large Hollywood names all the while backed by one of the largest media conglomerates in the world. The film is a spectacle and a rollercoaster in every sense of that metaphor. The ups and downs come in the form of rising and falling action, emotional engagement and playful vs serious tones. I believe Hollywood will be hard-pressed to produce another summer blockbuster this year that, overall, is as gratifying as Captain America: Civil War."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Packed theater with adults. At the end of the movie these adults were children... clapping and cheering.

The movie was a blast. I had a great time watching it. I have to admit it is not what I expected.... good and bad. Don't get me wrong I had a blast with this flick but there are a few things that frustrated me, very minor things but the only major one is... where is the villain? Zemo was a joke of a character. If this movie had a real Baron Zemo I would had come out of that theater with the need to change my ""underoos"" but the lack of a real villain took away some of the edge and purpose of the conflict. So they just fight because they disagree on the toppings they want on their pizza? The movie is inspired by the comics but it is not like the comics, reason I'm complaining. Why not make this more of a larger scheme were the Avengers fighting is just part of a major evil plan by Zemo? Still the problems between Captain America and Iron Man are deep rooted and the last twist at the end gives the whole fight an edge and meaning. Not to mention the whole movie is pretty dramatic for a comic book movie. This could be the best superhero movie ever made.

I was delighted by all the characters. Cap and Iron Man were my favorites. People say Spidey and Panther were the best... nah. I never cared much for Tony Stark before but in this movie I definitely enjoyed his character 100% and understand his point of view on everything... I'm still with Cap all the way but Tony's choices now make sense to me. Strangely this is the first time I saw Stark as a ""human being"" and not as a rich asshole with the world at his finger tips. He even appears to be like a Father to ""some""! Steve Rogers is a simple yet complex character. He thinks like a military man and has a heart of gold, this creates so much chaos in his life. I love Cap because I can relate to him of all characters. Spider-Man was great. At first when he appears I was like... where is his bottle and bib, but in seconds he won me. Best Spidey ever put on the screen, hands down. I'm very excited to see HOMECOMING. I'm guessing I'm not as impressed as others by Spidey because he is so young and I cannot relate to him. It is like watching a little nephew or brother get into adventures, unlike the other characters that are all around my age. Black Panther, Bucky, Scarlet Witch, Ant-Man and Hawkeye were great. Falcon was so cool. My least favorite would be Vision, he is meh. He is too powerful for this plot and unbalanced in the whole dilemma. The ""airport"" scene, oh God, reminded me of playing with my action figures when I was little. It was phenomenal!

I can't say more about the movie because I would get into spoilers and you guys ain't here for that. See it! I'm watching it again in a few days grin emoticon The people that would not enjoy this movie are the hardcore DC fanatics (jealous because this is how you do a versus movie) or people who are dead inside and don't care for superheroes on the screen.

BEST SUPERHERO TRILOGY"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"?#?Civilwar? is a great movie, with a great cast, with a story exactly like the one from BvS.

However, other than the action scenes, it is virtually everywhere when it comes to directing, and about 90% removed from the actual civil war story arc. Marvel made a great movie about great characters played by a great cast, and decided to dump the comic book in the trash.

If you didnt like Batman vs Superman, there is no logical reason to like Civil War more. Im going to take a line from all of the BvS reviews and call this movie's attempt at a Comic Book: humorless, bland and uninspired.
Marvel had the opportunity to take one of my favorite Marvel comic arcs (second only to World War Hulk) and make it come to life. Instead they took the title and flushed the subject matter down the toilet.

Baron Zemo, though acted well was a completely different character from his comic book alter ego. And people will love him even though they hated Eisenberg's Luthor for the same exact thing.

I was really hoping that the trailers werent giving us the full picture, but unfortunately, they did. What was a global conflict in the comics is degraded to a parking lot brawl in the movie and most of the most memorable characters from the conflict arent even featured at all.

As far as technical arguments go, some of the CGI was deeply frustrating and honestly unacceptable, which is a small problem i had with Batman vs Superman as well. But what occured in BvS only once, occurs pretty much every time Spiderman or Falcon are on the screen in Civil War.
Chris Evans and RDJ are still the best parts of the MCU outside of Ruffalo's Hulk... But guess where he's at?

Not in this movie.

Marvel made a good popcorn movie, but as a comic book movie, they fell flat on their faces. If you are a fan of the MCU, you will fall for this movie, hook line and sinker. If you are a reader of the subject material. You will walk out shaking your head.

However, ultimately, everything everyone hated about BvS they will love about this movie. And I guess that is just the world we live in.

6.5/10

P.S: Peter Parker was literally perfect. Literally."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Okay i saw captain America or was that the avengers??? Seemed more like an avengers movie. Anyways, it was an awesome movie!!!! It kind of worries me because when the new avengers movie comes out they have to top this movie. It will be interesting if it could be done!"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,I caught this movie last night and this might be one of best Marvel movies so far. I will definitely will be going back to catch again. I love Spiderman but I have to admit the Antman stole the show
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Phase Three of the Marvel Cinematic Universe kicks off with a bang.

I've been a big fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since its inception, and have stuck with it seeing almost all of them in theaters. The movies themselves have their ups and downs, teeter-tottering between genuine character developing storylines and mind-numbing summer popcorn action. This movie, I'm glad to say, focuses on the MCU's character development and is an improvement on the semi-disappointing Avengers: Age of Ultron.

The Positives: One big positive I had with the movie was the introduction to the new characters; specifically the two new heroes, Black Panther and Spider-Man. I felt as if both Black Panther and Spider-Man were great additions to the universe and did not feel shoe-horned in at all. Tom Holland absolutely killed it as Spider-Man. I'm extremely excited to see his standalone movie because he already has me rethinking my favorite Spider-Man portrayal. Another positive I had with this movie was its fight scenes. The Russos focused in on more stick-to-the-ground, hand-to-hand combat (much like they did for The Winter Soldier) rather than big CGI explosion-fests. The airport scene (which is shown pretty heavily in the trailers, but doesn't spoil any of the good parts) is probably my favorite scene in the movie. I geeked out pretty hard when each side had 6 team members and they both started slowly walking up to each other, then started running towards each other, and finally it was an all out brawl. It was just such a fun, nerd-out scene of probably 15-20 minutes of action. Finally, my last positive I want to talk about is the final ""twist"" in the movie. I don't want to spoil anything in the movie, but two characters have a certain connection that the audience doesn't know about and neither does one of the other characters. This leads to the last fight scene in the movie. It was one of the few times the MCU has truly shocked me. I'm glad they included this.

The Negatives: One kind of severe gripe I had about this movie was the first act. Holy crap was it bloated. There was just way too much going on. In the first act there was a flashback from the 90s about the Winter Soldier, an Avengers mission which included Crossbones, backlash because of the mission, Tony Stark talking at MIT, Tony's relationship with Pepper is rocky, a Hydra subplot, and eventually the main plot of the movie which is the mixed feelings about the Avengers being controlled by the UN. Although a lot of what I mentioned that happens in the first act eventually makes sense and is fine by the end of the story, it was just a lot to take in for the first third of the movie.

Verdict: It's a great MCU movie, definitely in the top 4. I highly recommend seeing this movie if you love the Marvel brand, or comic book movies in general. Don't be afraid to geek out in the theaters, folks!"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"One of the finest films Marvel has put out thus far, the stakes actually feel real in this one. It's a massive film that juggles all sorts of characters, tones, and thoughts, but it's all brought together nicely. The addition of Spider-Man and Ant Man brings a much needed lightness to this dark story of broken ties."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Amazing. This movie makes BvS look like one of those cheap knock-off redbox rentals. The fights actually make sense and propel a cognitive story forward.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Hands down the best marvel movie to date!!

"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,It was a great balance of action with a complete story line. Can't wait to see what they come up next!
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,The rare marvel movie that got me sold & sold me big time
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Another awesome Marvel installment. Just enough back story and great plot ties in the new characters perfectly. Best Spider-Man ever. Finally caught the whimsical side of the character. Stay through the credits, two post scenes."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Alot less useless dialogue. Really nice fight scenes. Wish Black Panther movies came out tomorrow.  OMG great debut for one of my favorite characters.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,This movie was good in the beginning but as the movie progressed I was very very disappointed if I were any one I would wait for x men or Sucide squad
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Russo brothers deliver a heart-wrenching tragic comedy filled with the best action scenes ever in what is the final act of arguably the greatest superhero trilogy.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,I really liked the introduction of SpiderMan and Black Panther but the last 20 minutes just didn't work for me.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Both Avengers movies directed by Joss Wheddon were so campy (in an awful way), that Civil War saying people died on those films feels like a ret-con, and that's a major disadvantage Civil War suffers being a sequel to 2 poorly made comedies films. Now, Spiderman and Antman don't know why the f*ck the fight was about., and what should have been a dramatic fight scene plays like friend playing Smash Bros. To make matters worse the trigger that causes the final Cap vs Ironman fight is not the opposing ideologies, instead is a forced plot development, which sort of just exists so the fight can happen, which majorly cheapens the whole enterprise. Now the Spiderman / Ironman setup I utterly hate it. No w Winter Soldier being mind controlled also cheapens the character and it's motivations, as it fully reedems and absolves the character from all sins. The villian is an improvement over previous Marvel Cinematic Universe villians, Marvel Cinematic Universe has many of the worst developed villians of all time, they might be super developed on comcs I really dont know as I dont read them, but their film counterparts are usually  terribly one-dimensional, thankfully Civil War does better, Also why title the film Civil War othe than marketing purposes, if there's no war at all and also no one dies? Bring back Jhon Favrea"

"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Just pure entertainment right here. Not quite as good as Winter Soldier, but still damn fun to watch. Seeing the bigger roster of heroes together is a sight to behold, especially adding Spidey! I think Marvel is going to bring the best version of him yet and Tom Holland plays him to a T for the few minutes he's here.
Really great storytelling as to where all the films are leading. Greatly excited for more from the MCU!"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,There is real conflict here. This is one of the best Marvel movies.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"All I can say is excellent, Excellent,  EXCELLENT! 3D in affect and definitely a MUST SEE!"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Excellent well done.  Didn't care for the Star Wars reference that began with ""This old movie..."" and I cant see Marisa Tomei as Aunt May."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"What I expected which was disappointing. Another weak villain in Baron Zemo as the Avengers fight each other. Spider-man looked and acted so pathetic. You don't really get a sense of any Avengers being in grave danger because it's a family movie and of course they aren't going to do anything drastic knowing Disney. Now that I wasted my time and money, looking forward to X-men Apocalypse."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"There's nothing I can say about Civil War that more eloquent and prominent critics won't cover first.  All I can say is that, like it's predecessors, the Captain America films continue to be the height of the Marvel franchise.

I went into this film with several reservations already in place, and I have to say...I ate all the negative words I'd said about this film leading up to the release. Any concerns I'd had about characterization?  Gone.  All my worries about hokiness and pandering?  Gone.  This was a well crafted film that both payed homage to the comic book arc it was loosely based on and made the story new and interesting enough not to bore an audience that already knew the story going in.

My only complaints stem from the expected places.  Ant-Man and Spider-Man really had no purpose in this film.  They were amusing.  I enjoyed them.  Their scenes were very fun.  But they did nothing really to add to the plot beyond adding more names to big heavyweight fight roster.  They could have been cut from the film entirely and there wouldn't have been much of a difference, all in all.

My absolute favorite aspect of this film?  How they handled Natasha.  I was very concerned leading up to this based on the fact that she was on Tony's side, something that put her opposite both Steve and Clint, a situation that I found to be hugely out of character and difficult to understand.  How they handled it both made sense and was brilliantly in character for her and leads me, yet again, to echo the masses and ask, Where is my Black Widow movie?

This film was definitely a return to the goodness Marvel had to offer that was sorely lacking in its recent films, like Dark World and Ultron.  It gives me high hopes for the lead up to Infinity Wars, and I can only hope they don't lose this momentum."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Fantastic movie that really sets the mood for the rest of Phase 3
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Amazing movie high action fight scenes that actuall lasted a while unlike some movies. Had a nice simple easy to follow plot and only story was the avengers no origins unlike some movies. And Tom Hollands spiderman was amazing glad marvel has spidey back. The only thing I had an issue with was Ant-Man was a bit to clingy it's one thing to be a fan but the writers way over did it.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Kids today will take this movie for granted, but for those who have been waiting for the last 30-odd years, know that each shot in this movie is worth every single day of your life that you waited for a movie like this to happen. So, Spider-Man Civil War is a worthy sequel to The Avengers."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Loved it. Best Comic movie ever made.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,What the hell! It's not even in the top five of the superhero genre!
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"WOW! Finally! The best Marvel movie ever! Title is Captain America, but it was like Avengers 3! Unbelievably dynamic, thrilling, exciting, emotional and really really funny! IMAX 3D was unbelievably fantastic! Actors were great! So many super heroes fought each other! Story was smart and nice. Jaw dropping special effects! Anthony and Joe Russo directed it really funny and wonderful! Joss Whedon couldn't make Avengers 1 & 2 like this! So many surprises and shockes! It was 146 minutes but I didn't feel and I didn't want to end! See it in IMAX 3D! Oh so many people didn't leave until movie's end! Because extra bonus scene was after the long end credits! Yes, they knew it! Fantastic!"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I found this movie to be entertaining with a lot of cool action.  However, it went WAY long.  I don't think Spiderman brought a lot to the film and if about 25 minutes could have been cut out, it would have flowed much better.  
Thinking it is setting itself up for the next couple movies.
BUT, See it in the theater!  Worth it!"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,simply put...Captain America Civil War is a masterpiece.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I suppose you could show cow manure and say it's from Marvel and all the Marvelites would go crazy and say, ""God darn! It's the best movie since Citizen Kane!"" I see where a fanboy begged for all the comic nerds to rate high so ""Civil War"" won't go under 92%. Crazy man! It makes me really dislike fanboys: Marvel, DC, Darkhorse, etc! To the general public: it's not a great flick or a horrible one. It's an average movie. I rate it half a star, cos of the lunatic fanboys. Skip it!"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America Civil War Review

Ok so I saw Captain America Civil War last night. The movie was great. Marvel started off phase 3 both a bang. The Russo's are back and they've adidas a few new characters. First and foremost this is a captain America movie. I know there was a lot of hesitation with EVERYONE (minus Hulk and Thor) showing up. Most of the avengers are cameos. The additions of Black panther and Spiderman to the MCU had me overjoyed. To see my favorite web-head in the same scene as iron man and Captain America had me overjoyed. I've said it since I heard the news and from previous recasting a but Marvel makes the best versions of their characters.(sorry Sony) and Black Panther is a badass. He's  great fighter and a fast runner. The airport sequence was great. I won't go as far to say BEST ACTION SCENE EVER like so many others have but I will say BEST ACTION SEQUENCES IN A COMIC BOOK MOVIE. this 20 minute set piece had me drooling in my chair at all of the mayhem that was going down with Heroes fighting Heroes and the scene doesn't disappoint. 

This movie isn't perfect(which was disappointing for me with all of the hype surrounding this film) I expected to absolutely love it it which may be showing my cards a bit but let's talk some of my problems. The CGI. we are in 2016 and they can't get iron man with RDJs head to look right? It looked like a poor photoshop job and it took me out every time he  took off the helmet. It looked better in the iron man movies 8 years ago. But the big problem and a lot of people have already stated this in their reviews but the villain was unnecessary to this film. Zemo was a waste and I'm a defender of the marvel villains. Now Daniel Bruhl was great with the role he had but Zemo(who was only Zemo in name only) should not have been here. Now sort of minor spoilers I guess but he is the cause for the civil war and what he does to cause it is great but they keep cutting back to him and it feels his story and the main civil war are two separate story's until the end. There is a twist in this film which SPOILERS is connected to the opening sequence, I won't say what it is but unlike my whole family I knew what the reveal was and waited for confirmation the whole Time. I got half of it right. 

The performances were great all around the board, from Evans to RDJ, who's was especially heartbreaking with what he went through in this movie. Chadwick Boseman was perfect as black panther and I already stated Tom Holland is the perfect Spiderman. Nice little cameo by Stan lee. The score by Henry Jackman, who by the way is my favorite composer working today, made an outstanding score. There is one scene where captain America and Sharon (SPOILERS) Carter meet up and Bucky and Sam are in the car and their back and forth was just too funny. 

This movie isn't as good as the first avengers or the winter soldier not even as good as the first iron man and maybe that's what disappointed me. I've shared all the love I had with this movie but it was disappointing that it wasn't the best or even second best MCU film. It's 4th in my opinion. I'm gonna give CAPTAIN AMERICA (because it is his move) Civil War a 9/10. It's a great movie and I want to make that clear. It's a great movie and a great comic book movie but it's not the best and that's where my disappointment lies. 

Rating: 9/10"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Most people disagree with me on this movie, but mainly with me, disappointment. It could've been way more epic, and it's kind of a non-serious thing, and if it's so ""serious"" to fight over it, then why would they laugh and be jokey and happy during battle. MCU knows they will make a ton of money so they don't care if it's legendary. However, like every MCU movie, it's enjoyable. It's funny. It's high-budget. It's well scripted. Well Made, but it lacked what it needed, intensity. And we have to look at what they got the story from, The comic mini-series ""Civil War (2007)"" I'm okay when a movie changes it from the book when they make it better, but they didn't at all. it was epic, it was way more serious, both sides felt more pastionate about their side, this wasn't as great as everyone says, but it was 7/10. but get your on opinion(if you haven't already) and you decide."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Almost five stars from me.  One of Marvel's best movies.  And it's not just Captain America, but the whole gangs here.  Even Ant Man and Spiderman show up.  It's a great 2 1/2 hour escape."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It does everything it needs to do to move the MCU story along. Lots of callbacks, lots of foreshadowing, lots of character development, lots of action, lots of pathos, and lots of humor."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Man, there was a lot in this movie. How is it that Marvel can create a film featuring over a dozen super heroes fighting each other and it's well calculated, well paced, and even punches you right in the emotions, meanwhile DC holds three of the most iconic superheroes hostage in a film critics completely slammed? Just when you think this film doesn't live up to it's ""Civil War,"" gimmick, by the time the credits roll you tip your cap (no pun intended). Another solid Marvel film. Being partial to the Cap, I'll say it still isn't as great as his first film. And favoriting DC Comic characters over Marvel, this movie kills me. We get it, Marvel, you make good movies using otherwise forgotten characters. Quit showing off."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Civil War was pretty bad, and not only because of all the plot holes and lack of character growth.
The pacing was so bad - I almost fell asleep 3 times and that's never happened in theaters before. It seemed like the only way the plot could be moved along was ACTION SEQUENCES between very very slow dialogue-heavy sequences. Overall, this made the first half of the movie very jarring as it was dragged along from action sequence to action sequence.
The only character with significant character development was T'Challa - Tony was particularly bad, especially his unashamed manipulation of Peter Parker and hypocritical actions in the final scene (I kept rolling my eyes so hard).
One of Steve's famous dialogues was taken from him and given to Peggy, which was okay except it'll probably be wrongly attributed to Sharon now....they couldn't establish her character any other way?
The plot holes absolutely disgust me, Marvel must think their audiences are idiots - especially with those stupid location overlays as if no one can identify famous landmarks or follow dialogue. Let me tell you as someone who has entered government facilities - THEY CHECK ID. Also a dangerous ""criminal"" would never be left alone with a civilian without armed guard, that's ridiculous. And there were more beyond this I'm not even going into detail on...
Also everything literally ended up as Steve said it would (not being able to respond to something they should, being called in for a job they don't want to) and Tony even ended up on his side in the final scene, so in the end it seemed like the whole movie was pretty much pointless."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Movie was full of all the things I love from Marvel. Not super keen on the new Spider-Man though.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I was suffering from superhero fatigue, but I've got to give it to the Russo brothers: this movie is well executed fun. And god damn wasn't Spider-Man cool."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Well thought out, a tribute to both fans of the comics and the cinematics. It's deep, jaw dropping, action packed, and fun. A must see!"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This movie does an amazing job of juggling its components, introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man, giving each of the Avengers moments in the spotlight, and still giving focus to the main story. It starts with an action opening, and has several other big action set-pieces, including what is easily the best super-powered slugfest in film history. It'a a movie I will absolutely need to see in theaters a second time. I can't say for certain if it's better than Winter Soldier, but both are so good it's really irrelevant. Not 'perfect', but immensely entertaining."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Not sure what everyone is rating this movie so highly for. I endured this movie last night and found it tedious. Of course it is visually stunning and has great fight scenes .. and then another fight scene ... and then of course there are the fight scenes .. but the plot is weak and many of the links to other characters are tenuous 

A very average film to say the least"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Action! Spectacular!
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Stunning visuals, incredible dialogue and a story that keeps you engaged from start to finish. You feel for the characters and it actually pulls you between the two sides and makes the issue at the heart of the movie a blurred line between right and wrong."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Loved it!  Was very good.  I really liked Black Panther and Spiderman.  Both were very well portrayed and really tough.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Civil War was incredibly entertaining at ever corner. Funny, clever, and filled with culture references that you have to pay attention to catch. It may have been a little long in the end, but it needed extra time to fill in missing plot holes. The new Spider-Man was young and funny, Black Panther is a great addition, and Ant-Man is just constantly entertaining. Definitely my favorite Marvel thus far, but can't wait till Guardians get integrated with this team."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,It does a fantastic job of building relationships and tension between a giant cast with several new characters too. Everyone gets adequate screen time and nothing feels rushed. It's super long but never boring so it doesn't feel long. And unlike BvS they have a legitimate reason to be fighting. 11/10 go see it right meow.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Una masa! Como la primera vez que se juntaron los Avengers esta entrega otra vez esa película que siempre quisiste ver y mas. BvS se supone que trata sobre las consecuencias que tiene el actuar de los superheroes pero minga! esta película muestra las consecuencias que tienen.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,greatest comic movie ever!
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,This flick is AMAZING!!!! Marvel Studios has knocked it out of the park again!!
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,one of the best marvel movies yet
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It started a little slow, but once the main conflict is presented to both Tony Stark and Steve Rogers we start to see both sides of the problem in a very smart, witty and engaging way. Quite possibly the best Marvel movie to date. Great character depth, internal conflicts and Blank Panther and Spider-Man fit right in to the ever expanding universe. Paul Rudd and Tom Holland are my comedic standouts (with close runner ups Anthony Mackie and Jeremy Renner right behind them). Not to mention another great villain that is at the main focal point of the story (no spoilers). Overall, whether you come in standing with Team Cap or Team Iron Man you will walk out with a clear idea of who is doing the right thing and who must learn from their mistakes. Action aside, its the quick paced dialogue and politics between the superheroes turned foes that keep you on the edge of your seat."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This movie will make a billion and a 1/2 because it's Marvel, but I won't watch another Avengers movie as long as I live. I'm so angry for falling for the hype train!"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"WOW. Exceeded all my expectations! Best Marvel movie to date! LOVED everything about it! The incredible storytelling with all the twists and turns, the characters, the actionâ?¦ So good!!!"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Highly impressed in how they handled Black Panther. Costume, the actor, his skills, everything. Of course, Spider-Man is my favorite part of the movie. They introduced him perfectly. They used him perfectly. The CG, the humor, everything about the character was done perfectly. I was very skeptical of Tom Holland, having never seen him in anything and hating the idea of a teen Spidey but he did a good job in and out of the costume. Really looking forward to the solo movie. I was also glad to see that Scarlett Johannson grew her hair out again for Widow. She killed it, as usual. Ant Man was used well enough but the way he picked sides felt a little contrived. Scarlet Witch was handled well too. Same with Vision. The rest of the crew were about as good as you'd expect having seen them in several others already so not much to say there. 

Not a perfect movie but very solid."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Man, some of the very best comic battles Ive ever seen. I thought this would be the ""end all"" of Marvel films. Its not-but thats not a negative reflection. Sprinkled with solid humor throughout. Spider man is amazing! Pun intended. Spidey n Antman stole the show. Why is Hawkeye there? Mostly meaning J. Renner. Def go to the theatre."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War is the third and final film of the Captain America trilogy starring most of the Avengers from the previous MCU films, except Thor and Hulk. Originally, the film was supposed to come out around the same time as Batman v Superman in March, but Marvel delay the film to a May released date in order to avoid competition with DC since it follows a similar plot about two superheroes fighting against each other. Now that Civil War is released in theaters, Is it the Marvel movie that we all been waiting for or does it have its similar flaws with Batman v Superman? 
After going to an early screening of the film last night, I have to admit not only is this the best Captain America film, but this is the best Marvel movie I have seen since Guardians of the Galaxy. Captain America: Civil War is the Avengers movie that I have always wanted to see since this is based on the Civil War comics that came out in 2006. The story is set after Age of Ultron where Captain America is leading his newly establish Avengers team fighting against Crossbones for stealing biological weapons. An accident occurs during the fight causing the United Nation to call the Avengers to sign the Sokovia Accords, which will establish a governing body to take control of the Avengers. This cause the team to divide as Tony agrees to be put under check, while Cap disagrees, believing that it will take away their privilege to go somewhere that the government would not allow them to go. While thats going on, Bucky Barns aka the Winter Solider is framed for killing King T`Chaka of Wakanda, causing T`Challa aka Black Panther to seek revenge against Bucky. Now its up to Cap to find the man who framed Bucky while fighting against the team he was once apart of. The story in Civil War is well written that you start to understand the reasons why each of these character are doing on what they think is right instead of the whole Justice cliche. The film manage to be both an Avengers film and a Captain America film at the same time and it actually works. The film knows when it needs to be funny and when it needs to be serious. Marvel has been doing a great job on balancing those types of moments that the film needs to be. Each character in Civil War is given a perfect amount of screening time, including your friendly neighborhood Spiderman, who is the highlight of Civil War.Tom Holland did a great job portraying the web slinger without giving an origin story that we all heard before from the previous Spiderman films, but this is the best Spiderman we have gotten since the Sam Rami trilogy. Black Panther was also cool to see in this movie and was given the amount of character that he as supposed to be given since he`s gonna have his own solo movie in 2017. The introduction to Paul Rudds portrayal of Ant Man was hilarious and fun to watch. Besides Spiderman for being the highlight of Civil War, the fight scene at the airport is amazing. Forget about the big fight scenes from the previous two Avengers movie, this was awesome to watch. Every superhero manage to have an awesome fight with one another. If I had to nitpick one thing with Captain America: Civil War is that this is a long movie. Probably the longest in the MCU.                   This doesn`t mean its a big flaw, but their are probably one or two scenes where the film could fell a little slow. Overall, Captain America: Civil War is Marvels best, besides Deapool but thats owned by Fox. I highly recommend viewing this film as a standalone movie, but its best to watch the other MCU if you want to know more about these characters. Besides Deadpool, this is one of my favorite films of 2016 so far, which is why I`m giving it a 9.4/10."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Great movie! My favorite super flick so far! Finally get to see super teams fighting. Now if marvel would only give me a superhero team fighting a Villain team!
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Civil War is emotionally brutal and exhausting. I left the theater feeling worn out, and definitely need some time to recuperate before seeing it again (and writing a review). Much like The Winter Soldier, the strength of this movie is in its personal relationship. My favorite part of TWS was the friendship component of the movie, particularly the bond and trust developed quickly, yet believably between Steve Rogers and Sam Wilson. CW takes every friendship and team dynamic felt, and strains them all to the limit. Some of it is subtle and understated, some of it is right in your face and obvious. With so much going on, the characters have real depth and dimension to them.

The action sequences are flat out awesome. Critics have praised the airport scene as possibly the best, comic book action put on film, and they aren't wrong. It's worth the price of admission on its own. The fighting in the third act is just punishing. The choreography is as good as you would expect, but large parts of me just wanted them to stop because of how invested I'd become in the characters. The punches feel real, and carry consequence. 

While Captain America is the much more sympathetic of the two de facto leaders of the conflict, the motivations of both are believable and with merit. There's logic to both sides, and while Cap's appears to be more emotionally rooted than Starks, you could argue it's really the other way around. This might be RDJ's best performance as Iron Man. The ego and quick wit are still there, but you see a man wound really tight, as guilt and other unresolved issues are pushing him near a breaking point. 

T'Challa is a complete badass. Chadwick Boseman really was the perfect choice for the role, he manages to be both kingly and fierce at the same time. I'm looking forward to his solo outing much more after seeing Civil War. Spider-Man is the best version of Spider-Man we've seen, and it's great he's finally part of the MCU.

I liked Zemo as the villain quite a bit. His part was a slow burn, and very subtle. One of the MCU's problems has been lack of memorable villains, and Zemo will get criticism for this as well. It's possible his arc may play to the long game much more than we realize, and this could be the foundation for something much bigger.

The massive amount of characters was handled deftly by the Russos, with each of them getting the chance to develop and weigh in on the picture as a whole. Some of it was front and center, and some was very subtle, planting seeds you want to see grow in future movies. In particular, both Vision and Scarlet Witch hold a ton of potential for continued development.

It's going to be interesting to see the fallout of this movie down the line. I'm most curious about how Ant-Man and the Wasp is handled with how this movie went. 

A couple of minor complaints. Spider-Man's inclusion was a bit forced, and it was obvious he was a late addition to the script. The ""shaky-cam"" was overdone in one of the sequences, but part of that was due to seeing it in IMAX. It will look a lot better on a smaller screen. I wish Sharon Carter had a little bigger role, but I suspect there's more to her story coming down the road. 

On a scale of 1 to 10, I'm struggling to give it a rating. Nine seems ridiculously high, but eight doesn't seem to do the movie justice. Let's go 8.75 (it's my scale, after all) and say this is right up there with Iron Man as one of the best ever. On the downside, 2018's Infinity War is way too far away now. After what the Russos did here, and how epic the close of Phase 3 is supposed to be, the bar is set really high."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,One of the best marvel films to date.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Avengers Ultron (2015) era tan estúpida e infantil que esta Civil War fácilmente podría haberse llamado ""Capitán América: La disculpa por Ultron"". Y funciona. Si Ultron era mala hace un año, hoy se ve peor gracias a Civil war. Para mi, CW dejó a Ultron como una película derechamente pa cabros chicos y pa vender juguetes. Dentro de lo ""cabro chico"" que es todo lo de Marvel, CW ha quedado como para ""adulto"". Tiene toda la humanidad que no tiene Ultron. Esas son pelis que esperamos los cabros chicos repentinamente transformados en adultos como yo, jajaja :P

Winter soldier (2014) ya trataba muy bien los temas como hasta donde puede llegar el control de la población por parte de las autoridades. Esta vez vuelve a estar presente el tema del control, pero aplicado a Avengers. Eso le pido a una película de héroes, que te haga pensar un poco, que plantee más o menos apegado a la realidad actual como sería un mundo con superhéroes, etc. No que te regale escenas de acción interminables llenas de efectos CGI. Que se justifique la acción y que esté bien distribuida.

Es brígido que se enfrenten Iron man vs Capitán América. Eso no pasaría de un día pa otro. Eso tiene que estar bien explicado. Y si, lo está, está bien desarrollado. Además, hace 2 películas que se veía la tensión entre ellos (gran punto pal universo cinemático de Marvel). La película tiene buenos peaks emocionales. No es para nada una película de acción sin sentido. Lo que pasa pasa pq se rebalsó el vaso.

Hay cosas que están implícitas, y funciona pq están dentro del rico U.C. Marvel. Me refiero puntualmente a en que se basan las decisiones de Stark y Romanoff. Bueno, vean el pasado de Tony Stark y Natasha Romanoff previo a ser héroes. Eso determina mucho sus acciones de hoy.

Excelentes secuencias de pelea. Harto contacto y poco rayo láser, similares a las de Winter soldier. Muy bueno para mi parecer. Un acierto total que hayan decidido dejar a la dupla de dirección de Winter soldier (lo que explica pq se repite el buen estilo de acción de esa peli). Le da un poco de mirada de autor a una franquicia donde el director es mas bien un títere.

Como guinda de la torta, creo que el directorcillo de Batman vs Superman (ese pobre hombre Zack Snyder) podría tomar clases con los directores de Winter Soldier/Civil War

En una frase, creo que es una de las mejores películas que ha sacado Marvel. A la altura de Iron man (2008), Winter soldier, y Avengers (2012). Y hasta me atrevería a decir que postula a ser la mejor del U.C. Marvel"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"For the non-comic book fan who is starting to get tired of the Avengers franchise and all its spin-offs, this movie single-(bionic) handedly drags you back in. Gripping from beginning to end, great action, more subtle humour than usual, and thoroughly entertaining!"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Pert near a perfect Marvel/Avengers adventure
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"From the start of a hydra symbol to the mission in Lagos against Crossbones, this movie fills in the spaces where its counterpart (Batman, superman, DC and all its characters) FAIL!!!! Itching is perfect but this is as close to perfect as it gets. James Bond films are the only other films that pays attention to story and action the way marvel does. Black Widow is as great of a fighter as Capt or Ironman. Black Panther is just as powerful and great of a fighter. SPOILER ALERT!!! - Spiderman is still the most quick and acrobatic of them all though!!
Let's start here: the creation start of storylines with Black Panther and Spidey are perfect and with the introduction of both characters they were beyond perfect where DC clutters the story and kills character origin or needing to see them on the big screen. ( They need to stick with tv so they have a long enough time to tell their story) 
Marvel can explain a character in only 10-15 min where DC is that long drawn out lecture we hate. The grievance in this story makes sense where we know Superman vs Batman didn't! Not giving away this movie in words I choose to state that these characters are believed in their suits. Even the X-Men try to compete with the avengers but come up short. This story comes down to the pain that the avengers can inflict on the innocent when not trying to and accidentally happening due to cause and effect. Is ion sums up the story here in his definition of what's at hand and the truth!!  NOT ONLY SEE THIS MOVIE BUT SEE IT AT LEAST TWICE!!! Spidey and SPOILER ALERT!!! Ant Man steal the show here and show why these characters are believable as real people.
Until Next Time- Only the bad shall fear my name!!"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I Max showing! Paid for my man and my younger sister! A pretty penny and one that wasn't well spent. I am so upset. It was a snooze fest for all of us. My sister kept blaming the fanboys, but I blame the critics! Do yourself a favor and safe your money. A stinker!"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This is the Avengers sequel we should have gotten. There are a lot of comparisons to be made with Batman v Superman because there are a lot of similarities. Right down to a complaint I had about about BvS. Where these guys taking notes from each other. When you see it you're going to be like, ""Lex and Zemo know each other."" I enjoyed this movie a lot more though. The events of this movie were earned. Is it a perfect movie? No. Even The Dark Knight, which I consider to be one of the greatest movies ever, has flaws. Everything that has happened since Iron Man in 2008 is paid off here. If you've followed these movies, you see the progression of Steve Rogers and Iron Man. They end up at different places than from where they began at the start of their stories. People say that when you watch it, you will see that it is a Captain America movie. I have to disagree. This is an Avengers movie. Cap and Iron Man and the main characters. Not a single thing is wrong with that though."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"To put it simply, this movie was on point.The Russo brothers know what they are doing and how to make a solid movie. This takes the greatness that was Capt. 2: Winter Soldier and elevates it to an entire other level. I literally can't think of any real complaints about it, which is unheard of for me with a comic movie, there are always things I wish were at least slightly different. This movie nailed the Civil War concept and kept us surprised at what exactly would happen in the coming scenes. It also did a fantastic job at hitting and revealing the personalities of every character, which is quite impressive when dealing with a dozen or more main characters. This is a movie that will be easy to watch again and again."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Maybe if I had gone in with lower expectations, but I read where a critic said Oscar nominations. It's laughable! There are at least eight movies I've seen this year that are far better. I've got to stop reading fanboy stuff. It's losing me money! Go see another movie, or don't go at all..."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Awesome movie, well done."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Disney Super hero check list please... Mind control - check. Team bickering - Check. Team fights - check. Wasted Major villains - check. 

Spiderman was fantastic character & I do look forward to seeing him more, BUT he was wasted in this movie. Relegated to Ironman's Robin... Spiderman is NOBODY'S Robin!!! He was such a major player in Civil War books but here,  You could have switched him out with ANYONE else in the MCU and it would have made no difference what so ever... that really sucked...

The whole premise for the civil war (which really was useless seeing how the Avengers were originally a government team when NY happened but that is never mentioned) gets lost & replaced with a revenge story out of left field (because MIND CONTROL... again) AND none of it is wrapped up. 

On to Apocalypse & hopefully a good movie. This one is forgettable."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Marvel delivers again with this incredible summer blockbuster.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Went with my boyfriend to see the Avengers movie last night, because it was his time to choose. He said he heard it was one of the best movies of the year.  High expectations for both of us. Too high!!!! A yawner, but on the positive side the food at Nanita's was excellent! Tex-Mex food is fantastic!"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I don't write much reviews but I had to take the time to write this one. Civil War was not better or as good as Winter Soldier. The story was NOT that good, only the visual effects and the choreography scenes. The expectation was to high due to trailers and word of mouth that was ""good"".  Thank you ""movie critics"", ""fanboys"" and marketing production for ruining what could had been the movie of the year."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Better than the Avengers movies. Prolly the best from the Avengers cast side of movies.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Awesome! Enough said.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Where to begin! Definitely one of the best, if not the best, superhero movies yet! Usually too many characters is a weakness for the superhero genre, but this one managed to somehow give every superhero their own story within the larger story. The casting is impeccable, including newcomers Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther and Tom Holland as Spider-Man (who immediately became my favorite Spider-Man in just a few minutes). And the fight scenes!!!!! Great action scenes I have ever seen in a movie! The battle between the two sides is absolutely perfect and full of fun surprises! Can't wait to see it again!"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,i found it very entertaining...lots of actions and spiderman!!! hahaha
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"So now we come to Marvel's turn to pit to big heroes against each other, while I still liked Batman v Superman, this is definitely the better movie, it has way fewer plot problems like BvS also they dealt with the superhero accountability issue in a more realistic way, Iron Man never wanted to go to war with Cap, he tries to reason, they at least had conversations before fighting unlike batman and superman. While I can see where Iron Man was coming from, I had to be on Caps side, if the avengers did nothing in all the attacks that are mentioned, thousands would have died, and when there's a bomb that's gonna explode in a crowded square in 10 seconds, there's no way people aren't going to die, and that shouldn't be the avengers' fault. 
Anyways, the new Spider Man was good, everyone is raving that he's like the second coming of Christ, i wasnt BLOWN AWAY like that but he did a good job, Ant Man had some solid laughs, Vision and Scarlet Witch have a bond that I didn't see coming but I found effective. Lotta people are shitting on Zemo, while I admit his character is the least interesting, he wasn't unnecessary or pointless, he served a role, and actually his plan made sense, or at least more than past villains. You wanna talk pointless though-Martin Freeman is on screen for like a minute, and doesnt really contribute anything, despite being such a big star
Look for the stair car from arrested development in the airport fight scene, i thought that was cool
Overall another solid entry in the marvel cannon, it was cool to see even more new characters get introduced and interact with each other"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"the best marvel movie till date... what a film!! MARVEL AGAIN SHOWED ITS CHARM.. it was no where close to its comic story ""civil war"" but writers did a fantastic job to make it perfect. one of the most perfect superhero movie ever made. all the charecters were more upto their potential. they are just speechless. new addition of black panther and spider man were the best decision from disney. i think this changes the whole marvel movie concept of the phase three. great combination of story, awesome climax, more complexity in stories and more comedy from its predecessor. just speechless... hats off to russo brothers.. they have done it again............"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,its better than the trailers that you have seen already.... its worth it
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I saw it last night and the movie did not disappoint. In this day and age, many movies deliver fan service to the super fans of their IP but few tell a satisfying story with character arcs and satisfying narrative twists and turns. I found the portrayal of each character to be both satisfying and substantial. I particularly loved the way Spider-Man, Black Panther, Ant-Man, and Captain America were used."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"What a movie! Marvel have some great characters here, and build them into the story perfectly. This new style of bringing every major character into one film is really working. I'm also excited to see the development of the new Spider-Man because I didn't even bother seeing the Andrew Garfield versions."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"See Zack Snyder, this is how you do a Superhero movie.  WOW, what a ride this was.  The Avengers are literally split down the middle in this, which is kinda funny when you think about it because this is not an Avengers movie, it's a Captain America movie...ah, whatever they're all the same movie, but nonetheless this was amazing.  All the actors are in top form here and just look like they are having a lot of fun.  Chris Evans is still very strong as Steve Rogers/Captain America and Robert Downey Jr has got to be sick of playing Tony Stark/Iron Man by now but he is still great at it (even if he's more miserable than usual here), Scarlett Johansson is always great, and great to look at to, and all the supporting characters are good as well.  The new Spiderman makes his 1st appearance here to, and although he is awesome, I do have to wonder about the actor playing him, Tom Holland, he seems a little young but we'll see when his movie comes out if he can carry it for 2 hours.  The 1 downfall in this was that the villain was kind of weak, he didn't have any special powers or anything, his whole agenda was to destroy the Avengers by making them destroy each other, kinda of lackluster motive as well, but whatever, every movie has to have some kind of flaw.  I really don't know how many more of these there will be (group of movies I mean, not just Captain America) because there are a lot of characters and I just don't know if they are just going to be all together like this, or if they will each get their own movies.  I still say Scarlett Johansson's character still needs her own movie but I don't know if that will happen.  Still definitely worth multiple viewings.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for the plethera of action scenes and for Paul Rudd for the few scenes he's in."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It had some great fight scenes, but it wasn't as funny as the other big Marvel films. It also lacked the character development of the origin films (Iron Man, Captain America, etc)."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Great movie but ultimately forgettable, need to see it again for I decide just how much I really like it."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Civil War was perfect. Absolutely everything it needed to be. So happy with what the Russo brothers were able to accomplish.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,My favorite MCU movie by far. Awesome story and action. Marvel does a great job of introducing the new characters while further developing the older ones. Can't wait to see it again.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,There's enough great acting and action jollies in this movie for three lifetimes!  A lot of surprises and just enough complicated plotlines to make those surprises stick.  Long live the Avengers.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Sooo freaking good!!!!
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The ending wasn't where I expected it to go, and it'll be interesting to see how they solve some of the unresolved problems in future movies, but as a standalone it is one of Marvel's best."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This movie is all about fan service, but to me that is a huge problem. Is fan service and nothing more. Spiderman, antman and others were ridiculously shoehorned for the airport fight, (by the way a fight with no tension, thanks to the continuous jokes) the script was all over the place, a complete mess, and like you said poor cgi and horrible shaky camera.
But to me the biggest problem is that like the majority of the marvel movies, in the end nothing really happens, there is no stake, no one dies, there is no consequences, and because of that there is NO TENSION. You can watch a marvel film knowing that everything will remain the same, every movie is just a set up for the next one."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Great movie! Loads of fun and very entertaining. I will see this a few times.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"One of the more mature Marvel films that successfully juggles multiple tones and characters. A great forward for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Well done, Russo Bros, McFeely & Markus."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,EPIC!! I'll be seeing this many times
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Phenomenal. Everyone brings their A-Game.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This is by far the best Marvel movie to date and I may even say that it is the best superhero movie to date. RBJ did an amazing acting job and definitely made me feel for that character and the reasons behind his actions. 

Spider-man, Ant-man and Black Panther stole the movie as well. Lastly I want to say that the Airport battle scene was so entertaining and I can honestly say that all superhero franchises including Marvel itself will have a hard time beating it. 
Thank you to the Russo Brothers and the writers of this movie, You did an amazing job. 

At least on my list, it has knocked down Guardians of the Galaxy and Winter Soldier down a peg to make Captain America: Civil War, my favorite MCU movie."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,This is probably the best marvel movie made. The storytelling and action scenes are top notched
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"el plan de zemo es muy tonto todo le salio de suerte !!! ya que si black widow no hubiera dejado escapar a capitan america y a winter soldier jamas hubieran llegado a la bobeda donde estaba zemo y jamas hubiera llegado iron man a ver el video donde matan a sus padres!!! no es muy inteligente el plan !! y el hombre araña es sacado de la manga solo para fans!! no es jusificado, junto con el regreso de hawkeye y creo que pym jamas hubiera prestado el traje a scot para hacer algo de ese tipo!!! apesar de eso es muy buena bastante accion y muy bien desarrollado cada personaje !!! sientes la ira de cada uno y su justificacion!! russo lover!!! :)"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Iron Man 4: The Winter Soldier 2 is a fast paced comic book movie that continues the trend of upping the ante for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. There are the fight scenes that are punctuated with quippy moments of levity. There's the obligatory underlying theme of the role of power on the global stage and how that intersects with the characters' relationships and responsibilities. Black Panther is cool. War Machine is still unnecessary. Spiderman gets a dignified and organic extroduction from Fox's production company (who continually underwhelm with the character). The film is self-aware enough to both pander and surprise the audience whether they be hardcore fans or disinterested film-goers. The action set pieces are a lot of fun, but if you are expecting anything more than a comic book movie, I guess you get out what you put in to it. If you are looking for a nuanced critique of the role of American interventionism in policing and protecting the world, sorry - this is just more military/industrial masturbation."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The Russo Brothers are indeed the Kings of Comic Book films. They scored huge with Winter Soldier and with Civil War they Hit a Grand Slam. The script was phenomenal by capturing scenes from the comics but also putting in their own original ideas and making them work within the MCU Storyline. The Best MCU Cast since the Avengers, every actor fit their roles perfectly not just on paper but in live action. Huge high praises for Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther and Tom Holland as Spider-Man. But what really made this film was the emotional scenes (some over the top but still worked) and the action scenes especially the Airport Scene, Super Epic. If I have to give one criticism about this film it would have to be Baron Zemo's screen time. Although Daniel Bruel did a good job as Zemo and his motivation is better than most MCU villains, but he was only in the film for a very short time. Overall Captain America: Civil War was Spectacular and Epic from beginning to end. I defintely rank this film a 9.5/10 Stars and it is indeed my new favorite MCU Film, maybe even my favorite comic book film period"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,if you like marvel this one is good
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Civil war was everything a blockbuster super-hero movie should be.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Amazing movie. Great cast. Good tempo and great jokes at the right time. Like how all the Heroes were used just enough.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Absolutely loved it, Marvel delivers another great time at the movies this time adding new depth to each of it's characters and giving us their best story yet!"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Marvel Studios continues to amaze the comic book fans from old to the new and so far Disney is letting them do their ""thing"". Without giving away too much this movie was fun and yet had the tone of Winter Soldier which of course the directing duo did. It's not a perfect movie by all means but I cannot wait for others to follow. Strong 4 Stars out of 5."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I hate to admit it, but this was actually pretty good. The action insn't overlong or overwhelming; the comedic timing is impeccable; and the use of CGI is timely and appropriate. Civil War is by far the most mature and well-crafted Marvel movie of the cannon. And it never hurts to bring on board the directors of many eps of Arrested Development and Community."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Spectacular! Worth the ticket price.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I didn't expect to love this movie more than Winter Soldier, but the Russo brothers delivered on a new level with the most emotional movie in the MCU. The huge cast didn't make the movie feel bloated like one would expect, and the new characters were added in so naturally and flawlessly. The final 30 minutes of this movie had me on the edge of my seat. The villain actually wasn't awful either. I can't find a flaw in this movie (and believe me, I tried)."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I saw Civil War last night. I like action movies. I'm not a superhero fan per se, so I'm not a comic book nerd. As a matter of fact, I've never bought a comic book in my life. All I can say is, ""wow,"" and I say that in a negative way!  This is an average movie. I saw the first two Avengers movies and thought the first was okay and the second one terrible, and I thought I was done with the Avengers, but all the hype sold me! What a mistake! Enough! I'm so upset at all the comic book nerds that will accept mediocrity - and there's many in the media - that they go on a euphoric blitz and sale garbage! No more! I'm done! A couple of my friends that are comic nerds thought it was good, but the rest, who aren't comic fans, were disappointed. Do not waste your money. This is more of the same. A big bore. CGI is horrible. I've seen better fight scenes in other none superhero movies. The wisecracks suck and seem out of place. Who cares about Spider-Man. I've seen enough of him to last me a lifetime, and his wisecracks were embarrassing. There is nothing special about this flick. I understand fanboys liking this very, very average movie, but please give yourself some distance. Sit for awhile with all your praise and then see if your delirious opinions are still valid. I love action flicks, but they have to be good. Civil War gets two thumbs way down. Now If I could only get my and my friends money back. That would be great!"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"totally inexplicably and insanely awesome.  several ""whoah did they really do that?"" moments from the comics.  def seeing again. blows BvS out the water."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This movie is fantastic! I went into it with high expectations being a huge Captain America fan and was not disappointed. I would consider this my favorite superhero movie to date even in the over saturated genre that is super hero movies. My only critique is the bad CG for Cross Bones face in the beginning but other than that the film is full of amazing special effects. Action, Comedy to break the tension, and great story, what's not to love. If you were disappointed with last superhero mash up films, this one will not disappoint. I definitely recommend this to comic book fans and movie viewers alike."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Corrects the wrongs of Age of Ultron and expands the MCU in a way that makes you truly excited for the next 100 years of Marvel movies.  Plus we get the best cinematic representation of Spider-man.  Ever.  Also, Chadwick Boseman was born to play the Black Panther.  I can't wait for his solo flick!"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"So Much Fun watching this film. I believed in the conflict and the drama.
Airport scene is truly, The Best Action Fight Scene of All Time.
Best Marvel Film Made, Surpasses all of Marvel's work.
Spider Man & Ant Man are only in for Two Scenes, But They Are One of The Best Parts of the film.
Black Panther is Amazing
The Conflict Between Iron Man & Captain America is Smart, Believable and Understandable.
Great Film!
10/10"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Stunning set pieces sand brilliant storytelling
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Here are my thoughts on the movie
http://geekboyking.blogspot.com/2016/05/captain-america-civil-war-what-they-got.html"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This is probably one of my favorite Marvel movies! The action was top notch, the characters are all given their time to shine, the humor isn't forced, the plot is well paced and makes sense, and wow... Spidey and Ant-man steal the show! Black Panther, definitely need more of him, his portrayal was spot on."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,best marvel movie ever..... hands down from the cast to the graphics well done way better than batman vs superman
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War, while entertaining for the most part, is respectively a mixed bag. First off, it was great to see all these characters again interacting on a spectacular scale. Civil War features some great character moments across the board that range from dramatic to funny. The action here is absolutely the best part of the movie. Every character has their moment and the big airport scene is something to marvel. Sadly, the overall plot doesn't support the film as well as should and surprisingly we get another throw away villain. Overall, it's worth a watch, but it was honestly somewhat boring."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Not a perfect film but pretty damn close. Might just be the best marvel movie. Loved it
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Excellent! Must see!
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This movie is certainly an impressive feat. You could acknowledge what Joss Whedon achieved with the first Avengers film( A film that admittedly remains my favourite MCU piece to date.) but then he had four extremely well known central characters to put together as a team on film, it sounds like a winner before you even walk into the theatre right? The opposite rung true when I was reading up on what Captain America: Civil War's plot would be. They would have to build a believable and engaging conflict between two of the lead Avengers whilst successfully popularizing a group of secondary characters to the general audience to successfully introduce Phase four as it were, seemed a difficult task for 'Captain America: WInter Soldier' directing duo the Russo brothers and that's forgetting the task of restoring the reputation of the most popular Marvel Hero of them all, Spider-man.

They pretty much nailed it. I had no clue what Black Panther is, I do now and I like what I'm seeing. Ant-man, well just wait and see. Spider-Man, bring on his standalone ASAP, he was perfect. The film has some of the greatest superhero action set-pieces I have seen on screen, possibly the greatest in the scene that follows that much built- up airport standoff.

The core confrontation is believable and is built around the premise of keeping the Avengers in check as death and destruction inevitably will follow their exploits, as necessary as they may well be. Tony Stark is presented with a great reason to feel the need to sign the accord that will see the Avengers placed under the direct control of the US government, whilst Captain America also has real reason to reject the notion, I never really found myself picking a side which I suppose is a good  thing. There's some solid philosophical debate in this film.

The film is overly long, there's no two ways about it. Some scenes do linger more than I'd like, usually involving Baron Zemo, they are probably necessary as the film reaches it's climax but I feel the put the blockers on some early momentum, but not too badly. Also Martin Freeman, why? His role is pointless and slightly irking as everyone knows he's English by now, just get an American to fill this role should it even exist in the first place, though I'm sure avid Marvelites will tell me otherwise. In a film as crowded as this it's possible some won't like every hero involved and in my case that is true for Falcon, War Machine and Vision although they have their moments. Which I think shows the expert job executed by the Russo brothers. They seem to be the right people for the Infinity Wars films."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Overall, a good movie.  Really fun to watch.  The action scenes are pretty incredible.  The interactions between characters feel like they'd be genuine and are at time quite moving.  

My complaint is the motivations in this movie felt pretty contrived.  From the legislation, to the reasons each hero chooses a side, to the actual reasoning for these two sides to come to blows...  Each one of them feels forced into the movie just to get the brawl at the airport(which I admit was incredible, worth the price of admission by itself).  It just feels incredibly hollow, particularly the ending which feels incredibly coincidental...  

In the end, I'd 100% recommend it as a movie and absolutely worth watching in the theater, but it isn't a perfect movie in my opinion."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Nutshell: If you're an MCU fan, you know you're gonna see this, but wanna know if it's actually any good. IT'S BETTER. If you're not an MCU fan and wanna know if you should see it? There's plenty of amazing battle scenes, as well as scenes that will have you feeling all the feelings, because the actions in this gutsy storyline have very real consequences.  So yeah, Civil War can satisfy fans and non-fans. What are you waiting for? Grade: A

I've been salivating over the idea of a Civil War storyline in the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe, for folks who are still having trouble with all the acronyms) ever since they announced it back in 2014.  The idea that Marvel would make a film about the consequences of epic superhero throwdowns, and how dealing with those consequences shatter the Avengers, made me bounce in my seat.  Because let's face it; as much as I love superhero movies, after a while it's the same old Bad vs. Good punchfest we've seen a million times or more.  Adding themes of responsibility, the price of freedom, and what it means to be a hero?  Could reboot the entire franchise, and Civil War does just that. And it might just be the best thing Marvel has dropped into our lap so far.

Warning: SPOILERS AHEAD.  At least for the next paragraph.  Don't say I didn't warn ya.

Synopsis: After the events in Sokovia, the Avengers are still going out and fighting the good fight.  But during a mission to stop a bad guy (Crossbones/Brock Rumlow), Scarlet Witch becomes ""distracted"", causing the deaths of Wakandan aid workers.  The UN decides to ratify the ""Sokovia Accords"" (the ""Superhero Registration Act"" in the original Civil War comic book arc), with Tony Stark/Iron Man supporting the idea, and Steve Rodgers/Captain America deciding that having others telling them what to do could mean that superheroes could be prevented from doing the good they should if the powers-that-be deemed their actions unnecessary.  But the building is targeted by a bomber, leading to the death of King T'Chaka of Wakanda.  Heroes choose sides, and battle lines are drawn.

Civil War works on several levels.  First, it's a knock-down, drag-out fight; a movie that takes every kid's ""who'd kick who's ass"" comic book conversations and plops up up on IMAX.  Because let's face it; monster-on-monster movies are the best Kaiju movies, hands down. So of course seeing superheroes duking it out is boom-tastic. But knowing these superheroes after following their stories for years makes their feuding tough to watch. Picking a side though, well that's easy; you're either with Captain America and his stand for freedom, or you're wrong.

But how can you cheer Iron Man, Black Panther et al. getting beat up by Captain America, Falcon and their crew? Well, you can't.  These scenes are tough to watch because directors Anthony and Joe Russo manage to keep the bonds these characters feel for each other front and center.  They may be fighting, but they still feel the pull of friendship.  And while these battles are absolutely amazing - Ant Man in particular gets to show off his stuff in a big way - I couldn't help but wish they'd stop fighting and band together again.  (Particularly heart-wrenching?  Seeing BFFs Black Widow and Hawkeye on opposite sides.)

Screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely inject plenty of humanity into the storyline, from Black Panther's reasons for siding with Iron Man to the Big Bad's reasons for being a Big Bad.  They also add in the requisite jokes and bonhomie between comrades we've come to know and love here in the MCU. Yeah, that mix of anger and humor doesn't sound like it'd work, but whipsmart editing and a cast that knows their characters inside and out, Civil War leads the charge into MCU Phase Three beautifully.  Not only does Civil War stand on its own, but the aftermath of what happens here is sure to echo through the rest of this new Phase.

No spoilers, but the climax will break your heart.  And you'd better have a strong one, because that's not the only time you're heart will get put into a blender on frappé.  A major character we all know and love dies halfway through the film, and it's gut-wrenching.  Or at least it is if you have a soul.  And there are many more moments that will have you clutching your popcorn, pearls or what have you.  In Civil War it's not the story that's the thing - this is basically a who's in/who's out thing - but how they get there, and why.  Here, the why is the thing.  And the behind the scenes craftsmanship, along with actors giving top-notch performances, make for a compelling two-plus hours.

Gotta say I'm glad to see Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff and Anthony Mackie's Falcon/Sam Wilson get lead status here.  You know there's more to them than what we've been given so far, and getting to know them even better - especially Falon and his kickass suit - is just what the movie doctor ordered.  After so many Marvel movies and TV shows, things can feel weighted down, or worse yet, dull.  Getting each character to decide where s/he stands is a great way to dig into their psyche, giving us heretofore unknown tidbits on who they really are.  Eight years into the MCU wonderland, that brings new life to the franchise.  Bonus: with getting to know these characters, I didn't miss Thor or Hulk once.  (Okay, maybe Thor's abs.  Sue me. But keep an eye out for Cap biceps.  Seriously, you'll wanna catch that.)

Here's the newbie rundown.  Spider-Man? As much as I feared this new revamp, Peter Parker feels like the high schooler  I remember. (And Marissa Tomei's vivacious Aunt May is a nice 21st century upgrade.) He definitely makes his presence known in Civil War - everyone's seen the Spidey-with-Cap's-shield teaser - but Petey is the bumbling newbie he was when I read the comics and Sunday papers back in the day.  And there's plenty left over for Spider-Man: Homecoming in 2017.  Black Panther?  This is just...wonderful.  Chadwick Boseman is absolutely amazing as T'Challa (aka Black Panther).  His commanding but understated onscreen presence is powerful, and I can't wait to see what he does when Black Panther hits theaters.  Plus, gotta love that suit!  I'm a sucker for retractable claws.  Just ask my cats.  And while we've seen Vision and Scarlet Witch in Ultron, it's good to see their characters fleshed out a bit more here, as they bond (after all, both Witch and Vision are hyper-powerful beings) and choose sides.

As for the usual multiplex add-ons, definitely go IMAX. 3D isn't necessary, but if you need it for your IMAX  thang, do it. You really wanna see this on the biggest screen possible. Let it all come at you large and in charge.  You're welcome.

Sneaks after the film?  Most definitely.  There are the usual mid-credits & post credits sneaks. The after-credits song ""Left Hand Free"" is a groovy way to pass the time between the two. Oh, and don't forget to keep an eye out for Uncle Stan.  I think this is my favorite cameo of his to date. Ranks right up there with Cap's ""Language!""`"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Almost perfect  if not for the extremely predictable story line. Still loads of fun though.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The darkest Marvel Studios Film you'll ever see.  You may not like it, but I think this could be an Oscar-triggering motive.  Marvel, IMO, is striving to be the most cautious movie maker the industry have known."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The most impressive thing about Captain America: Civil War isn't the well-filmed action, the surprising amounts of humor that works, or the great new characters (including one of the best Spider-Man portrayals by Tom Holland and Chadwick Boseman's super cool Black Panther), but its the balance. Pretty much every Avenger shows gets stuffed in the movie, but as you watch you are still focused on Cap, Bucky, and Iron Man (except when Spider-Man shows up. Then I just wanted more of him). The movie isn't perfect, some portions of it felt rushed, especially the random ""romance"", and Marisa Tomei is WAY too young to play Aunt May in my mind. She does a fine job for her 5 minutes of screentime, but I can't put her in that role. At all. (Also, I hate the text-on-screen that reveals the setting. It's weirdly big and the font is really pointy and it bothered me for some odd reason.) Besides those minor critiques, this was an incredible comic book movie. All of the actors give great performances, and it was really nice to see Sebastian Stan back as Bucky Barnes after a 2 year absence.The action sequences are pure comic book fun, the super cameos are great, it balances fun with the more serious storyline, and while it feels a little long, it was definitely worth the 2.5 + hours. Is it one of the best comic book movies? Time will have to tell, but as of right now it could be up there."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Amazing. Just. Amazing.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,CGI smorgasborg. SO Boring in the first hour and a half. Spiderman and Antman were the only good parts. It's a copy of Batman vs Superman with terrorist bombs and superhero mommies and daddies being catalysts.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"A wonderful movie, the Russo brothers did a great job showing off all the different superheroes in the movie. The fighting scenes were amazing and the they were also funny! Overall a wonderful movie that if you have kept up with all the Marvel movies, you will love this one."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,This movie was better than a movie has a right to be. OMG so good!
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This is the Marvel movie I've been waiting for since The Avengers. A small, personal conflict that puts emphasis on emotional stakes rather than worldly stakes. The Russo brothers, Christopher Markus, Stephen McFeely, and Kevin Feige have crafted what could possibly be the best comic book movie of all time. 

From the moment the question of whether or not the Avengers should be governed by world governments is poised each Avenger has a sensical, interesting, and unique stance on whether or not they should comply. Characters' opposing ideologies bouncing off each other with the perfect dose of their comic book personalities made for an engaging and well thought out argument for each side of the issue. All of this build up gave the action sequences depth and meaning, as opposed to just fighting or fighting's sake. 

Each new character is introduced so eloquently, especially Black Panther's introduction to the MCU. His arc was woven so well into the overarching story but did not weigh the film down with a lengthy origin. Spider-Man's introduction could almost feel like it was tacked on to the story, but the dialogue was so well written and the scenes were so well executed by the actors that it worked beyond belief. 

The final confrontation takes the emotional weight of the first two acts and expands on it exponentially while again making it a much more personal conflict. You understand exactly where each party is coming from, each has their rights and their wrongs, but you still root for both of them pretty equally. 

To paraphrase Cap, ""I could watch this all day."" This movie is simultaneously the best Captain America film, Iron Man film, Avengers film, and quite possibly the best comic book film of all time. This is how you make a film that pits superheroes against each other. Bravo, Marvel Studios. Well done."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"You go see this movie because you are invested in the MCU and It doesn't disappoint. The set pieces are big and the new players are fantastic. Spider-Man(Holland) and Black Panther(Boseman) are spectacular while Spider-Man pretty much steals the show like everyone was hoping for. The wait for Homecoming will border on unbearable after his scenes because they were just that good.  Evans and Downey play their roles flawlessly and really just seem like they embody everything about their characters. The one liners as expected are spot on, funny, and really add an extra dimension that BvS wasn't able to capitalize on. The action scene at the airport is everything it was billed to be and more. The Russo brothers never stop hitting you with great action scene after scene and the dialogue is just spot on as you would expect. It is definitely is a top tier offering from Marvel and it is one of their best. For me it is just not as focused as Winter Solider which is my favorite MCU movie. There is a lot going on and I'm sure my second viewing will allow me to take it all in better. Don't wait go see this movie you won't regret it."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"One of the best Marvel movies yet. It's very difference from the Civil War comic, but every bit as good."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Yes, Spider-Man is the best part of the movie. A solid follow-up to THE WINTER SOLDIER, but ultimately does not live up."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Amazing! Marvel is at the top of their craft! They do almost everything perfectly!
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,The movie had its interesting moments but tends to get long and redonedant. The Surprise Character of Spiderman turned out to look more like an unexperienced overly eager kid. Did nothing really to convince me he was a Superhero. This movie can easily be watched on DVD so No rush to spend your money at the theater.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Great movie. Exceeds all expectations.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"For everyone who said that ""Age of Ultron"" was just a rehash of the first Avengers film, this is for you. Character development, motives that make sense, the perfect balance of screen time for all heroes. Every action scene was amazing, all the humor resonated. This is the best ""Avengers"" film to date. Well worth the watch."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,The Russo Brothers do it again!  ????
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Amazing that's all I have to say!!!
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Super nice! just enough humor. Great action. Introduction of Black Panther was very well done. Gave just enough to have fans asking for more.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,A little slow in the beginning but the airport battle scene definitely makes up for it.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Ridiculous plot. One of the worst Marvel Movie's I have seen.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Honestly wonderful! So much happening in this movie but they are able to make it all feel so natural. I loved it. The introduction of the new characters couldn't have been done better. Can't wait to see it again!
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Hands down the best the MCU has to offer by pitting our heroes against each other. 100/100,"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"United we stand. Divided we fall.
This is my first time writing a review for a movie, reviewing this movie as the first time I ever review a movie, it's an honor. Now, I will not compare this to Batman v. Superman even if I want to, as a person who loves Marvel but also respects DC. Captain America: Civil War is my favorite MCU film since Captain America: The Winter Soldier. I gotta say that Captain America is the only Marvel Franchise or even superhero movie franchise where the sequels get better. Hands down to the Russo brothers, they understand how to direct action and in which direction it needs to go. What I liked about this movie in particular is that it didn't rely on too much backstory, just 1 or 2 minutes to reinforce somebody's backstory, it relies on the other MCU movies for backstory. Even the newcomer to the MCU Black Panther (played by Chadwick Boseman, who was pretty awesome, the new Batman of the MCU) doesn't get a backstory, but you can understand why he is involved and why he is on the side that he is in. Spider-Man also doesn't rely on backstory, because everybody knows who is Spider-Man (played by Tom Holland), just your friendly neighborhood. And Tom Holland was my favorite Spider-Man that I have ever seen, I don't want to say that he is the best because not everybody has seen this movie, but the majority of people would agree with me, I am positive. Everybody is complaining that Tom Holland looks young and he sounds like every kid on Call of Duty, and I must say that there's some truth in that, but Peter Parker is 16 years-old in this universe.
Even though this movie looks like an Avengers movie, it is more of a Captain America sequel, in the sense that the civil war part doesn't come until the second half, but again, this is a positive not a negative, as this movie is well balanced.
Now the first half of the movie was all about the drama and about what is happening with the government and these superheroes, and I would say that the first half kind of drags because it isn't all action, although there are some pretty neat and polished action sequences, and that is what I love about the Russo brothers, that they can definitely do action so well, and you know that if you've seen the previous Captain America. I gotta give a round of applause to the stunts team because they did a pretty great job. I walked in this movie being #teamironman, but then I was shifting sides as both Tony Stark and Steve Rogers kept bringing up great points. Another reason I loved this movie, is that the audience who have picked sides have inner conflicts, so points of view shift all the time. As I stated earlier, this is ultimately a Captain America sequel, so this half focuses on finding Bucky because he was framed for committing a terrorist act and the authorities are after him.
The second half of the movie is where the Civil War stuff happens, Iron Man has had enough of disobedience by Cap and his team. This is my favorite half because it has the greatest superhero throwdown ever, and that is the airport scene from the trailers, where it is just packed with as many superheroes as Marvel could afford, which I am not mad about, because most of the characters there, we had previous movies made to care about them, and then there's Spider-Man, one of my favorite characters in the movie. Paul Rudd as Ant-Man was hilarious and was great, standing toe-to-toe with Spidey. What I loved about this action seen is did not focus too much on Cap and Iron Man (that is a later sequence) , everybody had their time to shine, and Spidey acts like such a geek in this movie I couldn't help but clap at Tom Holland's portrayal of the wall-crawler.
Now, for the negative, which isn't much. Marvel spends too much time in making the superheroes great that they forget about the villains, which are played by actors that I really like. The villain is played by Daniel Brühl, who I like, and I must say he wasn't bad in the thing, but the villain didn't play well into this story, but I can understand his motivations, like everyone else in the film. And earlier I said how the first half kind of drags, but that's pretty much it for the bad stuff.
I truly recommend this movie to pretty much everybody, I guarantee that even if you're not a superhero movie fan, but just a fan of good movies with a little bit of well-timed humor, you're gonna like this movie, and I would rate Civil War a 10 out of 10 shields. This was the best way for Marvel to kick-start phase three of the MCU. And I would recommend watching it on cinemas, especially for the airport scene. 
I am sorry if I was being confusing, again, this is my first review ever, and thanks for reading this. Have a good day everyone."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Diversão com algum conteúdo, agrada fãs e público geral. Junta-se àquela meia dúzia de ótimos filmes de super-heróis."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I felt like my money was wasted. Visually stunning but I felt as though there was something left out. If you want to see characters fight and little story line, this is the film for you."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,enjoyed the movie...
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The Russo Brothers' has done what I thought to be an arduous task of bringing in action and emotion into a film with umpteen characters. The direction is impeccable , well paced and walks the fine line between perspective changes.. The most important thing that worked for me in this film is the ability to bring in different  perspectives into the picture and keeping all of them intact. This didn't just chose sides at the end but showed all of them . It is just incredible that they could be extremely subtle with the line. The script is brilliantly written for the most part , it is well staged and dialogue really flows . The drama provides a perfect padding and boosting to the action sequences and vice versa. With the exception of certain plot holes in the handling of its villain , the script was compact and provided overall arcs to all of it's characters. The characters are brilliantly portrayed . Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark has pulled the single greatest performance in comic book genre along with Heath Ledger in the dark knight . Sebastian Stan as Bucky gave a formidable Winter soldier and I thought the writer and the director really played this character well . I felt they showed here how power the character was and his ability to provide a clear motivation in morality . Chris Evans as Steve Rogers was at par with Tony stark and I must give credit to the Russos for taking bold steps with the characters that could have gone disastrous in the hands of other directors. The story took Captain to literally the edge of the line to generate the maximum emotional response. The overall story shows a complex dynamic between these three characters and the spine of the script . The debut of Black Panther in the MCU was impeccable and provides the third perspective to the movie . I felt Black Panther plays the more introspective view of the audience and the neutral side, probably the one the audience would feel as well when all the known characters side up against each other. He is well written and brilliantly played by Chadwick Boseman . The film doesn't go much into the background of the character but gave us enough to help the cause of this storyline .  Boseman's portrayal with a distinctive accent . a fighting style and movement draws parallel with Andy Serkis as Gollum from the Lord of the Rings in terms of creating a new personality through rigorous method . His relation with the picture's leads is the foundation on which events transpire. Other characters like Antony Mackie's Falcon and Elizabeth Olsen's Scarlet witch has been significantly improved from the previous films . There are other dynamics at play here between Tony Stark and the debutant Tom Holland's Spiderman , Paul Bettany's Vision and Olsen's Witch. Many would argue that this portrayal of Spiderman is the definitive one . The character doesn't go into any origin's story but feeds on the previous tales . Tom Holland's portrayal of teenage angst and nuances along with his extremely hilarious interaction with Robert Downey Jr. provided a layer that the character never had before . It makes it more rounded and I am surprised how the Russos' used them in the movie . At times I was feeling why would Spiderman go into a civil war specially being so young but I felt the script handled it well and stopped when it required. Bettany's and Olsen's dynamics was ingenuous and unpredictable at the same time . After the Age of Ultron , we are offered more insight into the personalities and I thought it really layered the film . The script really did a remarkable job of binding characters together . Coming to the action - Probably one of the best action sequence is cinema history is within Civil War. First of all the movie has a lot of action set pieces in between the drama but the emotion and motivation that underlines the action bolsters it to a great effect. Every action set piece has a specific purpose and it sticks to it . The introductory action set piece has a very James Bond' opening sequence appeal to it with lots of handheld camera movements. It provided as a brilliant setup for establishing character moments .That alone would have been a highlight of any other movie . But the sequences in the middle section and the one specifically at the end ""The Airport Sequence"" will make the history books . It's an extravaganza that will bring forth repeated viewings . I have never seen such an array of lead characters being played out in such style in front of the screen . Every character had a moment in that action sequence with adequate and appropriate humour and signature stunt traits. The suits looked amazing , the visuals were top notch and the set piece was brilliantly staged. It certainly feels a lot of work has been put into it . It felt more like a war and not just as a dispute . For those that loves the colorful pages of the comic books coming to life , the Airport sequence will be the zenith of it  . Marvel has really upped the game . There are some negatives especially in the form of plot holes when it comes to the main antagonist and the first fart of the film might be a little slow to few. Also Marvel has the tendency to under emphasize the use of original score . But the negatives don't stand up to the huge emotional and adrenaline response it generates .  Honestly this film would have been one of the best without any villain . This is a film of Heroes vs Heroes . Overall it is a brilliant piece of storytelling and one of the best superhero film if not the best . It is tonally exquisite and would ensure large number of repeated viewings all over the world . As a person leaving the theatre , one can't help but feel slightly torn and can't wait for the next array of movies to see which direction the MCU takes  . Some enthusiasts may feel like nostalgic since Iron Man ,2008  and even before.  . At the end though , one can safely say . Wow ! That was a movie worth going . It was a journey worth taking."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"What can i Say!! 
10/10 for action
10/10 for entertainment
marvel does it again!"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Even though its 2.5 hours long, there's never any down time. Its great from start to finish. Absolutely amazing. Marvel and  the Russo Brothers once again prove why they are on top of the box office. Best Marvel movie to date."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The movie was very entertaining to say the least, who wouldn't want to see Spiderman and Black Panther? Viewing this movie three times I had focus on three aspects of the movie, First was the entertainment which exceeded my already high expectations with added humor that was a bit too much in certain sequences (which didn't ruin the movie experience with already established comedic based characters.) In my second viewing I focused on the plot the motives of the characters which was clear there is a villian that felt like he was was a bit rushed which was a bit disappointing givin the fact that he's such a great actor  the plotholes that were clearly visible in my third viewing. Finally I focused on the portayal the convincing emotions that the actors brought was simply just not that impressive in other words not convincing enough to the plot excluding Robert Downey Jr. who was as always great with his acting but the rest wasnt that convincing. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed my viewing I'm pretty sure you will. Best Comicbook movie ever? No, but thats for another discussion"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Absolutely phenomenal...hands down Marvel's best movie yet. Arguably the best super hero movie in creation up to this point
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,One of the best MCU films to date and one of the best Comic Book movies ever. Marvel Studios once again delivers great characters in incredible action within a well guided story. Civil War is a game changer in many ways from the impact of the events to the MCU going forward and how comic book movies will be handled overall. It balances so much on it's plate to perfection while you never feel any character has drawn the short straw. The introductions of both Spider-Man and Black Panther were off the charts.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"A good entertaining movie. While it was kinda of a mindless battle in the airport, it was visually spectacular. The plot was intriguing throughout until the end where it fell flat for me. Nonetheless this was, to me, the best Avengers movie to date. Also Spiderman was awesome."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Great Movie wonderfully done ! For the critics that said the story was poor,  Like Kyle Smith of the NY Post, shame on you. If you watch any of the other movies, you'd know the story great and connects all the pieces together. Even ties into the last scene from Ant-man. The movie is a fun ride and enjoyable from the time it starts. Only flaw Spoiler alert.... is that a Maria Tomei should not be playing Aunt May (Sorry Aunt wasn't Hot, she was a nice old lady). This is the movie we wanted back when the Age of Ultron came out. Def worth seeing."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,A true legitimate contender for the best or one of the best films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe by Marvel Studios.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Captain America civil war one of the best marvel movies to date
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I have been a fan of captain america since I was a kid and read all the comics, this movie brings a lot of comic history together, introduces the civil war series and has a few hidden gems for comic readers and non readers.  This movie is likely the 3rd best work done yet.  You will not be disappointed."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Loved it!  Love the plot, the acting, the actors... just love."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"While probably not my favorite movie of the MCU (That would still be TWS or GotG) Civil War will go down as one of the best super hero movies of all time. This is a nice adaptation that is pretty far from the comics, but makes sense in the universe we currently have. Spider-Man and Ant-Man really steal the show when on screen, as well as Black Panther and Falcon. Loved it."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"crap, typical tooty fruity coloured cheese!"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Every time I walk into a Marvel movie, it's with a mixture of overwhelming excitement and a tinge of fear: will this be the movie when they finally let me down? Captain America: Civil War had the highest potential to do so, cramming a roster of a dozen super heroes into a fight against not only a bunch of bad guys, but each other.

And yet, a movie could not have been put in more capable hands. The Russo brothers, veterans of working with ensemble casts (Community, Arrested Development) and Marvel Cinematic alumni writers Markus and McFeely together manage to do what might seem an impossible task: throw a ton of big-players on the screen and still give each of them a unique voice and a moment to shine, without feeling like a hap-hazard decoupage of suits and powers.

Still, the movie is very anchored into it's staples: Steve Rogers and Tony Stark. Each of them so thoroughly explored that this movie very much feels like the melding of Winter Soldier 2 and Ironman 4, rather than Avengers 3. Civil War manages to bring more character development to these two players than Marvel has been able to accomplish since the first Ironman. But it's fantastic that at the same time, it manages to lay the foundation so well for two brand-new heroes (to the MCU) that already have heart and cool-factor off the charts. This movie generates tons of excitement for the next Avengers films, but not because it has to throw so much screen time at doing so, but because it affirms that those movies are in such capable hands with it's creative team.

Captain America: Civil War is not only a near-perfect super hero movie, it's an amazingly and surprisingly grounded, character-driven film that, while very different, could go down in history among the ranks of The Dark Knight."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This is one of the better Marvel films.  It bites off a lot of items ... continuing the Winter Soldier plot, introducing Black Panther, introducing Spider-Man, continuing the Avengers plot, bring Ant-Man into the greater fold ... but without succumbing to the ""too many plot lines"" issue that buries so many comic book sequels.  It even manages to work in a climax that does not involve blue light shining up into the sky and all the heroes fighting hordes of enemies.  It's not as good as the previous Captain America film and nowhere near as refreshing as ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", but it delivers what a film like this should and it does it well."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Where do all the really good villains go??
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Lots of Bro-Moments throughout the movie.  Black Panther kicked ass.  Spiderman was a good addition & this version has potential. ""Aunt May"" got hotter.  Too bad one of the fight scenes towards the end was too dark."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Ridiculously good. Best Avengers movie yet.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,This movie was incredible. Every superhero has their own part in this movie.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Better than avengers ultron
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,definitely worth the hype and rushing to theaters on the first day. action packed and wow moments throughout. marvel got it right on this one like few others in the past if not all.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Much better than BvS
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,I will see this film again and again. Audience reactions are awesome. specially with this kind of epicness. I was seriously in awe for a major moment of the film.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"My favorite superhero film in the current age of the ever-expanding Marvelverse - other than the delightfully irreverent variants like ""Ant-Man,"" ""Deadpool,"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" - has been ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier."" In that movie, the fantastical comic-book elements that normally numb the brain through ceaseless (and expanding) repetition were, for once, grounded in details relevant to the world in which we live. Suddenly, the titular character was fighting for a cause in which the stakes were high - preventing an NSA-like entity from excessive data-mining - yet comprehensible in human terms, and therefore meaningful. In both Avengers films - the second one even more so than the first - extra-terrestrial (and -dimensional) forces threatened our world with domination and destruction; how many times can global disaster be averted before it feels boring, rather than frightening? In that sense, though the final Dark Knight film was a bit tiresome, as well, Christopher Nolan's series was, to me, more palatable, as the director kept the stakes earthbound (unlike this year's ""Batman v Superman""). If every time it's the end of the world, and we know it, then I don't feel that fine, in cinematic terms, anyway.

This is the age of the tentpole franchise! What can you do? Stop going to the movies? That's an option, but if the reason you go to the multiplex is for spectacle, then ""Captain America: Civil War"" delivers the goods as well as could be hoped. In fact, to be fair, it's better than most of the competition (and in IMAX 3D, to boot!). It has a decent cast and a compelling enough story (unless one is just exhausted by all the mayhem). What it is not, however, is a film solely about Captain America, that square-jawed, genetically modified refugee from a time gone by, frozen in ice at the end of his first adventure and then defrosted in our modern era at the start of his second. Though this new film is directed by the same brothers Anthony and Joe Russo) who gave us ""Winter Soldier,"" and though Captain America's particular moral dilemma is the one that (mostly) drives the plot, this is really ""Avengers 3: Battle of the Brawn."" One wonders if perhaps the Russos were not working out their personal demons, as the plot pits (spiritual) brother against brother (and one sister), as the fate of ... yes, the world ... hangs in the balance.

The movie begins with an Avengers mission that leaves many civilians dead. This time, the governments of the planet decide that the collateral damage is not acceptable, and heads of state gather to formulate a series of accords to check the use of power and might by these super-powered agents of ostensible good. The ""civil war"" refers to the fact that not all erstwhile partners agree on whether to sign these accords or not. Into this mix comes Bucky Barnes - aka, the ""winter soldier"" of the previous film - Captain America's childhood friend whom our hero tried to de-program last time around. Bucky's in hiding, but when he supposedly carries out a terrorist attack, the Avengers have one more issue that tears them further apart, since some think him guilty, while others support the Cap. Along the way, there are some attempts at weighty dialogue about the nature of good and evil, and shades in between, as well as some philosophizing about how power should be used responsibly. The movie works best in some of its action sequences, however - the simpler ones, like a brilliant car chase in Bucharest - than when it tries too hard to be consequential, since ultimately it sheds any relevance to our actual world when it morphs into a slugfest between former friends.

Chris Evans is back as Captain America/Steve Rogers, joined by Robert Downey, Jr., as Iron Man/Tony Stark, Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff, and most of the rest of the gang from previous Avengers films. But not Thor and not the Hulk. We do get a new superhero, Black Panther, played by Chadwick Boseman (""42"") - very good - and a new Spider-Man, played by Tom Holland (""In the Heart of the Sea""), who is not bad, except that he is the third iteration of that character in the last 15 years. Talk about repetition! Paul Rudd shows up once more, as Ant-Man, in my favorite cameo of the movie, and the list goes on. It's a cornucopia of super-riches, and if that's your thing, then this is your movie. And even if this is no longer really my thing, the movie was by no means unentertaining. Call that a (very) qualified recommendation, then, and go throw your dollars at the screen to ensure that we never escape from Marvel martyrdom."

"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"In my humble opinion...this is one of the top 3 best Superhero movies ever made. This movie was everything I could have asked for. Really. So many of these giant, blockbuster movies are action and spectacle first and while this movie has, without a doubt, the best superhero action scenes ever, this is about the characters first. You care more about these characters in this movie than any other MCU installment by a mile, and it's wonderful! I'm so glad that the Russo brothers are in charge of directing the biggest movies going forward! I'm going to go see this at least 2 more times!"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Awesome! Extremely well done! What Batman v Superman could have been!
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Good story line, great action and laugh out loud funny !  What these superhero movies are supposed to !"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Emotion and conflict are what drives this Marvel staple from beginning to end, along with some of the best action you'll ever see in these movies."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The is one of my favorite comic book films. The movie had the best action sequence in any comic book movie to date.  The cast, story and cinematography was amazing. Kudos to the Russo brothers!!!"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"MARVEL is the best there is at what they do, and what they do is epic cinematic experience. CIVIL WAR is 10/10."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,awesome movie from start to the end!
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I loved Black Panther, Spidey, and Ant Man..Story could have been worked a bit more. I felt they were trying too hard to make the action too intense by speeding the frames up. Didn't allow you to process what was happening but all in all I still enjoyed it"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,It was amazing. You have to see it. Best one to date.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,To me the greatest super hero movie so far!
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Amazing movie.  Done.  The story build up as phenomenal, and it keeps doing it.  Love it"
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"So, so good. An absolute must see. Best MCU film yet and Black Panther is incredible, as is Spidey."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best Marvel movie yet.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,This film is an example of what happens when studios actually care about their blockbuster characters.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Stupid stupid stupid movie!
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Very well put together
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Entertaining enough after a slow start and just about manage to contain all the different characters and make them relevant.
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I got my entire LIFE watching Civil War! Spider-Man, Ant Man, & Black Panther were the highlight of the entire movie in my opinion. I honestly don't know where to start. Everyone that played a part in this movie did a fantastic job and I can't wait to see what the Russo Brothers do in the future with Infinity War. I felt happy, then sad, then excited, then happy again. It's such a fun rollercoaster to be on. The fight choreography is A1 and I'm set on seeing this film again. Maybe 3 just for that airport scene alone. Do yourself a favor and go watch this movie. Marvel knows what they're doing."
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Slow start, strong finish. Spidey steals the show."
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The Avengers that Age of Ultron couldn't quite get.. The Captain America movie that, inconceivably, outdoes its predecessor. The thriller and action film that ranks among the best of them. It provides a very believable, realistic government response to superhero activity (Ahem, X-Men and BvS), and does so without tedious court proceedings or other boring politics (BvS again, Iron Man 2). That's not to say that there are no politics, it's just that they're presented through the eyes of people, not a faceless government with a forgettable puppet. The conflict between everyone is believable. Tony/Cap's relationship has built since they met. Everyone takes a course of action completely believable and in character. The title fight in the airport is belief-driven, while Cap and Bucky v Tony is on a far more emotional, personal level. Never a dull moment in the film. Action, well-placed but in many places throughout. I count 6 notable fight scenes. Much of the rest is intriguing dialogue, in which the heroes first try every last resort before coming to blows, then during fights and in trying to make amends afterwards. Zemo, the villain, has a more unique approach than any other. He easily hurts the Avengers the most, and does it without throwing a single punch. He is underdeveloped, but makes up for it with craftiness on the level of Loki. That's another thing. Zemo, like Loki, is one of very few Marvel villains to survive a film. He doesn't get away scot-free, but it does open up future opportunity. Spider-Man was amazing. Easily the best to grace the screen. Nobody is left out, not even the woman who takes the place of the Stamford mom in the comic. Easily the best superhero film of all time."
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,Unfuckwitable ð???ð??»
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Rarely are we privileged to witness perfection in our lifetime, an ascension of immaculate conception against formulas and data sets.  Just as Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky changed literature in the 19th century, and Picasso and Matisse permanently transformed art in the 20th century, so to does Civil War bridge the gap between this world and infinity.  I say this without hyperbole and in complete sobriety: Civil War is the greatest superhero movie in the history of the genre.  Just as The Godfather provide a clear demarcation between American film history, Civil War as well forever splits superhero movie history.

When reviewing this psychotically error-proof work of art, it is difficult to comprehend the political and psychological elements at play here.  Like the great filmmakers of years past, the Russo Brothers incorporate pressing issues in the American political and socioeconomic fabric of everyday life to advance their storytelling technique.  For comparative examples, look at our current Presidential election climate and the approval/criticism debate involving the generation sociologists have labeled ""Millennials.""

To its detractors, know one thing.  Throughout the history of American cinema, creative high points of film art have been lambasted while derivative fluff of the trivial nature has been garnered with praise.  Likewise, the cinematic storytellers of the future will, an a pointless effort to capture the very nature of eternity and physical existence, set the world on fire with the sights and sounds of Civil War."
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Put on the suit, let's go a few rounds."
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Fun action, underwhelming story, very forgettable"
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,A sucker punch to the DC frowny face! Marvel once again proves they understand how to make a wildly entertaining film about superheroes that are both super and heroic.
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Fantastic!!
amazing!!!
Spider man and Black panther are just wonderful, and the stakes have never been higher.  Final Grade:  A"
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best Marvel Movie! Well done!
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best marvel movie ever !!
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,If you want to go see a movie where people just fight for stupid reasons and you want to see a third avengers movie then waste your $10. The premise of the movie is extremely overplayed. We simply solve the same story told several times by DC in the Batman and Superman movies most recently just another government trying to tell people with amazingly gifted powers to do what they're told just is a great way to spend three hours bunch of politic telling people what to do so engaging.
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,The new Spider-Man was amazing!
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Now that is how you make a superhero film.  After 12 films, it seemed unlikely the Marvel universe could create something so refreshing and new, but Civil War does just that.  It's impeccably paced, exhilarating, heartbreaking, and just outright fun.  Captain America Civil War is one of the greatest superhero films to be put to the big screen.

Civil War sees the return of most of the usual suspects from the Marvel films, with the exception of Thor and Hulk, and sets the universe in a new direction while also honoring what came before it.  The Captain America 'trilogy' should be considered the most unique trilogy of all time.  Although, for all intents and purposes, this film is essentially Avengers 3.  Yes, the story is always focused on Cap and Bucky, but it is just as much a Marvel Universe film as a story about two best friends from Brooklyn.

The Russo Brothers are thankfully back after Winter Soldier and they pulled off the impossible with Civil War.  There are so many characters, plot-lines, and things that need to be set up, and it's handled wonderfully.  But they also direct action maybe better than anyone in Hollywood right now.  Much like Winter Soldier, the action in Civil War always hits at just the right time.  The airport scene will go down as one of the greatest superhero fight sequences of all time.

Newcomers Black Panther and Spider-Man were brought along and implanted seamlessly.  Chadwick Boseman and Tom Holland play the two characters brilliantly and instantly get me excited to see their solo films within the next few years.

Each character gets their time to shine.  Scarlet Witch is fully realized and Ant-Man, Falcon, and Vision bring the witty Marvel one-liners that they have become known for.  As much as this film is deeply rooted in psychological emotion and tough character choices, it still retains the humor that keeps the film from ever reaching grim areas.  It really puts to question, how much better can superhero films get?

I haven't even mention Hawkeye, Black Widow, or Bucky/Winter Soldier who all get incredible moments.  Does anybody not have confidence that the Russo brothers can balance 60 something characters in Infinity War in a few years?  Overall, the Marvel Universe and superhero films in general, have a new level of greatness to live up to.  Perhaps more time will give me perspective, but for now, Civil War is my new favorite Marvel film.

+You understand both sides of the coin

+That Airport scene

+Builds on what came before, and sends the universe in a refreshing direction

+Still a focus on Cap and Bucky

+Black Panther and Spider-Man steal the show

+Maintains the fun tone amidst an immensely emotion film.

"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Another great marvel film! Does a great job mixing humor, action, and an in-depth story line that will keep you wanting more."
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Hands down, the best Marvel movie. Even with so much happening, the movie is still intimate and emotional. It hit every target at the right spots and at the right times."
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This movie gave me a lot of things that just made my heart happy.  The first half of the movie was a bit slow, but the second half of the movie was probably some of the best stuff ever put into a superhero movie ever.  Spider-Man and Ant-Man steal the show!  Go see this in the theater, you will not regret it!  Overall I am very happy with this movie!"
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,The latest Marvel film is the best Marvel film.
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best marvel movie ever
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Honestly a complete joke, this movie calls itself Captain America Civil War when it doesn't have any relation with the Marvel comics title: Civil War. This Movie should have been called Winter Soldier, because all the plot is around that character and how the cap wants to protect his friend by doing the wrong things and fighting against the law; also this movie changes completely one character from the Captain America comics, which es Baron Zemo or should I call it Colonel Zemo since he was a Sokovia soldier and not a member from Hydra as established in the comics, this Zemo is also just guy looking for revenge against the Avengers for the dead of his family. Just to end this, this movie was full comedy, I spend most of the time laughing from all the jokes they over use, literally this is no action movie, this is a comedy movie with some action in between scenes."
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,wow what a movie! great script great writing amazing fight scenes oh and airport man airport. this is the empire strikes back for the avengers and it did it almost flawlessly. Rating: 10/10

"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,Awesome movie with good visuals and story
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,Wow! I can't say much since this just came out but I felt like I got my money's worth in the first 15 minutes.
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best super Heroes movies Ever!.
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Nope, not a misclick.  Last year I watched ""The Abyss"" for the first time in years and for every moment that reminded me what a master filmmaker James Cameron was, there were as many scenes that reminded me that Cameron can't write realistic dialogue for shit.  The result was that it was a flat 5/10 as a median because everything that was great was greater than I remembered and the bad shit was almost unwatchable.  ""Civil War"" is that kind of movie.  I knew there would be obvious, didactic soapbox moments where people would speak from virtue signalling pulpits and those moments make the first half almost unwatchable despite the solid action sprinkled throughout (though that action is also a bit choppy at times--high-speed shutter trick doesn't work when the action is impeccably performed in the first place).  Vision is boring as fuck and will probably appeal to the very young viewers who have never heard of Spock from ""Star Trek,"" Data from ""Star Trek: TNG,"" ""Robocop,"" Bender from ""Futurama,"" Kryten from ""Red Dwarf,"" etc.  I knew Bettany-bot would be utter shit in followups and yeah, he's unbearably precocious, intoning lines that sound like they came from motivational posters from ghetto community centers.  Then Spider-Man and Ant-Man show up and ""Civil War"" escalates into the movie I came to see, then they go away, and the plot machinations lead to the kind of drama Mark Millar's garbage mini-series could only wetdream of reaching, leading to one of the most satisfying finales in any superhero movie.  But that first half..."
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War is the MUST SEE film for the MCU. Packed with Intense and Bittersweet Emotion, Hilarity (with turns from Paul Rudd's  Scott Lang/Ant-Man and Tom Holland's Peter Parker/Spider-Man), and Edge of your seat Action that truly succeeds in bring fun to life, the one main thing Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice have failed to register. Chris Evans and Robert Downey, Jr. are just as best as ever as the rest of the main cast, and directors Anthony and Joe Russo once again hit another Marvelous homerun of a Marvel Cinematic Universe film. Highly Recommended!"
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,Cookie-cutter Marvel movie. They really need to branch out and try something different.
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Incredible!
Amazing!
Wonderful!
Outstanding!
Better then Batman V Superman by a landslide!

 MCU can't do any wrong!

Just Wow!"
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,Hands down the best marvel movie to date. It's knocking on the door to the dark knight as the greatest comic book movie of all time.
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,Great film that has everything you're looking for in a Captain America movie as well as makes up for some of the dull moment in Age of Ultron.
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"If you have been waiting for a comic book movie to appear, that would be like taking the inky, colorfully, paneled pages of a silver age comic and plastering it upon a gorgeous cinematic canvas, Captain America: Civil War is your movie. 

I saw this movie opening night, Thursday at 7:00 in IMAX 3D. I waited in line like all the rest of the die hard geeks, patiently excited for what this next MCU film had to offer.

And BAM! 

Opening scene, after the timeline, origin set-up that most movies have, this movie was a wild roller coaster. But unlike a fairgrounds rickety, hastily put-together coaster that you only wouldnt allow your most hated enemy on, this movie was like a smooth, brilliantly laid out action-ride.

From beginning to end, you sat on your seat, desperately awaiting the next scene, the next line, the next frame even! It was almost as if each of the actors and actresses were all puppets of the Russo boys, as their facial expressions, movements and vocal controls were all beautifully perfect. 

This movie blew my overwhelmingly high expectations, and I cannot wait to see it again. Thank you MCU, thank you Kevin Feige, and thank you Russo brothers, you guys knew how to make a movie, something legendary.

EXCELSIOR!!"
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,Pure epic awesomeness....
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,So good!! They all brought it! Russo brothers hit it out of the park.
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The best Marvel movie I have watched so far. It is the future to many upcoming movies including Black Panther, Spiderman Homecoming and Avengers Infinity War. The action sequences are something that we haven't seen in any other Marvel movies. Spiderman was hilarious! The movie is the perfect mashup of action, comedy and emotion. Yet the movie made me cry."
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I liked it a lot,just a few things. I wish they shortened the first scene where bucky escapes from his room to make more room for cap vs iron man,that scene was what a lot of people came for and while it held to the comics a lot,it felt rushed."
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Refreshing start of the summer after the dissapointing Batman V Superman. The most satisfying Marvel film yet, with some of the best action scenes in superhero films period. However, you might walk away wishing you hadnt seen the endless trailers."
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,Marvel simply ups the ante with their latest release Captain America Civil War.
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,The Best movie I think I have ever seen since Avengers
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Another fantastic political thriller to come out of Marvel with some superhero action added in for good measure. When will the reign of Marvel end? If each of there films can be half as good as this once, then hopefully never (and this coming from a DC Comic fan... I still love you Superman and Batman but you have some well crafted storytelling to compete with.. stop trying to play catch-up and focus on your characters and story)."
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,Excellent...enough said!
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,Muy buena y entretenida. Only one word awesome.
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,I won't ruin it by giving away spoilers but I will say that this was a great comicbook movie! I don't know if its better then the two Avenger movies but its close. The Action was good the plot was good the introduction to Spiderman and Black Panther was very strong. Finally they pick the right person to play Spiderman. As for Black Panther they made him look real strong so that the causal fan will now be very interested in his solo movie which done right could be great. I thought the whole cast worked real hard into making this movie good so if your into comicbook movies and you were disappointed with Batman vs Superman Civil War goes above and beyond to make your forget all about it! One last side note Not only did it crush Batman vs Superman but it also was better then Deadpool as well I know fans might try to say otherwise but its simply not true
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"amazing,  so much action obviously will be a another addition to this incredible movie"
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,IMO the best marvel movie ever made. It balanced humor very well and kept characters true to their personalities while keeping screen time balanced. The plot was extremely engaging and was very well paced. SPOILER: I believe they wasted Zemo's potential which was the only shortcoming I could think of. He was the perfect culprit but his comic background was lost to a much different character.
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best Marvel Film to date
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The second best Avengers movie after the first film, but my third favourite Captain America movie (after The First Avenger and The Winter Soldier, in that order). This is an Avengers film nonetheless. There are a lot of great action scenes in this film but most of the plot feels like a drag, like an excuse for the Avengers to fight each other. 

Besides that BIG cool thingy at the airport, there are not many surprises in Civil War up until the moment when Stark loses his mind (that was a very interesting plot twist). I'd equate this big reveal to the Shield/Hydra reveal in TWS. There are a couple slack villains in the film, but Ironman ends up getting the job. Marvel has a big issue in the villain department so maybe it was natural to turn up to the heroes division. I found Spiderman quite childish and annoying. Being the second reboot in less than four years I would have enjoyed a more grown up/grounded character. On the other hand, Paul Rudd's Ant Man was a highlight, and a surprise. The ending was sloppy at best, leaving promised conclusions frozen in cryogenics. This film could have been so much more if it weren't for the need to setup the next 5 years of Marvel movies."
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,Ya... I liked this... a lot.
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Quite good, better than most. Well worth the price of admission."
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,4.9999999/5 stars. Absolutely amazing!!!
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Very good movie, not my favorite in the MCU. The airport fight scene is my favorite action scene ever in any movie, but the beginning dragged a little. I preferred BvS to be honest but wouldn't miss either, Spider-Man was great. 87 out of 100"
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,The fight scene in the middle gave me a nerd-gasm
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best Marvel Movie Ever!
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Seriously one of the best superhero movies!!!! Has everything! Very dark and toes the line of emotional, makes this universe more real. Much more real than other marvel movies! So awesome! A thrill ride! Must see!"
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I'm actually growing tired of these movies. By the way, Bucky and Bullseye are insufferable."
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,For the past eleven years I have maintained that 'Batman Begins' is the best comic book film ever made. Finally something has come along to knock it into a close second. 'Civil War' is the best comic book movie ever made. Everyone at the WB should be embarrassed that 'Batman V Superman' exists.
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The acting in the latest Avengers movie is remarkably good -- so good that it appears wasted on a super-hero movie. The direction and story, however, leave much to be desired. Yes, it's a super-hero movie and yes, the viewer could read the comic-books. But, still, when you are introducing a character in a movie, for the first time, it's generally a good idea to let the viewer know who the person is and what his or her powers are. Exactly how this is to be done is up to the director, but it needs to be done. On the other hand, why waste time mentioning a character who is never going to be on screen? Even the CGI is just average -- nothing like the previous movies. The movie has made a lot of money because it is a super-hero movie with top stars. However, it feels like what someone might say to break an awkward silence. The studio couldn't afford to go too long before making another super-hero movie so they made this one. There's too much story, too little action and, in the end, really no point. It isn't about geo-politics, really, and it isn't quite a  feel-good movie either. I hope the next one is a real movie."
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,The quintessential comic book movie
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This movie was the perfect example of how you take an overcrowded cast and make it work. The directors focused on only the important people of the movie, sure there were a lot of characters but each was given the perfect amount of screen time (baring Daniels Brühl's character ""Zemo which I'll get to). The Fight sequences were probably the most improved area of the this film in the past it's been very difficult to follow an action sequence BUT since the Russo brothers took tips from John wick directors the improvements perfectly displayed in this movie. 
Daniel Brühl's ""Zemo"" was such a great villain, Darker than the usual Marvel villains his performance shown very well! He was chilling yet cool and calm and the idea behind his motivation is brilliant. The one nit-pick I have is that his character wasn't as fleshed out as it could have been but I'll get to that soon, I think that's due to the running time of the movie. Chadwick Boseman was the perfect choice for the prince (or Rather king) T'challa the Black Panther, he left me wanting to get to his Solo movie sooner. The fact that his story for this movie focuses on the monarchy of Wakanda passing to him and how he is both ""warrior and king"" just sounds freaking awesome! Finally Tom Holland as Spiderman was the shining jewel of the movie, his performance was faultless the way he stuttering when he was introduced to Robert Downey juniors ""Iron man"" was a barrel of laughs! Also the fact that he was very chatty during fight scenes with Anthony Mackie's ""falcon"" and Sebastian Stan's ""Bucky the winter solider""  to the point where falcon points out that ""there's usually not a lot of talking"" just shows you marvels class when it comes to casting. In saying all this there were a couple things that didn't seem to fit for me, but these are king of nit-picks. Chadwick Bosemans accent as King T'challa wasn't as refined as it could have been some of his lines showed cracks in his accent hopefully he changes it for the solo movie. The next nit-pick is the scene in which Scarlet Johannsen's Black widow incapacitated the Black Panther by shooting (in a non-lethal way) him with electric Taser type thing. I thought that was a little PIS considering Jeremy Renner's ""Hawkeye"" had claimed in the previous scene that ""I don't miss"" and then proceeded to miss two shots when confronting Black Panther.  What I'm trying to say is that if anyone in the whole entire marvel universe could hit the Black Panther its Hawkeye, so if Hawkeye misses then Black widow shouldn't do any better. the fact that the black widow shot him (3 times I think it was) and he didn't seem to take an evasive action like he did against Hawkeye smelled of PIS big time (I can feel the feminist trying kill me with voodoo dolls). it's not anything to do with the fact that she's a woman (in fact she's shows her particular skills in hand to hand combat with the heavy weights of the film crossbones, the winter solider, Hawkeye which shows she is MORE than capable of beating any man or woman up). It's just that her character in previous films is shown to be a spy/hand to hand combat specialist and nothing BUT those skills no expert marksmen skills mentioned in any of the MCU movies. So when she displays perfect aim that she previously has not and incapacitates someone (Black Panther) who is is fresh off beating the greatest marksmen (Hawkeye) in the MCU it's safe to conclude that this part of the movie was PIS at its finest. The next nit-pick is the scene that takes place when Bucky/the winter solider is awaking with his arm in a vice with the captain standing in front of him. He (captain America) says ""which Bucky am I talking to?"" Bucky responds by saying something that only those two remember. The captain then deems him sane and they head off to the next part of their mission. This scene is a problem because before that scene Bucky had just had his memory reset by the Zemo the villain of the movie meaning he is the full on Russian speaking winter solider again plus he had just decimated an entire room of hero's (baring the Black Panther) which include his allies Falcon and Chris Evans ""captain America"" and nearly murders the captain (again).  The problem is simple in one scene he's the evil winter solider and in the next he's Bucky the good guy, this could have worked if it was explained BUT it wasn't. there was zero explanation as to how he becomes the good old Bucky again. The next nit-pick is Daniel Brühl's ""Zemo"" I loved his performance but his character wasn't as fleshed out as it could have been. The whole movie was building him up to be someone with a secret mission with his focus on finding out what ""mission report 1991"".it leads the audience to believe that he wants something to do with the winter solider program but we are corrected when murders the rest of the winter solider unit. This leads to the scene where he explains to the Black Panther that everything he did in the movie because he lost his family in the Sokovian incident. When I heard him say that line I was bewildered. If the director could have had a scene during the film in which we see maybe a Sokovain family grieving or something of that nature without making it obvious that this is the motivation behind the villain's actions then it would have held more weight and emotion when he revealed this to Black Panther. It would have been a shocking reveal but it just wasn't done right, Don't get me wrong I loved the idea that they built him up to be a man with an evil agenda when really he was just a man grieving for his family's loss that's a great idea it just could have been polished is all I'm saying, I know they hinted that concept when the viewers repeatedly saw him listening and re-listening to an audio message left in his inbox but that's why it's a nit-pick. The final Nit-pick is the final conflict between Iron man and the duo of Captain America and Bucky; in all the films shown Iron man has been seen duking it out with Thor and handling blows form the magic hammer Mjolnir (not that kind of hammer) as well as surviving tank blasts to the face with nothing but a scratch. He also has technology that can destroy tanks with a single missile fly as fast as or sometimes faster than any human piloted jet plus that beam in his chest is enough to blast back Thor and destroy robots like Ultron if pushed to its upper limits (and this is all from the films) so you could imagine that a fight even with to enhanced soldiers would be a piece of cake sure cap has his shield but Iron had in previous scene revealed a weak spot in captain Americas fighting style (simply titled ""go for his legs"") so Iron man should be able to take these two EASY!. However this being a captain America movie I expected them to depower Iron man in some way so that they could emerge victorious. And so as predicted they (cap and Bucky)emerged victorious EXECEPT yet again there is no explanation as to why Iron man hasn't used his bombs or chest beam  or why he didn't analyse the captains fight patterns (which he's uses far too late into the conflict which is weird considering Iron man is a bloody genius plus he knows that cap is superior when it comes to hand to hand combat) I mean he had just seen a video of winter solider Bucky Killing his parents  so he had all the motivation to kill Bucky. So why didn't he just bomb him? That's where PIS comes into play again and we are forced to watch Iron man with the entire previously listed skills struggle against two enhanced soldiers which doesn't seem right without an explanation. Other than those nit-picks the movie was everything Batman vs superman should have been in terms of story line (action sequences is a different matter), the director pieced this story together perfectly and as previously stated only focused on the important roles of the movie which is the two leads in Chris Evans and Robert Downey junior with minor threads here and there placed perfectly throughout the movie the inclusion of Spiderman was justified and explained enough as he didn't play a huge roll in the movie . and of course the humour in this movie shows that Marvel is solid when it comes to Family friendly movies. All in all great watch!."
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,This movie has a great plot and it's easy to understand. The most i like from this movie is the plot twist that make better story than the conflict one
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,The best Marvel movie I've seen yet and the best CBM I've seen in general.
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I was pretty underwhelmed by the last entry that Winter Soldier bobbins despite the high praise.  I was also a little put off by the eye watering number of  superheroes they've shoe-horned into this entry...you know what though, this is fun.  The plot is actually semi serious and won't have grown ups bored and/or cringing behind their hands.  The additional characters are actually fun and add some much needed light relief (despite myself I'm now actually looking forward to the new Spiderman film).  It all moves along at a nice clip as well.  It's not the best film you've ever seen, it doesn't move you like the new Star Wars film.  It is an enjoyable popcorn munching multiplex offering though."

Disney has the winning superhero movie formula and they should be raking in the dough as I see this one challenging even Star Wars: The Force Awakens in the box office totals. I cannot wait to see what's next with this story, because the bar has been raised, the tone has been set and it doesn't get any better than this action packed and hilarious movie for the whole family. So get your tickets quick! This will be sold out at every show!!"
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,an absolutely amazing movie . action pack . great story.  all around good movie . good job
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Great with every sides
I mean Cap's"
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I'll just cut to the chase directly. I didn't like Civil War. I'm too filled up of the emotions after watching the movie, that i don't care about properly editing this post and make it look good.

[SPOILER ALERT : spoilers ahead]

Problem with Civil War is that the actual reason that they wanted to show that resulted in forming two groups among Avengers got sidelined. It started with registration act, which should've been the actual reason, but then it got lost somewhere. Captain America and Iron Man were fighting against each other because of The Winter Soldier, who's Captain's best friend. He got framed for an attack, and in order to save him, Captain America got against Shield and Iron Man. That's one fine reason, and I can understand why Falcon was supporting Captain, as he's always on his side.

But then suddenly, Captain America's team recruited two new members - Hawkeye and Ant-Man. I don't understand what was driving them to fight with Captain America against Shield and Tony Stark. The reason of registration act was not mentioned again ever, and it became a revenge story for Tony stark to avenge his parents' death. Also, Spiderman's cameo is awesome and fun, but again he's just trusting Tony Stark and fighting against one of the most famous and disciplined hero - Captain America without any reason.

What would have been better was to keep the registration act the focus of the movie and thus the two groups, as was in the comics story line. What's strange is there were people who didn't like the reason for which Superman fought Batman in Batman Vs Superman, i.e. because his mother was taken hostage, but then same set of people justify the reason of saving one's best friends from Shield as a valid reason.

Well, i didn't like Civil War much, and i am really shocked that on the one hand this movie has a score of over 90% on rotten tomatoes, and on the other hand Batman Vs Superman: Dawn of justice is sitting at 26% rotten. Not even this, Civil war currently is in IMDB top 250 list (number 88)."
"May 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Despite being overstuffed with superfluous characters and story lines, ""Civil War"" manages to be one of the more entertaining Marvel films thanks to some fantastic action sequences,higher personal stakes and an exuberant amount of fan service."
"May 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Spettacolo!!!
Uno dei migliori film del MCU!"
"May 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It was such a disappointment. I fell sleep during this movie. After waiting that long, it was just waste of time and money."
"May 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This has an excellent story, an astounding cast, amazing visual effect, and exceptional direction."
"May 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"As a fan of films, comic books, and comic book films, I loved this movie. The characterisation of every character was perfect in my opinion and the fight choreography in some scenes was very impressive. The only quarrel I have with this film is yet another underutilized villain in Baron Helmut Zemo with him being used only as a plot device more than a well developed character. However this was remedied by the strong introduction of both Spider-man and Black Panther. Overall one of my favourite MCU films to date."
"May 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"At first, I had mixed emotions towards this film. Although the action sequences were great, the story seemed a little discombobulated at times in the beginning. A lot things were happening at once and they seem to not have the ability to pin point the main conflict. But, as the story goes on, the film gets better and better. The action scenes were euphoric, the dialogues were clever, and the story became rather personal and darker towards the end. But, my biggest issue with this film is that at times I feel rather disconnected with some characters like Black Widow, Hawkeye, and Falcon. Nonetheless, this is still a very fun and great action film to watch."
"May 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"2 1/2 ud af 5 vibraniumskjolde. Knap så røvkedelig som Age of Ultron, men den får allligevel  1/2 point mindre, fordi der stadig er for mange kokke om maden -- blandt andre Red Witch og Vision, som begge er inderligt overflødige. Ud med dem! Og så er der alt for meget snak, snak, snak! Superhelte skal ikke filosofere og konversere, men slå på tæven! Det sker også, men der kunne  sagtens klippes  1/2 time ud af dette samlebåndsprodukt, der ikke tilfører genren noget som helst nyt. Et lyspunkt er dog den nye Spider-man, som gør en lovende debut, men det trækker ned i min karakterbog, at Spideys søde, gamle, vindtørre tante May nu spilles af Marisa Tomei, som er alt, alt for sexet til den rolle."

"May 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Great movie outstanding fight scene, script, acting, and spider man was not some stupid hipster! Comic and super hero fans will enjoy this movie. Highly recommend to watch it in 3D."
"May 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Saw the premier, I can honestly say that this is what Batman v Superman SHOULD have been. Intense, powerful, with a strong message and action-packed throughout. Come on, DC, get your act together."
"May 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Not gonna lie. It's been about two hours since I got out of seeing Captain America: Civil War and my natural instinct upon thinking about it is to stand up and applaud. As the 13th film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe it does something borderline miraculous - it keeps things interesting. After twelve films of origin stories, team-ups, and intergalactic villains, the writers and directors of this latest adventure found a way to break the mold and keep things fresh in what is essentially the best Avengers film even though its officially a ""Captain America"" film.

I could probably writes pages and pages about why this flick stands out as Marvel's best film yet but I want to get you into theater seats as fast as possible so let's run through the baseline reasons faster than the dearly departed Quicksilver:

1. Variations on the Comic Book Movie Plot -
    Nine times out of ten, a comic book movie's plot is about as complex as the hero fighting against a new villain to save either the world or himself from certain destruction. This trope has slowly fallen out of favor in recent years and Civil War goes a long way to shattering it further by delivering a well-crafted plot that believably pits close friends against each other. This politically-charged change in storyline is loaded with thought-provoking parallels to our real world and now it just seems hard to imagine a good, old-fashioned ""stop the villain"" plot being as entertaining anymore.
2. Focus on the Story at Hand - 
One of my complaints about recent comic book movies is the trend toward spending an inordinate amount of screentime building up and teasing plotlines of future movies. And while there is certainly a little bit of that going on in Civil War, the main story never takes a backseat to it and as a result those little teases are shockingly welcome instead of being a distracting time filler!
3. A Worthwhile Villain -
There's no denying the fact that the Marvel Cinematic Universe has featured a bevy of relatively lackluster and forgettable villains (Loki excluded) but this is one instance where the villain shines through. As the mysterious Colonel Zemo, Daniel Brühl weaves an intricate web that turns our favorite heroes against each other without exotic makeup or flashy powers. Proves once again that there's nothing wrong with a little intelligent simplicity every now and then.
4. A Well-Balanced Screenplay -
    There are a lot of components and characters at play in Civil War and it would have been easy for all of it to spin wildly out of control, but major props must be given to screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely for keeping it all tight. They keenly juggle the complex mix of characters with a blend of seriousness, humor, and suspense without the film ever feeling like a mess. The effort is borderline award worthy. 
5. Solid Acting - 
Comic book movies rarely receive acclaim for the performances of their actors but dammit there's some really solid work here from everyone involved. Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. in particular give their best efforts yet as these characters and when these two pals violently come to blows you genuinely feel every punch.
6. Fast-Paced Direction -
Major kudos also need to be thrown in the direction of Joe and Anthony Russo who after showing surprisingly deft skills with The Winter Soldier prove they were born to direct comic book movies. Despite being jam-packed with characters and subplots these crafty brothers keep things moving at lightning speed without ever losing focus or clarity. I honestly can't wait to see what they do with The Avengers: Infinity War.
7. Humor -
A movie about good friends and allies being turned against one another and actually coming to blows would seemingly be a depressing and humorless affair, but holy hell - this movie is funny. Sure, there are painful moments but a good laugh is always around the corner to relieve the tension and keep things light. And while I don't believe that every comic book movie needs to have this much comic relief they really hit the nail on the head with it here and deliver a perfectly well-rounded film.
8. Spider-Man -
I mention humor above and hands down one of the big sources of that is from none other than everyone's favorite webslinger. With the most recent attempt at a Spider-Man film franchise running into the ground, Sony Pictures has wisely thrown a Hail Mary and teamed up with Marvel Studios to deliver what appears to be the definitive onscreen version of the character. Tom Holland absolutely nails the role of Peter Parker/Spider-Man with a percussive wit and loads of charm. Those out there who groaned at the prospect of yet another reboot of the character will find themselves panting with anticipation for Spider-Man: Homecoming to be released next year.
9. Black Panther -
Civil War boasts not one, but two character introductions that are about to blow audiences away. With significantly more screentime than Spider-Man we have Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther, a royal prince from the African nation of Wakanda who is thrown into the mix of the story on the hunt for revenge but ends up choosing sides in the war amongst the Avengers. Seeing Black Panther in action is an absolute thrill and I can't wait to see even more. 
10. The Airport Fight -
    Let's get one thing very clear. If you've ever giggled with glee at a superhero action sequence on screen, there is a scene in Civil War that will put you over the edge into a void pure joy. I will simply refer to this as the airport fight (trust me, you'll know it when you see) and it is BONKERS. It is where things truly come to a head with the entire cast of the movie and everyone gets at least one completely geektastic moment. And if you never thought much of Ant-Man before, I promise you he's going to leave a BIG impression.

So what are you waiting for? Get your ass to the theater!"
"May 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,Movie was ok!! But not great! The villain sucked like always... Tired of waiting for a good villain
"May 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,Captain AmÃ©rica films are always The best
"May 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Iron man is so pity...
this movie makes me sad :(
I want to see story about captain america."
"May 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,I really wanna see this...
"May 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"See ""Batman V Superman""? Marvel did what you tried to do, but it did it even better and schooled you in the process. It is possible to do a 'superheroes-at-odds-with-each-other' movie without having it be too grim, too convoluted or too draggy. And you can still introduce new characters for the sake of fan service as long as you integrate them into the plot in a smart way that doesn't seem like a desperately shoehorned footnote. This more than made up for the earlier disappointment that was BvS, and ended up being one of my favorite entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe so far."
"May 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"In the renewed battle between studio superhero film franchises, Marvel defeats DC in another round with their hardest punch yet, CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR. Extending their win streak begun with CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE WINTER SOLIDER, directing duo Joe and Anthony Russo raise the stakes in the Marvel Cinematic Universe once again, crafting a serious story, darker in tone than their first film and less political, placing the key conflict between Captain America (Chris Evans) and Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) in a global fight to define the true purpose of the Avengers as a unit.

Marvel's smartest move in unleashing this CIVIL WAR? The film is not an excuse to feed audiences more Avenger battles for sheer destruction sake like some superhero KING KONG VS. GODZILLA . . . or BATMAN V. SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE. This CIVIL WAR is a reckoning, the contentious summary of dynamic hit Marvel films and character arcs leading up to it. Marvel has now matured in its art and purpose far beyond Zach Snyder's dark fumblings that have laid waste to Metropolis with directorial ennui and dramatic emptiness.

In this third CAPTAIN AMERICA chapter, our supers are still paying the price for the moral and material destruction following THE AVENGERS' New York battle with Loki's alien army in an increasingly unstable world. Extending beyond Hydra's attempt to hijack Shield and the Avengers in WINTER SOLDIER and elevated above the internal Avenger bickering in AGE OF ULTRON, CIVIL WAR forces the Avengers to confront the reality of an Earth society now suspicious about the Avengers' unregulated power to inflict as much harm as they accomplish heroic good.

The Avengers - and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) in particular - are put on the spot from the opening scenes, in which such a mission of mercy in Lagos takes a tragic wrong turn. The U.S. Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross, played by William Hurt reprising his role from 2008's THE INCREDIBLE HULK as a tie-in from the pre-Disney Marvel universe, slaps the Sokovia Accords on the table, which demands the Avengers operate only under United Nations orders and jurisdiction. A superhero civil war among the Avengers begins: will they sign the accord and accept UN authority or refuse and exist as international outlaws?

Avoiding spoilers, it's safe to say (thanks to the film's posters) that Captain America and Stark land on opposite sides of this question, and alliances among the remaining Avengers form along these internal battle lines. Do the Avengers accept government authority and risk being corrupted by the political machinations evidenced in WINTER SOLDIER's intrigues, or does the team refuse world government oversight and take on personal responsibility for their combined actions? The beauty of the Avengers' answer, fought out over the bulk of the film, is that both choices have logical justification and practical faults in their effect. Further complicating the fight is the still-troubling presence of Bucky Buchanan (Sebastian Stan) glitching out in his Winter Soldier mode, dividing and testing Avenger loyalties and causes simultaneously. This civil war is one treacherous layer cake that is as delicious to the eyes as the minds of its audience.

Returning franchise screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely wisely prevent the heroes from quickly accepting one choice over the other, allowing this moral dilemma to play out in tense drama and gripping action between the Avengers as they fight for their beliefs. Drawn into this battle for the soul of the Avengers team are Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Rhodes/War Machine (Don Cheadle), the enigmatic Vision (Paul Bettany) and Sam Wilson/Falcon (Anthony Mackie), all adding their characters' specific viewpoints to this difficult choice, adding more depth and complexity to the story.

Just as wisely, Markus and McFeely remember to inject moments of Marvel brand humor into the mix with a brilliant tie-in from ANT-MAN, including a hilarious, applause-inducing effort by Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) in his updated supersuit. As you've seen from the trailer, Peter Parker returns to the Disney-led Marvel franchise in the form of Tom Holland, playing a young-yet-established Spider-Man eager to join the Avengers just as they're falling apart. Thank Simon and Kirby! The writers ignored Spidey's over-told origin story, streamlining both his development as a Disney/MCU character and hero that has Parker's alter-ego ready for new (and hopefully improved) adventures ahead. While a supporting character in the context of CIVIL WAR, this might be Spider-Man's best feature film incarnation to date, with due respect to Sam Raimi's original launch in 2002.

Yet CIVIL WAR's ultimate triumph may be its cinematic introduction of Black Panther, deftly and powerfully played by Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa, the future king of Wakanda. This African nation is MCU's source of vibranium, of which Cap's invulnerable shield was originally made by Howard Stark. Both Wakanda and T'Challa's father, King T'Chaka (John Kani), play an important role in the Sokovia Accords agreement and its political aftermath which incites the emergence of Black Panther onto the superhero scene. Spoilers avoided, Black Panther and T'Challa are well realized in CIVIL WAR and fully primed to make their solo feature film debut in 2018.

On that subject, there's still no ignoring the disappointment that a female Marvel hero won't make her solo film launch until CAPTAIN MARVEL in 2019. Once again Black Widow takes another one for the Avengers team in the MCU, despite recent entries including CIVIL WAR that repeatedly tap her leadership skills and character. At least Captain Marvel will add some much needed female perspective and participation to the Marvel film pantheon when she finally arrives, even if such starring presence is long overdue.

CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR exists spectacularly in the dramatic moment as much as it cleverly looks forward to extending the story (and box office success) of the MCU, whereas most action films barely accomplish the first feat. Far more focused and disciplined than the excessive AGE OF ULTRON while sacrificing none of that sequel's epic, global scale, the Russo brothers deliver fierce battles and teeth-gritting drama evenly and artfully. Lean and mean, but not without some organic laughs that befit the film's tone, CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR fulfills Marvel's ongoing contract to deliver top notch superhero entertainment worth the price and effort of seeing it in a theater upon release. If DOCTOR STRANGE is as smartly conceived and well-crafted when it mesmerizes audiences this November, 2016 will be a highly memorable and profitable year from Marvel and Disney.

FilmEdge rates CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR 4.5 stars out of 5."
"May 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This movie is a difficult movie to rate. At no point during the movie was I ever in an outrage but I went in open minded.

"May 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best Marvel Movie yet!!!
"May 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Airport scene alone gives it a 4 star from me, otherwise it'd be a 3 star."
"May 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War makes a great effort in trying to make a life-changing experience for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, making another more serious entry, but doesn't lack the fun from their formula."
"May 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I never liked the films of the captain america, (I've only been to see them once, normally I see movies I like 3 or 4 times) especially because I never really liked bucky barnes, he is too boring.. why he is not dead yet?? marvel kill great characters like Harry Osborn (raymi) or Pietro (age of ultrom) why? .. I think is time that bucky die, too many movies with this dude here, seriously.
anyway I only went to see this movie because Iron Man, he's so perfect and great, really I never thought I would love an superhero like him so much, but the actor fascinated me from the first movie, with their confidence and overwhelming security, since then, I never miss iron man films, so relatively broke my heart watching him suffer for his parents ..and all this.. seriously!! ..just, bucky deserves to die, kill bucky!..

spiderman on the other hand, he was so perfect, thank God! anyone have idea how much I detest the movie ""amazing spider man"" ..this guy..I does not even remember his name.., but Tom Holland! here! he did incredible and I have faith on a restart with Him, He is awesome, and conveys very well the funny point of his script, was one of the highlights of the movie, everyone was cool with their movements and laughed when he spoke, really impressive, the same with black panter .. dont know how he does, whether it will be the actor or the director of cameras, but seeing him actually makes you feel that you are in front of a king, very good, and the ant guy is too great xD I went to see his movie 3 times, it's just that I had never read his comics, so I cant remember his name, anyway his girlfriend is a female character whose personality seems much stronger and more serious than the black widow .. is a remarkable woman.

vision has great charisma, and yes .. I was very close to hate wanda, so .., vision is perfect, never change a vision! vision is the best! LOL .. anyway why??  captain america kiss A random girl? it was necessary? without that kiss, I would have given 5 stars to the movie, but as always dont know why everybody think that we like to see romance in a movie of super heroes, but fool yourselves, the new generation really hate the romance in the superhero movies, that takes away all the seriousness of this, someone saw batman vs superman ? well many of my friends only gave it 3 stars and some didnt like at all, just because superboy was  the entire film fooling around this girl .. lane .. Lol .. anyway, civil war was a very good movie .. if we remove this and that (random girl), spiderman was great..tony was great, vision was great,  but.. bucky deserves to die.. seriously just kill buckyl! xDD

and as for the romance, the antguy .. he is right with his girlfriend, they are the only couple so far of the entire marvel universe that I really liked, was horrible to see the whole mess with x-men old movies and wolverine, I didn't know that x-men was a novel until I saw them. fortunately brian singer did a good job with first class, DOF and hopefully it stays well in apocalypse.

so really, no more romance for the superheroes movies, please? at least they will a super badass couple like in the antman"

"May 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,This is the best superhero film since The Dark Knight. Now I'm just laughing my ass off at all the people who thought Tom Holland as Spider-Man was a bad casting choice. Black Panther was a very pleasant surprise.
"May 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War possesses some genuinely emotional moments. The conflict between Cap and Iron Man is compelling and engrossing, and seeing the former friends come to brutal blows makes for exciting, dramatic cinema. Yet there's a hollowness at work here that's hard to shake. Sure, Rogers and Stark are beating the crap out of each other, but we know it can't, and won't, really last. After all, there are more Avengers sequels to come - how long can these guys really stay mad at each other? There are no real stakes here, and this is a problem that is prevalent through all the MCU output. Had Captain America: Civil War focused more on the character conflicts,  delved further into Steve Rogers' stubborn commitment to his beliefs, and spent less time on Zemo and his dumb bad guy scheme, this might have ended up being the best Marvel film to date. Instead, it falls somewhere in the middle. It's entertaining, but so what? Captain America: Civil War should've changed the very fabric of the MCU. Instead, it's just more of the same. This is a cinematic universe long overdue for a new direction.

"May 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Villian does as Luthor but no charisma, then they force Spiderman in very badly, and then they add Spidey as a weaker superhero than Cap, and weak in general, also removing his Spider sense.

Spiderman has super strength relative to his spider and an incredible spidersense that makes him almost invincible, wether he has 17 or 13 years old. Some of the same issues as BvS, like too much stuffed, not enough charm, and ultimately does not impress the way people expected, just like BvS.

Ese afán de Marvel de investir a todos sus personajes con características bufonescas termina convirtiendo un conflicto serio y trascendente para la humanidad en una batalla de lo más ridícula."

"May 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR
Rating: 4/5
The film opens with and delightfully continues throughout to flaunt some of the most dazzling, if not dizzyingly-good fight scenes of recent superhero movies. From the Black Widow's precision acrobatics in the opening scene to the earth-moving brawn versus metal clashes between Captain America and Iron Man, this movie was chock-full of action, excitement, shiny metal and a bit of irrational emotion, which all combined is marvelous.
 
As expected, the top crowd-pleaser was the reveal of Peter Parker/Spider-man, rousing hearty applause throughout the theater. Tom Holland is very promising - he's youthful, talkative, brainy and fun-loving - exactly what a young Spidey should be. Almost equally thrilling was the inclusion of Ant Man (and who doesn't love Paul Rudd?!) These choices including the introduction of the Black Panther, while somewhat of an excessive and shameless prelude to future films, presented a smorgasbord to satisfy any superhero fan's appetite alongside good but unsurprising scripting and a perfect balance of violence, emotional tension and worthwhile laugh-out-loud humor, making it far supersede its predecessor, the infantile Age of Ultron. 

The movie is centered on the conflict which arises when the Avengers are forced to address the ethics of vigilantism and their role in the loss of innocent lives while trying to save others, which the King of Wakanda pointed out, is no heroism at all. It is rare to have this issue brought up in the comic universe but while other fans may disagree, I found the subtle intersection between the real world and the comic book world to be smart, especially in these actual times and the changing perspectives of audiences who are more sensitive to such topics.
 
The division among the Avengers pertaining to the signing of the Sokovia Accords (giving the U.N. control over their work) sparks a whole lot of brilliant, unbridled violence which all seems pretty senseless in the end since the Cap and Iron Man manage to make it clear that they are still buds and proves that the Avengers are simply incapable of having non-violent discourse, even among themselves. Without delving into the matter too much, I also want to side note the ironies of Captain America, an officer of the U.S. Army, is opposed to being regulated by a governing body whereas Tony Stark, a weapons-manufacturing entrepreneur is suddenly on-board the idea of being regulated after spending most his life trying to keep his technologies out of the hands of government. No biggie, it's just kind of funny.

Captain America: Civil War is not a carousel-ride of a movie. It's a high speed, double-looping roller-coaster, meaning it's a busy movie but not so much so that the viewer cannot be perfectly engaged, follow the story and have a rockin' good time. This starkly compares to rival DC's long-winded Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice. Bringing comic books to life on screen is a difficult task and CA: CW makes a perfect effort to do so."
"May 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,Super buena fue todo lo que esperaba y mucho mas!
"May 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,Saw it tonight and have to say it was very enjoyable.  I will be seeing it again.
"May 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,Great Superhero Movie!
"May 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"AMAZING action, good story and a all around super cool movie.


This version of the Civil War story aka Captain America vs. Iron Man deals more with the Winter Soldier than with the registration of all heroes. Captain America and his team try to stop Crossbones in Wakanda (Black Panthers stomping ground) and end up killing bystanders. The government no longer want them to act unauthorized and with S.H.I.E.L.D not in the picture they have no official status anymore. General Ross has ordered all members of the Avengers to sign an ""Accord"" to let the government decide on when the Avengers should operate. Meanwhile the Winter Soldier is being held captive by an evil organization and has had his programming reactivated to assassinate. Steve tries to catch Bucky on his own with his team but end up crossing hairs with The Black Panther and the government by not signing the ""Accords"" and acting alone.


They may have changed the Civil War story up a bit but the story they used worked very well. The real Civil War story has soooo many players involved making to where the task of putting a movie like that in place would be almost impossible without several installments being at least 3 hours long. Also with the movie rights issues it took an unnecessary long time to get Spider-Man to finally play along with the Avengers where he belongs. This rights problem also includes The Fantastic Four, X-Men and quite a few others that we can only hope to see back with Marvel for proper team-ups.

The action was top notch and superbly done. The hits were hard hitting and unlike the DC vs. movie that came before it, the action is clear to see without alot of darkness and shadows to cover up blurry CGI. The martial arts was on point and the suspense had you on the edge of your seat. That being said it was soooo good to see Black Panther in the marvel movies finally. Black Panther was snapping and was no joke as he should be. Chadwick Boseman did him justice. Elizabeth Olsen surprised me a bit with her portrayal of Wanda in this because she was really good and better than she was in Ultron. You found yourself rooting for her a bit. They did a good job showing how powerful she is and how sometimes her powers can be hard to control as well. The story was easy to follow and well thoughtout to setup for the next installments for my boy Black Panther and the new Spidey. I really like the new younger teenage Spidey. Tom Holland nails the young inexperienced Spider-Man as he joins Tony's side to fight these veteran super powered heroes. The suit is very different from what we have seen but it is pretty cool. I will admit he did look like a big CGI character the whole time but still everything still fit together and he held his own beautifully. Every character had a purpose as well. You would think with all these players involved someone would be there just to have fans say, ""cool look, there's so and so"" but everyone had their place and had cool stuff to show off. Black Widow did the most fighting in this than all the movies she has been in combined. She was fierce. Chris Evans as always was on point as Captain America. His fight scenes always get better and this was the best yet. There was so much to like about this movie. You have to wonder how in the world is DC going to truly get their momentum with the new DC universe they have started to give us continuity and films that are not so split when it comes to fans and general public enjoying them. They are hoping to change the flow a bit with Suicide Squad and I wish them all the best but as we all know, they have a lot of catching up to do. Especially with the installment of Batman v. Superman leaving a lot of questions more than answers that you hope is explained sooner than later, something really needs to give. Not only were the scenes visually stunning but they took enough care to give you some classic iconic scenes or images from the pages of the comic book. Well Done!


Once again, I say this is a great movie! Winter Soldier was the best Marvel movie we have had so far. This one is even better.Â 

Definitely worth watching more than once or twice

Highly enjoyable for the whole family."
"May 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Another clean, well-executed installment. Spider-Man and Ant-Man are the standouts here, while Bucky continues to be kind of plain bagel. Couldn't help but feel it was missing another dimension to it, after the film acknowledges the similar destructions in every Marvel movie's climax, this one isn't wholly different."
"May 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Thats just good
the plot is amazing 
the twist twisted me
spider man in mcu 
EVERYTHING IS GREAT!"
"May 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War is bold, innovative and altogether refreshing. Impressively switching between character-driven dialogue development, all-to-the-wall action scenes and a depth to a war and conflict that others could only dream of (looking at you, Batman vs Superman), Civil War is impressive because of what is at stake and what we know lies ahead. It wins by building to this point thirteen episodes into its Universe run and offering more for the audience to invest themselves in - there is no winners, or losers, or good people or bad people as such, just individuals with different approaches, opinions and emotions and Civil War wins by accepting each of these and exploring them in thought-provoking and progressive ways. I genuinely do not know where this Avengers unit is going next and as long as Marvel do not hit the reset and send everything back to being peachy keen, they will have myself and many others beside them for the journey.

Make sure you let me know what you thought of the film and share your opinions in the comment section!"
"May 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"A.K.A. Avengers 2  1/2. While calling this Captain America is a bit of a cheat as it involves almost everyone from the Avengers series and carries on directly dealing with the consequences from the resolution in the last Avengers movie, it is the style of writing and directing that put it in the same vein as the Capt. America strands of films: more hand to hand combat, less CGI explosive annihilations and the focus is more on relationships and emotional interactions between the characters - and all the better for it. If The Winter Soldier is a 70s conspiracy film, this one belongs to the ""someone's been framed and need to prove his innocence"" genre. The script keeps it simple and wisely do not see the need to shoehorn a new villain into the already bloated cast list. There is still the problem of finding a dramatic arc (no matter how small) for everyone - though they manage it just about without messing up either the main narrative or stopping the movie dead on its tracks. The introduction of even more characters from the MCU for future franchises is less sledgehammer-like, and in fact, helps elevate the darkness and solemnity the old Avengers found themselves in and that lightness and joy are the key and major difference between this film and another recent superhero mashup. It also makes some of the narrative contrivances bearable, for this is by no means a perfect film, but given both the disappointment and down-right hostility the audience had for recent films from both DC and Marvel, anything vaguely resembling a half decently made and thought out film that is actually enjoyable and fun to spend 2.5 hrs with, feels like a breeze of much needed fresh air, blowing away the cobwebs left behind by both Bats and Ultrons alike."
"May 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Good fun. Things blow up. Some scenes are repeated a little too often in case you didn't get it the first time. Which is nice because you could literally watch this while unconscious and enjoy it. Slightly too long but just remember not to have to large drink and that should not dampen your enjoyment. The only thing that detracted from my enjoyment at all was the blatant propaganda and the often clumsy product placement. But then, this is Captain America, propaganda is the point I suppose.

Critics say it explores thought provoking themes. If putting your socks on in the morning is a mental challenge then this will be a thought provoking film for you. Enjoy.

For me one of the most thought provoking parts was the airport that had exclusively Airbus A340s in it. They're not even that common! I like them though."
"May 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,it's awesome of marvel cinematic universe of all time and this now !!....
"May 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,the best movie in the mcu
"May 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Most amazing film I have ever seen. Stunts, actors, story, emotion. Everything was absolutely on point. Well done to all."
"May 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War knocked me off my feet. Just when I thought that it would be difficult for Marvel to outperform itself, I was pleasantly shocked. Not only is this the best in the Captain America series, I dare say, this is the best of the Avengers/Marvel Universe. The screenplay, directing, and of course, the casting, takes another notch in distinction. There's nothing more thought provoking than a powerful story of redemption, friendship, honour, nobility and justice, especially when principles collide. The quiet run-up fuels the final act, which will blow you away. Saying more would only lead to spoilers. A MUST WATCH."
"May 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"its a good movie where all the elements are in the right place tony's emotion in the final fight is mind blowing,  the only thing i hated is all the action is already on the trailers, teasers and tv spots so no biggie i guess but its a must watch movie."
"May 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Serious subject matter with perfect amount of humor to balance.  If they would have just called this Avengers 3, then it would have been the best Avengers movie by a mile.  They incorporated new characters without feeling like overload in Ultron.  They finally got Spider-Man right."
"May 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"THis is what Age of Ultron should have been. The Russo brothers demonstrate again they are the premier Marvel guys (Gunn has to show he can duplicate his success) with their ability to juggle action, large cast, humour and all the other staples of a Marvel film. They extend their amazing fight choreography of Captain America to the whole avengers team making everyone look good - even Falcon. They also just manage to keep it a film centred on Captain America although Stark comes in close second and arguably goes through more development. The majoir downside is some ridiculous plotting and this year's superhero obsession with not talking (in this one they do but not about the obvious things that prevent a fight). We have to accept that both Captain America and especially Stark are just being stubborn illogical douches for the feud to continue. Zemo could have been an interesting villain (expertly played by Danile Bruhl) if it weren't for the fact that his moustache twirling plan makes no sense and relies entirely on co-incidence to pan out. Fortunately the Black Panther's debut works far better and makes more sense bringing something different to superheros. Spider-man's debut is fun but his entire presence feels tacked on (probably because he was added to the film late in development). He works well in a crowd and comes off genuinely young, however they need to work on making him not seem like a cartoon in costume - I often felt like he was entirely CGI. Ant-man is surprisingly strong as a team player and gets some of the best action scenes. All in all it's the best Marvel film since Guardians of the Galaxy and hopefully they have things back on track since Age of Ultron."
"May 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,Very good movie Spider-Man /Peter Parker is spot on and how he is introduced is even better than I thought it was going to be.
"May 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Aside from traditional fight between good and evil, the modern superhero genre has been dominated by three major themes: The struggle against inner self/to find true self (Nolan's ""Batman"" trilogy, Singer's ""X-Men""), anti-hero antagonists (""Spiderman 2""), and the philosophical question ""Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?"" - ""Who will guard the guards themselves?"" (""Watchmen""). It seems that ""Civil War"" tried very hard in all three aspects, with not much results except for some entertaining fighting sequences and a confusing climax. It really was a pity that the surprisingly deep theme of ""Who watches the watchmen"" at the beginning of the film was gradually replaced with the ever-boring story of a pseudo struggle against one's self of the superheroes with a Marvel-ish ending that shows the script's lack of depth, or the laziness of the writers, or the disregard of the audience's intelligence, or a combination of all three. Moreover, despite its epic name (""Civil War""), the film did not feel ""epic"" at all with the fight between twelve superheroes appeared to be lopsided, poorly coordinated, and confusingly edited (the filming and editing were so confusing that ""Civil War"" reminded me of the infamous fighting sequences in the ""Transformers"" series where no one can understand ""what the hell is happening""). Of course, ""Civil War"" had sequences that were very well choreographed and executed, but they mostly involved a small group of characters and thus felt pretty disconnected from the ""bigger picture"" of the ""Civil War"". In this respect, ""Civil War"" is even less impressive than the much more criticized ""Batman vs. Superman"", where the feeling of epicness (""terribilità"") prevailed despite the poor control of the storyline.The disconnection was also apparent in the timeslot reserved for each character, with Iron Man and Captain America had so many more emotional and memorable sequences and lines that the rest of the cast seemed to just line up in the far corner of the storyline in the size of an ""ant man"". And yet, if one tries to stitch those emotional moments together, one will see that there is no connection between them either, thus, by the end, the film with so many memorable scenes seemed to be so unmemorable (or at least it had the audience ""try to remember"" only to miserably fail to do so - ""Try to Remember"" is a key song in the film). All in all, an entertaining yet forgettable film - a new pinnacle of the ""McMarvel"" model. (Spider-man's much-anticipated appearance did not help either, since he was as annoying as his ""counterpart"" Ant-Man was despite lengthy on-screen time)."
"May 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This is good, I enjoy most of it."
"May 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"despite being a giant cosplay fight, really enjoyable.  Better than Ultron but not as good as winter solider."
"May 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Saw the movie its way over hyped infact i dont understand why every one is praising it so much air port scene is ok its good but not like u have not seen this before, few say that its the best action scene they should see some action movies its no where as good as they say but yes a nice movie"
"May 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,IT'S LIT! ð??¥ð??¥ð??¥ð??¥ð??¥
"May 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The best movie on the MCU, Captain America: Civil War has a lot of heart and humour but it's not without it's darker moments and more serious themes. The movie for me is as good as The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises."
"May 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"A really great movie, that at the same time is a sequel to Captain America: The Winter Soldier and a continuation the the MCU, We see more of Cap and Tony, Spider-man is great and I am waiting to see his stand alone movie, Black Panther is wise and really great, the characters are so well fleshed out. In conclution this movie is a blast amazing."
"May 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best Marvel movie to date! I was blown away by the plot twists and action sequences. The Russo brothers came through again.
"May 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,spider man saved the show
"May 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Great movie its nice when a company knows how to bring multiple char. together in a cohesive movie, also thank you Marvel for giving us true fans a epic to wash that liver flavored dibacle BvsS"
"May 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"So.... It's ok.  Given the hype, probably expected more.  Felt a little bit crowded and a pity some of the heroes had little other than cameos.  Captain America / Steve Rogers came across as very annoying and a bit of a dick.  Not sure about Tom Holland"
"May 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"O K- this went on a bit, but that seems par for the course these days. Loads of references to other parts of the overall story which I realise I'm not remembering, but full of great stuff :)"
"May 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Marvel have again created a fun, kinetic and smart addition to its' world of mega heroes. The central fight is the most creative yet in the Captain/Avenger series, with Antman stealing the show. However, the Marvel universe has still yet to create that real sense of 'stake' or invested empathy, which ultimately leaves you less engaged in the pivotal scenes or the key players involved."
"May 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"A cracking good film, tho was more of an Avengers film than a Captain America film. Had just the right blend of humour, drama and action. Loved the new members, Antman fit right in as did Spiderman (Tom Holland was great), and the Black Panther was a very cool new supe addition. Can't help feeling tho that if they'd just sat down at the beginning and discussed it they could have just frozen Bucky straight away and saved a lot of trouble. Thought Robert Downey Jnr was class in this and his emotions were very believable. I was Team Ironman before the film and I'm still Team Ironman!"
"May 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,An absolute joy to watch from beginning to end! The Climatic fight between Iron Man and Captain America left me in awe!
"May 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,absolutely awesome movie! the best super hero ever made!
"May 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,Awesomeness!  Black Panther was my favorite!
"May 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Very worth the time. Entertaining, solid, more than acceptable. Of course, the movie have certain downside, but not anything too damaging the the movie cant recover from"
"May 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,A righteous & worthy sequel to Winter Soldier. Best motorcycle stunt I've seen in years.
"May 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"No puedo con buena conciencia recomendar esta pelÃ­cula. Es mÃ¡s de lo mismo Vengadores. Nada espectacular, sÃ³lo una pelÃ­cula aburrida insulsa. No entiendo las crÃ­ticas que van ga ga sobre esta pelÃ­cula no-maravilloso."
"May 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,All I can say ....TOTALLY AWESOME!  Although at 2:17:49 some parts were a little slow although necessary to build the story.  A very complex story that pits pretty much everyone in the Avenger universe against one another.  Fight scenes are awesome!  Marvel did it right and definitely built upon the whole superhero movie genre.
"May 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,This movie is 300 times better than Batman v Superman (which I don't recommend). I also think this is the best marvel movie ever made.
"May 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,Biggest load of crap going. Annoyed as wasted my money and time. The layout is to complicated and just a jumble of overrated crap
"May 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,good action like you would expect
"May 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,weak ass villian like always..
"May 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,Lutinha lutinha lutinha lutinha piadinha lutinha lutinha lutinha e 500 personagens esquecíveis... Patético.
"May 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best movie in the MCU
"May 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best superhero movie EVER!
"May 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America is a fun, action-packed superhero movie with a solid plot and interesting new characters as well as old, revisited characters."
"May 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War  is one of the most famous movie i've ever watched in the movie theater !!!! How nice, The Russo Brothers ^_^"
"May 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"As a superhero movie goes it's not bad but as a movie - its storytelling is just as predictable as. But as anything that's supposed to be slightly more complex for the easily impressionable American mind, I'd say bravo!"
"May 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,best Marvel movie to date!
"May 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,http://cinephilecrocodile.blogspot.co.uk/2016/04/captain-america-civil-war-dir-russo.html
"May 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This movie, while filled with style and action. Moves from action scene to action scene with little reason or thought. I wasn't expecting an intelligent movie but I feel Marvel has lost a lot of its magic."
"May 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,This film is everything you want to see in a Comicbook movie. So many good parts needs to be seen multiple times!
"May 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Esta buena la película, spiderman me gusto bastante y pantera negra impecable. En cuanto al trama esta regular, me parece muy forzada, demasiado chiste y humor en momentos serios rompe la tensión.
Las peleas son buenas pero a mi criterio le falta mas dark (oscuridad y seriedad ). Es una película que carece de tema adulto y parece dedicada a un publico joven-adolescente.
A mi parecer hay demasiados chistes y bromas que no permiten que se construya la tensión que la película pretende tener. se pelean los superheores pero siguen siendo amigos, WTF? Realmente la película no logra venderte la idea de que en realidad estén tomando bandos, sino que simplemente pelean porque deben de hacerlo, solo porque si.
En comparación, es mucho mejor BatmanVSuperman DC Comics en este Round si gana porque sabe construir suspenso y seriedad al mismo tiempo que te entretiene y te manteniene atento en cada escena. La Batalla en Civil War se desarrolla en un aeropuerto vacío (Que conveniente!) y esto es para satisfacer a los críticos que lapidaron a BatmanVSuperman y Man of Steel debido a la destrucción de la ciudad donde batallan. El Villano de la película no tiene razón de ser y su trama es muy forzada, después de que la emoción termina quedas con expectativa ya que el main Plot no te satisface.
Es lamentable que los críticos le den 95% a Civil War y reprueben BatmanVSuperman con 29%
En fin Civil War es una película entretenida y les recomiendo que la vean, en lo personal me quedo con  Captain America Winter Soldier.
Nota: 7.9/10"
"May 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,Simplesmente sensacional!
"May 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I've watched Captain America: Civil War twice already. It was an experience as strong as the first Avengers and overall I liked it lots; phenomenal acting, editing, strong dialogues, it never feels forced in spite of the massive character list...; it certainly deserves the hype, but it will surely not please as much hardcore Captain America: The Winter Soldier fan, though.

*SPOILERS AHEAD*

The film is half a Captain America film and half an Avengers one. I did want to watch a very down to earth thriller with a serious tone, which it has at the beginning and at the end of the film, but the middle part with the fighting scene, which is awesome by itself, is basically an Avengers movie just sprinkled there.
Granted, even if it is out of place, it doesn't feel like it and it manages to come organically, but it does take away the urgency and blurs the main theme of the film just when it needed to remain present; the flaws within are what will divide and make all fall if you are not aware of them. I think this has led to write off Zemo as some stupid villain, and I am not saying he was an evil mastermind. That was the point. He only had to focus the attention of the Avengers to the flaws of their team mates, but in an effort to build the big fight fan-service scene, this plot point was made too complicated and blurry to work properly.
I like to call this plot point cramming the Game of Thrones Complex; the medium falls short when you have to show so many arcs, it makes the momentum of the original arc to evaporate. From episode to episode in Got when you first gain the momentum from a couple of arcs and in the next episode you don't follow them up and it gets lost because the attention is shifted in to different arcs with different characters. Both GoT and Civil War do a decent job managing this, don't get me wrong, but the only way to achieve the level of intensity The Winter Soldier had, you need to focus with Captain America´s story. Scenes and transitions can only do so much, like a comic book page. My analogy is, when War Machine hits the ground is like when Ned Stark loses his head in Got; after that, you have pretty much lost the impact from the walkers plot. I would rather have a story punch me in the face than pinch me like a mosquito.
Also, like Age of Ultron's source of intelligence, the main narrative makes no sense since the Avengers were sanctioned by SHIELD and a panel of international leaders in every event they mentioned except Lagos. The Sokovia pact or whatever is basically what they have been doing most of the time, and it was imperative for us to know what's up with Fury's SHIELD after Ultron to better develop the conflict in this film. That was a BIG NO-NO, like The Amazing Spider-Man 2's story structure.
And even though all the action scenes are superb, sometimes the Crank-like shaky cam took away from them.
I also didn't like Tom Holland as Peter Parker, and his scene was the lowest point in the movie. I did like him as Spidey, though I still prefer Garfield (he was just so perfectly Ditko)."
"May 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This is what a super hero movie is all about. Amazing story telling, epic cast with some good humor in the fold."
"May 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best movie experiance  for comic book fans as well as a casual movie watchers.
"May 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"very sketchy plot line that takes you to the end wondering why you waisted so much time coming to that conclusion, extremely obvious when scenes have been blended with CGI with a low frame rate and blur. black panther GCI had no sense of weight to it and was noticeably broader in the chest than the real life actor in costum. black widow looked great though!"
"May 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,simply amazing a must see
"May 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,This is all sorts of terrible.
"May 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,probably the best marvel movie to date
"May 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Nothing original in Civil War.  

All the superhero movies are getting very repetitive.  First there's Batman vs. Superman, which in my opinion was way too long and a snore.  Now we have Civil War.  

To be fare this is a better movie and bound to do well at the Box Office. It appears that you really have to lay an egg to lose money as these type of movies are very hot right now,  Hence all the ""me too"" movies are coming out at the same time."
"May 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best Marvel film so far
"May 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best superhero movie that I ever seen
"May 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Didn't live up to the hype, predictable storyline and at times the movie was slow and boring."
"May 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Recently I have quite liked the Marvel movies that I have watched. Sadly I did not like this movie at all. The only reason that it does not get a zero or one star rating is cool special effects and a few laughs.

I want my heroes to be just that, heroes. Unfortunately this movie gets off on the wrong foot right away by not only ""incriminating"" the Avengers in the eyes of dimwit politicians and putting them on surveillance of a political body but to make matters worse it is the useless black hole of taxpayers money, the United Nations, that are supposed to surveil them. That pretty much ruined the movie right away for me.

When I though that it could not get any worse it actually does. In true Hollywood fashion the Avengers start to bicker and fight among themselves.

The few redeeming qualities of this movie is great special effects and a few fun comments that made me laugh from time to time. Even the ending is pretty crappy with the Avengers remaining divided and the main bad guy feeling that he achieved what he wanted.

Technically there is not really anything wrong with the movie. The actors are good, the filming is good and, as I wrote, the special effects are great. The story however is not my cup of tea to put it mildly. I cannot express how much I despised the story in this movie."
"May 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain Americca: Civil War continues the stories of Winter Soldier and Age of Ultron and proves that Marvel are head and shoulders above DC.  The plot is not too dissimilar to the Batman vs Superman, in this instance pitting Iron Man agaomst fellow Avenger Captain America.  But where BvS failed in both it's ability to deliver a film with coherent plot, special effects and introduction of new characters, Civil war succeeds.  

After and incident in Africa which kills many innocent civilians, the Avengers are asked to be made accountable for their actions and sign a treaty putting them under government control which divides the Avengers.

Where BvS was a really slog to sit through, this is extreamly fast paced and the actions scenes some of the best committed to film.  I've already seen this twice and it was a thrill ride each time.

As well as having the likes of Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and  from Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) from previous Marvel movies the film also introduces two new characters in the form of Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Spider-Man (Tom Holland) and they don't feel shoehorned in for the sake of it and will be hood additions to the MCU.  Especially Spider-Man who seems revitalised after the disastrous Amazing Spider-Man outings."
"May 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,Superb. Team Captain America
"May 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,Wow! So good. It's almost as good as the Winter Soldier. I love all the scenes with Spiderman. Now I can't wait to see his movie.

"May 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Amazing movie, highly recommend, it can't wait for the other one"
"May 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,"They wrote Spiderman perfectly, it had jokes, and it got REAL. Really real. I was not disappointed. Once again, Marvel makes another amazing Captain America movie."
"May 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The first MCU Movie after ""The Incredible Hulk"" that went deeper and darker than the usual ""light-hearted"" and humorous Marvel movies.
The movie makes you question throughout the whole movie which one of these opposing parties is in the right.
You don't have a simple evil villain that needs to be taken care of and everyone walks away laughing after the job is done.
No. Brothers and Sisters are fighting against each other.
And Civil War is doing a really good job at portraying how everything isn't just black and white.
You see these people who fought alongside in many battles fight over their ideologies, cheer and grief with them. It isn't a movie in which the studio tries to make two iconic Marvel characters fight each other just because of the purpose of...well...fighting each other. You care about these characters and you can relate to their stance.
A movie packed with emotions and probably the best action scenes a superhero movie has ever put on the big screen."
"May 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Zack Snyder take note, this is how a super hero should be done. Marvel have produced yet another hit, how do they keep doing it? I must admit the film took a little while to get going for me but when it did it was truly fantastic. The film has many characters but it handles them all really well. None of them seemed like they were shoehorned in like Wonderwoman in Batman v Superman. My only real criticism and it's a small one but I felt the new Spiderman looked too computer generated. 

You can expect to see the usual mix of great action, impressive fighting and wisecracks that Marvel films deliver so well. This film simply blows Batman v Superman out of the water. I look forward to what the new X-Men film has to offer!"
"May 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,"An excellent addition to the franchise, a lot of emotion involved, believing in both sides of the argument, and the constant thought of ""I just want them all to be friends again!!!!"""
"May 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Capitán América: Civil War. It was everything I thought and a little bit more.
Perhaps it should have not been called Civil War. The brief appearence of spider Man in one word was AWESOME!! Iron Man was way too cool again, better than ever, his character evolved through all the films and that was really awesome. Black panther insanely magnificent. In some parts of the movie I was TeamCap, but the 80% I was TeamIronMan. I feel that Steve Rogers progress between movies is kind of poor and disappointing. But the whole package of the movie was really entertaining. It is action packed, it is fun packed and like no other marvel movie before, it had the courage to show us the consecuences of the heroes actions and decisions."
"May 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Esta pelicula no debió llamarse civil war, fue una pelea intrascendente y con motivos que una buena charla entre personas inteligentes pudo solucionar, Pantera, Falcon, Antman, el Cap, Vision y Scarlet se lucieron pero Spiderman me dejó desilusionado por como le faltaron el respeto a mi héroe favorito de marvel, Ironman intenta hacer el trauma del huerfano de una manera muy llorona y no se,  Spidey, Ironman y el villano me dejaron muy enojado."
"May 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Dizer que os Russo mudaram a maneira de enxergarmos uma estética de filmes baseados em quadrinhos depois do excelente Winter Soldier, é redundância.
Mas, o fato é que, com Civil War, a dupla atingiu um nível jamais visto nas escalas de herói vs. herói e, com um roteiro invasivo que não se deixa ser cartunesco em momento algum, a dupla cria momentos que são impossíveis de se descrever, tirando de seus expectadores, diversos ""Meu Deus!"".
Civil War abre um parâmetro inigualável para tudo o que vier pro gênero, a partir de agora.
E coitado de quem vier, agora."
"May 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,I was expecting more. It was a bit slow for my liking ...
"May 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,A truly epic film from Marvel. Can't wait for the Bluray.
"May 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,"All the characters, from the ones starring in their 6th picture, to the ones making their MCU debut, are well employed and organically implemented, for the most part. The film sets a new tone and status quo for the 3rd phase of the MCU, and left me begging to see what happens next. It'll be a while, unfortunately, until we can catch up with these characters again. Overall, a huge payoff for those following the MCU, at least the Earth-based characters, and their adventures so far."
"May 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,Avengers 2.5...the Cap narrative seems to be the one that gets better each time. It holds enough heart and one of the best standoffs in cinema.
"May 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,great movie. worth your money. I'd watch it again.
"May 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Fantastic fight choreography, great effects, fantastic cast... but seriously, where was the plot? Would someone truly abandon their friends and comrades to rescue someone they know is a dangerous killer, who they haven't actually seen for 50 odd years? Maybe they would, but I found it simplistic and unconvincing. And really, black widow fighting hawkeye because... reasons? The majority of the film felt like a 6 year old boy's fantasy and lacked the witty script of previous marvel films. Spiderman's entrance brought some mild humour but overall it felt like a cheap way to cram as many superheroes as possible into a tedious two and a half hours."
"May 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,"To many things going in to be a true Captain America squeal. This it's a Avengers spin-off and it doesn't disappoint, it just breaks up the main plot between Cap"
"May 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,I have watched it twice. it's awesome!
"May 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,"*LONG REVIEW*

After 3 days and 2 showings, I can now finally write a hopefully objective review (because yes, I am a Marvel fan)! 

I couldn't decide if I liked this better than the first Russo brothers film, The Winter Soldier because after the first viewing, I felt like Civil War's plot had gaping holes. I actually didn't like the first part of the film with the whole Avengers starting in medias res once again. I felt like I missed watching the first episode of a TV show. Winter Soldier's narrative was just stronger. The movie was fresh on its take as more of an espionage thriller than a superhero movie and with the surplus of superhero movie, your basic viewer could easily get bored. 

Superhero movies now have the great task of trying to think out of the box to please average film goers and at the same time, cater to the dreams of every fanboy. It's not easy but the Russo brothers have done it. So I have decided that I liked Winter Soldier's narrative but I liked the heart and soul of Civil War more. 

I don't really read a lot of comics but I was fortunate to have read Mark Millar's Civil War and that was one of the stories that changed my way of how I see superhero comics. When they announced that they'd be doing this storyline, I was actually surprised but also very happy. How could they do this without all the other characters and what about the superhero registration act? Will it look like The Incredibles on the big screen? Thankfully though, while the Russo brothers changed the storyline, they were able to maintain its key elements, In a stroke of genius, instead of the Superhero Registration act, we have the Sokovia Accords that basically confines the Avengers under the rule of the United Nations. And the best thing is that you get the agreement. You get why Tony Stark is for this and you get why Captain America's against it. Now I don't want to compare it to BvS but I need to because this is the glaring difference between the two movies. You cared what the characters were fighting for and you're thrown in this area of gray. It's very political and it is hard to choose a side.

In the aspects of ""war"" theme, it isn't as grandiose as the one in the comics (hello, no Hulk and Thor) but boy do they have one of the best action sequences for ensemble and one-on-one (or one-on-two). Ensemble because they aren't fighting villains, they're fighting amongst themselves so it was a joy to see how each character will play their strengths and weaknesses. We also have NEW characters in Black Panther/T'Challa splendidly played by Chadwick Boseman (spot on accent! To think he has an African-American voice). I checked his interviews and I cannot believe how out of character T'Challa is for Chadwick but he nailed it being a super fighter regal prince. That mid-credits scene is such a huge nod to his standalone movie as well. Antman's involvement is solid but I felt that he should have thought more on why he joined Team Cap but it was so awesome to see ANOTHER side of antman. I never expected that they'd err reveal him through Antman but holy cow, THEY DID! <3 #fangirls

And come on, the Russo brothers and Tom Holland gave us the Spiderman that the fans deserved. A lot of regular viewers must be confused by now because of 3 Spiderman iterations but trust me, when I tell you that Tom Holland is Peter Parker, HE IS PETER PARKER. If you watched the animated series or even the latest comics now, he is that nerdy smart kid that we've all been waiting for. Tom has the body type, the personality and the flexibility for it (he is a frigging gymnast!). His British accent never once appeared and I'm sold for it. I AM SOLD. He has one of the best fight scenes as well. And yes, Benjamin Button-ing Aunt May is awesome. They're both awesome.

Can we please give a standing ovation to the stunt coordinators and visual effects team? I want to give them a high five and just tell them, YOU GUYS DID AN AWESOME JOB. Please give tons of recognition to these guys.

Though I didn't enjoy some of the CGI in this film. It felt... odd at some points.

Now why does it have full of heart? Because of that last d*mn scene. If you read Civil War, they actually pulled out a panel straight from the comic and right into the screen. It was one of the best moments in the film and I feel like I need a poster of that scene. The last scene culminates Phase 2 and triggers the start of Phase 3. We have divided friends and after learning about some very important fact (which I cannot say), goes head on and the final battle is worthy of the title Civil War. The movie gives weight to each character's loyalty, friendship, allegiance and philosophy. The Martha moment in BvS could have been done so much better if they saw how Civil War handled theirs. There is a Martha moment as well, in the sense we see the vulnerability and humanity of our characters and the Russo brothers just played it out so beautifully with Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr at the helm. Go into this film with no expectations on the villain because even if we have Daniel Bruhl as Baron Zemo, he isn't the one in the comics. Just go in and watch a family fall apart (and they wear costumes and shiz). It is really heartbreaking on my 2nd viewing.

There is so much nod to the comic book community because there is flirtation between a supposed pair of soon-to-be lovers, some foreshadowing on what may happen in future and yes, magic is definitely in! 

I now am so excited for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Next up is Doctor Strange and I cannot wait to see how he'll blend in with all of them. Kudos to everyone in the Marvel Studios for creating a franchise with such magnitude. It will now be very difficult for new MCU fans because they have to watch everything in Phase1-2 just to understand Phase 3. It is awesome though for Marvel fans. 

So a 4.5 would suffice for this movie. I think I need to watch it another time (and another for Caps' Biceps just because) just to get a real rating."
"May 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War
The biggest Marvel movie ever made? maybe.. but is it the best one? well i don't think so. Civil War is an epic blockbuster movie with top class cast and also superb action scene. the story itself is so enchanting, the relation between characters is developed nicely despite the different side they are on. But although the director can maintain the audiences mood constantly i think Civil War is lacking some kind of thrill in it.
Overall Civil War is an epic success, definitely a must-watch for fans or non-superhero fans. and also Civil War is not only a film, it's also a love letter contains a promise for future MCU movie.."
"May 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best marvel film yet. It has started to bring together all of the stories. It's an action packed flick that gives us all that we want
"May 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,One of the most overwhelmingly mediocre blockbusters I've ever sat through in my life.
"May 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Overall, disappointing. Two reasons. Firstly, we know it's a Civil War (the clue's in the title) so why take about an hour and a half getting to the civil war part. The back story could have been covered in ten minutes. Secondly, the most interesting parts of the movie all come with the minor characters such as Vision, Scarlet Witch etc. Sadly, as good as their acting is, there's nothing more to say about Ironman or Captain America and when they're on the screen all the energy dissipates. In fact, the movie is saved by the entrance of Spiderman & Antman who bring some much needed humour and fizz. Not particularly looking forward to the rest of this series now. Not unless some real jeopardy shows up."
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Civil War comes on as the perfect example how the media on its deadly viral form can shape the looks of a film as an unskipped chance to watch epicness on a movie theater. Civil War use a well structured script with the right montage to support well all the storylines the are settled. The way conflict and the big feud is brought is compelling enough to get stuck in your chair until half of a movie, with the combination of well choreographed action sequences, the film pays back. But in the end, all promises over the film that were told at the beginning are not enough to hide the franchise business of what MCU has become, leaving this so called epic movie on a position on not standing on its own and be totally forgettable in years to come. MCU is founded on the perpetual delivering of new product, which left past products drifting away through oblivion."
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This for me, is the best Marvel movie. This movie did almost perfectly what Batman v Superman failed to do, and that is to understand why both sides are fighting for. Ideologies, different ways to handle a situation. The character development is very well done too. I'm team iron man but I understand why the cap is doing what he is doing in this movie and I respect that. And you know what else? Spiderman is finally done right! I looking forward to see him in the future films! The chemistry between Peter Parker and Tony Stark is gold, I wanna see more of that! If you haven't seen it, you really should! It's a very enjoyable film."
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,excellent movie.  wud of been enjoyed more so but was so crammed in like a sardine and knee was cramping. VUE LEAMINGTON have you heard of leg room for your standard seating!!
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,best superhero movie so far
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,Just keep getting better
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"What's really clever about this film, is that everyone's motives and point of view is so well portrayed. For a moment, you feel behind each of them. Even the so called villain, for a moment of pity at least. Just when you think you expect a DC predictable ending coming, it's turns into something completely different. What an excellent mature storyline and plot, completely character driven and entertaining with wit charm and amazing visuals. So people can hate on marvel as much as they want but the point is, it appeals to absolutely everyone of all ages and captures imaginations. This is how it's done"
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Civil War delivers plenty of action with a very interesting villain who is not just evil, but has legitimate rationale for his terrible crimes. Fans of the series or Marvel fans will most likely enjoy the film. The Antman sequences were especially enjoyable. Personally though, I felt that the movie lacked depth. So while it does offer escapism for 2.5 hours - it left me little to reflect on afterwards. Perhaps I'm expecting too much from the film because of all the hype. But IMO the early X-Men films portrayed the challenges that mutants/powered people faced much better."
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"maybe have give money to marvel. but hey, Ironman 3 did too, and was one of the worse movies ever! god, i was tired by the end of the movie, captain america is a selfish man the entire movie, Stark is the only one feeling like this is something very bad going on.
CGI was BAD. they didnt finished like they should, and Spiderman payed the price. awful. over all, liked the 10 last minutes of the movie. forced relationships, forced jokes... a big title, didnt sell what it is. the plot is mostly about captain america trying to help his friend bucky."
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,movie is the same as the other one. 4 stars...
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Es increÃ­ble, de las mejores de pelÃ­culas de super heroes, todos tienen un momento Ã©pico."
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,Marvel si sabe hacer buenas películas
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Esta a otro nivel, Mejor q Avengers age of Ultron."
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Graciosa, llena de accion, una trama interesante, dilemas, una docena de personajes y todos con algo que aportar, accion interesante y divertida. Civil War es una pelicula que te dejara boquiabierto, riendo y en ratos triste, ademas de una sed de mas mas mas! - a must see -"
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This is the must see Marvel movie. What makes it so, in my opinion, is not the endless and often funny action sequences, though they are pretty fun,  but rather the very real dilemma that is born from each side of a very serious issue. The issue of course being oversight of enhanced human beings.  And because both sides make such convincing arguments, the viewer is thrust into a moral quagmire. At the end of the film I still didn't know who was right, and that left me very uncomfortable. Which is something a superhero films doesn't often do."
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This movie is like a puzzle that amazes you when is complete.
There you are, caring about the characters and seeing a beautiful
clash of values and visions of what is right and wrong.
Well done Marvel!"
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,it's really hard to justify who is right or wrong from what one truly believes in. there's always something in between. the plot was cleverly and delicately told. it's purely entertaining and effortless of watching a 2.5 hr film.
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"As I write this this review, I had just gotten back from seeing Captain America: Civil War roughly an hour ago, and whoa, what a satisfied time I've had thinking about it so far. Not only was this film the best of ALL of the Marvel Studios Films to date, it is also one of the best superhero movies of all time. Everything in Civil War is darn near perfectly executed, whether it be the writing, characters, storytelling, action, and the most important for a movie like this, character motivations. 
For the most part, I perfectly understood where these characters were coming from. (PS: it probably helps to have seen the other films in the MCU before going into this one, but it's not too bad without that advantage.) Another thing about this film that caught be a bit by surprise, is the serious tone it carries throughout, while still managing to be funny when in needed to be and also very enjoyable throughout. 
The Captain America franchise is a series that seems to get better and better as the movies progress, which is one thing I appreciate about these films. Even with so much focus put on several other characters (speaking of which, this is the most I've liked tony Stark since the first Iron Man), it still manages to be a story based around the relationship between Cap and Bucky, with Tony's problems being blended perfectly into the mix. 
Another note, the action in this film is some of the most engaging, exciting and ""realistic"" action I've ever seen. And (as you've probably heard many people mention), the battle-royale seen at the airport is one of the best action scenes of all time, as well as the less-mentioned final action scene, which was one of the most engaging throw-downs between characters I've seen. 
I tried to keep myself from over-hyping this movie, but I really couldn't help it because this is a truly great movie. While I do highly recommend it, don't go into this movie expecting the second coming, because if you do then you are most likely going to be disappointed. Even with that, I still highly recommend this movie. 
9.5/10 

(SLIGHT SPOILER FOR THOSE WHO HAVE AVOIDED THE TRAILERS)
PS: Spider-Man in this movie may be the best film version of the web-slinger we've had to date. Tom Holland really captured the essence of the character and I believe that he was a VERY good choice."
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This movie is for little kids, predictable plot, lots of punch lines, explosions and weak antagonists. A perfect safe movie to take your little newphews for a lovely sunday. Don't forget to buy your action figure."
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It's just BRUTALLY  EXCELLENT,  it will tear you apart. Everything has a reason , and those reasons might even make you question yourself on what you actually believe is right and\or wrong, everything was perfect, it  obliterated my expectations, left me wanting more. Get ready for one hell of a ride, and yes, BEST SPIDER - MAN EVER BROUGHT TO LIFE (since Sam Raimi;s Spiderman 1 & 2), you will just LOVE IT."
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This movie is perfect on every level. Watch the movie and you will not be disappointed. Surely one of the best, if not the best movie Marvel has ever made."
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best marvel film yet especially like the political undertones on how we should not allow terrorist to change our way of life.
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"DC who? Marvel once again deliver the goods. learn DC this is how you bring superheros. together. masterpiece. fenomenal, fantastic,  pure gold. box office be ready because cap is here and he is about to show you. how to rule the MCU."
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Fantástica y entretenida. No es la historia del comic, sin embargo lo que presentan es muy interesante y divertido. Una película para disfrutar varias veces."
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Not perfect, but a great movie! Looking for the next one!"
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I left feeling that CA: CW was a more enjoyable film than Batman versus Superman. 

The introductions of new characters, such as Black Panther, and the new Spider Man, were well handled, even if they did seem included only to make us anticipate their new movies."
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The biggest differences between Captain America Civil War and other recent superhero film which I do not wish to mention the title are it's more focus and cohesive. I know what is going on. I know why the superhero fight each other. Every characters have their own moment without affecting the story. I love how the story gets deeper and emotional until we almost reach the end point of the film. The only issue I have was certain fight scene was too shaky, can't tell what hitting what. To conclude, well done Marvel Studio."
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,Emotional Stakes and the best spider-man incarnation for the big screen.
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America may be one of the best films that Marvel has ever made. With a gripping narrative, Emotional story and brilliant character development it does a tremendous job of not letting any of its gigantic cast fall by the wayside while keeping it a Captain america move. There are no faults that I can find with a movie that tries so hard to please everyone. The Russo brothers have somehow topped their last Captain America movie and I don't know how they're gonna top it next time."
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"it was a very emotional turn for marvel studios, every scene in the film was good and the next scene topped it in every way, like batman v superman but not shitty"
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,Was dope AF!!!! Spider Man done right loved him in the scenes he was in. Love how the story flowed. The must see movie of the year. It will dominate the award season it is that good.
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Es mejor que Avengers 2, cumple su cometido, entretiene, lo mejor son los 20 minutos finales. Prefiero Batman vs. Superman, la cual es totalmente superior."
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"An excellent movie. A good storyline and good packed actions throughout the movie. Even the 'supposedly' main villain is a case for simpathy (spoiler). And just when we thought the action sequel is finished (but that figthing of the titular characters hasn't come up yet-another spoiler), then the ending action sequence come. One conclusion though, the most mature and wise character by the end of the movie is not Cap or Tony, but one of the new super heroes (more spoliers). An excellent work by the Russo's brothers. Two thumbs up."
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,The airport scene is the best action scene... Ever! Must see movie
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best marvel film yet
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,The action scenes are good but the whole thing feels empty and a waste of time. At the end of the film nothing is achieved. The new heroes are still poor and the franchise is still heavily driven by older cast members. Will not be watching any future installments... there's no point.
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Civil War is not only pure Marvel heaven but also rises above other comic book adaptations to give true drama and depth to characters that are given time and respect to deepen with every player having their time to shine. A great follow-up from the enjoyable Age of Ultron and a fantastic sequel to Winter Soldier, the Russo brothers bring action, heart, comedy, grit and comic book fun to make another perfect superhero flick on Marvel's roster. See it in 3D and IMAX if possible if not only for one action sequence that's so fun and inventive it could go down in movie history. Spider-Man is loads of fun with Tom Holland showing to be a great choice while Chadwick Boseman's Black Panther is bad ass and given a great introduction to this universe having a great slice of the drama of this movie and a compelling character arc. Cap, Bucky and Iron Man are the strongest they have ever been with each actor bringing great emotion and seriousness to their roles. Doctor Strange has big boots to fill while Infinity War only gets more faith with these directors in charge."
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War might be the best MCU movie to date, even though Marvel drops the ball yet again on the villain side of things."
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Amazing action scenes, great storyline, and the civil war is throughout the movie and not a 'oh look, a bigger threat' kinda movie. The new characters were spot-on, and 4DX was definitely worth it! This movie is my new favourite Marvel movie.
This and Deadpool."
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,Another spot on Captain America film!
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I loved this movie!  
1.  What they did with Spider man was amazing!  My wife who is not the biggest super hero fan and never saw the other Marvel movies said the best thing in this movie was Spider Man.
2.  They way they introduce each new character made sense and was an enjoyment to watch.  It felt like the new characters were needed and fit into the plot.  It didn't feel forced or unnecessary.
3.  The action!  One thing that disappointed me most about BvS was that we really didn't get the two characters fighting that much.  This movie allowed us to have more than one fight and how they did the scenes was wonderful.  There is one image, I won't say when it is, but it comes straight from the comic book.  I said out loud. ""Beautiful!""  My wife had no clue what I meant until I explained to her the significance after the movie.  When it happened, it fit so well into the fight sequence as well, again, coming right out the original comic.
4.  The plot.  I was expecting this to be more political than it actually was.  It really wasn't.  It was to some extent, but the story I think ended on a less political note than I expected.  Not only that, everything ties together so, so, well.  The threads all connect.
4.  Finally, I really like what they did with the action scenes and story together.  I felt like you got enough story to make it worth watching just for that but the way they carried the action sequences was also very well done so you weren't bored.  Both aspects invite a second and third watch to be able to capture everything while a first watch leaves you very satisfied.  Both the action and story allows you to think and get into the world while still being entertained.

My only problem is this...you really need to see the other Marvel movies to get the full impact of the movie.  My wife hadn't watched them and would give this movie a 3 stars.  She adds the 3rd for Spider Man."
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Probably the best movie of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with an excellent mix of action and drama, packed with emotional conflict and strong performances that will make happy fans and non-fans of the comic"
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,SPIDER MAN IS THE BEST ONE YET
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,The Avengers gone into overdrive. Story could have been more slick but let's face it: it's all about the action and the one liners.
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Excellent movie, with a very well tied plot and very clever script, respecting the essence of the heroes, their nobility and friendship to put the fight together as a momentary need without bizarre motivations. They fought for ideals knowing they did not want to hurt each other. The airport scene was epic, to stay in the history of comic book movies!"
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The worst Captain America ever and a shameless political bulllshit. But a lot of fun inside four different movies at the same time. So, fuck me in the brain, Marvel and thank you."
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,Really good action in this one and some questions left unanswered which we will need to wait for the next Avenger Movie. Overall a solid movie even  if with the cast it seems it should be called Avengers:Civil War
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The most recent addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe might just be the best one yet. A wonderfully written story with breathtaking action and fantastic performances, Captain America Civil War sets the comic book movie bar even higher."
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Definitely a contender for ""best superhero film yet"""
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I really prefer the winter soldier one.. Please Spider-Man don't appear like that again.. After BvS , seeing this movie is like a grown up going to a kids party .."
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"A amazing marvel flim, the best super hero movie ever!!"
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,You think they can't top what they already got then BAM PIFF KAPOW Marvel hit you right in the face with a fistful of awesome!
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,best comic book movie ever (so far)
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,One of the best superheroe movies I have seen
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Note to DC Comics, this is how it's done.
Watch this movie thoroughly and you might learn something!!!
Great entertainment."
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,The second best picture of Marvel Studios
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"They shouldn't have called it Civil War, just Civil Disagreement. When the only Avenger to face death is a 90 year old SHIELD agent, you don't have a war. They completely failed at using a great comic book title. Spidey, Black Panther, and Downey Jr's acting save this movie, because the villains once again are forgettable and wasted. This is slightly better than Age of Ultron, but Winter Soldier was way better."
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,Captain America: Civil War may not have Avengers in the title but the film is still able to have a huge group of characters and still have them shine while also providing the same thrilling story from Winter Soldier.
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"""There was no way more perfect and majestic to start Phase Three of Marvel Cinematic Universe""

This ""Captain America: Civil War"" Review contains some spoilers. If you have not seen ""Civil War"" film, please, do not read, this could destroy it.

A few years ago, approximately, five or six years, Marvel had in its hands one script and one proposal that possessed enough unknowns. That project would receive the name of ""Avengers"". The biggest concern for the owners of the company was supposed to make a film where not only a hero was the protagonist, may break the story, be boring and completely commercial. Two years later, on May 4, 2012, ""Marvel's The Avengers"" landed in all movie theaters, solving each and every one of those unknowns on just the first day at the box office. Today, Mayo 2016, ""Civil War"" increases its number of participants to 12 heroes and 3 villains. Will this be the film event of the year? I don't know, I can only assure, Marvel has lost the fear and perhaps in the next few years its projects could reach total perfection (Avengers: Infinity War Part:1 or 2).

Based on the Comic of 2006-2007, movie serves as a sequel to ""Age of Ultron"" and ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"". After all the fighting and disaster in ""Ultron"", the Avengers return to discuss issues still more violent than in 2015, the death of innocents (something very, very similar to what we saw in ""BvS"", with Superman, and then say that they are polar opposites) and the dilemma, Does our help really help?

Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (William Hurt, reprising his role from The Incredible Hulk) immediately ordered a conference to bring together to acclaimed heroes. After showing the dramatic and terrible consequences of their actions, it opens way for the culprit of this civil war. Sokovia Accords established by the United Nations. That treaty, aims to put each of the actions and missions of the Avengers in the hands of the United Nations for so, take care of each human life, taking into account that it will be them who decide if the heroes can act or not. As expected, not everyone agrees. They needed something for fight, here is their reason. After discussions, different thoughts, ideologies and equations, the decisions are made. 36 hours, two teams, a objective, an end, and Russo Brothers, Civil War has begun!

Captain America, Iron Man, Winter Soldier, Falcon, Hawkeye, Black Widow, Scarlet Witch, Vision, Black Panther, Spider-Man, War Machine - and multiple villains - Crossbones, Helmut Zemo, Gen. Ross - transform to this, in project biggest of the history cinematographic based on comics. Unquestionable, film focuses more than in the ""Avengers"", in Steve Rogers and Bucky Barne again (like Loki/Thor), it is owned by Cap this film. The center of the chaos is Bucky, sign faithful of a love story between Cap and him.

I affirm with all security and respect that ""Civil War"" has the best sequences of action of Marvel films so far, with sophisticated and perfect choreographies and training. A true example, and personally one of the best parts of the movie, the fight at Berlin airport. The presentation of both sides, literally, made me cry, its class, its style, its elegance and its  professionalism to mix and combine each of the specific abilities (physical and emotional) of the old and new heroes, to create a scene of entertainment, quality and long, long fight makes that truly the public continues to support to ""Marvel"" for continue, (Curious fact: Directors David Leitch and Chad Stahelski (""John Wick"") are part of the second unit of the film).

 ""Spider-Man is the equivalent to Wonder Woman in Civil War""

Special relevance has the presentation of Spider-man and Black Panther. Their inclusion is appropiate, the first is introduced in way more relaxed and comic, who along with his fight and jokes makes this be the best performance in the Peter Parker story.

Another hero who had appointment was a Black Panther, an heir to the throne full of hatred and pain, perfect for his own movie and with a fresh and innovative appearance. In addition, other friends already seen previously are incorporate to the group as ""Ant-Man"", associating the world of past facts (seen in the films) with the present, something that really strengthens and gives coherence to the Marvel Universe. While many characters used this as a springboard for their own films (Spider Man - Black Panther), all boils down to the personal conflict revealed at the end between these three men, it is something that goes beyond policies, laws, treaties or rules, this is personal. Russo brothers take the decision after pleasing to the public with that magnificent fight, they there will be no more effects, flying planes, cobwebs, or CGI, for that moment, they weave meticulously a narrow path to focus on the three real protagonist of the story, Tony, Steve and Bucky.

And then, arrive the final fight, ""Iron Man"" vs. ""Captain America"" a dispute of friends. The fact that Bucky was defeated and they could fight each other was really fantastic, this is not a trick more to win more money, it is the destiny. Personally, I felt like the final fight between Batman and Superman, that anger but at the same time love, that hate but at the same time forgiveness , it created a swirl of emotions and thoughts that ended in fatalism. ""CW"" had all the unimaginable, and even the enigmatic and traditional cameo appearance of Stan Lee.

Phase three has begun. If Marvel offers us more equal or better products that this, will sound crazy but, they could reach the level and love of critics and fans to ""Star Wars"" . Goodbye to the cliche about Marvel films are cheap fiction and paste sh_t, quality exists. ""Civil War"" gives us a true contrast ""BvS"", but is just as tasty, fruitful and exciting. ""Marvel"" best film so far, plant bases strong and resistant to the future to come, and let the brand to a more high for Warner Bros. with ""Suicide Squad"" and Fox and Marvel (new) with ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" in May and ""Doctor Strange"" in November."
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Pretty good!  I wasn't blown away by it and I have a few big problems with it, but overall it's a fun romp that kept my interest very well throughout.  

I've said this numerous times before, but one of the main issues I have with superhero films is they always wreck entire cities, no doubt causing countless civilian deaths in the process and knock down skyscrapers in a fashion that would make the 9/11 hijackers jealous, and there's never any consequences.  The heroes fuck everything up, then they leave.  I've always HATED that in these movies because I can't just ignore the ridiculous destruction my fragile eyes were exposed to.  In Civil War, the whole plot revolves around holding these people accountable to their actions, which pleased me.  However, were Marvel always going to go down this route, or are they only acknowledging this because of thousands of movie-goers like me who always raise this issue?  I saw Batman V Superman recently, and it's a very similar story there.  Although I think we all know DC only touched upon that because of negative backlash to the stupid and indulgent 9/11 city destruction scene in Man Of Steel, they definitely were never going to address it otherwise.  So is that the same situation here?  I don't know.  Either way I was happy my concerns were being heard, and for the most part I think this plot was executed quite well.  

There's a lot of fun sequences here, most notably the action scene at the airport where all the Avengers get stuck into each other.  It wasn't a dark and moody scene, it was playful and humourous with some inventive set pieces, such as Ant-Man turning into a 50 foot giant, and Spider-Man tying his legs together to bring him down just like the AT-AT's in the Empire Strikes Back, which he also directly references as he's doing so (That Star Wars purchase is really paying off, eh)  Although, speaking of Ant-Man, I have no idea why he was in this film or what his personal motivation was.  It seemed like they just wanted to shoe-horn him in as a way of self-promotion.  I do like Paul Rudd a lot though and was pleased to see him, but exactly why he's agreed to fight Iron Man with Captain America isn't explained whatsoever.  Same goes for Spider-Man, no motivation, and clearly shoved into the film as a way of getting people ready to buy tickets for the next stand alone Spidey reboot.  Again though, they used him well and he was enjoyable to watch.  

One negative for me, and it's a negative for all these films, I think the action looks so goofy.  I'm almost certain the action scenes were sped up slightly here, the characters movements didn't look natural at all.  Also, how many times can they have someone getting punched into a wall?  It really looks ridiculous to me and honestly I think the action was my least favourite part of the film, and in all the others too.  Shoot me.  This is especially annoying here because the final action scene of the movie actually has some emotional weight behind it, yet instead of having a really gritty, personal, non-flashy altercation, we have to see the characters do all that flippy shit still.  It felt tonally wrong and really took away from the meaning of the conflict.  

Let's talk about Captain America, as this is supposedly his film (Although it really isn't)  He's engaged in a feud with Iron Man throughout most of the story, and honestly, I was on Iron Man's side all the way.  I think the filmmakers had the intention of trying to make it difficult for the audience to pick a side and have their loyalties split, but it was a very easy decision for me to choose Iron Man's team.  I think the main reasons for this are 1. Robert Downey Jr. is just so charismatic in the role I find it impossible to dislike him, and 2.  Captain America as a character is just...well, boring.  He is!  They guy doesn't have any faults.  He's so straight and narrow I can't get behind him.  I need protagonists with flaws, Tony Stark is an arrogant dick, and he isn't Superman.  In fact, Iron Man gets the shit kicked out of him!  Captain America may get a bloody nose here and there but I never feel like he's in any actual danger.  Give him a heroin addiction in the next one or something, yeah?  

I also didn't like how the film ended, with Tony Stark wistfully reading a letter from Captain America and smiling ever so slightly as he does so, when Mr. America spent the entirety of the film arguing and fighting him, even going as far as protecting the man who murdered his parents because ""he's my friend...""  Sorry, but I wanted Iron Man to rip his fucking head off!  I wasn't conflicted, my loyalty wasn't split, I was firmly in Stark's camp from the beginning to the end, and to finish the film like that bugged me.  But shit, maybe I'm the only one who feels that way, maybe the rest of you were actually conflicted, who knows. 

Overall; definitely not without its problems, mainly regarding tone and stupid goofy action when it isn't called for, but it's a fun time and won't outright offend you like Batman V Superman will.  There's humour, good character motivation for the most part, and a reflective, self-aware plot that I appreciated."
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Let's get this out of the way right off the bat; Captain America: Civil War is everything Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice failed to be. Ignoring the blunt similarities between the two would be silly, as Civil War shares the exact same narrative beats as its 2016 rival, but the former simply does it better. From a filmmaking angle to a storytelling angle, Civil War is a well done superhero film. Instead of 'retelling' the canon characters from the comic books by turning them into scowling Ayn Randian objectivists, the Russo brothers - Anthony and Joe - continue displaying their understanding and grasp of the characters they've been tasked with handling, delivering yet another solid entry into an otherwise overwhelming creatively stagnant Marvel Cinematic Universe.

That isn't to say Civil War is a storytelling masterpiece, because it isn't. Like every other MCU film, Civil War is formulaic and predictable for anyone with a functioning brain. Yet what sets it apart from the rest in the genre, such as Avengers: Age of Ultron - and BvS -, is how the nuance of the characters and impeccable direction raises it above mediocrity. Dealing with similar themes, motivations and issues involving superheroes and the accountability of their actions, Civil War features equal clashes of personal belief and rhetoric with the usual non-stop face punching and destruction porn these films have come to lean on as story act segue crutches. With a call to arms marketing campaign requesting fans to pick a 'team', Civil War handles the ambiguity of the winner better than how slanted it was in BvS, pitting together major characters from the past twelve films - barring Thor and Bruce Banner/The Hulk - into an actual fight rather than the easily forgotten squabbles in previous films.

Beyond several jarring scenes of shoddy CGI involving Robert Downey Jr.'s face plastered over a computer-generated suit of armour set against a computer-generated green screen, Civil War is a technical achievement, throwing around twelve superheroes against each other at the same time, mixing the gritty hand-to-hand martial arts choreography of Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2013) with the larger-than-life spectacle of an Avengers film. Other than how it hits the brakes halfway through the film to veer off course in an attempt to shoehorn introduce a certain friendly neighbourhood webslinger (Tom Holland), and four minutes shorter than BvS, with almost four times the number of major characters, Civil War in comparison is a marvel of a perfectly paced superhero film.

Spiritually adapting Mark Millar's rather average core ""Civil War"" storyline from the comic books, and rather than mismanaging the progression of the story and characters in Civil War, the Russo brothers' creative choice in placing more emphasis on character moments - artificial and dramatic, both aplenty for nearly each character -, rather than composing disjointed 'perfect shots' like Visionary Director Xtreme Zack Snyder does in Batman v Superman is tell-tale of both the film's overall quality and their caliber as filmmakers. So much so that it's embarrassing how much better a formulaic, general audience-friendly, safe Marvel film is than a feature film starring both the Caped Crusader and the Man of Steel for the first time in history."
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America:Civil War has everything we've come to expect from a good Disney/MARVEL superhero movie. In many ways it is a culmination of all the things MARVEL has learned works on audiences. Good action? Check! A host of fun superheroes plus a some shiny new additions? Check! Great action set pieces? Check! Witty dialogue, one-liners and jokes to make you laugh and ease tension? Check! You get where I'm going with this. CW reads like a checklist of Disney/MARVEL movie traits and while it is is good and very enjoyable, but doesn't truly bring anything new or unexpected to the table. This lack of 'freshness' keeps Civil War from being a truly great film.

Black Panther is the highlight of the film although he is a bit one note. 
Spiderman although enjoyable was awkwardly shoved in to the proceedings so much so that he got sent off! Literally. 

The plot doesn't hold up under logical scrutiny tbh many character motivations are half baked and require a great suspension of disbelief in order to enjoy them. 

The airport scene is a well choreographed dance of super powers and is up there with the best AVENGERS throw downs. However you never once feel anyone is in danger. CW is less Civil War and more Civil Dispute. 

Enjoyable time at the theatres but very formulaic and almost seemed like some scenes ripped off other hero v hero films we've seen recently.  Go in with tempered expectations and you should have a good time :)"
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,Everything in this movie is just so perfectly handled. We really could understand each teams motivation. The introduction of Spidey and Black Panther was so amazing.
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,Why the heroes fight? I don't know. It's a full effects & fights movie but if you turn on your brain then... you lose.
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,It's Awesome ð???ð???ð???ð???ð???
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Civil War is not as thrilling as The Winter Soldier, but it does bring some new characters perfectly, despite it is overlong."
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"At its heart, this is a superhero movie about superhero conflict: the strong characters and impressive action set pieces are built with genuine emotional depth. If not perfect, I found ""Civil War"" thoroughly enjoyable."
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War

Good film, though I may have just had my hopes way too high. 
A lot is done right, like the action scenes and the dialogue filled scenes that fill the gap between them. The acting from everyone was superb, and the story was entertaining to see played out! And the airport fight scene is absolutely fantastic!

I feel that there were some weak parts to the film though.
Sometimes it felt like the dialogue heavy scenes were dragging on a bit, whereas some scenes that could have been drawn out a little bit more were incredibly rushed. 
I wasn't a big fan of the ending. I felt it was quite anti-climactic but again I had my hopes really high and was expecting a big cliffhanger that would maybe tease Infinity War or another of the big installments in the MCU, other than Spider Man of course. 

All around I feel this was a pretty good film, better than CA: The First Avenger by far but not as good as CA: The Winter Soldier in my honest opinion."
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Civil War decepcionante y con un guión reciclado al estilo Iron Man 3,  es una vergüenza para su predecesora, un asco, ni la sombra del soldado del invierno"
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Fantastic movie.Where I live it came out on Friday and I must say it is amazing.There are some problems but the dont change much to the story.Spidey,Black Panther and (Gi)Ant-Man are the best parts.Spideys lines are perfect.Black panther needs no origin story for his solo film because his origin is summed up here in about 20 minutes.The airport fight is incredible,and the mid/post credits scenes are spot on and do well at what they need to do.Go see this movie because it is simply fantastic and deserves the five stars I gave it.Spot on."
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,Favorite Marvel Movie Yet.
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,Okay. Could have been better.
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The movie is great, it's at same level as an Avengers movie, really cool. I was enjoying it fully, until guess what... WORST SPIDER-MAN EVERRR! Andy Garfield, we miss you.
This Spider-Man has no appeal as Peter Parker, the costume is ugly, and adds ZERO elemnts to the plot. They could have included any other Marvel's character, instead, like Wasp or Spider-Woman. But no, they had to trash a previous saga that was going great to insert Spider-Man to the Avengers (another bad move, by SONY).
With all and all, the movie is neat and full of action. I want to see it again, it's worth it. Kudos for Black Panther, Vision, Scarlett Witch and Falcon."
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The third film of Steve Rogers is a smart adaptation of one of the most important events of the modern era of Marvel Comics. With a fully appropriate to its own universe own story, including new characters that bring much to the table and spectacular action scenes, expectations for Phase 3 are high. We hope not disappoint us. (I'm looking at you Doctor Strange)."
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,Enthralling over the top action extension of the marvel world. Don't sit too close to the screen though. Hard to pick a fav character in this one.

*Contains Spoilers*

Political interference in the Avengers' activities causes a rift between former allies Captain America and Iron Man. Politics. Rifts. Allies. That basically sums up this take on Civil War fairly well. And replace 'War' with 'Selfish Disputes'. There's little to sink your teeth into despite marketing ""OMG ARE YOU TEAM CAP OR TEAM IRON MAN!?"" The end result is Team Neither. Two and half hours of bravado and nobody dies. Oh, except Peggy Carter, she dies from old age. SHOCKING! Captain America: Civil War is not a Captain America film. Fact. Early this week the Russo Bros let slip that they feel Civil War was a reaction to Warner Bros announcing Batman v Superman. And it shows, feeling like just another product off the Disney assembly line: safe, cookie cutter fluff. Considering you all tweet and post MCU related memes, fan theories all year round, there wasn't much point in rewatching previous Marvel films before this release, it's everywhere we go, wether we want it or not. It's not comic book movie fatigue, i'm sick of this middle of the road, stale Marvel Cinematic Universe.

I didn't have issues with the running time or pace, at no point did the film drag, i enjoyed the quiet moments that built some tension, new characters are developed better (Spiderman, Black Panther) than others (Martin Freeman) but it's typical Marvel being safe and taking few risks. So because of that i won't list every character and their performance because you know what to expect, it's more of the same. For once, Marvel didn't con us with their trailers, you get what they promised. Apart from seeing Spiderman and Giant Man battling it out, there are few surprises and most of what's on screen feels uninteresting.

The amount of similarities with Batman v Superman are interesting: opening with an incident in an African city, camera panning up to a destroyed building with civilian deaths, a chat between heroes that the world is talking and ""it's not your fault"", bombing of a meeting where the future of our heroes is discussed, a villain who manipulates events to force the heroes to fight, and dead parents are mentioned.

Civil War looks more like a Netflix movie with it's washed out visuals and a generic, almost non existent score that has no effort put into it. Outside of the airport battle (although good in parts, it felt like a training exercise than a 'War') there isn't much to shout about. Why is that? Because there's no emotional depth, weight or threat. The opening fight in Lagos involving Crossbones and his henchmen was The Russos once again trying to imitate Bourne, ending up more like G.I. Joe with a touch of shaky cam and over editing right out of Taken 3. A jarring visual experience that tries too hard to be exciting.

One of the dumbest things nobody will pick up on (or question because it's such a 'fun' movie, right?) is Tony Stark asking a teenager who's only been Spiderman for 6 months to help him FIGHT one half of THE AVENGERS that also includes A WANTED KILLER in the Winter Soldier. Sure, it was great to see this Peter Parker, young and indecisive interacting with Tony Stark, but come on seriously, is he really goin.....oh i forgot, this is a 'fun' movie, i need to turn my brain off.

The much hyped discussion for the past year or two has been, ""Who's going to die in Civil War?"" Do you fanboys really think Marvel is that bold to kill off any of their main characters? There is no death for Captain America like in the comic storyline. How about Bucky? Nope. Oh you thought maybe Marvel would flip the script and kill Tony Stark? WRONG. Therefore, the whole journey is rendered meaningless. Zemo's plan of destroying an 'empire from within', it worked for a few minutes i guess? Suddenly the death of Stark's parents is important after a zillion MCU films, and Bucky was responsible. Okay then. After the dust has settled, Steve Rogers sends a letter to apologise and explain his reasons to Stark. Much like Age of Ultron, ending in such a whimper, a nice little package with a pretty ribbon on top.

I'm 35 years old. I grew up on comic books and movies like many kids. In the early 90s, i always imagined what would it be like to see my favourite superheroes on the big screen one day. Fast forward to today and thankfully i can say we all have Bryan Singer's X-Men 2, Days of Future Past, Sam Raimi's Spiderman 2, Zack Snyder's Man of Steel, Joe Johnston's Captain America and many more. These films surprised us, cinematic yet straight out the comics, familiar yet new. After phase one, I feel the MCU isn't matching the standards set. Marvel insist on pandering to general audiences with the movie equivalent of McDonalds. Going into Civil War i was ready to tune out the lame, predictable humour, but i was annoyed where the comic relief came from this time around. ""Quick, Ant-Man won't have much screen time, just shoe-horn jokes that the mouth breathers will love, make Falcon say those lines!"" was probably Kevin Feige's masterplan. When i can predict what the next shot/line is going to be and the audience is going to belly laugh while i sit there and cringe, i need to admit defeat, clearly these movies aren not targeted at me. If you love cheesy jokes written for 5 year olds and fall for the 'wait for it wink wink' approach to those scenes, maybe it's new to you or something, and that's the form of entertainment you think is 'awesome'.

Like i said earlier, I'm 35. I don't have time to turn my brain off and lose brain cells faster than normal because Marvel want to dumb down the comic book movie genre with borderline insulting efforts like this. I expected more but all i got was Avengers 2.5: Civil Bore."
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"[FR viewer] Every character is developped in a smart and accurate manner, wich makes the clash between all these figures inevitable and at the same time, joyful and painful. Prepare for twists, revelations, and heartbreaking scenes, as well as incredible action scenes. Black Panther and Spider-Man are the icing on an already pretty amazing cake."
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"So Glad that it managed to exceed expectations and be a great movie, needed that."
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Not a perfect movie but certainly comes very close to it. It has a small amount of flaws that mainly revolve around the villain of the movie and his cause. 
It is packed with a lot of great characters but never for a second the movie feels too crowded, the Russo brothers did an excellent job keeping Captain America in the center of the film.
One of the most amazing marvel movies out there."
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,For Being a Marvel Movie is ok. It should focus only on the Civil War plot. Best possible Spiderman
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I left the theater with a smile. I enjoyed seeing the characters in their glory, with some excellent fights that managed to really showcase the powers of both Cap and Bucky better than previous iterations. As a character-driven film it was fantastic.

On the other hand, the ham-fisted plot has far too many contrivances and ""what-if"" scenarios to ignore. To be fair, the original storyline included some of these over-the-top contrivances, but I believe there was plenty of room in this film for repair. The movie is fun and enjoyable, but don't think too long about the story or it could damage your enjoyment.

I recommend the film, overall, as it is presented, a fun comicbook blockbuster with a character-driven angle that leaves you loving your favorites all the more."
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,Really looking forward to this and infinity war
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"From the first introductory to the second dark political thriller, the Russo brothers has surprised the audiences by transforming the entire tone of the series into a psychology based superhero film. It's a mini Avengers reunion but more centralise on the conflicts between Captain America, Winter Soldier as well as Iron Man and with more grounds to cover, both Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely who have written the first two installments managed to ensure the well-pacing of the story without losing its sense of intentions. Continuing the epic traditional fighting sequences from previous episode, the 13th outing of this MCU adventure offers a wide variety range of action scenes and it is evenly distributed among all the superheroes through efficient cinematography of switching without focusing much on gunshots, smashing and explosions. All characters are engaging thanks to the compelling character developments; Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr. and Sebastian Stan deliver well as their roles respectively in term of resolving the challenge of their friendship test, the other Avengers perform outstanding too especially the brought in of Spider-Man, Back Panther and Ant-Man have added more fun and joy which is entirely absent in DC's Dawn of Justice. It is emotional, inspiring and perfectly crafted, implying that the actions chosen between the two main characters are not anything about right or wrong, but more on perceptions and the outcomes. While the Captain America trilogy is not up to The Dark Knight trilogy masterpiece, the decision to explore thought-provoking themes have made it one of the most impressive series in MCU."
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,Absolutely amazing film!! Great Acting! Bewildering Effects!! Stunning Plot!! By far the best Marvel Movie ever! Brings back many other marvel characters from other movies. The only thing to say is that you definitively should watch all the other marvel films to understand this one!
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Overall it was a fun film, and i'd see it again for the humor and spider-man (which i never thought i'd say). I wish the effort they provided to solidifying tony stark's views and ideologies, they provided the same for captain America's without asking people to recall upon the films of the past, as something that fundamentally defines a character deserves to be shown, juxtaposed to long scenes of air traffic control towers falling. The consequences of the film felt empty and thus the stakes never really felt that high. Despite all this, it was a tight, enjoyable film that faltered under the weight of it's own story. Captain America's ideals seem justified now more than ever with recent events of SOAP, PRISM, and a growing policy push for more governmental control, but it deserves more than a sentence. Sometimes newer things don't make them better, just like social values which are, and should be critiqued equally. Maybe it demands an essay but equally avoids it. Captain America Civil War is a subtly thought provoking film that chooses not to be substantive. Rather it is decisively enjoyable, fun loving and largely entertaining to watch."
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Marvel movie funny, but it turns out is a copy of Batman v Superman, and hubi a frustrated attempt to improve the script in complicated situations."
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War was an enjoyable movie. However, hailing it as  the best Marvel movie seems like a disservice to previous ones,  as does calling it the pinnacle of interlacing various superheroes in one movie, or even the best ""deep"" superhero movie. Superhero movie with character development. Whatever you want to call it.

One of its missteps is, indeed, is its pursuit of all of the above, as well as aiming to be funny and visually pretty. This may be all in all genuinely impossible, which is where Civil War falls. 

(warning: some spoilers ahead)

The Russo brothers trusted on their experience of working on shows such as Arrested Development or Community, where one has to jungle multiple storylines of multiple characters and have, by the end of an episode, moved them to a place which suggests the slightest of personal growths. In Captain America: Civil War, there is an abundance of personal growth of characters the masses are used to seeing prominently blow up stuff. Usually smug and arrogant, Tony Stark battles with his conscience, going deeper than he has before in terms of self-reflection about the actions he and his team (or family) are in any way responsible for. Elizabeth Olson's Wanda Maximoff deals with the aftermath of her powers - learning about her strengths, as well as her weaknesses, while trying to accept the well known need to break a few eggs when trying to make an omelette. The Vision starts acknowledging and trying to manage  his new found humanity and everything it obtains. Sebastian Stan's best performance in the MCU yet sees his Bucky Barnes trying to come to terms with the fact that his body and his mind have been stolen to him, that he spent seventy years being violated by a group of people with terrible fake Russian accents and sent on a killing spree around the world.  You get the picture.

There's too many characters in Captain America: Civil War for me to describe the growth of each one without boring anyone reading this to death or giving away spoilers. There's also multiple new ones being introduced, and I tip my hat off to the team behind this movie for using Tom Holland's Peter Parker and Paul Rudd's Ant-Man as the sources of comic relief, because their one line zingers (or multiple line zingers, in the case of Spider-Man, who talks more during the large battle montage than the audiences are used to, much to the delight of people in the cinema around me, who were laughing out loud) are written in a way which does a good job of capturing the core of the characters, as we've known them from before. This is all done exceptionally well, especially given the fact that it is a super hero movie, where one is more used to long panning action scenes than the personal growth of men and women stuffed into spandex.

However, my main disappointment in the movie comes from Steve Rogers. It is most certainly not with the way Chris Evans has portrayed him, because we have been truly lucky to see his impressively wide shoulders carry the persona of America's Greatest Hero with true authenticity and integrity. This movie is meant to see him follow his heart instead of his head, the ultimate people's person finally doing something for himself. And in a way, we do, with Steve unwilling to sign the Sokovia Accords meant to pacify the Avengers after their recent misshapes, in order to go find his best friend forever, James Buchanan Barnes. And this is where my problem lies - I genuinely thought that the Russos, along with Marvel and Disney and anyone else responsible for the movie - would finally bite the bullet and give the fans what they wanted.

Because there is a reason behind the multiple photomontages, playlists, works of fan fiction, drawings and embroidery and literally anything else that you can think of which is based on the more-than-just-friendly relationship between Sergeant Barnes and Captain Rogers. Here you have two men who grew up together, who cared for each other (Barnes protecting and saving Roger's minuscule behind in fights during pre-serum days). Here are men who fought in war together, who's sense of brotherhood and loyalty is unquestionable and exceptional, two men who have finally found each other after seventy years of not being fully autonomous. What a nice friendship, you might say, discretely trying to wipe a stray tear from the corner of your eye. How good that they have each other, poor souls. And indeed. Their bond is the glue in the movie, the string trying to tie together all the tidbits and scenes provided by the Russos. However, their bond could be easily seen to be something more than pure heterosexual brotherhood - Barnes is the man Captain America stormed into a Nazi camp for, in what was possibly the most suicide-esque mission ever. Steven Rogers' face and voice, on the other hand were enough to break seventy years worth of torture, mind control and memory manipulation, because it was the gloriously panned out scene at the end of Captain America: The Winter Solider which ignited a spark of recollection in the otherwise fully indoctrinated Barnes.

And tell me that that's not something more than platonic. My disappointment lies here - the team behind this movie had the perfect opportunity to show the audiences a heart wrenching love story which would pan from hiding (or pining) in pre WWII Brooklyn to the battlefields of the Allied front to Nazi camps, from Russia to DC to Siberia to everywhere and anywhere else. The ultimate love story, one about loyalty and trust and pain. Is that not what superhero movie are always partially about? Think of the box-office champion Deadpool, and how Wade Wilson's motivations and feelings rotate mainly around his love for Vanessa, the snarky stripper he's fallen in love with and promised to protect. Yes, there might've been a lot of innuendos and dirty jokes in the movie as well, but Deadpool rests predominantly around his love and devotion.

Why, I ask, couldn't Captain America: Civil War, do the same? The previously mentioned Deadpool brought the first seemingly non-straight superhero, with Wade Wilson apparently identifying as pansexual, and yet the only sign of his diversion from heterosexuality may be found in the closing credits, where a cartoon Deadpool humps a cartoon unicorn. I demand more. In the 21st century, superheroes should be able to get with the program of civil rights movements and gradual change within society, and it's great that we're getting more superheroes who are not male or white, but how about we get one that isn't straight?

Instead of doing this, the Russos follow the amazing (hear the sarcasm) tradition set by Joss Whedon of clumsily shoving romantic subplots into the movie due to the sheer lack fo time (or space? or ideas?) to possibly occupy the characters in between shots of the characters fighting with something else. This can be seen manifested as the terrible idea of shoving the Black Widow onto the Hulk in Avengers: Age of Ultron, as her romantic interest from 2012's Avengers was suddenly given a family and a wife (I'm guessing this was done in order to give Jeremy Renner's Clint Barton something to do in his downtime). Thus Steve Rogers was paired with Sharon Carter (yes, there is a relation to his wartime sweetheart) in what was sold as ""an unexpected romance"". This gives Ms. Carter a sort of subplot, which makes it seem like she actually does something in the movie other than look pretty. A modern day Bond girl, if you will.

Many reviews I have read are critical of the visual aspect of movie, but in following the tradition set by the previous Captain America movies, the aesthetic appeal comes from shots of the movie's protagonist flexing, as well as from colour coordinated leather jackets, rather than the kind of action sequels that made audiences fall in love with the first Avengers movie. This can be forgiven, as it seems to be that the movie chose to follow the previous Captain America movies with putting value into emotional substance rather than exposions, and it must be said that the idea of Joss Whedon managing Bucky Barnes' PTSD with as much sensitivity as he did Natasha Romanoff's sterilisation (another great example of how not to try to further a character's development) is a scary one indeed.

Despite being funny, it is no where near Deadpool's league. The action shots fall short of the standards set in Avengers, and the character growth is not as immaculately handled and tied up as audiences are used to from the previous Captain America movies. It is a wonderful take at managing multiple figures and their own storylines while having multiple action sequences and bad goys. Captain America: Civil War manages to be wonderful in many aspects, but it's gun-holding villain-punching fingers never quite manage to grasp the supremacy which was within its reach."
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Emotional and heart-breaking. Russo brothers made the Captain America from a comicbook figure, into a great soldier on-scree with humanity and telling the story between him and Tony Stark.  Unlike other films it has shaped him into an iconic figure. With the great showdown in the Airport is definitely the best part of the film. With the tease of Spiderman and Black Panther it tries its best to develop Phase 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Can't wait to watch the following Marvel Film Avengers Infinity War coming to 2018. Hopefully Russo brothers will make another film franchise the greatest comic book movie ever made in the moving pictures industry."
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Marvel Studios have done it yet again. Just when they appeared to be running out of steam after Age of Ultron and Ant-Man sat comfortably in the middle of the MCU canon, they strike back with this enormously entertaining series-booster. Essentially Avengers 2.5, this movie is crowded with so many well-known characters it's a miracle it's a movie at all, let alone a coherent and consistently exhilarating one. When the end credits roll there's disappointment rather than relief, unlike other recent superhero vs superhero efforts. The plot mechanics don't completely hold up under scrutiny - especially the antagonist's scheme - but it is the pitch-perfect character interaction that propels the story in between the multitude of kick-arse action sequences. And what kick-arse action sequences they are! Bookended with an impressively gritty Bourne-esque set piece and a seriously personal (and intense) punch up, each battle is cleverly given it's own spin to avoid feeling repetitive. Nothing tops the truly remarkable showdown amongst superhero friends though; with everyone fighting everyone, a web-slinging newbie stealing the show and a HUGE surprise, it confidently challenges the New York alien beat-down for MCU's greatest set piece. It doesn't quite reach Guardians levels of humour but there's a wonderful levity maintained throughout and the quip-filled dialogue is often laugh-out-loud funny, strongly aided by the rock-solid cast (both familiar and new). Picking a standout amongst such an electrifyingly diverse group of players is impossible; series regulars - Cap (Evans), Iron Man (RDJ), Black Widow (ScarJo), et al - are always excellent, whilst newcomers Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Spider-Man (Tom Holland) are both downright awesome. Somehow fresh despite having a dozen films come before it in the MCU, Civil War is a near-perfect popcorn flick that galvanises enthusiasm for the upcoming onslaught of Marvel adventures."
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,This totally removes the bad aftertaste of the second Averngers movie.
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Civil War es mitad película del capitán América y mitad ""ironman y sus perras parte 3), llega un punto en el que empieza con su fase de chiste tras chiste de la que parece que no va a salir y vuelve una batalla que debería de ser Épica en más de lo mismo, de igual manera el villano que parecía que por fin sería algo interesante vuelve a ser el típico malo porque si y se derrota solo, hasta se les olvida que está ahí.
Ahh y Spiderman es el equivalente a aquel capítulo de South park donde conocen a los escritores de padre de familia. Esta demasiado tonto, es el universo Marvel cinematográfico condensado en un solo personaje.
Tampoco hay sorpresas, ni nada que te haga decir Wuau.
Cosas buenas: la parte de la peli tipo Winter Soldier, Wanda, Black Panther, Ant Man/Goliat y el ganador de la batalla.
Cosas malas: todo lo demás.

No me acabé las palomitas."
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Great stuff, the best of the MCU. Tackles the idea of accountability well, while also providing sufficient character development and stakes."
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Watched it twice! Really spectacular, all the characters were greatly introduced, storyline is unexpected with lots of twist! Recommended!"
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,I found a bit tired of non-stop action for a two and half hour film.
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,I'm so going to watch it again!
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,Slow to start but still worth it
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,It's a superhero film with a heart and soul.
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Never believed the hype anyway. Mostly meh and okay, similar to Ultron (It was that bad). Don't know what the critics see in this and what are they smokin'. Highlight was the new(ish) heroes in this group (Spidey, Ant-Man and Black Panther). Probably would've been more emotional and dramatic if they followed the comics more and killed off Steve Rogers in the end."
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Personally my new favorite marvel movie. It had the perfect balance of fun, action and drama. it was suspenseful enough for the first watch and entertaining enough for me to watch again. The DC cinematic universe needs to learn how to balance itself with this one."
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The final battle between Cap, Stark and Bucky was so hard to watch. But Ant-man was funny and Spidey and Black Panther were good. Get well soon Rhodey."
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,Live's up to the hype
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Amazing, simply amazing that a movie like this can exist in this day and age, especially after how many people said it could never be done. Sure the Avengers pulled of the improbable, but this film finally pulls off the impossible. A full breathing, living comic book world that doesn't feel like a comic book, it feels like real life. And that after all, is what it should be at this point.Every character, treated with such respect and nuance, not as ""comic books superheroes"" but real people with real believable motives in a world that feels real. Take note competitors and imitators...this is how it's done."
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Take the best part of the Captain America films and combine that with the best part of The Avengers, with a few new additions, including the best Spiderman to date, and you get this very enjoyable third installment of the Captain America series.  This is also the best yet with near enough non-stop action."
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,The Best Marvel Movie Yet!!
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,A little slow at the beginning and only became enjoyable when Spider-Man was introduced and the action started in earnest. Much better than Age of Ultron at mixing all the characters together. Enjoyed Antman's return to the screen as it brought some humour to what was a boring first half of the film.
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,la mejor pelicula de marvel es exelente
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,The best super hero movie in this moment!
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"A good genre film. This film had some very good ideas in the screenplay. It some genuinely humourous and witty dialogue, however the humour sometimes was badly timed and effected the dramatic tension. It also made Spider-Man an annoying character. Generally fine on the acting front, and technically a treat of visual effects, however the music and cinematography wasn't stand-out. A flawed film, which has some great potential but lesser in terms of execution."
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"too, long some moments are so boring, the comedy in the movie is awful...."
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Russo brothers all the way, Great movie and I'm glad that Russo brothers will direct the Infinity War part 1 and 2! I love the twist and I love how they team up. I don't pick side 'cause I understand the point of view of Captain America and Ironman and that is what I like about this movie the directors and writers clearly shows what Team Cap and Team Ironman point of view is, why they are against to each other. One thing I hate about this movie is the reason behind all of this."
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Best superero film to date, the plot was amazing so was the cast and Spidey"
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"First, if you're a nerd and you can't take it on its own merits, don't bother; even casual comic aficionados will raise an eyebrow at Marvel's civil war being turned into more of a petty squabble, and if it does have a weak point, it's definitely that the convoluted scheme setting the plot into motion just doesn't stack up if you think about it too much (which you probably shouldn't).  That aside, this entry more than keeps the franchiverse chugging along nicely.  Carrying on with the espionage theme of Winter Soldier (pretty much the only reason this is a Cap'n movie rather than an Avengers movie) the action sequences this time are more Bond than Bourne, and all the better for it.  Most viewer's biggest fear - what the hell happens when you pile on so many characters at once - turns out to be a non-issue, the sprawling ensemble cast serves the story, and the shifting allegiances and alliances in what is essentially a deadly game of office politics never feel less than real.  The weight of numbers means that you get just enough but no more of some of the more traditionally useless members of the ensemble (ahem, Jeremy Renner and Don Cheadle) and you're constantly surprised by where the film focuses its attention next.  Between the debut of the kick-arse Chadwick Boseman and Elizabeth Olsen's full throttle return, this one also leaves you with something Age of Ultron didn't accomplish - confidence that Marvel can go 'next generation' without all interest disappearing when the current principle cast does."
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Quite possibly the best film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The action is solid, the characters are well written, and the story is thought provoking and interesting enough to keep its viewers interested throughout the entire runtime."
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,A huge improvement on Age of Ultron but Cap's previous solo outing is superior in every way. The strengths of this film lay in the interactions and conflict between the characters and Tony hasn't been this likeable since the first Iron Man. This is also a great introduction to the new (and best) Spider-Man and Black Panther.
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,Gripping with high voltage action and surely the best written marvel flick
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Great stuff, thoroughly enjoyable and hard to fault. Black Panther in particular was spectacular and I can't wait to see it again!"
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"it's overall a decent movie, jokes were thrown in places which don't need them, making it less serious and less engaging, guy its civil war, not a sparring match, Pacing is a bit slow, conversation was not as engaging. Villian motivation was good but execution was kinda poor, plot was really carried out by chance and luck........ the movie only gets better by the 3rd act, in fact, u can skip the first 2 act and still get the 3rd act, that is how irrelevant the first 2 act were, the airport scene was not as great as everybody say it was, airport scene = the star wars prequel lightsaber fight which is full of flare and stuns, there was no real stake involved during that fight. the fight we see in the end of the trailer involving bucky, cap and ironman was great, filled with raw emotion and stake involved. 
The final Ending scene was just a turn off after what i deem as a very engaging emotional act 3, i will just leave it there, 
Problem for me was how the film doesn't feel like a captain America film or an avenger film, title this movie IRON MAN ""Civil War""
people cannot disagree...... it more of a struggle in Tony stark not captain America.
IRON Man has become what wolverine was in X1-2-3, where story is revolving mostly around wolverine, same goes to civil war where story does not revolve around steve, instead, it revolve around tony.

Spiderman was great but he was really shoehorned in, he wasn't needed that AT ALL, but still it was great to see him.

surprising how black panther was shockingly good in this film."
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I'm not really a massive fan of epic blockbuster superhero movies but perhaps I can make an exception since Tom Holland and Paul Rudd are in the house. And the amazing Stan Lee made an appearance too (Stank!).

The story was mainly about two opposing teams led by Steve on one side and Tony on the other. Each group had a different point of view when it came to saving the world. It started when a mission was recklessly carried, which led to the necessity of the government's involvement. After seeing the aftermaths of their actions, the characters (heroes) had somehow formed a dramatic incompatibility of opinions resulting from their disagreements on what they believed was more humane.

The Russos did it again. They had somehow managed to make the film so carefully exceptional so as not to fail any related installment that may have any connection to the movie -- to maintain that compelling impression intact. The sound and visual effects were a perfected craft of genius and creativity. Each superhero was highlighted with importance, deliberately thought out through. The writers had also kept that deftly fun, light mood that most Marvel movies have and almost all DC movies lack. It's simply an outstanding film with remarkable scenes that would leave you on the edge of your seat with eyes fixated only at the screen and an o-shaped ajar mouth.

The much-awaited entrance of the amazing spiderman really had made the movie more exciting than before. During the casting, I could really tell that Tom had it in him, what with his highly impressive stunt videos on Instragram and his geeky, charming talent that earned him awards from The Impossible film. Such a dreamboat. Ling.

It's a truly successful action-packed thriller with an emotional coherence that has surpassed everyone's expectations, I think."
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,A well put together film with fan favourite moments and thrilling action. One of Marvels best films so far!
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,The best marvel movie so far
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Simply put, Captain America: Civil War is THE best Marvel film to date. Combining the grit of the espionage twinged ""Winter Soldier"" with the balls to the wall colourful fun of ""Avengers Assemble"", the Russo Brothers have crafted Marvel's most mature, well rounded and fun movie in their vast amassing catalogue. Chris Evans' 5th outing as Captain America in his 3rd solo movie is by far his best performance and ties up the trilogy in a nice succinct way that is thematically satisfying too. Robert Downey Jr. of course is perfect in what almost feels like his tailored made role as Iron Man, however, we have never seen Stark so despondent and out of his element which adds an interesting twist to his otherwise 24/7 quirky personality. But that's not all - Civil War is filled to it's boots with heroes (Hawkeye, Black Panther, Black Widow etc etc etc) where everyone is given ample amount of time and serve every scene they're in to the letter. For example, while I wasn't particularly keen on Ant-Man's solo movie as a whole, Paul Rudd shines whenever he is on screen and provides some of the biggest laughs in the entire picture in what feels like a largely improvised performance. However... Without giving too much away - I gotta say - Tom Holland's Spider-Man in the limited time he appears in the runtime is the most fun Spider-Man has been on screen in years. Quippy, nerdy and just completely lovely; Holland's performance and take on the character makes me thoroughly excited to see him in his future solo outing (I can't believe i'm excited for another NEW Spider-Man movie). The pace is quick and choppy, however the film never tends to feel messy and for me the 2hr and 26minute run positively flew by. With all the fun of seeing heroes duke it out on screen, the film never feels jarring when it's juxtaposed with the espionage twist-based nature of the plot. I'm just... lbubnfjbfbdvfjd... Still gathering my thoughts... But all I know is, I want to see it again. Like right now. So yeah, get to fuck and go see it!"
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Good action , Captain America vs Iron Man , right vs ego !! All characters from the past avengers but new pop in's.   

Ant Man , brilliant in as he rips apart iron mans suit and then turns big which causes some funny fight parts. 

Spider man ( boy) pops in 

Basic story line which creates turmoil with the Avengers team. 

Will be good to see what happens when Thor arrives back."
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War is the best movie from Marvel, I enjoyed every minute!"
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,Wow wow wow all I can say is we have finally found our Spider-Man
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This was a fantastic movie, with great action and enough character building time with all the superheroes. You can understand both sides and Tony isn't portrayed as a villain like he was in the comics. It is natural to change your opinions again and again on their argument throughout the movie. The final act of the movie was emotionally gut-wrenching and was the best part. Black Panther and Spidey had great introductions and Robert Downey Jr gave his best film performance yet."
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"first Marvel movie that I don´t like, lots of drama, good ppl die, none of the guilty Avengers"
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"worst marvel movie in a while. opening scenes okay then bored the shit out me for the next hour and a bit, then battle between captain his pals and ironman and his pals. spidermans a wee fanny boy playing him ffs whered you find him a nursery and he was absolute shit. 

watched avengers based movies multiple times this one seen it once thatl do. another best bits in trailer movie."
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,Not my taste of movies and i'm not a fan of comics whatsoever but its very well made and contains an interesting plot. Nice twists also.
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Ono more time, nobody dies"
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Overall I liked it, but it was a bit disappointing it some areas. There are good points like the new Spider-Man, Black Panther & the big fight scene at the airport, which is spectacular. The film doesn't take many risks, which is a bit disappointing considering the story if is based off. The plot is a bit weak as a result & the villains are again very forgettable & largely pointless. 3.5 out 5"
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Great, fun strong movie, the best in the MCU. For someone who thought the avengers where just fine and age of Ultron was pretty much the same, this is the perfect avengers movie, plus it is a great story."
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Most of the action scenes (which drive the plot along) felt quite inconsequential and failed to tug at any emotions at all. The sequences are mostly spectacular but they never pose enough danger to characters for the audience to feel that they might just get hurt or die. And oh, there is over use of shakey cam for the punch 'em up scenes. 

Maybe cinema is just over saturated with superhero movies currently, for Captain America Civil War felt really boring. The run time of two and half hours actually felt much longer than that.

At least the plothole riddened BVS still somewhat tugged at raw emotions when people around the main characters die due to stupid decisions made by them. 
There is much talk about people getting hurt by the Avengers in this movie, but there is just a lack of emotional hit despite it being the cause of the story's theme.

There is a huge plus point in civil war and that's the reintroduction of a school boy Peter Parker as Spiderman. His appearances offered much joy."
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"A fantastic adaptation of the legendary comic. The story was excellent and both sides of the fight had very compelling arguments, which led to a very interesting struggle between which one was the right one to go with and led to a brilliant clash that might be one of the best battles in a Marvel film to date. It had it's serious moments but some of the funniest moments in any Marvel film as well, with Spider-Man and Ant Man stealing the show in that department. Both newcomers, Spider-Man (Tom Holland) and Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) were amazing in their roles and were arguably perfect picks for those characters. Overall this film is a must watch for any Marvel fan; a film with a compelling plot that could well be the best film of the year."
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Inconclusive film. There was no ""war"" was more a civil fight. And that even the subject became irrelevant and was not resolved. Similarly, as the main plot was quite shallow. Positives are Spider-Man, Ant-Man and the Panther."
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,An excellent addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Marvel keep up the great work with this latest instalment of Captain America (which is on par with The Winter Soldier imo)

Spidey & Black Panther are great additions to the MCU!

"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,was okay way to overhyped no where near as good as these critics are saying
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best Marvel movie to date.
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,Great movie but not as good as the previous installment. How the critic s can give this more than B.Vs S is concerning...
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Civil War slows down to give the audience the story and depth missing from the last few movies of the MCU while simultaneously offering up an awesome ensemble of characters (some old, some new) as well as great action sequences. One of the best Marvel films to date."
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Juste du bonbon du debut a la fin, malgré que black widow cache son cul tout le long :("
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,This movie was all over the place. The fight scenes were phenomenal!!! but the plot is very poor and messy.
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I feel very conflicted about this movie. It was good but not my favorite, maybe my expectations were too high. The story was alright. I felt like there was not much character development aside from Black Panther and Iron Man. Everyone else was sorta just crammed in there. I did have fun watching it and the funny moments were great. Black Panther was the best part, hands down."
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It just runs away from the original comic story. Where the comics follow more ideological lines, discuss the temptation of fascism and other mature themes, this film adaptation is just about two guys being manipulated by a vengeful villain. And also, criminally sexualize the only non sexualized main feminine character of the Marvel Universe. I wonder if  there is any problem with being old. Where the comics were a master piece, this half hearted flick is just bunch of really good action scenes put together under a terrible plot."
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"With amazing action set pieces, a very compelling villain and a very solid story, Captain Anerica: Civil War is in the Marvel holy trinity, besides Avengers and Captain America 2."
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I liked batman vs superman and is a do fan coming into this film planning on hating this film but this is amazing! The fights had comedy, drama and suspense and the film flowed so well. That is also the films only problem, i wasn't sure whether captain America and iron man were friends or enemies half way through and they didn't use Spider-Man as much as I would like. But those are insignificant compered to everything els because i... Just can't... Just go watch it. I didn't like any of the avengers films but I love this DC and marvel fans will love it equally."
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Just take Zemo out and this one is undoubtedly the best Marvel movie ever. It's mature like Winter Soldier, but comical like every superhero movie should be."
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,Pra mim é Capitão América - Soldado Invernal Part 2. É isso é muito melhor do que imaginei! Best Marvel Movie Ever!
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America Civil War (""He's My Friend""... ""So Was I"") (Quick Review)
Civil War has begun as Cap and Iron Man clash over political differences. The catastrophic events of the past has caught up. The Avengers are all to be held accountable for. But who is right? Cap who believes in freedom the will to do what needs to be done without govern restrictions! or Iron Man who believes restrictions and rules for superheroes will create a more stable world! Iron Man understands the consequences of no restrictions I mean he did create Ultron afterall and Cap well he has experienced first hand that shackles are bonded with corruption.

Cap and Iron Man have never seen eye to eye ever since The Avengers and it's clear this confrontation was building up. Director Josh Whedon at the time did a fantastic job of creating this conflict in The Avengers probably knowing someday that Civil War would happen. I admire Marvel for thinking ahead and connecting the story years later. Cap and Iron Man have come a long way ever since The Avengers there morales and ethics are still different either of them could be right because both of there arguments are valid and logical as you see throughout the movie.

If you enjoyed the new turn The Winter Solider took into more grounded superhero genre territory  you will enjoy this movie. Civil War is in the same boat but in a much bigger scale with more heroes on screen including new addition's Black Panther and Spider Man both who are done exceptional well. It's clear directors The Russo Brothers see these characters as the fans do and for a movie with so many superheroes on-screen The Russo Brothers found a way not the pollute the movie by only giving us snip bits here and there of them.
Civil War is movie that relies on your knowledge of the previous movies such as The First Avenger, Avengers, Winter Solider and Age Of Ultron you will be lost if you haven't at least seen Winter Solider.

Verdict
Captain America Civil War adds just enough screen time to introduce new characters while not over overindulging us with unnecessary story arc while still keeping to what the movie is centred around Cap v Iron Man."
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"They have definately stepped up their game with this movie, it was definately on another level of awesome. Fight scene at the airport definate highlight and wow Black Panther."
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"One of the best Marvel movies I've seen. Spider-Man, Ant-Man, Black Panther, and most of the characters were amazing."
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Best Movie Of 2016 Because Of Its Very Great Plot , Action Great Choreograph Scenes And Actors"
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,A great movie for fans of the MCU
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The thirteenth film in the Avengers saga veered away from the usual formula and delved into challenging motifs in the same style as its predecessor, Winter Soldier, resulting to a remarkable and spectacular superhero thriller. It has been said several times already but it's worth mentioning again that Captain America: Civil War is, by far, the best entry to the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The Civil War is a great superhero movie, especially the airport scene and Spiderman.. But somehow, i just feel that it needs more epic moments for the movie in this kind of scale.. Maybe i was too excited or expecting too much.."
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War eschews the dull trend of citywide destruction, instead the plot focus on the guilt of having caused all that ruin, eventually loyalties, powers, abilities and egos start to tear them apart. In spit an overflowing with characters, the Russo brothers brilliantly balance old favourites with new ones, while continuing The Winter Soldier's sense of mystery and intrigue to keep comicbook fans or audiences alike the joie de vivre."
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Hmmmmmm. I'm not really convinced. Yes the story line was more mature and the new characters that were introduced were fun, but....it felt long, it didn't really hit its boot straps until halfway through, it want as much fun as previous Marvel movies and, in places, it was just plain silly if that's even possible"
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,just awsome just see it is wirth the price and wait
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Here you go, DC. This is how you make a ""vs"" movie."
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Another Brilliant film by Marvel! Excellent performances by the talented ensemble cast! Fantastic storyline, fight scenes and graphics!

I can't wait for the next Marvel film!"
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"A more satisfying Marvel ensemble piece than either of the previous Avenger films, Civil War delivers on the action, tension, humor.  More importantly, it also makes you think."
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"WHAT I LIKED: The final act of this movie is the real take-away, as the final battle alone is enough to warrant your money. It's emotionally heart-breaking and thankfully proves that Marvel aren't afraid to test the boundaries of their characters and relationships. The gravitas of this though is only possible thanks to an efficient set-up that the Russos craft well - littered with great action and touching moments that all really click together.
WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: That super-efficient set-up does strip some life from the movie though, as the Russos don't give long enough in each moment to create real engagement or emotion. This in turn makes it feel a little manufactured, and less human than other MCU stories. That's not to mention the lack of style, or the out-of-place character decisions either...
VERDICT: Whilst not really engaging on a human (or spectacle) level for its majority, Civil War is well made, and contains the best final act in any MCU movie ever."
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Best Marvel movie yet. It was way more lighthearted than I expected yet emotionally darker too, especially the JAW-DROPPING end scene! The only critisisms I have is that although Zemo was a fantastic villain he should have been cut, & the screenwriters/costume designers completely RUINED Vision. I can't complain though, I love all the characters in this movie. The action truly made me speechless & it was incredible how the Russo bros tore the Avengers in half."
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"An intense environment for Civil war, the action parts were insane, it is definitely a psychological thriller."
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It was an absolutely fantastic movie. Like many Marvel movies past, it does not fail to disappoint. However, my only gripe with it is it should be called ""Avengers -- Civil War,"" not ""Captain America -- Civil War."" Not enough focus on Cap' for a Captain America movie. But to reiterate, it was still a VERY GOOD movie."
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,Spidey stole the show
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This two and a half hour blockbuster can be called an entry in the Captain America film series only loosely; more than anything its a story about the Avengers. Above all, its chilling, thrilling, and impeccably human. Despite the fact that Ant-Man becomes Giant-Man (in a endearing and utterly perfect manner, thanks to Paul Rudd's performance as Scott Lang), or that T'Challa breaks out the Black Panther garb while still managing to be shrouded in mystery (Chadwick Boseman is by far the best addition to the MCU we saw in this film), it is ultimately a story about the lengths one man will go to save his best friend. Ironically enough, this may have been the least explored relationship: Steve and Bucky spend a lot of the movie fighting for each other or talking about each other but only once or twice did they talk to each other, likely due to the sheer amount of 'stuff' the Russo brothers had to pack into an already lengthy film. Other characters may have suffered from ""so much to do, so little time"" issue: Natasha (who is yet again a different version of herself, this time a strangely solemn one) disappears at the end of the second third of the movie with little to no explanation, so much so that you don't realise she's gone until she doesn't come back. The relationship between Steve and Sharon also felt forced (Steve remarks that their awkward kiss was ""late"" but to the audience it feels rather rushed), and happens fairly early in the film, leaving Sharon nowhere to go but away.  And Baron Zemo, as villains go, was decidedly lackluster, not frightening or threatening but mostly pitiful. For the most part, he served as a way to stir up tension, which he did very well, and which actors Robert Downey Junior and Chris Evans carried with the utmost skill and grace. Other highlights: the rivalry between Captain America's two best friends Sam and Bucky, the little we saw of Jeremy Renner's Clint Barton, and the gorgeous, exhilarating fight choreography we saw in Winter Soldier. The best part, however, was that, despite the Team Cap vs Team Iron Man mania that makes up the entirety of the film's marketing strategy, at the end you are left unable to truly say which of the two sides you are on, thanks to the grace and the thought the Russos put into both."
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"""The Greatest Marvel film Ever"" seems to be the general consensus amongst critics across the globe. Either they watched a different film to me or Disney have payed them some serious cash. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it, it's exciting and full of great moments but to call this ""the best yet"" is an insult to other films in the series which are far superior. 
The first hour is a bore, there's no getting away from that fact, also the tone is even more dark and serious much like DC's last offering. However when Spider-Man and Ant-Man show up the film comes to life and it is a joy to watch from that moment. The banter is present as is the fantastic action and great special effects. 
The thing is this is nothing new, it doesn't change anything, you've seen it all before but audiences lap it up. A sold out audience laughed at all the moments when they were supposed to laugh and stayed until the end. It's become normal I think to adore anything Marvel churns out. People ignore what is right in front of them. 
This isn't a 5 star film and for it to sit at nearly 100% positive reviews is just baffling. 
The elephant in the room is obviously Batman v Superman which people seemed to dislike before it was even released. 
Marvel films it seems are now critic proof and this latest offering has surely proven it. 
I do love a lot of what they have released and films such as the first Iron Man, The Avengers and The Winter Soldier are much better films in my opinion, but it seems I'm in the minority."
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Ok, I'll say it. The premise was thinner than public toilet paper. Once again, we fall back on that tired plot device of making smart characters stupid. Really, unforgivably stupid. 
Yes, I love these characters and there were lots of good sequences and even character developments BUT every time I started to buy in again, these ridiculous, paper-thin plot devices, slapped me back to reality. I remain astounded that it scores so highly."
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,Marvel's Best Movie yet.......
"Apr 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The greatest superhero movie of all time. I don't say that lightly as I consider all the movies that I now have beneath this film in terms of quality, The Avengers, Winter Soldier, X-Men 2 and even the original Batman and Superman films. 

I remember my excitement when going to watch the first Avengers film or when I saw the original Spider-Man film for the first time, and although my anticipation levels may have been higher, In terms of quality, I can't think of another superhero movie that tops Civil War. 

The biggest challenge this film had, was giving sufficient screen time to so many characters. Thor and Hulk might not make appearances here but virtually every other MCU character does, and across the 150 minutes I never felt anyone got left out which is quite an achievement I feel. 

There are some fantastic scenes In the film, a couple of which I won't spoil for you but easily the best addition to the franchise was Spider-Man. Finally Marvels most iconic character Is part of the MCU. They do a great job of introducing him and his scenes certainly contain the most humour and leaves you excited for the forthcoming solo Spider-Man film In 2017. 

if you're up to date with all the Marvel films, you are going to love this!"
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Best superhero movie by far, why? Because it has the most engaging characters, the action scenes are like art brought to life, the narrative is a little slow at points but the dynamics of the characters and the fact we get to see some of the most iconic characters in modern culture battle it out on screen! Easily the greatest superhero movie ever and it will be very tough to beat!"
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Tengo que aceptar la agradable satisfacción que me produce que un blockbuster del género de superhéroes compagine cinematográficamente con lo que significa ser una buena película. Un par de escalones por debajo de ""El caballero de la noche"", Marvel toca techo con Capitán América Civil War a través de una historia sólida, un ritmo avasallante y el grato carisma de sus personajes. Esta película se construye entre un thriller político que aunque menos profundo e interesante que su predecesora (The Winter Soldier), se traslada de forma orgánica al ámbito personal de los protagonistas ofreciendo un enfrentamiento complejo en lo emocional y lo ético
Aclaración importante, Civil War sigue siendo una película palomitera anclada a la inercia creativa que hoy nubla a Hollywood  donde el superhéroe es el nuevo clásico; en este sentido su  tercer conducto junto al emocional y lo político: es el espectáculo, la acción y la comedia; pero contrario a la formula avengers 2, estos aparecen en sus justas proporciones mientras le aportan a la película ritmo, entretenimiento y espectacularidad visual. Por otro lado permiten  refrescar la producción en su segundo acto otorgando al espectador un descanso,  justo antes de adentrarse en el intenso desenlace final. 
De la mano de los hermanos Russo que no son Nolan (maestro de la autoría y la comercialidad) pero que  tampoco son Snyder y Whedon (forma sin sustancia), la guerra civil de Marvel es una mezcla hábil de las mejores características que nos ha dado el universo cinematográfico de esta franquicia en la última década. Su planteamiento  funciona con una eficacia tremenda contrario a la arriesgada pero incoherente, desordenada, saturada y precipitada Batman v Superman.  
Los Russo hacen malabares para entregar una historia coherente  con un guion variopinto  compuesto de diferentes fórmulas narrativas. El gigantesco elenco de la película que podría suponer un problema es resuelto sutilmente  entregándole a cada personaje su momento de pantalla (con distintos niveles de trascendencia) pero sin olvidar que es una película del Capitán América y que es a través de él que la historia se desarrolla. Por último la película funciona como una unidad en sí misma pero de forma integra con la continuidad de la franquicia en la que se apoya y sobre la que también construye. 
El gran triunfo del guion es hacer perfectamente legítimas y humanas las dos posturas encontradas, lo cual termina desembocando en un final  con una intensidad emocional digno de la palabra épico, sin embargo tengo que decir que falto un detalle presente en el comic para que la película fuera redonda con un final trágico y aturdidor (lamentablemente Marvel ama mucho a sus personajes para matarlos). Si conoces el comic de Mark Millar, advierto, no esperes algo semejante en la película, de hecho mi principal conflicto es por el título de la cinta. Sin embargo más allá de que no sea una adaptación del comic, de la falta de valentía de Marvel en ciertos aspectos y de uno que otro detalle y personaje  que sobraban en la historia (aunque su presencia sea agradable como Spiderman )  Civil War en su peso mismo y en su desarrollo es una gran película...  Palomitas, palomitas  y mucho más"
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Just back from ""Captain America: Civil War."" Awesome Marvel film. I would put it right up there with the original ""Avengers"" and ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" as far as the best of the Marvel Cinematic Universe movie. So many awesome moments for comic fans... the fight scene at the airport where both sides finally face off against each other is not only a great action sequence but it may be the best comic book hero movie action sequence ever... gave me chills.
If there is one small complaint, it's that they are trying to do a LOT of things in this movie, including rebooting Spider-Man. So much so that at times it feels as if you're watching ""Avengers 3"" rather than a ""Captain America"" movie. That being said, the new Spider-Man is AWESOME, and I'm actually excited for a rebooted Spider-Man movie other than being quietly resigned as I was with the previous reboot.
Black Panther was also done incredibly well, and I can't wait to see that solo movie with him as well.
Just a great storyline... see, DC/Warner, this is what you get when you NATURALLY BUILD to a conflict so that it makes sense, rather than just doing the equivalent of slamming two action figures together for 2  1/2 hours (**cough**Batman vs. Superman**cough**). You totally buy the conflict between Tony Stark and Steve Rogers, and it's actually emotionally moving because of it.
Despite a brief slow-down after an action-packed start, this movie was a true delight. You'll love it even if you're not a comic book fan. The fact that I am made it even better."
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The Russo brothers are at it again. Brilliant story, great character motivations and awesome action."
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Marvel's Best so far. Not only does it manages to give all the amazing characters their fair share off screen time, but it also let's them show off. It has enought badass action to catch the eye of someone who's doesn't know any backstory and the story itself is pretty interesting and thought provoking. The events actually have a reason to occur and it doesn't feel forced. Plenty of good laughs too. The very, very high expectations were met and the bar is pretty high now. Not that DC's Batman Vs. Superman left it anywhere high to begin with."
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Before i watched the movie (2 times now), the trailers made me feel like Tony was once again trying to make things right and fucking up again, well he is trying to make things right, but this time we can understand why. From the scene at the MIT we can actually feel bad for him (and sad for the mother's kid) the kid's mother blames him for the death of her son and then he does too, and if that wasn't enough, the relationship between Tony and Pepper isn't good either :( The only way he sees to make things right is to be putting the avengers in check, and then i think you all know what is going to happen."
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"a real joy to watch. story, dialog, action. AMAZING. had the humor we all love about Marvel and each character was true! really a soft to behold!"
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Hands down Captain America: Civil War is greatest comic book movie ever made and the greatest Marvel movie to date. Spoilers free! As a fan and a person who grew up with comic books, I have to say, this movie delivers in every way, it's absolutely brilliant, so emotional, the conflict between both teams works out just perfect, the characters are amazingly developed throughout the movie and so full of emotion, every character has a reason and every character is important, TOM HOLLAND IS SPIDER-MAN! His interpretation of The Non-Mutant Super Hero is incredible, Black Panther is magnificent, a serious character in a journey of vengeance, and Ant-Man is one hell of a surprise. It's filled with breathtaking action scenes, the choreography is astonishing, the fights are the greatest I've ever seen in a comic book movie, so energized and vibrant, I've never heard a theater audience reacting like that in a movie, the Airport Fight it's an absolute spectacle of chaos and the most perfect example of what a REAL Super Hero Clash is suppossed to be. And despite never losing its great humor adding the perfect amount of comic relief (absolutely necessary in a movie where there's a lot of tragic events) this is also the most emotional, darkest and most violent Marvel movie to date, there are really dark parts in the movie, touching the limits of the PG-13 rating, the final fight takes a really dark tone and ends up in a heartbreaking and fierce Brother vs. Brother battle. The Russo brothers and Marvel Studios did an amazing job, redefining the genre with a solid and masterful work, and giving The Avengers a whole new tone, more human and emotional in a world where their actions affect the world around them more than ever before, even the political themes were done just right. You can truly feel the effort and the heart they put into it, I have no words, Captain America: Civil War is a masterpiece in every aspect and surpassed my expectations, I can't be happier with it and I'm gonna watch it as many times as I can. As a fan it was a joy and a gift (even the reference to Captain America's legendary speech in The Amazing Spider-Man #537 is just a nerdgasm). An event that must be seen by every true fan in the world."
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Another brilliant marvel film 10/10
Spiderman, Black Panther really good can't wait see them again. Rest of the cast all good to, acted there ass off.
My First review but this film deserves it"
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"If the DC universe ever came this close to a such a captivating cast and story line....WOW.  Please do not ever let Bryan Singer touch this branch of the tree, X-men, regardless of earnings has just never matched the ability to weave the fabric of these multiple story lines and characters. 
Captain America has moved far away form the origins story and really created the most solid character that seems to be the one the really binds all of them in mission focus... The way they have set everything up with the Iron Man/Stark family ark through out the multiple platforms from the birth of Cap to the cause and effect of action vs inaction. 
Watching these is is hard to imagine what Hollywood has in store for us in the future. 
Sound track great and not overwhelming like the loud boom boom of the first Superman and fancy filter work. Marvel makes everything visually enticing and easy to swallow bite size pieces.  Time fly's, so don't gobble down you popcorn for this great two hour feature."
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War is probably the best Marvel Studios movie yet, take that DC 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice'. At no point do you feel the time drag, a story that contains more drama, humour and most importantly fun than ever appeared in the DC's BvsS. Even at 147 minuets some characters seem a little under used and are only here to add to the visual spectacle in fight scenes. Tom Holland's Spiderman sequence leaves you wanting the 'Spiderman' film to just turn up now, Paul Rudd's Ant-Man still brings a smile, plus a host of other Avergers cameos. Chadwick Boseman's Black Panther is another character you'll enjoy and will be turning up to the Marvel's film roster. There are plenty scenes of mayhem and fights to go round and fill a dozen Superhero movies. For those who don't like this genre I'll say then that there is probably nothing here for you, stay home and leave it alone. The rest of you who do then your going to get your kicks from this one. Has is always the case with Marvel films there are post credit scenes, this time two, so you might want to sit around through those. So come along and enjoy the ride because it well worth it."
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,All the characters done perfectly and the film was great by itself too! Nice work Marvel ð???
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I had the pleasure in seeing yesterday evening the best movie of super heroes of my life, really all the characters are shown and the best thing they give unexpected drafts as a good adaptation independent from the comic, an intelligent villain and with big plot arch."
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,Another great Marvel film. Spidey stole the show. Looking forward to his solo film. Black Panther was also a welcome addition. Great story with good pace and a satisfying twist for you to get behind the characters motivations.
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Striking a perfect balance between Marvel's style and breaking the status quo, Captain America: Civil War not only serves as an immensely satisfying start for Phase 3 of the MCU, but also serves as the perfect end for the Captain America trilogy."
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME! Watched it twice in less than 24 hours already! I'm thinking of watching it for a 3rd time and 4th and 5th and 6th already!
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Esta película es mala hasta más no poder, o sea en serio rusos malos, y gente de color que arruina el plan; Wow que original!! Como siempre no se muere nadie de ellos. Y para colmo de colmos después de no sé cuántas películas, ahora si vienen a reclamar los familiares de las víctimas que murieron en alguna de sus ""batallas épicas"", o sea tengan tantita creatividad no, y por si fuera poco proponer acuerdos bajo un organismo internacional gubernamental para ponerles control y cesarlos, entiendo que Disney compro Marvel, pero no tienen que reciclar el plot de los increíbles a esta altura, cuando los  familiares de las víctimas jamás se habían aparecido y ahora resulta que están atrás de todo, meter 12 ""protagonistas"" en una película, (como las de Gary Marshall) es lo más bajo que puedes caer para que sea un boom taquillero. Con esta película solo se demuestra la obsesión de Marvel por hacer dinero y no historias, lo mismo que pasaba con los westerns en los 60's, solo se está produciendo en masa sin realmente innovar o dar algo más como escenas que realmente perduren en la memoria cinematográfica y se vuelvan películas de culto."
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"From  a person who loves a good classic caper style movie and appreciates the new generation of action films with superheroes from DC and Marvel universe, this is HANDS DOWN THE BEST DAMN MOVIE I HAVE EVER HAD THE PLEASURE OF WATCHING! You're eyes will dance in amazement at how well the story carries all characters throughout, it will pull at your heart strings and your mind will be BLOWN AWAY!! Go see this movie!! More than once!"
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Absolutely amazing, very entertaining."
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Best marvel movie, seen it twice already, going to see it again tomorrow! Cannot recommend it enough"
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,This is one beautiful onion layer cake of a story and movie. How the movie is told and unfolds is a testament to the superior movie making skills of the crew and cast. Warner and Zack Snyder get your notebooks out and take a long hard sobering look on how it's done properly.
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The greatest superhero movie ever made. Wonderful character development, a compelling conflict and the single best action sequence in any film set Civil War head-and-shoulders above all others. The final clash between Steve and Tony is heartbreaking, not merely due to a friendship lost but because of grief and crippling trauma that may never heal. *****/10 out of 10"
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,Omg This is better then that new starwars movie!!!
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"In Russo brothers we trust. This movie was everything a fan could ask for when their favourite superheroes are fighting each other. The characters were amazing, I am now so excited to see Spider-Man in his solo movie, and /that/ one battle scene was probably the best, most entertaining fights I have ever seen. This movie is emotional, exciting, hilarious and basically everything you could ask for from a movie. Super impressed, surpassed my expectations."
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,Captain America blew my face off!!!
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This is an emotional film. No more games. Dialogues and backstory are great. It's a film that focuses on an emotional battle between Tony and Steve. All the characters are great, and specially the new ones. There were applauses, screams and laughs. Truly. Probably the best Marvel film to date and the best action scene in years. It's so important to know the backstory of the characters, so go and see previous Marvel films if you didn't ;)"
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,Now that's what I'm talking about
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"To many unnecessary characters, slow to start, light on plot, felt like they squeezed one story into another and lost focus, undercooked lead, character arcs were flat except Spider-Man's, entertaining but not the 5 star film people are saying. However the 30 minutes with Spider-Man is awesome."
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,The most intelligent Marvel film yet with genuine character drama and humour. It also has the best action I have ever seen in a superhero film.
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,The best Marvel movie ever made.
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Not Marvels worst film but not the best either.  Whilst, the film has some good moments, the film doesn't feel like a Captain America film.  The film feels a little bloated and fall under the weight of so many different characters in one movie.  To give each character enough time (and even then barely) the story suffers, particularly because Marvel want to set up other movies.

The acting is good and there are some funny moments but I wish Marvel would stop trying to create their next franchise with each movie, it just means the movies suffers and this have been very noticeable with this and Avengers: Age of Ultron."
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Everything you could want from the 13th film in a blockbuster franchise and more. This is essentially the third Avengers film, just told from Captain America's perspective as opposed from the usual POV of Iron Man's. In fact it's a lot more thrilling and enjoyable than Age of Ultron,  with a novel plot, emotional weight and RDJ acting his balls off like he hasn't had chance to before in the MCU. All this is backed up with spectacular action, judicious humour and a compelling, new kind of villain. It's a sign of a good film when it makes the last Avengers film a better one than it originally was. Now I just have to decide who's cooler: Black Panther or the new and already definitive Spider-man?"
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The Russo's have worked magic on what could have been a chaoic movie but gives all the characters a chance to grow and especially developed Bucky and the Captain's friendship and explores the Winter soldier programme. Spiderman and Antman are the comic relief but this film balances the emotional content well with brutal, raw fights that were breathtaking and heartbreaking. I was only sad this ended up being a set up for the next Avengers movie but otherwise well worth the hype and the wait!"
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It is just so good! They were able to bring joy, fun, and some hear breaking moments to this movie, it was also thought provoking, the battles were AMAZING! It's hard to believe they were able to put this many characters in and make it great! Marvel never disappoints :P"
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"A solid entry into the massively enjoyable Marvel Cinematic Universe. I'll keep this spoiler-free: This movie suffers with a bit of a wonky middle third storywise but wraps things together amazingly in the finale! A very, very good start to Phase Three!"
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"As close to a damn near perfect Comic-book movie as we'll probably ever get. With the best portal of Spider-Man AND Peter Parker, this movie showed Batman v Superman how to do a complex Verses comic storyline the RIGHT way."
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,Some say that it's the best Marvel movie yet. That is not an unfair claim.
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,This is what you wanted an Avengers fighting each other movie to be. It was emotional but also funny. It gave all the heroes a good amount of screen time and awesome moments to shine.
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,Not much to say here. Simply THE BEST MOVIE OF THE FRANCHISE!                    E.P.I.C!
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This is the best movie in the MCU, loved every minute, worth every penny.

Story is excellent, action in the movie is the best I've ever watched, acting is great, CGI brilliant and camera is spectacular also two good directors."
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,Far too many 'heroes' in this one for me.
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain america civil war delivers an amazing plot, game changing action sequences, and a talented cast, which results in marvel's best movie yet."
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The film was ok, it wasn't Winter Soldier and strayed too far from the comic for my liking"
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,Robert Downey Jr.'s neck CGI is odd and Aunt May is young.
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Brilliant fight scenes, awesome special effects, great performances, and just a generally entertaining plotline, this film is a superhero battle film done right(take note DC). The MCU just goes from strength to strength!"
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,Not the best marvel movie. Very long
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,This is probably the most fun of the big marvel team-ups.  Spider-Man was absolutely hilarious!
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,Sensational action and some genuinely funny scenes (which Spider-Man utterly stole). A great movie.
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,Holy shit they finally made a good spider-man movie
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Good action and an interesting plot, but a somewhat unnecessary villain slightly bogs down an otherwise enjoyable movie."
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I need to see it again but my first thoughts on Captain America: Civil War are as follows:
Good fight scenes, some nice character development, lives up to the civil war title, does not live up to the Captain America title, the ending ruined an almost perfect film."
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Dope movie!!! I still have Winter Soldier as my favorite Marvel film because I liked that story a lot better; the action in CW was great, the story was okay. Spiderman was dope but FREAKIN Black Panther was the highlight of the movie for me.  Overall, I'll give it a 7.5/10."
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,Very successful. An adaptation not faithful but presents important elements of its printed version. A selection of well characterized and interpreted appropriately characters. The best film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Una vez mas a resolver los problemas que ellos crearon, por otro lado la adaptación muy buena para el corto numero de personajes y eventos previos en comparación con el universo del comic. Entretenida buenas secuencias de acción y pelea, y le dieron en el clavo con el tipo de humor que maneja spiderman"
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,One of the most entertaining movies I have seen and it really pays off if you have seen all the previous entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,The most perfect superhero movie since the original Superman - with fantastic action ð?¤?ð???ð???ð??»â??ð??»ð???
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best Super hero movie ever
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,Simply epic and awesome.
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"liked this movie a lot.  Good narrative and for the most part well paced, acting by some characters (RDJ in particular) is very impressive, even the marvel villain is nicely understated and avoids any predictable tropes.  Action is some of the best on film so credit to the directors and 2nd unit directors.   I particularly liked that the film avoided the normal scenes of mass destruction in the final act and instead went for an emotional showdown that you could see they were heading towards but couldn't stop from happening.

"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Many good things, that captain is not one of those"
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The Russo brothers continues the Captain America legacy by crafting a successful, overly-smart and big conclusion to the trilogy, adding more Marvel familiar and newer elements, but justifying their presence in an emotional-yet-exhilarating crossover that might as well serve for a more worthy and iconic sequel to the first Avengers, even if the humor stands in a minor but constant way, it doesn't stops this blockbuster to deliver just as Winter Soldier did in regards of its quality."
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Think this film series can't get any better? Well you and I would be very wrong, stunning is the only word I can think of, Part Cap, part Iron Man, part Avengers film it has everything, Incredible action sequences but also some thought provoking questions not just of right and wrong but who is responsible for the collateral damage of well intentioned actions."
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"An amazing movie with so much comedy, emotion and action. A true marvel movie! Great cast with lots of potential especially the new ones like spider-man, black panther, ant man and I would like to see Zemo's character develop just a little more as I would very much like to see what he has planned next. Best marvel, comic book and lets face movie in general ever!!!!! !:)"
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Marvel's Captain America: Civil War could have easily been a 2.5/5 if not for Chris Evans' smile at the end of the movie.

On a serious note, as someone who has read the comics, the movie could have done so much better. Firstly, Crossbones' appearance in the movie just felt like he was used to create buzz for the film when the 'set images leak' happened during the shoot. He could have been easily replaced with some Hydra assassin or a person with an agenda against the Avengers or what not. He had an even bigger role in the comics which made it even more so disappointing with how he was used in this movie. Next, the storyline in the comics had Spiderman as a critical centerpiece, with him being part of Iron Man's team and revelation of his identity sent out a huge message for other superheroes out there that did not wish to be registered with the government, whereas, the movie made Bucky Barnes the main plot point. Don't call the movie Civil War if you're veering that far away from the comics! Even Spidey's age is meant to be much older in the comics during Civil War. Plus, there's no iron spider outfit! Wouldn't work in the movie's timeline anyway but the trailer spoiled Spidey's outfit.

Aside to those, the movie was wayyyy toooooo longgggg (what's with all the long superhero movies these days?!) - certain parts of the movie dragged out too much and villain had such a weak agenda against the Avengers. The movie also had way too much happening in just one movie itself - could have almost been a complete mess of a movie if not for its organization.

The above made it sound like it was such a bad superhero movie isn't it? Hey, at least it's better than BvS! But how the film got to a 3/5 for me (aside to Chris Evans' smile), had these worked out well:

Black Panther's appearance was fabulous - had that charismatic air to him and all round tenacity that made his story an interesting plot point in the movie. The jokes were all on point, and I totally enjoyed 'Gi-ANT' Man's appearance. That chemistry between Scarlet Witch and Vision was enjoyable to watch, whereas the key highlight for me was of course, Spiderman. Watching him in his teenage years, just starting out and almost abandoning the mission to Germany for homework was incredibly adorable to watch, and his constant fanboying over the Avengers was too cute (though he talks a little too much).

The movie's great fun, but just didn't live up the expectations nor hype surrounding it, and I probably wouldn't watch it again because it was too draggy. Good for watching once with a weekday rate at the theatres."
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"What everyone is saying is true. This movie is great and sits in the top list among Iron Man, Avengers, GOTG and Capitan America TWS. The movie is not perfect but the low points are very few and well exceeded by the high points. 
Just go watch it. You won't be disappointed."
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Best Marvel movie, epic fights and a good storyline"
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Marvel has a better grip on Captain America than any of their heroes, and it can be said with confidence that the three movies come together to create the greatest superhero trilogy of all time"
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Finalmente, depois de sofrer muito esperando por esse filme, assisti ontem. E ele conseguiu alcançar um confortável e seguro lugar como meu filme favorito da Marvel, dividindo o espaço com o Soldado Invernal. Desde que saí ontem do cinema já li diversas reviews e o ponto mais importante e que mais concordei foi: o conflito Cap x Iron é a consequência, é um elemento que compõe a obra toda. Não é o objetivo do filme, longe disso. É um trecho da música. 
Humor na medida certa, ação fluída, roteiro lógico e verossímil e suspense que funciona. E pra não dizer que só tenho elogios [---SPOILER ALERT---]: senti falta de mais impacto, mais mortes, mais caos e destruição. Mas só tive essa impressão por causa dos quadrinhos.

Nota 9.5."
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Another best marvel movies, love it!"
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Capitain America Civil War adapta para el cine una de los crossover más importantes del universo Marvel en los pultimos años; para los fanáticos que conocen la historia no será una decepción, cada segundo de la película tiene acción y genera inquietudes en el espectador, a lo largo de su 146 minutos de duración (me quejo de las películas que duran 2 horas pero este caso es el tiempo justo para este filme) logra presentar de forma rápida pero precisa cuales son las razones que motivan a cada uno de los super personajes a tomar partido de cada uno de los bandos y el espectador inevitablemente hará parte de este choque de titanes que jamás se había visto en la pantalla grande. Si no es un aficionado a los comics también podrá disfrutar esta película, quedarse pegado al asiento y brincar de emoción durante las secuencias de acción que no lo dejaran descansar. Excelente película, otro hit para Marvel."
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I saw it, great, excelent movie."
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"muy forzada la trama y ademas carece de argumentación, solo rescato las escenas de acción y a spiderman, pero no transmite nada."
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Hands down the best Marvel film, if not the best superhero film.  A film big in scale that still feels extremely personal.  It could've easily have been Avengers 2.5, but this is definitely a Captain America film.  Every character feels fleshed out, the bonus of having 12 films building up to this moment, and they all get their moments to shine.  The action is fluid and a pure joy to watch, whilst the dialogue is sharp, witty, with no filler.

Can't recommend this enough"
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,Captain America has always been the strongest character in these stories and this doesn't disappoint. Whilst filled with stars it still manages to tell a coherent story and include cameos from previous films and the TV spin-offs. The time goes quickly and the overall film is very enjoyable. Wait until the very end for the two extra scenes.
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Same old, same old. A movie for fanboys. A big bore. Maybe worse then B vs S."
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Civil War is the perfect combination of all MCU ingredients, the perfect blockbuster of the year, the Russo brothers take the comic and adapted the best way possible.
I'm desperate to see Infinity War"
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,Another year another Mavel epic - perhaps becoming a bit formulatic but there is no denying this film is awesome. Nice to finally see Mavel's take on Spider-Man...
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The Russo Brothers have a mountain to climb after making The Winter Soldier; a story of spies and secrets which held its own as not just a great Marvel film, but just an overall fantastic film. 

Civil War begins as more collateral damage hits innocent people as the Avengers mission misfires. Captain America believes the Avengers should have the freedom to move the world and keep it safe at any cost. Tony Stark AKA Iron Man, disagrees.

Sides are drawn, heroes take their platforms, and the stage is set for the biggest superhero showdown ever brought to the big screen. Yes, Captain America: Civil War is the best superhero (not comic book, that still is held by The Dark Knight.) made to date. 

The Russo Brothers have again made a film which feels deep, layered, and difficult to fully make a decision of who is right, and who is wrong. Both have convincing arguments, played brilliantly by all the cast. The plot is still running and enhancing from its previous films, so the platforms for caring about each of these characters is already set. It's been a eight year job, but it's been incredibly successful so far. The struggles of both sides having a valid reason for their points is only made worse by their personal issues, be it protecting a friend, or trying not to get anymore people hurt. 

For a moody tense narrative, CW is often lighthearted, with lots of comedic moments. The introduction of Black Panther and Spider-Man doesn't clog it's already overflowing either, they add to the wheel which continues to spin into what can only be called the best superhero brawl shown on film. Everyone has their moment to shine, which just bursts when it's beautifully chereographed and handled by such a fantastic cast and crew. 

I have no doubt in saying this is the best superhero film made so far. Weaved and sowed by eight years of creating a cinematic universe for these comic book characters. Captain America: Civil War is best Marvel film made so far. The hard work has paid off."
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"A near-perfectly executed comic book film for the post-Bourne era. Fun, intelligent and character-driven without action scenes that feel more grounded and relatable, as opposed to laying waste to cgi cities. Bravo, Russo Bros."
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Awesome, Just Awesome!!"
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Boring piece of rubbish that made me suddenly want to see an art-house movie, (and I haven't had that thought for a while) or any movie about  actual real people. It was like, ""no one cares about you superheroes because you are all glum, you are witless, humourless and taking yourselves way too seriously"". The whole first 20 minutes dragged on despite the fight scenes which were edited so that they were all choppy, which added nothing at all. I could not bear to even stay until the end. Mark my words, you'll sit there waiting and hoping that surely it will get better than a video game, but it doesn't. It's just tedious, cliched, predictable, dull and boring. My husband stayed hoping that I was wrong. He'd invested far too much in the idea to be able to realise, as quickly as I did, that the thing STANK."
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War is certainly the best movie on the Marvel Cinematic Universe up to date. 2 hours and 26 minutes packed with flawless action sequences, combined with a quality product and characters we already know and love, along with new ones we never thought we'd see together on screen, provides a joyful experience and it delivers the statement that Marvel always manages to stay on top.

*SPOILERS* 

After the fight sequence including Scarlet Witch, Falcon and Cap that we've seen on the teasers, a crucial breaking point to the plot starts to develop. After that, the movie can turn a little dull for a good 20 minutes, but it is also very important because it explains each point of view and the motives that drive the characters to act as they do.

Spider-Man was introduced organically into the story and didn't mess with the continuity of the plot. Tom Holland did a marvelous job as our friendly neighbor Spidey. He was funny and witty. Although we could've gotten a little more Peter Parker screen time. Overall, I can honestly say that we've seen the best personification of Spider-Man so far. Plus, the suit looks amazing.

Ant-Man's Paul Rudd was very funny, as usual. Even though we couldn't see much of him. Of course that's understandable since he'll be getting his second stand alone movie very soon. Giant-Man was a nice ""surprise"" (thanks, Funko.) 

Black Panther was magnificent. He's a very powerful, intimidating, noble, emotional and a character with very clear motives. His fight sequences are some of the most incredible I've seen on screen.

Of course the movie was centralized on the internal conflict between The Avengers, but non of that could've been possible without Baron Zemo. A somewhat discrete villain managed to create mayhem using the power of persistence and dedication. Marvel hasn't had many memorable villains, but this one delivered its purpose.

It was a nice change of pace that the producers decided to take on the story from a darker perspective. They did it with the Winter Soldier and progressively took it onto Cap's third installment.

Marvel continues to please the audience and critics, that is why we will stand by them till the end of the line... Wink."
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"A worthy sequel to the first Avengers (ignores Age of Ultron, which is decent but just doesn't compare). Comparisons with Batman v Superman is inevitable but fortunately? Civil War is much better than BvS in many areas and overall simply the better movie. There was not a single moment where I wasn't entertained when I watched the movie. Even more amazing is how well everything fits together in spite of the crazy amount of cast very big scope.

Definitely recommended."
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I went to watch this movie not expecting much. I wasn't a huge fan of Age Of Ultron. The first Iron Man, the second Hulk, Thor are amongst my favourites. What those movies have in common are somewhat of a grounding in reality, albeit a hyper one. So that being said, Captain America Civil War follows suit, and exceeded my expectations of another kid friendly outing ala either Avengers movie. The Russo brothers did an excellent job of mounting the tension between our two (literal) heroes portrayed by Evans and Downey Jr. Both arguments between the characters are presented unbiasedly, and you can see the for and against. Likewise, you can understand why subsequent characters take the sides that they do. Hulk and Thor are notably missing. This is briefly referred to, and one wonders if either of the characters being included would have weighed too heavily on the outcome of the inevitable battle scene. As everyone knows by now, Spiderman is bought into the mix. And yet again Marvel have taken the liberty of re-booting his origins somewhat. Mild spoiler alert coming up. So Tony Stark now gives Spidey the push he needs into becoming a fully fledged superhero after he's admittedly only been swinging around for 6 months prior to their meeting after 'something' happened. I'm assuming he meant the death of his presumably much younger than Martin Sheen Uncle Ben, if the new Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) is anything to go by. It's fine, it's glossed over quickly (but nicely nevertheless, this movie has a lot to squeeze in), and Tom Holland sounds exactly how Peter Parker should sound, and has firmly rooted the character back in his proper scrawny teenage roots. Spidey is basically there as a nice touch, a prize for fans, and setting up next years 'Homecoming' with Downey Jr likely 100% involved. Now if only Marvel could make a similar deal with Fox and get the X-Men onboard before the 'current' cast start getting a little too long in tooth. Civil War could likely be anyone's movie, but as the story heavily revolves around Cap's bff Bucky, it's the Captains film no matter if you're on his side or not. It bounces around the globe, each new location having the name of the city emblazoned across the screen in stark white bold letters, giving the vibe of a slick spy thriller. Which to some extent it is. Performances all around are great, from the newcomers and the seasoned cast. The big epic face-off is done not without a good dose of humour, and the inclusion of Spiderman and Antman make it fresh and interesting as each show off their respective skill-set. But it really comes down to the tension between Downey Jr and Evans that carry this film to an exciting crescendo, and the will they won't they still be buddies when all is said and done."
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,in contrast to last months gritty frustrating nonsensical dc hammer blow; civil war is a powerhouse. showcasing great character development. motives and ideologies you understand as they have been built up over 7 films. my only real negative (not even that) is with marvel films plots starting consistently showcase villains/big bads of the movie being direct results of a specific character/s actions. such as ultron being created by starks Mistakes. but the way they use this to set up the final battle is really interesting. in all best marvel movie yet?...could well be.
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"A great Marvel universe movie!
The new characters are great especially Spidermen :)

This movie is actually Cap. America Vs. Iron Man and is (so much) better than Batman Vs. Superman in every possible way."

It´s incredible that after 13 movies looking at all this heroes I am feeling surprise again.  They keep doing this better and better. Captain America: Civil War is a masterpiece. One of the best movies I´ve ever seen in the Super Hero genre. A lot of well paced action, with motivation and two political ideas, both with benefits and disadvantages but at the end with reasons. You will stay on the edge of your sit from beginning to end. And let´s talk about the two new introductions; Black Panther is seriously the most serious character of the movie, in a great way, And Spidey, well... Yes, he is the best live-action Spider Man, it´s like watching the 90s animated tv show from Fox Kids, I cannot believed it. I felt like a kid. And of course the showdown between all this lovely characters is an orgasmic fight of geek fever, the best fight ever and the most fun one. 5 stars out of 5 stars."

"Apr 28, 2016",NEUTRAL,"AMAZING, my first Marvel Movie in 3-D at the cinema 
 
Story:
Continuing off after Aftermath of destruction which occurred by Ultron in Avengers: Age of Ultron and the Debut of Ant-Man 
The Avengers are a high risk on the world as many of people have been killed in the name of peace so the Government has called them in to take control of the Avengers with the a world agreement that they will only be used if they are highly need and to do what the country's agree a pond what they believe is a threat 

Bucky Barnes/The Winter Solider returns with Steve Rogers/Captain America still looking for his best friend after their last battle which took place during the events in Captain America: The Winter Soldier where Bucky saves Steve life and saved him from dying after the falling from a Helicarrier in to the water and almost drowning Steve Knows after Hydra brainwashed Bucky that their is still good in his friend and it wasn't him the blame for his actions 

With Hydra gone and all their details uploaded around the world People know about the Avengers and Hydra around the world so this allow mad men to take advantage to find the Avengers Weakness 

Without Spoilers Team Captain America and Team Iron Man are formed who is right and what will happen who will survive 

My rating review 
Action sequences and special visual effects (3-D) were the best I have seen the stunts in this movie left you saying WOW!!! 
The Storyline was great but was expecting to see more at the ending when you see it you will know what Im taking about 
Characters Peter Parker/Spider-Man  
And T'Challa/Black Panther, Scott Lang/Ant-Man steal the movie they are so great on the big screen can't wait now to see Spider-Man: Homecoming and Black Panther now 

I LOVED this movie was it better the the past movies yes and no in ways each movie is different but the fight sequences and stunt work were the best I have ever seen 

I will be seeing this again in the Cinema 2-D and Can't wait to own my copy on 3-D Blu Ray

"Apr 28, 2016",NEUTRAL,"OMG, Fantastic Movie! By Far the best marvel movie for me. After some of the reviews I saw before I went to see it, I was going in think Zemo was gonna be awful but I didn't actually see much wrong with him, he wasn't supposed to be a huge character. Don't even get me started on the action scenes in this movie they are truly spectacular! I will just say one thing and that is the airport scene. Such a good movie, really would encourage u to see it!"
"Apr 28, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Amazing movie. VERY entertaining.
very well done. Great acting. great job in general. But the most important thing is that the movie does an amazing job in presenting the plot and placing the characters inside that plot.

"Apr 28, 2016",NEUTRAL,"If you are a fan of the MCU, ""Civil War"" is in the elite group of these films along with ""The Avengers"", ""Winter Soldier"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy"".  The story is outstanding with no real good guys or bad guys. It's an honest disagreement about heavy topics with weighty consequences. Because of this unusual formula, one does not generally know where this movie will take us to next or how the conflict will be resolved; if it will be resolved.
There is plenty of drama, suspense, humour and character development that never left me bored during this 2.5 hour romp.
The characters are well written and fleshed out. It truly is an achievement that so many characters were served equally well. I've seen many complaints about the villain. But, I believe it was due to the fact the writers decided to call him Zemo. If they didn't name him Zemo, then we have a simple ""villain"" with an explainable skill set and motivation. Does his plan depend on coincidences? Sure. But, it doesn't overly suspend our engagement of the film.
The only complaint I have about the movie is the first couple of action sequences are hard to watch because of the shaky-cam, especially in hand-to-hand combat. But, the last two conflicts are wonderfully shot and the effects are amazing.
Marvel, you have produced these quality films for a long time now and I look forward to see what will happen next.  This is a must see for comic book film fans and action fans."
"Apr 28, 2016",NEUTRAL,"i think this one is the Best yet from the MCU (but  the first Iron man is really my favorite),when everything in the movie is so fine, really really good :)"
"Apr 28, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Probably the best Marvel superhero movie I've seen so far (torn among cap:winter soldier, the first avengers movie, and this one). It was very entertaining, as what you may always expect from a marvel film, and while the plot was quite simple, the acting and the story line was very powerful. The Cap v. Iron Man plot was very great and emotional (I honestly felt all emotions while watching), and it's a fight that's definitely being cooked up by Marvel ever since the Iron Man 2 movie (when Tony used Cap's shield as some kind of wedge). I really felt that 2.5 hours was not enough, since it was so action packed and entertaining that it makes you go asking for more, but overall it was a very emotional, action filled, and wonderful addition to Marvel's films. (Spidey's scenes were so memorable as well!)"
"Apr 28, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War launches Phase 3 with an absolutely delightful action packed debut that results in bold outcomes, laying the foundation to the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

"Apr 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,grab yo bitch n take her to see it
"Apr 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This movie is definitely a long yet fun,exciting, action-packed film that Marvel Studios has ever made. Aside from that, the film deepens between Cap and Stark as they settle their differences and the opinions in regards to their accountability to the government which would bring out the best and the worst case scenarios within the film. In addition to that, Characters such as spider-man, black panther and ant-man were incredibly portrayed in the film. The plot was amazing and the fighting scenes were definitely worth watching."
"Apr 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Best movie of the year so far, hands down. Never thought Marvel could hit such high peak."
"Apr 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,"CAPTAIN AMERICA CIVIL WAR IS BRILLIANT! 

The Russo Brothers are a force to be reckoned with! Absolutely brilliant! 

The Plot, A percentage of the world, big enough, wants the Avengers to be held accountable for their actions taken in previous films resulting loss of innocent civilian lives, Melbourne had something go down according to the map, haha! Anyway the countries of the world put this system that will basically have The Avengers take orders from the government to prevent further collateral damage. Tony, has a run in with a mother who lost her son from the events of Avengers Age Of Ultron who personally blames him and in turn he agrees that this is should be how it works. Captain America believes The Avengers should be able to help with out government interference. Which causes the rift in the team having to choose which side to be on. The Winter Solider has this thing going on which if I say more will be going into Spoiler territory.

I have no idea how many main characters there are in this movie. BUT BVS had seven that had a major role in it and was a complicated mess which by the end of you just didn't care for at all. THIS! Has around twenty main characters in it and each one you understand their motivations and you care greatly for. You connect with them cause they are acting like people would act. The Vision is a great character I thought would be pretty dull but isn't,  Emily Van Camp is revealed as Sharon character and is great! Want to see more of her! Paul Rudd's Antman is fun but a bit underused. Black Panther, first I was thinking i'd just be ok but now I can't wait for his solo movie. AND last but not least TOM HOLLAND AS SPIDERMAN! He must have like ten minutes of screen time and He is already the best Spiderman! Good work Marvel! 

If you haven't seen the other Marvel movies you probably need to before you see this, BUT It was a fun, exciting and  at times pulling on the heart strings movie that has you seeing both sides point of view and your constantly struggling to choose."
"Apr 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I feel this is more Avengers movie than Captain America movie but that doesn't make it bad. I'm bored these ""Government hates you"" type stories and with some annoying details (Spider-man *sigh*) that reduces one star. Otherwise Civil War is enjoyable and fun movie. Story is good enough and like I have said   earlier I like these characters with these actors (excl. Spider-man *sigh*)."
"Apr 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It's really fun and the caracters are amazing, nice to see that the Avengers are getting bigger and others are joining that never joined before! Thx for Black Panther and Spiderman!"
"Apr 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Way better than I expected. Congratulations Marvel! Good storyline, amazing introduction to the new Spider-Man, and what I liked the most was the background development for the Black Panther movie."
"Apr 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Cap rules, great movie, a 10."
"Apr 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,Just saw this movie and feeling kind of disappointed. This should have been called Avengers Civil War. Chris Evans may had marginally more lines than everyone else but this certain ally wasn't a movie about Captain America. The story line was rushed with a multitude of side stories which sets the movie makers up for spin off movies in the future. Come on Marvel you can do better than this!
"Apr 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best marvel movie have seen and fight scene  Between Captain America and Iron Man also great scene from Spider-Man t
"Apr 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,La mejor película de Marvel y el mejor Spiderman EVER!!! :)
"Apr 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Really enjoyable, absolutely everything was in character (particularly the ending), with some touching and funny moments between various characters. Villain was very much evil based on his character and manipulation rather than superpowers, but that really allowed you time to see the internal dynamics of the team. Not traditional in its structure, but I thought it worked perfectly. Some general issues with the logic behind why people were so keen to control the avengers but that was my only real beef. The trailer has me questioning why they would be fighting in the first place - it all seemed like such an overreaction. But the movie played that out perfectly, and surprised me at every turn with lots of twists."
"Apr 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Although calling it a Captain America film seems a tad incorrect, this Marvel blockbuster excels from its ability to finally make its invincible characters responsible for their vigilante actions. It's a true look on how the world would likely react to something as absurd as various men in costumes running around saving everyone. At the root of this, as well, lies a firm story for each character, fuelled by past and present emotions. Considering the oversaturation of Marvel characters, it's impressive how capable Civil War is at keeping things mature and holding a ground that films from this never-ending, 'make-sure-you've-seen-em-all' franchise rarely stand on."
"Apr 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Okay. Captain America: Civil War is amazing. It is absolutely impressive from start to finish.

"Apr 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Civil War ? No , this movie is Captain America 3"
"Apr 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Not as good as Winter Soldier. Bit disappointing because the trailers were too epic like Iron Man 3, Thor 2, and Avengers 2. But it was an OKAY film. Not as good as CA:TWS, BvS, or Deadpool. But it's still better than CA: TFA, Avengers 2, Thor 1&2, and Iron Man 2&3."
"Apr 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I never thought Marvel Studios could set the bar this high.
Captain America Civil War is a total package. Entertaining, action-packed, humorous and an emotional ride. It's just a bonus if you've invested your time starting from the first Iron Man up to now to get attached to the characters, but it's not necessary.

The airport battle royal between our favorite super heroes is the crowning moment of the film. The action sequences in that particular scene, plus the surprises, is one of the best I've seen in a comic book movie. Although every action sequence throughout the movie is nearly on par, if not on the same level. It's just that seeing a lot of characters going at each other is much more enjoyable.

Black Panther, Spider-Man and Ant-Man were also highlights of the film, but everyone did an amazing job and had their deserved screen time. Some will definitely disagree with me on this one but as for Zemo, his role manipulating and working behind the scenes worked for me.

For others saying this is Avengers 2.5, I didn't feel that way. I still felt this was a true sequel to Captain America The Winter Soldier (only partly, AoU). The conflicting ideologies of our two main heroes is still the focus of the whole movie and everything was balanced perfectly.

To sum it up, this is arguably Marvel's best movie to date, and one of the best CBMs of all time. I can't wait for the solo outing of Black Panther and Spider-Man, and how the world of the MCU progresses from here.

P.S.
Honestly, I'm now having doubts that they can top this one with their line-up of upcoming solo movies, until maybe Infinity War. LOL!"
"Apr 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,"98% for a start and deservingly so. I must say the trailer didn't give away the storyline and I'm sure you won't quite be able to tell what is the villain up to. Quite straightforward and not messy like BvS. Yes, this is waaaayyyy better that over-hyped battle. I also personally like the new Spidey. I think they finally picked the right one. I think the most memorable scene is that 'guy thing"" bit which I'm sure all guys can relate to! Anyway, a very entertaining movie and totally a must see. 9/10.

p.s: there's two clip at the end credits, one midway and one at the very back. I say its worth waiting for."
"Apr 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Just saw it on premiere day in Belgium! I will not spoil anything for anyone, just say that I thought the movie was great! Definitely raises the level of the MCU once again. And just a pointer towards DC... Looks like it IS possible to make a movies where 2 superhero characters fight each other and make it work. Just watch this movie and see how it's done..."
"Apr 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Well balance, in action and plot.  Classic moral dilemma story (actually, not).  More than enough actions, fighting scenes, but quite disappointed with this version of Spiderman (kid)... not even 'teen'..."
"Apr 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,"In 7 words
Everything you ever wanted in a movie
Incredible."
"Apr 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Despite its name, Captain America: Civil War is really the perfect Avengers film. It has a strong, central story whilst expertly interweaving multiple other characters and themes into the film's narrative without losing focus. Sure some of the appearances are extended cameos but they don't feel crow-barred and all serve a clear purpose to the film's main drive. In contrast The Age of Ultron struggled to contain so many iconic characters. With its shaky pacing and unwieldy plot I feared too many cooks were inevitably going to spoil the Marvel broth. I needn't have feared - Civil War steers the franchise squarely back on track. The Captain America films always appear to be the more grown up end of the superhero spectrum. Far more effort is spent on crafting an intelligent, engrossing and at times quite dark storyline than on some of the other spin offs. Civil War again charts some very thought provoking territory amidst the excellent action, explosions and rippling biceps (all of which I thoroughly approve of too!). Whilst the premise certainly shares a lot of common ground with Batman vs Superman, Civil War does so with more panache, more fun and more integrity. There are moments when my allegiances genuinely shift (and back again) making you question the motives of some of your beloved heroes - all played superbly once again by an incredible cast.  Slick in style and substance Captain America: Civil War really has the Marvel blockbuster formula nailed. I genuinely cannot wait for more."
"Apr 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,And these idiots call batman vs superman boring.
"Apr 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This is the best comic book movie of all time, and definitely in my top favorite movies of all time. Those who are DC fanboys and think Batman V Superman was better than this clearly have some issue"
"Apr 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,Another Great Marvel Movie.(Not included Fant4stic.)
"Apr 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Whilst not inherently bad, Civil War doesn't come close to the levels of greatness that The Avengers, Winter Solder, and GotG had.
A major detractor is the often woeful CGI (Especially with Spider-Man, Black Panther, and certain Captain America moments)."
"Apr 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Come back Joss Whedon! Awful, but the stars are for the cast (bar woeful non-Andrew Garfield Spiderman)"
"Apr 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Beautifully done! There's no why, just when. When i got to watch it again. Watch it on IMAX 3D for that airport scene."
"Apr 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Exhilarating, Joyous and Heart-Breaking, Marvel's greatest accomplishment."
"Apr 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,Now that's entertainment folks!
"Apr 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Huge yawn. Don't really understand why the ""Civil War"" (mediocre brawl) was initiated. They were friends then wanted to draw blood from each other then resolved to a friendly banter without a thought about a storyline behind their actions. Marvel movies are designed for braindead twits."
"Apr 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,Easily the best marvel film to date.
"Apr 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Very good, interesting twists"
"Apr 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Caught the 1st Show at Midnight on the day of its release.
It has a story and it has action. Going to see it again."
"Apr 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,Became a big yawn. But Spidy and Antman was great
"Apr 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The best Marvel film to date. Bright, emotional, action-packed, and legitimately funny. The Russos has done a marvelous job at juggling all the pieces and characters together cohesively. Finally, a Marvel entry where you don't need to review the other movies to get it. This is a good a standalone film as any. Plus, it\s fun! Snyder, learn some!"
"Apr 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,Great movie that war really amazing
"Apr 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Has a lot more action, a teeny bit less character (my opinion) than Winter Soldier, but just as awesome. I might have a new all-time comicbook film fave."
"Apr 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,THIS is how you do a versus movie!
"Apr 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Damn fine movie. Personally an incredible superhero movie with an intelligent, cohesive and natural/organic story. The action in this movie is one of the best I have ever seen. The stair way fight, tunnel chase, airport brawl, and the final piece with Tony, Steve, and Bucky are just so incredibly well shot and choreographed. But the best thing about the action is that the we, the audience, cared about the conflict. We were all invested in the action because we followed the development of these characters and this conflict. There is great tension in this movie, very serious atmosphere, but there's still very well timed humour and time to develop the characters in this movie. The side characters who join in, Black Panther, Ant-Man, and Spider Man all add to the movie and don't feel forced. I'm surprised at how the film didn't feel crowded at all. This was such a great introduction to Spiderman and Black Panther. They just add more depth to the Marvel Cinematic lore and they don't hinder the story and the movie or the conflict at all (unlike Wonder Woman or Lois Lane in the other Superhero Brawling movie..) Ant Man is the character I was surprised to be delighted by. He wasn't a crucial character but his introduction to the movie was great and fun to see. It also helps that his and Spiderman's presence in the action sequence were amazing. 

The best fight scene and probably my favourite scene actually has to be the final battle with Cap, Tony, and Bucky. Not spoiling much but the shocking moments and the pure emotion of that scene was just incredible. Not gonna lie, teared up a little bit in that scene. And a lot of  Geek-Out moments too for someone who read the Civil War comics

My only real issue with the movie was not the villain but with the ending. Yes, it's not really the Zemo I was looking forward to but he wasn't a bad villain at all! In fact, his story in the movie and purpose just adds to the theme of loss and consequences. As for the ending... It's just a bit too ""happy"" for me. If it was about closure for the two main leads, fine, but it felt ""too wrapped up"".

Don't want to spoil anymore but this movie was great. I don't post stuff often in RT or MC but do believe me that I don't give films really high ratings a lot.

I'd give this movie 87/100. 4/5 ish. but 4/5 is still very high for me personally. It just hit all the right marks for me. Not only did they have a great story but they also TOLD the story really well. Two Thumps up for sure"
"Apr 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The best Superhero film of 2016. Actually, the best movie of 2016."
"Apr 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The Cival War story arc should not have been mashed up with Captain America. It should have been it's own, stand alone, Marvel film. Besides a few nitpicks, there were some good fan-boy moments and overall, it is a decent film."
"Apr 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,"First of all, I'm glad that Indonesia had the chance to see this movie one week earlier than U.S.A, and after spending 2 and a half hours watching this movie, I can guarantee you that the wait is worth it..

I must gave all the praise to Marvel for doing this movie way much much better than what DC did with Batman and Superman.. Clearly Russo brothers know how to make a movie about our favorite superheroes battle each other.. Even though it is a multi cast movie with a lot of our favorite stars and character just like Avengers, but the character development for everyone is fair and square with the scene-stealer goes all the way to our young Spider-Man with the wonderful performance from Tom Holland.. Russo brothers did it all, with a really simple story they can develop each of our superhero character proportionally that they can shine on their own.. Such as Black Panther which is for me Chadwick Boseman did an amazing job portraying it..

Overall, it is a superb opening to the Marvel Cinematic Universe Phase 3 and definitely can't wait for the Avengers back in action again together in Infinity War"
"Apr 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,A cap movie which better than a Avenger movie
"Apr 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Marvel's third phase of their cinematic universe kicks off with the best entry of the entire catalog. Captain America: Civil War shrugs off the trend of a horrible trilogy film and instead kicks us right in the feels for a two and a half hour ride full of spectacle, Avengers characters, and reeling reveals. While many people suggest that 13 is an unlucky number, I feel Marvel has bucked all preconceived notions and in doing so, changed the status quo for the next 9 films that will be talked about for years to come.

Civil War may look and feel like an Avengers film, but it is not. To me, the movie captures what a lot of people had issues with during Phase 2, in that these characters teamed up during Avengers, but where were they during their own movie-creating circumstances? We never found out, but now we get to see what happens when everyone is involved in a character film. Minus the inclusion of Hulk, Thor, and Nick Fury, every character gets at least one highlight moment if not more throughout the film's running, but at the core, this is Steve Roger's journey to clear the name of his best friend.

Speaking of characters, the must-see Airport fight sequence is worth the price of admission alone. While many have claimed it's not 'enough characters' compared to the comic book Civil War, those nay-sayers obviously didn't see the movie yet. Which is also to say, this is mostly an homage to the material in which the name was derived. Stand out performances include RDJ as Tony Stark, as always. Since it isn't an Avengers film, we don't get his full story since Ultron, but every action he takes in this film is an emotional one, usually in reaction to a larger bit of information or news. His reactionary role is what provides his stance on the Sokovia Accords and only sways one person to his line of thinking. The rest of his team are more sympathetic, including the great introduction of T'Challa and the Black Panther mythos. Spider-Man joining feels the most out of place (did he sign the Accords? Is he an Avenger full-time now?) but he steals the show for every second he's there. Marvel gets Spider-Man and next year, his own film will probably knock our socks off.

Yet I digress, from the true hero here, Captain America. Chris Evans brings thoughtfulness, devotion, and has elevated the character from humble beginnings in his 2011 origin film to probably better/higher quality content than RDJ gets with Iron Man in the past few years. Bucky also has some of the greatest action/fighting scenes throughout as he's more of a hand-to-hand brawler with a sweet apartment setup (function over form). He's just as great here as in the Winter Soldier and hopefully we see more of him in the buildup to Infinity War. The Falcon also steals his scenes as a support character. His new tech upgrades are cool, but he's very capable of tackling a lot of situations on his own and saves some ass occasionally. Coming in close to third is Ant-Man, a late-comer to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but definitely upped the ante in the Airport scene, with surprise action and clever use of his powers. On point, Paul Rudd.

We also see some Scarlet Witch and Vision moments, Hawkeye shows up, Black Widow is awesome early on, and War Machine is there as, well, the only person to agree with Tony for the most part. Even with all of these characters, they never get in the way of the film or feel they hinder the Captain America story arc, which has a great closing by the end of the film. We're not done with Steve Rogers, nor do we want to be, but how and where he shows up over the next few years will keep people speculating, including us.

The story is straightforward, although the actual Sokovia Accords and their ramifications take the backseat to a larger plot orchestrated by Zemo. The tides and plans shift quite a bit, but it is definitely another great plot with a villain that is in the upper echelon of Marvel's properties. Without delving much into it, this is again, an emotional journey that takes our main characters on a ride and leaves them in new places by the time the credits roll. This film takes bold stances against common tropes as well, probably cementing the fact they can be bold in doing what they want, without trying to employ shock value throughout their series.

After repeat viewings, Captain America: Civil War is without a doubt, my Empire Strikes Back of the Marvel films. While other films before it were good, this takes them and improves upon them exponentially. The ending will leave you wishing there was more and that much more anticipated for phase 3's offerings, including newcomers Black Panther and Spider-Man. Keeping in mind that this is Steve Roger's story and his relationship with Bucky/The Winter Soldier, helps elevate Civil War even higher and is one of those films that gets better on repeat viewings. It isn't a perfect film throughout, rarely anything is, but this is damn near close even without the Marvel name. Captain America: Civil War raises the bar to heights never before thought possible and I couldn't be happier."
"Apr 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,Near perfect. Possibly the best superhero movie I have ever seen. Tom Holland is also the best spiderman/Peter Parker we have seen on screen!
"Apr 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,THIS IS AWESOME SUPER HEROES MOVIE EVER !!!!! U gonna love this if u enjoy with AOU . And if u love Spidy Good Job Brothers Russo .U have to watch this movie U MUST TO!!!!
"Apr 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,#TeamStark all the way.
"Apr 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,Heartbreakingly awesome.
"Apr 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,"To be fair, this one is a good Movie, one of the best came from Marvel i have ever see, but the ""Civil War"" things ... i don't think it fit here, while the fight scenes was awesome, The villain are kind of ... meh

Anyway , looking foward to see Spidey again =))"
"Apr 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Exhilarating, fast-paced yet intelligently written, alternatively hilarious and emotional, brilliantly acted and well directed. Popcorn entertainment at its finest."
"Apr 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It is fantastic. It blends the humour you come to expect from a Marvel movie with a darker, serious tone that the Russo Brothers established and executed so well in ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"". Character motivations are clear and you really get involved in these battles - even if you have in mind that probably nobody will really die here. The battle sequences are fantastic - especially in IMAX - , well choreographed and Spider- Man absolutely kills it. I loved the overall tone of the movie, and I thought the ending was really well executed. CGI is great - despite some shots I think could have been cleaned up. If that is where the MCU is going, then I will be there at opening night, twice a year for as long as I can.

Well done !"
"Apr 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,Amazing all the 5 stars go to the ending and the airport scene amazingly written
"Apr 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil Skirmish is an overhyped convoluted mess of a movie. I finally had the displeasure of viewing this last night and since then I can't quite get over why everyone is lauding it, it's the same Marvel film we've seen over a million times before, there's no originality to be found it's just the typical Marvel formula of whimsical lightheartedness followed by unfunny jokes flung left, right and centre then it comes to a grinding halt with shallow action. First off the tone of the movie is all over the place, I can't tell if this movie is trying to be serious or a drama or action or at some points romantic I mean it is all over the shop. I won't dive into every problem this movie contains but I will however talk about two of the most neglected parts though. If there's two aspects of film that Marvel have failed to reproduce since Sam Rami's excellent Spider-Man trilogy it's 1) The music and 2) Emotion. Music is pretty damn important in a film because there is so much a wonderful score can do, it could convey raw emotion or set up a breathtaking action sequence but unfortunately for every single MCU film there hasn't been a quintessential score since Danny Elfman's work on Rami's Spider trilogy but probably the most important aspect Marvel have flat out failed to do since Harry Osborn's death in Spider-Man 3 is create emotion, why should I become emotionally invested or what's the point in becoming emotionally invested in characters that you know are going to live and not get seriously injured? What's the point if there's no danger that befalls the hero's and what's more is whenever something potentially serious or threatening comes along it's swept under the rug because the characters have started telling jokes!!! The reason that this movie gets a two star rating is because 1) It's predecessor The Winter Soldier kills it dead and 2) It's not the 'crowning achievement' that most people have said it is. The movie does however benefit from excellent actors, it's just a damn shame that they've been stranded in a mess. It seems that everyone else is doing it so I will too but I'm going to share a completely different opinion.....Captain America: Civil War is balls compared to Batman v Superman. If you want to view a superhero movie that has terrific tension, characters you care for, a beautiful and powerful score, exquisite cinematography and brutal violence go watch Batman v Superman; if you do choose the latter however bring your brain and work it because it'll be a much more rewarding experience, just don't expect the Marvel formula like most people did. This review must sound like I'm a DC fanboy and contrary to what you might think I'm actually not, I'm just someone who sees through the lies and deceit that Marvel movies spew and I've had enough of it.
P.S That airport fight wasn't a fight it was punch joke kick joke fly joke, in other words it was one big joke."
"Apr 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America 3 struggles to manage all the character point of views, some feel weak others a bit stronger, but nothing that stands out--and that's probably it's biggest fault. Many good small moments don't make a great movie.  Winter Soldier is still the best Marvel film, followed by Civil War."
"Apr 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,"One of, if not the , best Marvel movies! Great to see after such a disappointing BvS."
"Apr 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Good film, although felt a bit like a setup for future films."
"Apr 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,Loved it just loved it that's all I shall say
"Apr 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,NEARLY AS GOOD AS AVENGERS ASSEMBLE
"Apr 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,Another weak movie with a weak villain. Add Civil War to the list of overhyped Disney/Marvel movies. There's no real sense of any of the character's lives in danger. The jokes were cheesy as usual.
"Apr 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,I'm not a huge superhero fan but this movie had me rooting for them. It did had some flaws but the overall story and emotion and action sequences just made up for that. You're basically nitpicking at this point cause it's just a good solid superhero movie. It's a must see!.
"Apr 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,A cinematic nerdy orgasm. And that's a good thing.
"Apr 23, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Civil war is better than before avenger movies but not too good..
If u hate BVS then the same emotion is carried out in this movie too u have to hate this also..Dont make unnecessary trolls we can find many mistakes in civil war too...JUST MAKE A BETTER JUDGEMENT NEXT TIME!!!!"
"Apr 23, 2016",NEUTRAL,Avengers 3 is in a good hand. In Russo Brothers we trust!
"Apr 23, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Very loose adaptation of the comic, but a stellar film regardless.  Loved the sheer number of heroes in this movie!  Black Panther and Spider-Man were standouts.  Can't wait for their solo flicks."
"Apr 23, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Simply an amazing movie, start to finish. Amazing characters, almost everything you could want."
"Apr 23, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Given this is in fact a Disney movie, it came as no surprise that not one single avenger/hero died. However, yet again, Marvel failed to deliver on a proper villain. Crossbones was killed within the first 10 minutes, after being promoted a great deal in advertising. The main villain's plan, Baron Zemo, depended purely on chance and coincidence. I was also dissapointed that Captain America didn't surrender at the end of the film, as his comic book counter part did in the Civil War comic."
"Apr 23, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War blew me away! My expectations were exceeded! Let me go over what I loved!

Positives: 

1. The characters; almost all of the Avengers are back and their personality and banter is all there. But they all have resentment on one another over this issue. This whole Team Cap and Team Iron thing quite frankly is just all marketing, its hard to choose sides! They're both right! Their fight with one another is emotionally intense and I was on the edge of my seat. 

The villain Baron Zemo was also handled well too, he has actual motivation you understand. People are saying Crossbones was a pointless villain. I disagree, I thought he was fine and I got behind his reasoning and I didn't think he necessarily needed to be this huge compelling villain because in my opinion the true villain in this film was the conflict with our heroes and he fit in fine with the film.

2. The action and tone; The action is awesome! This is by far the best action I've seen out of all of the MCU films. My favourite action scene by far is that airport scene which is honestly worth the IMAX admission or Blu-ray if you're reading this months from now. That airport fight scene might actually be my favourite action scene in comic book history, I might have to think about it. 

The tone is dark and grounded, this is by far the most grounded of all MCU films in my opinion, I said the same about the previous Captain America film and this film exceeds it on every level for me. They don't hold back on some dark moments and honestly all the better for it.

3. I loved Spider-Man in this film! This might possibly be the best Spider-Man/Peter Parker we've gotten in my opinion! He's awkward and convincing out of costume and full of quips in costume. A perfect balance, good job Tom Holland! I cannot wait for Spider-Man: Homecoming!

4. Black Panther was so badass! I honestly felt for his character and understood where he was coming from. And the scenes where he's kicking ass is awesome! Good luck Chadwick Boseman, I am interested to see what they do next with him in future installments!

5. Ant-Man was so awesome in this movie! He was way more entertaining than his stand-alone film and that's saying something! And the scene where he turns gigantic had the theatre roar with laughter, good job Paul Rudd!

Overall:
I don't have a single negative! This is by far the best MCU film I've ever seen! This exceeds Captain America: The Winter Soldier in every way in my opinion. If you haven't gotten the chance to see Captain America: Civil War then what are you doing? Go see it right now as soon as you can! I would recommend seeing it in IMAX! Or if you're broke go see it in regular version, it doesn't matter just go see it in theatres as well as buy the Blu-ray when it comes out!"
"Apr 23, 2016",NEUTRAL,"With a focused and audacious narrative, extremely well directed action sequences, and a story that presents its well developed characters as people first and superheroes second, Captain America: Civil War is one of the finest superhero films ever made."
"Apr 23, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Even with a couple of cgi errors this is still one heck of a movie! Idk why I doubt the ability of marvel to adapt an amazing comic into a movie & not screw it up, but also make its own story. It sounds corny, but I found myself caring about the characters, Fun, action packed, funny, with some emotional scenes like actual emotional scenes... In a comic book movie... Who would of thought that could happen!"
"Apr 23, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Civil War has a great plot along with some very good acting. It has a brilliant mix of comedy, action and drama. Tom Holland is superb as Spider-Man and gives possibly the best portrayal of the film. Captain America: Civil War is without a doubt the best Marvel movie to date."
"Apr 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It's been written and said before, but I'll repeat it, because it deserves repeating: This movie is an absolute triumph! Arguably the best Marvel film to date!"
"Apr 20, 2016",NEUTRAL,One of these best marvel movies so far. The trailers don't ruin anything at all. You will enjoy it unless you're a die hard fan boy
"Apr 20, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I hate feeling the need to compare two different films in order to get my point across that a movie is fantastic, but it seems somewhat appropriate in this case.  What the MCU did with Civil War is what Batman V Superman should have been.  There were some similar plot points and other parallels to be drawn between the films, but Marvel did it with significantly more competence.  Do not get me wrong, I actually enjoyed Batman V Superman for what it was, but recognized its flaws.  Many of its flaws were related to having too many subplots as well as the fact that DC is playing catch up with Marvel's Cinematic Universe (which began way back in 2008), but that is a whole other story, so I digress.  In Civil War, character motivations were clear and the film's style was executed flawlessly.  The raw, dramatic and emotionally powerful scenes and ideas were very nicely juxtaposed alongside the light humor that the MCU has become so famous for.  The action scenes were grounded and easy to follow, and pretty much every utilized character was given his or her time to shine.  Lastly, I must comment on the incorporation of the new characters that will soon be expanded upon: Black Panther, Spider-Man, and one more character (or should I say, additional ability) that I will not spoil.  The way that the Russo brothers and film writers added these characters into the movie was seamless.  Again, my apologies for comparing the film to DC's venture, but the way Civil War established these future stars was far more natural than the attempt in Batman V Superman (aside from Wonder Woman).  Great cast, great directing, great stunt work, great drama, great humor... the amount of ""greats"" could go on and on.  Die hard fanboys of the original Civil War storyline may be somewhat disappointed by the direction taken here, but given what has already been established in the MCU, the Russos adapted the Civil War storyline with flying colors.  I want to let it sink it, but this may be my favorite MCU film as well as perhaps my favorite superhero movie."
"Apr 20, 2016",NEUTRAL,The best iron man movie yet. The best captain America movie yet. The best on-screen spiderman yet. The best marvel movie yet!
"Apr 20, 2016",NEUTRAL,Wow wow wow what a movie
"Apr 20, 2016",NEUTRAL,THis movie made me tremble in so many different forms
"Apr 20, 2016",NEUTRAL,Posiblemente la mejor pelÃ­cula del MCU
"Apr 20, 2016",NEUTRAL,"'Captain America: Civil War' is the culmination of Marvel's 8 years of cinematic caliber, and it's undeniably marvelous. It follows Steve Rogers, and his team of superheroes, on mission to ensure the safety of humanity when another incident involving the Avengers results in collateral damage, the government wants to make sure that they are accountable for they're actions. Every member of the team, along with their principles, is now torn between the idea of liberty and security. 'Captain America: Civil War' is arguably the best MCU film to date, thanks to the efforts of the Russo brothers in creating a superhero film with personal, human motivations. The movie excels in providing broad insight for every characters motivation as well as creating visually-striking, grounded action sequences."
"Apr 20, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This movie took the Marvel series in just the direction I think it should've. It was interesting to see a different story structure than the typical ""good guys fight bad guy"" that is the standard action blockbuster format. I loved that new, deeper themes of morality were explored. I for one have always wondered, ""What about all those poor people who get caught up in the damage of destroying an entire NYC block?"" It was time those questions were addressed and they did it nicely. And the sheer number of superheroes in this movie made the main battle a truly epic one and one of my favorite parts of the movie. I mean, it was one thing for Spider-Man to be there, but I have to say, when Paul Rudd showed up, my heart may have stopped. Overall, great content and a lot of fun."
"Apr 20, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Absolutely awful. No risks taken for this
 film, clearly marvel just want to keep releasing tons of movies to help thicken their pockets. Good, bad, differences, fight...yada yada yada, no questions asked, generic plot, nothing you haven't seen before, as you can see (critics score), all the zombies already love it."
"Apr 20, 2016",NEUTRAL,Great Captain America movie! So glad Spider Man is in the movie too!
"Apr 20, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best MARVEL movie EVER!!!!!
"Apr 20, 2016",NEUTRAL,"SO MUCH BETTER than Age of Ultron yet still not as good as Winter Soldier.  This was a good movie but I still had a few issues with it.  The airport scene that the entire world would not shut up over was not that impressive in my opinion.  It just felt like another Marvel fight scene that went on for WAY too long.  I personally thought the motorcycle/car chase with Bucky, Cap, and Black Panther was the best action scene for the movie.  I also thought in the end you wind up being more sympathetic towards Iron Man as apposed to Captain America which is odd considering this is a Captain America movie.  Finally, this could have been the best Marvel movie villain if they had left him as Joker-ish some men just want to watch the world burn type but they ruined it at the very end by turning him into a crybaby with a sob story I personally could not care less about and had zero emotional impact."
"Apr 20, 2016",NEUTRAL,Loved this movie!!!!  What an amazing blend of superhero's!  This was equal to Winter Soldier (my favorite) and both Avengers movies.  Go see it!
"Apr 20, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Civil War is a great ride! You might be forgiven for thinking that Captain America: Civil War is Avengers 2.5, but the directors have delivered a hero-laden film that combines serious themes, great action, a good plot, lots of characters and locations, real emotion, great laughs, and super-powered smackdowns into a film that never forgets that it is at heart a Captain America story."
"Apr 20, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The Captain America movies have always escalated in quality, and serve as the lynchpin of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This entry is no exception to the rule. Great acting, great writing, and great direction makes this yet another high point for the MCU."
"Apr 20, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America Civil War certainly one of the best marvel movie i've ever watched, with so many characters they can still focus and give us a climatic storyline. Marvel you've done it once again"
"Apr 20, 2016",NEUTRAL,Had everything that you want in a superhero movie
"Apr 20, 2016",NEUTRAL,"malisima! igual que las otras, creo que soldado de invierno es mejor"
"Apr 20, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Don't get me wrong.  I really liked it!  I liked it a lot!  As far as Cap 3's story telling spot on the whole Marvel cinematic timeline though... I'm gonna say the movie was completely unnecessary.  
Great to watch!  Loved the action scenes!  Loved the new Spidey.  Go see this movie!"
"Apr 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This movie was absolutely brilliant in every single way!!!!!! Chris Evans once again gave a fantastic performance and so did Robert Downey Jr. But by far my favorite performance is Tom Holland as Spider-Man! This was, in my opinion, the best on screen Spider-Man we have seen since Spider-Man 2! This is now by far my favorite movie ever!"
"Apr 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best movie ever. I enjoyed this movie from beginning to end. For those who want to watch a superhero movie done right...it's a must watch. Do not listen to the those who say it's for kids.....that's completely WRONG. I saw it in a pre screening and I can't wait to watch it again. Action packed! Just a great movie. I don't really write reviews but decided to because I saw all the fake bad reviews and is pathetic that they would do so just because it is marvel. For an honest review this is a must watch. You will enjoy it...if not a fan of good movies watch that other flop that came out earlier this year.
"Apr 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,best action scene ever
"Apr 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,The best entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe with stellar performances from the entire cast and a story that's compelling and real. 5 out of 5 stars.
"Apr 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This film was Marvel's chance to finally take a risk and do something new. They didn't. Every Avengers movie has had at least one hero on hero battle, this time, there were just more players. The editing struggled to establish solid ground, jumping from one character to another overcomplicating the narrative with too many antagonists. The main villain of the film was completely unnecessary, and the movie ultimately ended with no resolution. On a positive note, Black Panther and Spider-man made great debuts. Overall, action and humor will win over a large audience, distracting them from the weak storyline."
"Apr 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best Marvel movie to date.
"Apr 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,Haters just mad cause Marvel knows how to make great movies.
"Apr 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,really good film want to watch
"Apr 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War is a solid, engaging masterpiece from the Russo Brothers and Marvel Studios."
"Apr 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,"First of all, not explains why they called this film ""Civil War"", but it is faithful to the comic and definitely not risk killing any of the heroes. This title implies that the Capitan America should die, just talk about Domsday in Batman V Superman involving the death of Superman, which Snyder run faithfully while this might displease the critics but definitely please fans of DC.

The initial history is boring and meaningless, trying to justify a fight between two sides which at the end is a fight between children with pillows as many have expressed it well. They have no conviction or motivation to do so, they have heroes who don't have no motivation, rather than obey the Capitan America and Iron Man.

Spiderman is the best movie, but at the same time makes no sense that participates in the dispute which definitely can not be named as a ""Civil War"".

In short is a mediocre film made for the pleasure of children, to which Disney knows as squeeze them tickets."
"Apr 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,All around great movie.
"Apr 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Best fighting scenes, amazing introductions to new characters and Scarlet Witch GAVE ME LIFE...I'M SOLD :D!!!"
"Apr 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,"**Warning may contain major spoilers**

I'm gonna compare Civil War to a few things here as I feel it's only right to. Especially as the year has opened with hero against hero which creates a good base for any superhero movie. There has always been that debate, #whowillwin when matching heroes against one another and I believe the hype over Batman V Superman was greater with regard to who wins but Civil War had more hype overall. 

Is it really a Captain American movie? Robert Downey Jr. has been quoted saying it's Iron Man 4. In my opinion it's another Avengers movies which centres around Rogers and Stark disagreement to be put into check. Only Thor and the Hulk are missing and you can understand their absence. Though the Russo brothers have done something rather incredible, and that's a perfect balance between all the characters. It's a super busy line-up yet each and every character gets decent pieces, each having their own moments. It's almost like Vision has devised a formula calculating the percentage each character should have and divided the 147mins perfectly. 

The debates between Rogers and Stark creates an unnerving tension which eventually tears them all apart. There's a basic agenda there but understanding both sides of the argument it's hard to pick a side, even when knowing certain truths you can still sympathise with the other. As a whole, it's like they've stripped everything back to basics and built it back up whilst letting the heroes tear it back down again. 

It's not just the characters they balance so well either, but the action versus downtime and comedy. This has some of the best fights out of all the marvel movies put together and I believe that to be as a result of it being mostly hand to hand combat and some web to shield. The staircase fight was Bournish but with super strength, the airport showdown is epic beyond measure again, everyone getting their piece of the action. The foot-come-car chase was clever too and just when you thought you've seen Natasha kick-ass before, she goes and throws all that about. A lot of very imaginative action without it going silly; in fact it's the most believable fight scenes I've seen in a Marvel movie. 

The comedy element is there and yet again, everyone else having their moment giving the audience so much to talk about, which I reckon most of would be unfortunately lost during the adrenaline rush. It isn't just Stark that throws the witty one-liners and cheesy comebacks, Sam, Clint gets some in and even Bucky shows his sense of humour for a brief moment. This is down to excellent script writing and there's a lot of clever dialogue to go about. 

We see the familiar heroes, Rhody, Sam, Wanda and Scott Lang having a small BIG part with his quirky uncomfortableness. Clint obviously returns and it seems he has a lot more to say. Or it feels that way; I'm not doing any word counts here. But they introduce two more characters from the marvel universe, one of which is already a major player on the field and the other being T'Challa, the Black Panther. 

Chadwick Boseman does an superb Black Panther and really makes his presence known. He can punch and kick with the best of them. And what is really great about the introduction of both these characters is that there really isn't one. No origin story for either so not to derail and insult the audience. Like Spider-Man needs a background story. (He's always been one of my favourites)

Your friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man is recruited in comic fashion and what he brings to the arena is nothing short of amazing. Not sure if Tom Holland has the Peter Parker look but it's refreshing and his boyish chatter is brilliant, actually complimenting on his enemies abilities and attributes whilst giving them the slingshot and web bashing. It was his part I was most worried about hoping they wouldn't ruin him or just give us a hint. It works. Thank You. 

I'm not sure about Martin Freeman and as much as I love him as an actor I'm not sure he fits in. I don't think his part was wholly necessary or to have him play it. Maybe they should have dressed him up to be more like Agent Coulson. William Hurt's character yes but Emily VanCamp's Carter could be seen as a weak link though she has more than one purpose in this fight. 

Now, it does lack the major bad-ass super villain but there's no need and even though there's a hint of one or a squad of them, there's a clever twist and like Batman V Superman, it involves mothers. (Hmm, was that one below the utility belt?) It totally works and allows the story to finish with the ending it deserves

Other things to note are the baseball cap disguises everyone seems to wear and of course everyone being on first name terms. You can't see everyone going about calling each other by their superhero names when sat around desk. It actually adds some humility to each of them. And yes Stan Lee makes his usual comical cameo with some lasting effect thanks to Rhodes. 

Is it to comic book lore? Well, after consulting my comic hero expert it's better than the comics ""fleshing out their storyline"". Is it better than Dawn of Justice? Yes. So much better on so many levels. Is it better than Avengers? Definitely better than Age of Ultron, it's like a separate movie all together and my current mood is saying it's even better than Avengers Assemble. I think it's because this time it's personal and not so over the top. It's marvel at ground level and at it's best.

94% 9/10"
"Apr 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil war, the latest venture of the captain and other avengers was not just a marvellous treat to the longing fans, but also a change of track from the old cartoon-ish theme of most superhero movies.
After 'Avengers: Age of Ultron', the ultimate question remaining was ""What's Next?"", and now, Marvel has come up with the perfect answer.
This is the best Marvel movie ever. They added the right amount of darkness and to balance that, some lighthearted humour, and mind numbing action sequences.
The only question you'll be having after the movie is, "" Where the hell is Nick Fury? "". Don't worry, I'm sure they'll answer that question with 'Thor Ragnarok' in 2017.

The whole cast showcased their best performances for the movie, and made it a must-watch on the way. So, pick your sides and go watch the movie. I promise you won't be disappointed.

#TeamCAP"
"Apr 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This movie will not disappoint, it's a must see this summerð'¯ð~ #BlackPanther is a beast!!! The Barack Obama of Marvel!! Hands down it's a great movie for the entire family#Marvelfan"
"Apr 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,So Much Awsomeness In 2hrs 27mins. Every Scene Is Better Than The Last.
"Apr 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,How the Russos found a way to balance and handle a large ensemble of a cast is amazing. Top-notch stunts! The best MCU movie by far.
"Apr 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,Amazing!!! This is one of the best Marvel films if not best Avengers films in the MCU.  It is a great follow up to Age of Ultron and Winter Soldier.  It is as much of a character driven story for Tony Stark's Iron Man as Steve Rogers Captain America.  Surprisingly deeply emotional and entertaining.  The introductions of Black Panther and the NEW Spider-Man is well set up and goes with the narrative!  It is a great ending to the Captain America Trilogy and Cap's relationship with his pal Bucky.
"Apr 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War again did a good job of ensemble film to put every actors together while sticking to the main storyline. So glad to see Black Panther and Spider-Man portrayed by talented young actors as well.
No offense to the fans of DC, but Marvel really gets much ahead on movie making with this film comparing to the Batman v Superman. 

P.S. After recruited Benedict Cumberbatch in the upcoming Doctor Strange, Martin Freeman showed in this one. Who will be the next?"
"Apr 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,So satisfyingly good!
"Apr 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Fantastic character driven film that makes the viewer's question themselves. Both sides are right and wrong at the same time. You will go back and forth between which side you are on.

Pros:

1) Great action scenes, especially the airport sequence

2) Spider-Man, Black Panther and Ant-Man stole the show

3) Each character gets their moment to shine (doesn't feel overcrowded at all) and acting is great

4) Extremely well written plot

5) Both sides provide valid points and reasons why they are fighting.

50/50:

1) Zemo is a great character and his reasons are solid. But his plan required a little too much ""coincidence"".

Cons:

1) Some of the characters' motives for choosing sides aren't that clear or explained.

Overall great film. 9/10. One of the best Comicbook movie of all time. And undoubtedly a great movie

Tips: Though not 100% necessary, I would highly recommend seeing ""Captain America : The Winter Soldier"" and then ""Avengers : Age of Ultron"" to appreciate this movie. And to fully appreciate this movie see all MCU movies prior to to this."
"Apr 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,Not the best marvel movie made. I was disappointed. Honestly I thought Superman VS Batman was better even though no one else did
"Apr 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Is it just me or there a lot of DC trolls giving this movie a bad review just because they're upset with critics reviews of BvS. Apparently maturity does t run in comic book fanboys. Not calling any group out but get over it. If you didn't see it, your opinion is of no value. If you did and didn't like it then you didn't like it. Fine. But a better description than F%#$ Marvel might warrant a better review."
"Apr 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,"If anything Marvel has promised us the most significant showdown, or the most ambitious superhero stunt the American way, this is it. Civil War is emotionally grounded with real consequences for the Avengers family, and vendetta for humanity. Surpassing the Captain America franchises to date, it is a formidable piece of political-action symphony to general audiences."
"Apr 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,mcu's best movie so far!
"Apr 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Couldn't come out on DVD fast enough. Best superhero movie this year, definitely looking forward to purchasing it on Apple TV????"
"Apr 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Do yourself a favor and go see it. ""Thumbs up soldier"""
"Apr 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Finally a movie long enough to been watch again. Yet again that's one of the issues and it's a direct sequel from Avengers Age of Ultron. But if that's an issue, you need to consider the possibility that you might been missing an oustanding movie."
"Apr 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,"--Fun movie, great action sequences mixed in with humor and funny dialogue. --It will be very interesting to see how they follow up the story arc, especially in the next Avengers movie. --It felt like a little too much to throw Spider-Man and Ant-Man into the fold, but there were some good lines, particularly from Tom Holland. --At times it did feel a little tough to root for Captain America, which was awkward."
"Apr 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,"HOLY AMAZEBALLS!!! The Russos have done it again! By far, Marvel's Captain America movies are my favorites!"
"Apr 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Excepcional! Na boa, em alguns instantes você pensa que vai ser chato como Batman vs Superman em muitas partes, mas não foi, quando esses sentimento lhe chega na cabeça, eles fazem tudo mudar e tudo fica mais divertido!
O filme entretem, tem os momentos certos pra tudo e pra todos os personagens, não fazendo um filme atropelado e entediante, tentando colocar todas as situações de todos os personagens em um filme só.
Além disso, sem entrar em hype, mas esse novo Homem Aranha/Peter Parker, é sim o melhor Homem Aranha do cinema! Tom Holland conseguiu ser o melhor Peter Parker e o melhor Homem Aranha ao mesmo tempo! Não foi como Tobey Maguire, que foi muito bom como Peter Parker e o Andrew Garfield que foi muito bom como Homem Aranha.
O que mas deixa esse filme perfeito é a temática se conectando com cada cena de ação. Tem uma temática mais pesada e sombria, e as cenas de ação se aplicam nessa temática sem ser de forma forçada.
Assistam! Compensa muito, além das mil e umas referências, sendo que 98% delas o Cabeça de Teia solta."
"Apr 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,SPIDERMAN IS FANTASTIC AND THE MOVIE TOO.
"Apr 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,I really hate the guy from the Young Folks who gave this movie a poor review just so it wouldn't have a 100% on Rotten Tomatoes. Just Pathetic. The movie is amazing
"Apr 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It was alright, it wasn't as good as people are making it out to be. The bad guy was somewhat boring and the whole movie was just alright. For me the only bright spot was the black widow fight at the beginning, and that's it really."
"Apr 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,Nearly perfect!  I saw see it in IMAX but you canpeobably skip the 3D
"Apr 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,"While running a bit long and sometimes relying on shakycam for its action sequences, Civil War ties together many of the MCU's characters in fun fighting scenes and cool special effects. However, I did not enjoy Spider-Man's annoying character plot nor the very little amount of the comedic Ant-Man we were given."
"Apr 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,"My favorite Marvel movie to date and no it's not just because Spidey was in it. Thoughtful, Funny, Entertaining, etc. All the stuff you want in a good comic book movie and everything you've come to expect from Marvel. Go see it!"
"Apr 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,"batman vs superman is better and screw Disney for paying critics to give bad reviews on batman vs superman.  Besides that, there are other issues with this movie.  I have seen it and the overall reason why cap and iron man are  fighting is very unclear. In previous movies they have been shown to get along and now suddenly they hate each other?  This should have been done after the avengers not after they caused destruction and werent follwing the law not once but twice.  Also, there were other plot issues and too many characters, some characters who weren't even introduced to the mcu like black panther made the movie very confusing and too stuffed.  Despite that the action sequences were well done and the actors acted quite well."
"Apr 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,Comic book movies don't get better than this!
"Apr 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Great movie, awesome action with a darker theme but still keeps is able to keep the comedy element that Marvel does so well"
"Apr 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,Thank you marvel! Wow wow wow!
"Apr 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,All I can say is awesome !!!! Very well put together !
"Apr 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Amazing. Entertaining from beginning to end. It gave you seriousness, consequences, drama, and (in my opinion, most importantly) a great amount of levity, and brought it all together much more successfully than a certain other Superhero franchise's latest attempt. Leaves you wanting more, and excited for the future."
"Apr 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The film makes you think it's going to be a formulaic third act but reveals its going to be much more. It juggles so many characters while also being thought provoking and entertaining at the same time. The character work is just amazing. Every character gets a moment, every character shines. The airport fight scene is probably the best fight scene I've seen in years. The story is very well crafted, with amazing action. This is probably the best superhero movie I've ever seen, and I don't know how the Russo Brothers are going to top this (hopefully, they can)."
"Apr 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,"SPOILERS!!!
Después de que se anuncio en 2014, ya llego el momento que inicia la Fase 3 del MCU, y Cerrando la Trilogía del Capitán América, Con un Gran Cierre, Captain America Civil War es una de las Mejores Películas del MCU y esta a la Para de Captain America The Winter Soldier.

Vamos con la Historia: Los Nuevos Vengadores ya llevan trabajando juntos 1 año, y su misión Actual es capturar a Crossbones y lo encuentran y este se asesina así mismo con una Bomba, Wanda lo retiene pero no por mucho tiempo y Explota y hace que mueran miles de Civiles Inocentes, Ahí enciende Parte del Conflicto, Wanda se siente culpable y la consideran un Peligro, e incluso la llegan a encerrar en su cuarto con la Protección de Vision.

117 Países aceptan el Acta de Sokovia, Que permite que el Gobierno tenga el Control de los Vengadores, Ya que siempre dejan Destrucción y Muertes cada vez que actúan,Tony Stark, Natasha Romanoff, James Rohdes & Vision están de acuerdo con el Acta, El Cap no! esta en Desacuerdo, junto a Varios de sus Amigos, Mientras el Rey de Wakanda T'Chaka y varios en la ONU están preparados para que los Avengers firmen en tratado, Hay una Explosión que hace que mueran Muchas Personas incluyendo T'Chaka y culpan a Bucky Barnes. Black Panther quiere vengar a su Padre y decide ir a Asesinar a Barnes, Ahí es cuando el Cap y Falcon tienen que Proteger a Bucky y defendedlo ya que el no tiene la Culpa.
Varios Acontecimientos mas, Desatan la Guerra Civil de los Avengers. juntando 2 Grupos uno Liderado por el Capitán América y el otro liderado por Iron Man y es ahí cuando un Épico enfrentamiento empieza.

Como muchos ya la vieron, Sabrán que el Villano Principal es Zemo, Un Gran Villano que quiere venganza por la Muerte de su Familia (Murieron en la Batalla de Sokovia) y es quien desde un Principio culpa a Barnes y hace que los Avengers se maten entre ellos.
Muchos dicen que no es el Baron Zemo de los Comics, Pero muchos no entienden que el MCU no es el 616 y es que las Ideales de Zemo en la Película son muy buenas y llego a causar mas Daño en los Avengers Emocional y Psicológicamente mas que todos los Villanos que se han enfrentado.

Me gusto casi todo de la Película, La Trama, La Historia, Los Guiños al Comic, Las Actuaciones son muy buenas pero los que se llevan al Merito de Mejor Actuación son Chris Evans & Robert Downey Jr.

Las Escenas de Acción son Espectaculares, Los Russo se caracterizan por eso, Cada momento de Acción es demasiado Bueno en especial el Final con Cap & Iron Man en verdad sientes un Sentimiento realmente Genial!

El Humor esta muy bien manejado, Me encanto no lo sentí forzado como en Age Of Ultron y aquí funciona de forma Natural y en el momento adecuado.
Black Panther es quien se roba el Show en sus Escenas, Ant Man o Giant Man a pesar de la poca Participación también se Roba la Película, Y no olvidemos al Arácnido,  Spider-Man dejo a todos sin Aliento y es que es la Representación del Spidey de los Comics. Y pues es Spider-Man ha Vuelto!

Pero mi escena Favorita fue la Muerte de los Padres de Tony, Soy demasiado Fan de Howard Stark desde Agent Carter, Y verlo morir a manos de Bucky de una manera Brutal, Es algo feo y frió que sentí, Y ver la Reacción de Tony. Es demasiado bueno.

La Película tiene sus fallas son pocas, El CGI aveces es muy malo, Creo que se quedaron sin Presupuesto, Pues Iron Man o Spider-Man aveces se veían falsos pero se perdona.

La introducción a Spider-Man es muy forzada y mas cuando Tony muestra que Parker es Spidey mediante Videos de Youtube...
Y Sharon Carter creo que también un poco desperdiciada, Pintaba para mas, Y Vision no hizo prácticamente nada en la Pelea, solo esta ahí por que si.

Y entiendan Captain America Civil War, no tiene nada del Comic, Es una Adaptación, Si quieren algo como el Comic vayan a leer su Comic y no vean la Película. Es el MCU no el 616

En fin Captain America Civil War es una Gran Película, Yo la pongo al Nivel de The Winter Soldier, Es una de las Mejores del MCU, Los Russo lo volvieron a hacer, Es demasiado Genial, Ame Civil War. La Recomiendo mucho. Y es por eso que Recibe mi Clasificación de 5 / 5"
"Apr 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,by far the best super hero team up movie ever made. not just by marvel either.
"Apr 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Well, here we go again. A movie with kiddie jokes and mindless explosions. I would definitely go watch Batman v Superman instead of Civil War. DC Comics movies are way better than these movies. If you want to spend money on a beautiful masterpiece of a movie, go watch Batman v Superman. If you want to watch a movie that is worthless, go watch this movie."
"Apr 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,Haters gonna hate - but marvel movies are still gonna rock.
"Apr 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,"More intense than the average Marvel movie, but just as fun. You'll have a great time watching this latest installment of the MCU."
"Apr 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,the best Marvel movie
"Apr 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,great movie. worth repeat viewings.
"Apr 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,not quite what I had expected lots of plot holes
"Apr 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,Way better than B vs S.
"Apr 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This Captain America movie is a bit generic on the plot and acting, however the storyline, action sequences, even those jokes that they offer less still lives up its predecessors. The battle between Team Captain American and Team Iron Man seemed very entertaining and packed fun action (I voted for Team Captain by the way). Spider-man was annoying a bit but still hilarious, Ant-Man (Paul Radd) was lacking a little and could've been bad-a** but he failed it on this one. The other superheroes (except Iron Man and Ant-Man) did a great job w/ this flick. This was close to be rated 4 stars, but I rated 3.5-3.8 stars because of the plot before the middle made it looked pretty boring. Overall, this is a pretty darn good film and I do recommend giving this a watch as a Marvel fan."
"Apr 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,Absolutely loved it! Probably one of my favorite Marvel films!!
"Apr 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,Forced humor and very predictable. Lol @ anyone who likes this movie.
"Apr 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Same old Marvel formula. Forced jokes, awful villains, and a too conservative plot."
"Apr 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Great movie! I was pleasantly surprised , even though I disagreed with the fact of a superhero's fighting a superhero's! go see it if you get the chance !"
"Apr 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,BEST superhero movie EVER!!!
"Apr 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,PERO MIRAME ESE 94% PAPAH!
"Apr 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Absolutely disappointing movie, there was zero sense in the plot. I really thought I would love this movie and I can't believe I have to say Batman vs Superman is helluva better, Zach Snyder have won this. Shame on you Marvel, you look weak."
"Apr 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The Best Marvel movie that really blew me away.
It had The Best Spider-Man EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Apr 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Let me start by saying this is a really good film, and it does a great job of showing what happens when restrictions are placed on people and how those restrictions can fracture relationships.

This movie does have its funny moments, and enjoy the VW Bug scene - sarcastic comedy at its best :)"
"Apr 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,Well Civil war got all the missing things of batman vs superman charismatic characters a awesome plot absolutely amazing action scenes and introduces in a big way new fresh characters to the marvel cinematographic universe such as black panther and the new rebooted spiderman its a serious contender for super hero movie of the year. Highly recommended its 2 hr and 26 minutes of pure fun I am expecting that X men can also deliver that will see it later. Oh my god black panther and ant man were very fresh and gain enormous protagonism Civil War a success as a superhero movie . No matter you are #Team Cap or # Team Iron Man you would be pleased after seeing the whole movie. Oh I can wait for the black panther movie .
"Apr 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Great movie. Dynamite from the  beggin to the end. Very different from the original comic, but still works. Marvel has found the perfect mixture between action, plot and even jokes. Spiderman and Blackpanther were the best characters."
"Apr 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Best movie from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, period!"
"Apr 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This was an amazing film. It was very well done. I don't really have any complaints with this movie. The Russo brothers were able to create this real conflict between the heroes where it is easy to see where either side is coming from. It isn't a black and white issue. Zemo was perfect for what he needed to be. He just was someone who was doing what he could to get conflict to arise more and more in the avengers, and ultimately he got what he wanted and I really find that fascinating. You could really feel the tension between Tony and Cap in this movie. The action sequences are also done really well. The airport scene is absolutely amazing."
"Apr 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Everything you could ask for in a superhero movie.  It's the culmination of everything the MCU has put out till now and it's an incredible pay off, a gut punch of a movie that pulls out all the stops."
"Apr 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,Zemo seemed shoehorned.
"Apr 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,The Best comic movie i ever seen :-)
"Apr 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Possibly the best superhero movie to date! Batman v Superman, take note on how it's done right."
"Apr 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"As DC crashes and burns, marvel prevails again. This movie can finally wash the horrible taste of the ""realistic""? Batman v superman out of our mouths. The story is crafted carefully and beautifully. Scarlet witch, black panther, and spiderman steal the fight scenes, while the battle against the entire avengers rips at your heart strings. It's almost if not actually, Oscar worthy."
"Apr 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,Avengers 3 was great!
"Apr 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"So awesome! Could have used more Spidey, though! Still, amazing!"
"Apr 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I really enjoyed this movie. Everything you've heard is true: Spider-man, Black Panther & the airport battle are awesome! Also awesome: Falcon, Ant Man and RDJ. Will definitely see this again in a theater."
"Apr 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"At a time when super hero fatigue hd really began to set in with myself I find that due to the Russo brothers latest instalment in the MCU I have found a reinvigorated interest in this genre. 

The story telling is brilliant and they make what I feel is arguably my 2nd favourite comic book movie to date (the dark knight is no1). There feels like there is real stakes and accountability for the actions our protagonists take. This is something that has been lacking I feel thus far from the MCU. They manage to integrate comedic elements into the serious moments which we saw done so well in winter soldier. Probably the best feat is once invested you will find yourself flip-flopping between the two opposing sides, and that internal turmoil keeps you invested in the 2hrs 27min run time.

All characters are given their chance to shine be it from captain America down to Hawk eye. The introduction to the new heroes is brilliant and I think the new Spider-Man Tom Holland absolutely knocks it out the park. Black panther felt at home with Chadwick Boseman doing a superb job in the role. The two leads in Chris Evens and Robert Downy JR do what I think is their best work to date in the MCU.

My only complaint is once again the villain seems to be shoe horned in and is never fully developed. His motivation seems to be fairly weak but serves his purpose for the story.

Overall a superb movie which will get multiple viewings my my account"
"Apr 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,this is goob movieee i like it lots
"Apr 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The latest, and greatest, offering from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The perfect comic-book crossover of a story that starts in Iron Man, continues in the Avengers, and concludes in Captain America. All while expertly juggling nearly the entire roster of characters and easily introducing several new characters. Well done!"
"Apr 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,In my opinion it was the best avenger movie that has been made. The action was obviously amazing and the drama was on point. The best part however was the plot the writers really did a good job on this one.
"Apr 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This is a fascinating movie for me. The script is utter garbage that tries its hardest to make logical sense and fails spectacularly under the slightest bit of scrutiny but everyone, from the directors to the actors is so convinced it's not utter shit that they almost manage to fool you.

No one's motivation makes sense whatsoever, none at all. Tony's whole thing is that a young man, full of potential died in Sokovia because of a war he started. What's his bright idea with Spider-Man? Bringing in a young man, full of potential into a war zone to battle amongst THE most dangerous men and women on the planet. I could just hear Tony's validity just scream as it plummeted towards the ground off a skyscraper and splat.

Captain America? Stupid bullshit about freedom. He talks about how everyone in governing bodies has an agenda then he repeatedly withholds information and does things solely for his own interest AKA his friend Bucky. Also, Steve, fuck you. Age of Ultron is the perfect example of how ""the safest hands are our own"" isn't true. Does anyone bring this point up in the movie? No, not at all, because that would be drawing attention to the fact Caps motivation is stupid. 

Another problem is the Sokovia Accords, they make no sense. The Avengers didn't set up SHIELD which leads to the HYDRA takeover which leads to AoU. That's on Fury and the government, does anyone bring this point up? No, does anyone bring up Nick Fury's involvement in this? Nope.

Also, can we PLEASE stop acting as if the Sokovia Accords are the registration act from the comics? Because it's not. It's not forcing super powered people to either work for the government or go to prison. It is solely on people who were or are members of the Avengers. 

Sharon's whole spiel about Peggy being oppressed because she was a woman makes no sense in light of this. The government isn't oppressing you because you have powers, Steve. It's not rounding super powered people up and putting them into the Negative Zone. What the actual fuck are you people even talking about?! 

Ant-Man and Hawkeye have no reason to be in this movie. Ant-Man's whole thing is proving to himself, his ex-wife and his daughter are that he's a hero. He just throws that all away because fuck you, we need to pander to the fanboys with Giant-Man. Now, if the Accords were a registration act like everyone in this goddamn movie is acting like they are, Ant-Man joining up with Cap would make sense. 

Hawkeye happily retires in AoU, it's one of the best parts about that movie that the guy who you know the least amount has the most out of anyone to lose. His reason for being here.... Nothing? 

Spider-Man, Hawkeye, and Ant-Man should've been axed for Hulk. You'd create a nice parallel where both sides of the conflict have dear friends on the opposing team and Hulk WOULD have good reason to be involved in this movie logically and thematically. It's sure as hell more sensible than putting him into a movie about the Norse God Apocalypse. 

Like with Vision, the big reveal of the movie happens wwwaaayyy too late into the proceedings for me to care and this has that weird MoS & BvS thing where there is essentially no second act. It's a big long setup act and a big long finale act with barely a bridge between them.

So yeah, for a movie that's trying its hardest to make everyone's arguments seem mature and logical, it utterly fails. In many ways it's just as appallingly stupid as the comic. But the way the directors are shooting it and the way everyone is acting it, you honestly can't tell on a first viewing. It's like if Dark Knight was filmed and acted the exact same way we know it with a script that's on par with a Transformers movie."
"Apr 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,Captain America never has a bad movie.
"Apr 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,Meh. I've seen worse.
"Apr 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,Awesome!!!   Ant-Man becoming Giant-Man and Black Panther's cool.  Spider-Man is a rock star!!
"Apr 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,Want to see it. Hope it'll be a good movie.
"Apr 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,second favorit movie of 2016
"Apr 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,This movie shines when balancing the crowded ensemble amongst a legitimate outer threat that tears its way through the Avengers.
"Apr 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,"With tons of laughs, teeth gritting action, twists, parodies and plot lines that branch off into limitless new storylines how could anyone not love this film. Marvel has done it again. Reams of old character mixed with an equal amount of new ones that all work so well together and have actors who all out shine each other. This movie has hit my all
Time great action hero films list as I know it will yours."
"Apr 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,I was impressed by the storyline.  Thank goodness they didn't use the same old villain versus the avengers template.  They touched on some deeper topics and still kept me on the edge of my seat with their trademark action and wittiness.
"Apr 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Saw the movie last night, throughly enjoyed it. Best super hero movie ever it is not, but it does hold its own. Intro of Black Panther and new Spiderman were welcomed. Great action scenes and a good twist. Last 5 minutes weren't much to desire but all in all you shouldn't be disappointed."
"Apr 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,This is how Batman v Superman should have been.
"Apr 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,Very good it is better than The Avengers (2012)
"Apr 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Pro: Best Spider-Man ever. Awesome debut for Black Panther. Best super hero battle I've seen. Probably best Avengers movie yet.

Con: Didn't really care about the story minus the Avengers stuff. MCU still having a problem with compelling villians. Little slow in the first act.

Overall: Although I don't feel it beats Winter Soldier  (hard to beat) it's still a solid movie with a coherent story and great action. Solid ""A""."
"Apr 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,I don't know how to explain my love for this movie go see it if you haven't
"Apr 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,"nice story with lots of action and new people. that is made up as if they are slowly moving out the old for new , we will have to see how that works in the films to come"
"Apr 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,"All ypu, (ahem), critics are hilarious... all will bow to the MCU"
"Apr 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,Too long and too many characters. Action was pretty good though. I would have preferred seeing Hulk and Thor over Spider-Man and Ant-Man. Plot was somewhat confusing.
"Apr 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,Worst movie ever stupid Marvel fanboys
"Apr 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best marvel movie up to date!
"Apr 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,awesomeness!! One of the best marvel movies yet! ð'?ð'?
"Apr 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This movie was phenomenal and it just blew my expectations. Everyone was talking how great the airport fight scene, but I think the 3rd act battle was far better. Cap and Iron Man fight scene was packed full of emotion, rage and also sadness into it. Also, a slow cap for Chadwick B. as Black Panther and Tom H. as Spider-man. It dragged a bit in some parts but rest assured, everyone had their great moments.  Lastly, I honestly think the action fight scenes are by far one of the best from among Hollywood movies."
"Apr 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This may be my intense love of Marvel comics talking, but I just loved this movie.Â  I was entertained a lot of the time.Â  The characters were diverse and great, and the large amount of them did not cause the movie to topple and have too much going on, because the main focus is on Cap, Bucky, and Tony.Â  The action sequences were some of the best I have ever seen and were designed well.  The villain, Zemo, was great for me, because he was successful in tearing the Avengers apart, and did more harm than a lot of the other villains that ended up becoming underwhelming in other Marvel movies...he just shouldn't have been called Zemo, because he is not at all similar to the character in the comics of the same name.  There was a good amount of humor in this movie, especially from Ant-Man.Â  The interactions of some of the characters also provides some humor.Â  The tone was very good for a Marvel movie and felt a little darker.Â  However *Spoiler Beginning* I just wish someone would have died to make the movie overloke meaningful and make the Superhuman Civil War be seen as more devastating. *End of Spoilers*Â  One thing that I wish would have been changed was that Cap's motive seemed to be only because of Bucky at some point, and not because he actually disagreed with the Sokovia Accords.

Summary: Funny and enjoyable, with lots of good characters and a good story.Â  The minor mistakes that I found are eventually overlooked by the rest of the film's success.
Verdict: 9/10"
"Apr 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Probably one of the best movies I have ever seen! (SPOILERS AHEAD!!!) This movie had many strengths and very few weaknesses! To go ahead and get the weaknesses out of the way, it brings us to number 1.
Weaknesses:
1. Crossbones was killed off much too early. He has an integral part in the civil war story, I feel like his development in Captain America The Winter Soldier was very well done. So I was rather surprised to see him go so fast. 
2. Baron Zemo's back story was changed a little bit too much for my liking, however they were able to make it work. 

These are all the weaknesses that I can see. Let's move on to the strengths!

1. The Russo Brothers did what they always do regarding having a mm impeccable plot! 

2. Both sides of the accords were very understandable!

3. Chadwick's Boseman's Black Panther was absolutely astonishing! I have been waiting for black panther for a long time and he was incredible!

4. Tom Holland is ASTONISHING AS SPIDER-MAN! He is officially the best on screen Spider-Man yet!

5. Incredible action sequences! Contains the best action sequences of any marvel movie so far!

6. Fantastic character development!

7. On the good side of Baron Zemo, his motivations for being a ""villain"" we're outstanding! It was nice not having another villain wanting to destroy the world, like all the others.

8. I love the formation of the secret avengers!

9. Paul Rudd killed it once again as Ant-Man!

10. Fantastic Comedy! There were parts of this movie that seriously made me laugh out loud! Not only was the comedy hilarious, it was also perfectly well balanced with the serious parts of the film!

11. The perfect sequel to Captain America The Winter Soldier while being the perfect sequel to Avengers Age of Ultron!

12. The introduction of Black Panther and Spider-Man was incredibly smooth!

13. We should get to see more of Baron Zemo! 

This movie was outstanding in just about every way! 5 out of 5 stars for sure! If there was an option for a sixth star it would be 6 for sure! I was looking forward to this movie for over a year and was not disappointed! Captain America Civil War... FANTASTIC JOB!!!"
"Apr 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,it was awesome movie and watching captain America fight for his friend and the ending was amazing and would recommend it to watch and being captain America fan and would watch it again and again on DVD and seeing all of marvel super heroes
"Apr 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Excellent movie! Great script and relevant themes, fantastic actors, amazing action and well placed humor, excellent directing! 10/10! The best Comic Book Movie trilogy of all times!"
"Apr 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Awesome movie! A lot of action and story to keep you interested! Recommended.
"Apr 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,this movie was the best good action incredible graphics who wouldn't want to see it.
"Apr 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Civil War is so much more than just another superhero movie. What Disney has managed to pull off recently is cinematic history. The way they and Marvel have managed to build this franchise of complex characters that are all fleshed out is truly amazing. Every single moment in Civil War feels calculated, and it pays off in spades. The film tops the Avengers by not only juggling a multitude of characters, but making them seamlessly fit into an intelligent plot with a purpose. Mix in the best action sequences of the genre and brilliant comedic moments and you have the pure essence of what a blockbuster film should be."
"Apr 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,This movie was a great movie and it had some cool action in it
"Apr 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This movie was a very fun blockbuster. It was an event geeks and people of all kinds have been waiting to see and got what they wanted. A nice action, thriller, comedic, and unexpected plot line that got the audience on their toes. Well done."
"Apr 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"1/ It reached the emotional stage where everyone, who is watching, can shockingly think why such moments should happen.
2/ Spiderman and Black ""Cat"" made their debuts. I love how Tom Holland portrayed Spiderman. Its sorta similar to the way Andrew Garfield did but at way topper level.
3/ Some scenes were a bit predictable but still amazed me when they hit. (-1)
4/ Baron Zemo - Holy cow lol this guy.... I dont know but his type of villain feels like Bane.
5/ Russo Brothers captured the interests remained after the Winter Soldier and mixed them to create better story. Every piece has its own meaning.
Overall: Good Movie - 9/10
I'd strongly recommend this!"
"Apr 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I may have enjoyed this better than The winter soldier..... As soon as I watch it another 15 times,  I will know for sure."
"Apr 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Spider-Man!!!!! Thank you for being amazing!!!!!! Ã°'Ã°'Ã°'Ã°'
"Apr 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best comic book film ever
"Apr 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Fun adaptation of the comic. One of my favorite entries into the MCU. You might be lost if you're not familiar with the previous movies.
"Apr 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Really disappointed with this movie, not really living up to the other avenger movies or captain America movies. Spiderman was pathetic and aunt may is an old woman not sure if the writers or directors of this movie have even ever read a marvel comic book hope the next guardians of the galaxy is not like this oh well."
"Apr 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,Exactly What I expected
"Apr 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Brilliant movie if you love all things Marvel and are a big kid. Best film since Avengers Assemble. Everything works in this film, go see it!"
"Apr 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,Certainly one of the deeper Marvel movies. Still a good fun watch.
"Apr 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Finally saw Civil War.
It's a very OK movie but I was left kinda disappointed.
It's basically Batman V Superman 2.0.
It has the same problems and flaws as well as character development and unnecessary stuff.
I was most disappointed with the ending, both films should have switched their endings. They would have benefitted a lot from that.
The film is very overrated, it plays it safe. They don't take real risks.
And their villains are awfully executed, so non memorable. Especially Zemo who's back story wasn't very strong(here's a tip, you want our character to be understood, show don't tell)
Also that airport scene was really tamed. Nothing new except another popcorn flick like BvS.
But I did have a lot of fun and it had some decent moments.
The best part of this movie was Spider-Man. I love what was done with his character and how he was incorporated.

I give this one a 6.2 out of 10

Deserves a high rental."
"Apr 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"La película es entretenida, pero es la misma formula de marvel/disney; ""chiste, golpe, chiste, chiste, golpe, chiste"", Zemo, el mejor villano de marvel y fue por mucho, mejor que Loki en 3 películas, donde tambien se la pasaba contando chistes. El que desperdiciaran a Crossbones de esa manera al principio de la película es una tonteria y me sorprende que nadie más lo haya comentado antes, mas que nada sabiendo la participación que tuvo Crossbones con la muerte del capitán despues del evento de CW en el cómic. La pelea del aeropuerto es buena, pero caemos en lo mismo, demasiados chistes que hacen que no se note una clara diferencia entre un bando y otro, conté 6 referencias al cómic en la película, pero pudieron haber sido muchos más. En resumen marvel hizo lo mismo que BvS pero con chistes y mas personajes, solo que aqui los ""fans"" no se quejan. La película es buena, pero para el hype y lo que representa una Civil War deja mucho a deber. Winter soldier sigue siendo la mejor película de marvel y sin tantos huecos en la trama como CW."
"Apr 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Action packed, and fun."
"Apr 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It's been said that Joss Whedon makes movies about the heart and soul of his characters, which also happen to be superheroes. So little of this move was actually about them being more than human beings, quite the opposite, it's about accountability and how we react when things turn for the worse. 

We get a vulnerable Tony, a Captain America without a purposeful direction to point and Bucky to throw them all into disarray. Just when you think the climax has happened, you get an emotional battle between Cap and Tony that tears at your heart. For them both. 

This is how a movie is made, this is how you create a cyclical universe that stays true to iteself and to it's viewers, new and old."
"Apr 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,Great fight scene at the end!
"Apr 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Fantastic. The Russo bros. deliver high intensity action like few can. This movie has heart. It is about friendship and consequences. While the tone is serious,  there are a lot of laughs and feel good moments. 

The introduction of Spiderman and Black Panther was nearly flawless.

Great addition to the MCU."
"Apr 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,MARVELOUS film. I highly recommend it. I don't know which one's better this one or Winter Soldier
"Apr 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Loved every minute of this movie, Spider-Man and Ant man were hilarious. I can't wait to see it again, the whole time someone cursed I kept saying ""language""."
"Apr 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best Marvel movie of all time and one of the best movies I've ever seen. Spiderman was depicted perfectly and Black Panther stole the show. The movie is entertaining from beginning to end and make sure to stay for BOTH after credit scenes!
"Apr 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This Installment of Captain America is probably the best. You would think that it's a little overstuffed like Age of Ultron, but its not. Black Panther steals the show and is a fantastic add to the Marvel universe. Everyone actually get enough screen time but its not stuffed and forced (like another hero v hero movie I recently saw). Spiderman is awesome and easily one of my favorite parts of the movie, there isn't much of him but he is shall we say Amazing. The final act and climax unfold the whole plot and you get a psychological twist reminiscent of the previous Captain America installment. The movie does not disappoint, there is plenty of action and character development without sacrificing one for the other like most of these movies tend to do. I'm talking to you Zack Snyder and your awful BvS."
"Apr 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Succeeds where Age of Ultron fails. Funny, Real-Action packed and Spider-Man/Iron Man meeting was brilliantly done. Looking forward to watching with the boys when it comes out on iTunes. Loses a point for the ending, felt a bit....."
"Apr 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Another year, another Avengers movie this time under the Captain America flag. This film conflict emerges as the avengers have been forced to gove up their freedom to do as they will and be governed for the security of the planets population but there are some that will comply but others that wont that leads to a full scale assault on each other. The film was quite fun but I dont think it was as good as Winter Soldier or indeed Avengers 2. However if you are a fan of the whole Avengers thing you will have a great time watching this"
"Apr 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,This will be the movie of 2016
"Apr 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Watched it 3 times already,be my favorite Marvel movie ever!!10/10"
"Apr 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Marvel pulled out all the bag of tricks with this one, a must see movie that the family will enjoy."
"Apr 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Marvel continues the trend of upping the stakes by pinning our heroes against each other: Captain America and Iron Man. There are a lot of other characters, but unlike Age of Ultron, this is controlled chaos. You understand each of the characters' ideologies - why they disagree with each other, why they're on the sides that they're on, why they're fighting for what they're fighting for - and they're each given enough screen time for us to care. It's political, it's personal, it's fantastic."
"Apr 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,"--Fun movie, great action sequences mixed in with humor and funny dialogue.
--It will be very interesting to see how they follow up the story arc, especially in the next Avengers movie.
--It felt like a little too much to throw Spider-Man and Ant-Man into the fold, but there were some good lines, particularly from Tom Holland.
--At times it did feel a little tough to root for Captain America, which was awkward."
"Apr 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,Boring! Didn't impress me at all
"Apr 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,Spider-Man was so awesome!
"Apr 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,A bit overrated but good
"Apr 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,you have to see this when it come out wow
"Apr 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,Better than batman v superman by a long shot.!!!!!!!!!!
"Apr 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Awesome summer film, even though it feels like more of a sequel to The Avengers!"
"Apr 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,"What are the consequences when a group of superheroes battle it out with the bad guys and causing mass destruction? The impacts from the first and second Avengers, after the heroes fought and left the cities in ruin is all explored in Captain America: Civil War. Basically, the emotional theme of loss and destruction and aftermath that the heroes will have to face. The solutions to how to solve and contain from any further damage they may cause. The film begins with the Avengers of Captain America (Chris Evans) leading a team of Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Scarlett Witch (Elizabeth Olson), and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) are on a mission in Lagos trying to stop an arms dealer from releasing a bioweapon. The effects of stopping the bad guys, which leads to Scarlett Witch accidently destroying a building and injuring civilianâ(TM)s causes, the government to take the next step to contain these heroes. Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) still feeling guilty for creating Ultron, tries to persuade the Avengers to join the oversight program which the government oversees and controls the team. Captain America does not believe that they should be overseen by the government with their own personal agendas. Meanwhile, there was an explosion in Vienna over a conference that killed the King of Wakanda and some are believed that Bucky (Sebastian Stan) is behind it. While Steve races against the government to save Bucky and find out who is behind the attack.

 First off, I will say Captain America Civil War is hands down the best one in the trilogy and up there with the two Avengers films. Joe and Anthony Russo direction which they can handle the source material well. They can have multiple characters in the film and give them enough story and development to make it a better superhero film. The action sequences are top notch awesome including the second act airport fight scene with every Avengers except for Hulk and Thor who are absent this time around. Every character had a moment to shine and the fight scene was entertaining and creative with each individual character. There were a lot of fun moments and hilarious one-liners. The newcomers like Tâ(TM)Challa/Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Peter Parker/Spider-Man (Tom Holland) both stole the show with Panthers awesome fighting skills and Spider-mans nonstop talking. Their introduction does add the anticipation to see their individual films. I will say I am happy with Tom Hollandâ(TM)s portrayal as the web-slinging hero. Sad, for the short lived Spider man performance from Andrew Garfield. The emotional climatic fight between Iron Man and Bucky and Captain America is thrilling at every level. Captain America: Civil War is one of the best superhero films in the MCU, a great way of ending the trilogy with plenty of characters that was given a fair share of screen time and a moment to shine, a deep strong story with themes and consequences, and lots of action and visual effects. Definitely, looking forward to the next Avengers film."
"Apr 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,I have been waiting for 2 years to se this movie and I saw the first screening and IT WAS AMAZING OMG BEST MARVEL MOVIE EVER!!!!!!
"Apr 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Great movie,went so fast didn't want it to end, not perfect,still great"
"Apr 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I loved every second of Captain America: Civil War. Everything was so well put and the story and plot worked very smoothly. This movie is everything Batman V. Superman should've been. Every character fit right and at no point did the movie feel crammed with superheroes. In my opinion, the two heroes that stole the show was Spider-Man and black panther. They got both of these characters right especially black panther. As much as I loved Batman V. Superman, I have to give this movie more credit. The Russo brothers did not disappoint and they delivered another marvel masterpiece just like the winter soldier. This movie was very good and I plan on seeing it again when it comes out to all theaters and maybe a couple more times! This movie made me very excited to see what comes next in the MCU."
"Apr 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Out of all the Marvel Cinematic films, this one really gets your blood pumping and has you on the edge of your seat for more. It's without a doubt the best and most exciting one yet!"
"Apr 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,Incredible movie really felt the emotions
"Apr 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best Marvel movie up to this point! A must see for comic fans!
"Apr 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,Great movie introduced the new characters well and spider-man was right!!
"Apr 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,It was the greatest Captain America ever.
"Apr 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The Movie is going to be epic! After the frustration with BvS, a long and disconnected movie, with nothing of interest going on, except an 8 minutes fight, Civil War will bring together characters that we care about!! It´s gonna be awesome, and judging by the trailers, much better than the Dawn of Justice, because the name BvS is not the focus of the movie. Age of Ultron and Captain America 2 were awesome."
"Apr 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"this movie is crap, a fight of 5 vs 5 ??? hahahahaha not even close to the history of comics civil war that brought together more characters than this crap."
"Apr 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I've not enjoyed the Captain America franchise as much as I've enjoyed, say, Thor or Iron Man...but this is probably the best entry into his canon, despite it feeling more like The Avengers 3 than anything else. Great use of Spiderman and introduction of Black Panther. The Marvel guys really know what they are doing, don't they?"
"Apr 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,Spidey is awesome. Ant Man is Awesome. Panther is awesome. It does get boring a little bit but the rest is amazing!!?!
"Apr 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,the best film MARVEL !!! MARVEL the best films
"Mar 31, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Marvel has done it again. ""Captain America: Civil War,"" the 13th film in its ever-expanding cinematic universe, is also one of its finest. 

Though not as tightly paced as its predecessor, ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier,"" or the first ""Avengers,"" ""Civil War"" sets another benchmark for superhero films.

The comic book spectacle tackles the serious themes of collateral damage and government interference while reveling in the fun of seeing Earth's mightiest heroes go head-to- head in one of the best superhero sequences on film.

In ""Captain America: Civil War,"" the Avengers face scrutiny after their latest mission in Lagos takes a horrific turn, killing innocent civilians. More than 100 nations want the superheroes to sign the Sokovia Accords, named after the devastating battle in last year's ""Avengers: Age of Ultron."" The legislation would create a United Nations panel to oversee the Avengers.

Billionaire inventor Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) supports the accords, believing the superhero squad needs to be kept in check. But idealistic super soldier Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) opposes the idea, realizing the panel could cater to its own agendas by controlling the Avengers' actions.

The clash of ideals splits the Avengers along two sides. On Captain America's team are Sam Wilson/Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Scott Lang/Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and brainwashed fugitive Bucky Barnes/The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan).

Joining Iron Man are Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), James Rhodes/War Machine (Don Cheadle), Vision (Paul Bettany), Wakandan prince T'Challa/Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), and some extra help from the Webslinger himself, Peter Parker/Spider-Man (Tom Holland).

""Civil War"" works as a sequel to 2014's espionage thriller ""Captain America: The Winter Solider"" and a follow-up to the epic ""Avengers: Age of Ultron.""

Returning ""Winter Soldier"" directors Anthony and Joe Russo maintain the atmosphere of political intrigue and capably navigate a story with a lot of moving parts, although the pacing is a little slow in the beginning.

The blockbuster deftly juggles a who's who of Marvel superheroes, bringing back popular characters and introducing beloved favorites in a battle drawn along ideological lines. The film excels at explaining each side's stance.

As the shield-wielding patriot, Evans perfectly captures Rogers' struggles as Captain America moves past his Boy Scout persona and goes on the run to protect his best friend, Bucky. Downey Jr. conveys Stark's guilt as his work with the Avengers leaves a significant civilian death toll that weighs on the tortured genius.

Even the motivations of Daniel Brühl's understated yet methodical villain, Zemo, make sense.

The comic book caper features stirring special effects and eye-popping action. There's hand-to-hand combat, a jaw-dropping foot and vehicle chase and a fierce final battle that's intensely personal. But some of the early fights are hindered by too much shaking of the camera and frenzied quick cuts.

The airport showdown is the ultimate comic book battle. Featuring no fewer than 12 superheroes, each gets their time to shine. As high as the stakes are, the exciting sequence balances the drama with gut-busting humor. Ant-Man rises to the occasion as the battle's MVP.

""Civil War"" welcomes two new characters to the MCU, setting up for future solo films. Boseman is a standout as the agile, vengeance-minded Black Panther. And making his Marvel Studios debut, Holland is delightful as the youthful, enthusiastic and babbly Spider-Man.

""Captain America: Civil War"" masterfully blends grounded realism with fantasy in a comic book battle royal, adding another feather to Marvel's cap. Be sure to stick around for the two bonus credit scenes for hints of what's to come in the MCU."
"Mar 31, 2016",NEUTRAL,"not perfect but was really good and would love to see again.  


characters were great, reasons for and against the registration were good but Cap's reasons were way better as Iron Man acts like the biggest douchebag ever in Marvel, fight scenes were good, effects were amazing, they didn't have to add Baron Zemo and Crossbones had such little screentime and acting was good."
"Mar 31, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Wow, best Marvel movie since The Avengers and the Russo brothers do it again with Capt. America.  Spiderman and Black Panther are excellent new additions.  Action packed and Team Cap all the way, Iron Man is a shill."
"Mar 31, 2016",NEUTRAL,"great movie, perfect blend of story, action, and comedy"
"Mar 31, 2016",NEUTRAL,"One of the best movies in the MCU. It's emotional, personal, and fun. The introduction of black panther and Spider-Man was astonishing and were actually part of the story. The only negative aspect of the movie would be the villain and ""to me"" needed more of a unhappy ending to fully appreciate future marvel movies. Still, this is an amazing movie and should be experienced in the movies."
"Mar 31, 2016",NEUTRAL,AWESOME. WORTH SEEING AGAIN
"Mar 31, 2016",NEUTRAL,Great.  Best marvel cinematic universe movie yet
"Mar 31, 2016",NEUTRAL,kick ass from beginning to end
"Mar 31, 2016",NEUTRAL,"In my opinion, Marvel movies just keep getting better and this is evidence of that. The action, the characters, the special effects, and the story all pretty fantastic. Although I will say, this is an Avengers movie. Straight up. They just didn't want to call it that for some reason."
"Mar 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Spider-Man, Black Panther, and Ant-Man were the highlight of the film for me. 'Nuff Said."
"Mar 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"La mejor película de Superheroes, jamas creada, Anthony y Joe Russo nos demuestran el fantástico trabajo que pueden hacer como ya lo vimos en Civil War y Winter Soldier, una película llena de acción, una trama entendible y batallas épicas en el cual juegan con los derechos y valores de nuestros personajes favoritos."
"Mar 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,Villain why was he there whaaah
"Mar 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,It's going to be amazing.
"Mar 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Sin duda una de las mejores películas de súper héroes hasta la fecha y la mejor del Universo Marvel. Mucho más madura, con personajes perfectamente balanceados y escenas de acción digna de repetir una y otra vez en el cine"
"Mar 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,best comic book movie since the dark knight
"Mar 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Just saw civil war and with all the high ratings I was really expecting it to be way better.  

A few thoughts without spoilers. 

1. Captain America is sorta a prick. 
2. The best and most entertaining part of the movie was when Spider-Man was in it. 
3. There were lots of parts that I was bored out of my mind that just felt like filler. 

7-7.5 out of 10. 

Still worth seeing for Spider-Man and the black panther."
"Mar 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,i think that the producers should mqke more movies like thisn
"Mar 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Marvel has done it again! Smart, action-packed and very well-directed. Tom Holland is already the BEST on-screen Spider-Man we have seen. GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!"
"Mar 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Was it as good as the first avengers...No, but it is a good, solid and entertaining movie."
"Mar 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,made the franchise fresh again!
"Mar 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Honestly, among the best superhero movies to date. My only issue, was with the them of Captain America. He is a total contradiction of what he ""says"" he stands for. He is a tyrant and self righteous... and worst of all, he thinks he's some sort of Messiah, but in reality, is just as selfish as Tony Stark.
I also don't really like Falcon. He just seems like some sidekick, with a horribly designed suit, and shitty powers(abilities).
Spiderman was great... as was Black Panther. They were really great. As well as Hawkeye, Iron Man, etc, were all great.
The story was tense, made you wonder exactly what was gonna happen, but my only complaint... the ending was idiotic and pointless. Captain America, after allowing countless men to die, to save his friend(who has also killed countless men over the years... and some of them innocent, as well as crippling War Machine), deicides to just ""freeze""  the Winter soldier. He claimed to be fighting for the freedom of superhero's, but that was never the case. He's fighting for his own selfish wants over the worlds better needs. The film ends exactly where it started. Lives could have been saved, had the winter soldier just been caught, and ended up right where he ends up anyways. 
Fuck Captain America. I wish they would kill him off already. He's the Hitler of the superhero movies. 
But aside from him... the film is definitely worth a watch. Great all the way around."
"Mar 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America takes on Iron Man. The team divided. This film creates the tension and builds on the excitement from the very first second. The Russos crafted a film that focuses on the conflict between Captain America and Iron Man. As the film continues the tension builds. The mysteries unfold. The mastermind and history of these character explored like no other films in the MCU. This film also introduces new characters. Black Panther and Spiderman are the two highlight of the movie. Tom Holland as Spiderman is just amazing whilst  Black Panther just steals the show when ever he shows up. The actions are crafted with such precision and it's just unbelievably thrilling from start to finish. This is a must see film of 2016, and hands down he best MARVEL film to date. And spoilers ""there's two end credit scenes"" so stay in those seats."
"Mar 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Another great movie from the Captain America series, they never disappoint!"
"Mar 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Good movie with plenty of action and characters that are appealing. 
The plot was dumb but the rest was good"
"Mar 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,This movie BLEW Super Man vs. Batman Away!!!!
"Mar 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,Thrilling and moving movie of the year.
"Mar 26, 2016",NEUTRAL,An incredibly entertaining film that is sure to please veteran fans and newcomers alike.
"Mar 26, 2016",NEUTRAL,"A miraculous movie. The exact kind of conflict the MCU needed at this point in time. Every character was wonderfully developed and written extremely well. Could I rate with a percentage, I'd give this movie a 99%, merely because the ending left me slightly unsatisfied; however, I understand it's intent and respected it immensely."
"Mar 26, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The film was very anticlimactic for me. It kept building and building up to this showdown, and then nothing happens and you're left with wondering who was the bad guy in this film?
And while we are at it, Spider-Man had to have been the worst cameo of any of the super heroes from the Marvel Cinematic  Universe. If you was to remove him from the film, it would change nothing about the story and save 10 minutes off of the film. it was clear that he was added in post, as the only character he interacts with is Tony Stark, outside of the CGI scenes."
"Mar 26, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best Marvel movie yet. Not a wasted second. Not as depressingly sad as trailers would imply.
"Mar 26, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Pretty good. Not perfect, but good."
"Mar 26, 2016",NEUTRAL,What a great movie. Everything works.
"Mar 26, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The story is climatic masterpiece. If you haven't seen this movie, I highly suggest it. When I first saw the trailers, posters and generally the name I expected complete crap that I would expect to be eaten away just like the Batman vs Superman movie. Once I went into the theater the only reason I was going to watch was because of Black Panther and Spider-Man appearances. I was honestly surprised after watching while watching. Every moment was intense and the climax was crazy."
"Mar 26, 2016",NEUTRAL,Marvel exceeds expectations -- masterpiece!
"Mar 26, 2016",NEUTRAL,I rather watch Teletubbies.
"Mar 26, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Never a dull moment and some well placed cuckles. Concidering this pits two super heroes against each other, this is far superior to batman versus superman. no long winded flash back, no annoying origin story and a plausable moral dilema why two friends would fall out with each other. Do wonder with the budget why no Gwen and more missed, Mark Ruffalo. the new Spiderman is adorable and wait till the end of the credits, as a follow on story arch is reveiled..."
"Mar 26, 2016",NEUTRAL,It's awesome. Nothing else.
"Mar 26, 2016",NEUTRAL,This movie was simply fantastic. Seeing old and new characters constantly going at each other due to separate beliefs was interesting nonetheless but thankfully they were able to pull it off. Not as good as Winter Soldier but very VERY close to it.
"Mar 26, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I laughed, I cried, I cheered, I stared silently with my eyes wide open and my hand over my mouth... this movie, my god, this movie! Chris Evans was very right, it is both very much a Cap movie, and it's a movie about family. Amazing action, deep character moments, and emotional scenes that hit me right in the gut more than once. I highly recommend it.

As a side note, some people said Zemo was redundant and made no sense.... that didn't really come through to me. Maybe he wasn't necessary for this movie, but he was hardly an awful villain. You'll see, I see potential."
"Mar 26, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I have to say, the Captain America movies just keep getting better. Each one has improved from the previous one. This movie did feel like Avengers 2.5. Loved all the actors/characters in this movie. The addition of Black Panther was awesome and very well done. Even though I'm a fan of Andrew Garfield's take on Spiderman, Tom Holland really does bring the character to life and does a fantastic job. I can't wait to see him in his solo adventure next year. Even though I didn't know the character of Zemo( always thought he was cool looking back when I was a kid), I didn't particularly like his character in this movie. It felt like he wasn't needed in this movie, his purpose was dumb, IMO. The action scenes were awesome, but the end was bothersome to me. I felt the end of this movie was disappointing. Overall the movie was fantastic and I definitely recommend it."
"Mar 26, 2016",NEUTRAL,Wonderful again from Marvel. #TeamIronman
"Mar 26, 2016",NEUTRAL,The only regret was I watched it so late :D amazing movie
"Mar 26, 2016",NEUTRAL,"A really great film with a lot of superheroes. Great action, great story, not so great villain but all the aforementioned makes up for it."
"Mar 26, 2016",NEUTRAL,Is the more waited of comics... /uu/
"Mar 25, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Marvel keeping  and improving their standard. Humanizing the characters. Great battle choreography. Good comedy timing. Slight drama. Easter eggs. Cameos. 

The only downside, not making the villain(s) shine a bit more. They should take Darth Vader as an example. From his first screen presence he was a force to be reckon with. And still allow your heroes be the center of the movie.

Can't wait to see where the next Marvel installments take us and if they can own up to this new bar that have been raised."
"Mar 25, 2016",NEUTRAL,"A wild ride. Previous small conflicts between characters (especially Captain America and Iron Man) in past movies has finally escalated into a huge brawl that pits them against each other. Newcomers in the MCU, Black Panther and Spiderman, was established rapidly and effectively. All in all, this is the best movie by Marvel Studios yet. I'm looking forward to their future films."
"Mar 25, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best superhero fight ever!!!!
"Mar 25, 2016",NEUTRAL,another boring marvel film
"Mar 25, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Thrilling, emotional and boat-loads of fun. 'Civil War' is everything you could want in a superhero action-adventure film, and then some. This is how you deal with a highly complex plot and give equal screen-time to a whole team of rich characters, as well as satisfyingly concluding a trilogy that's gone completely under the radar in the grand scheme of superhero stories."
"Mar 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Far from perfect, but still entertaining with good action and great comedy. Chadwick Boseman & Tom Holland were easily my favorite actors in this movie."
"Mar 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,This movie was awesome.
"Mar 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Some spoilers!!! Captain America: Civil War is the 13th movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the third Captain America movie. This movie is amazing. They did so much right with this movie. The characters are interesting and funny as always and some do have a limited amount of time but are still done justice. The conflict between Tony and Cap was handled well and made you jump from side to side at times as both heroes had compelling reasons for what they were doing and why they believed they were right which was great to see so that it didn't seem one sided the whole time. Getting into the new characters, Spiderman was absolutely perfect. The most comic accurate Spidey to date. Tom Holland is absolutely perfect for the role as not only does he have the acting chops be he's the right age as well. Finale a teenage Peter Parker and not a 20 something year old portraying a young person. Black Panther was also amazing as well. Not only was he a great addition to the MCU but they handled his origin story very well by incorporating it into the overall narrative rather than slowing the movie down to tell a completely different subplot about how he became Black Panther. With the movie barring the title ""Civil War"" you expect there to be a Civil ""War"" and the movie delivers on this as this movie has one of, if not the greatest comic book action scene you will ever see in any movie, EVER!!!. So much happens and everyone gets their moment to shine and I have to say while Spiderman and Black Panther were great in that scene, it is Ant-Man who steals the show with his limited amount of screen time. Its also fantastic how self aware this movie is and doesn't try to play it off as if its some realistic thing. Marvel is known for having rather forgettable villains other than a few (Loki, Ultron, Hydra) but not this time. I feel that Zemo didn't need to be in the movie but with him being in it I thought they handled his character well and made him a more interesting villain then the usual ""Im evil and want to kill everything while rubbing his evil hands together because why not"" like a lot of the other marvel villains (Red Skull, Kronan, Malekith, Yellow Jacket, etc). He had a personal reason that you can get behind for his actions so I say that Zemo is at the top for the better villains in the MCU and theres one thing that they do with his villain and its that even when Zemo looses, he still wins which I thought was awesome since we havent seen anything like that before. Hope to see him suited up in future movies. The movie isn't without its problems of course. Cross Bones was one on the many reasons I looked forward to this movie and unfortunately while he was great in the time he had in the movie it just another case like with Barron Von Strucker in Age of Ultron where he gets a limited screen time then is killed off. These are some of the best villains of Caps rouges gallery and they are just killing them left and right without giving them proper amount of screen time. Overall though this movie is definitely a step up from the amazing Winter Soldier and is a worthy sequel and follow up to the other MCU movie although I have to say that The Winter Soldier is still my favorite MCU movie to date but this is a close second. 5/5"
"Mar 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I can't wait to watch this, I am totally #TeamCap"
"Mar 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Best superhero experience ever has so many types of genre in one action packed movie that it somehow works. I love how the superheros carries the weight of the public devastating events in such a realistic way that towards the end of the movie no matter how entertaining it was I realise it's not alright for superheros to fight against each other. The climatic ending tells us that superheros are no different from non superheros and you don't forget why the conflict between them is very special. It shows how humane these superheros are with in the pointed arguments, emotional conflicts and the support and love in friendship. The best thing about civil war is how it managed to give each character a moment to shine and still relates to the overall storyline. Its such a clever mature movie and still manages to be MARVELous."
"Mar 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,"One of the best, if not THE best, comic book movies ever made. 'Nuff said."
"Mar 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,Easily the single-greatest Comic Book Film of all time thus far.
"Mar 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,One of the best Marvel movies yet.
"Mar 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Felt more like ""Avengers 3"" than ""Cap 3"". But that doesn't take anything away from the movie. Great from beginning to end!"
"Mar 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,"A culmination of what have been and what will come. Civil War managed to combine several character's arcs and storylines, while including new heroes and elements, to create a suberb film that really manage to hit the high notes."
"Mar 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It gives every character their moment to shine and manages to handle multiple character arcs while remaining, and feeling like, a Captain America focused film and sequel. Great introductions to both Black Panther and Spider-Man. As well as a great villain in Helmut Zemo who has purpose and his story makes sense, one of the better Marvel villains. It also contains possibly the greatest action scene in any film, in my opinion."
"Mar 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America Civil war is the best Marvel movie to date. With an incredible story, action, emotions, fantastic performance and great direction. Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans show one more time that they were born to play Captain America and Iron Man. But who really stole the show was Black Panther and Spider-Man. Marvel chose the perfect actor to portray the great king of Wakanda. But who really was the cherry on the cake was what Tom Holland. This guy is the perfect Peter Parker and Spider-Man with his great humor, which all fans were waiting. Anyway This film is a masterpiece, thanks to the Russo Brothers, now we can say that Avengers Infinity War part 1 and 2 is in good hands."
"Mar 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,DC move out the way :-)) Marvel is coming for that number 1 spot :-))
"Mar 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,Marvel has done it again. Just WOW
"Mar 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Excelente película, tiene de todo. Muy completa."
"Mar 22, 2016",NEUTRAL,The best Marvel film so far!
"Mar 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,Gone be movie of the year mark my word
"Mar 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I was pretty worried about this movie, but rest assured, it was pretty damn awesome. Captain America: Civil War is brutal, emotionally driven film and is extremely entertaining and fun at the same time. Although the film doesn't carry the amount of realism from it's predecessor, all in all, this film is your occasional Marvel film but 100x better and sets many paths for upcoming Marvel films.

OVERALL GRADE: A"
"Mar 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,"""Avengers 2.5""? Hardly. I did go into the theatre with concerns that the movie was going to collapse under its supersized casting, but I needn't have worried. ""Captain America: Civil War"" is fast-paced and filled to the brim with action in all three of its acts, interspersed regularly with startling character development. Spider-Man, Black Panther, Scarlet Witch, Vision - every moment of respite explores their relationships, their vulnerabilities, and where each of them stand as not superheroes, but individuals. While this film's themes are nowhere near as intimately deep-rooted as ""The Winter Soldier""'s, it does round out the Captain America trilogy into a series where each instalment is unique and immensely satisfying.

Now, as someone who's on Team Cap, I'll try to be unbiased when talking about the story (no spoilers here, by the way). The expected things are all presented - the conflict where no one emerges the winner, the blurred lines between saving a friend and doing a greater good, the subject of action/inaction vs morals/accountability and which is worse when innocent lives are lost. But these things aren't made interesting simply because they're happening to the Avengers, it's because each of the major players holds a personal stake in which the greater good is affected, whether they like it or not. We see what drives both sides, the same things that would drive us as human beings. We witness the unfailing strength of loyalty and friendship, and its counterweight the self-destructive effects of revenge in a tug-and-pull of chaos throughout the film.

As for the action, ""Civil War"" definitely does not disappoint. Where the first two Captain America films lingered on scenes of conversation and reflection, this one moves efficiently through the slow scenes and play out fights for long, long sequences. Two hours fly by quickly when the bulk of the film is made up of the three brilliantly choreographed fight sequences at the beginning, middle, and end. Unlike ""Age of Ultron""'s bland, overblown fight sequences, every character is in their element here. Both stunts and special effects excel in highlighting their unique abilities and traits; Spider-Man and Black Panther make for particularly likeable new entries, making their debuts genuinely worthy of their hype.

For a movie with such a serious plot, ""Civil War"" is not all emotional and grimdark. There are plenty of laughs to be had at many of the jokes, which are much more organic than some of the forced lines in ""Age of Ultron"" (there's even a Game of Thrones reference in there, courtesy of Paul Rudd). The pacing is solid and I never felt bored, which is an impressive feat for a two-hour movie. The villain's plan unfolds in major strides while he holds a modest presence, which makes him only more extraordinary in hindsight. The entire plot feels like it bucks the common story-telling trend, but it's a bold step that I think has proven very rewarding for Marvel and audiences alike.

The performance of the entire cast is solid all-around, and I must mention once again the charismatic Tom Holland and the thoughtful, sympathetic Chadwick Boseman. Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany are both hilarious and dynamically fascinating as Scarlet Witch and Vision (I'm shipping them already). But the gold goes to Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr., who are absolutely electrifying in ways I've never seen before; there are definitely a lot of emotions lingering in all the unsaid things during their last scene together. And the film plays it straight: there is no comfortable feeling of resolution, only hurt and uncertainty - about oneself and one's estranged friends in equal measure - and they are things that can only be remedied with time (or perhaps an Infinity War).

Final score: 9.2/10."
"Mar 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Funny, impressive, and enjoyable with a superb performance from Robert Downey Jr, but also overlong & messy."
"Mar 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Spider-Man look so CGI and out of places and look so Fake. Sony Spider-Man costume look way better than this one. So no, not interested and beside i never get into Winter Solider and didn't find that movie interested too."
"Mar 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Another epic installment to marvel's blockbuster movies, that will set the mood and leave our heroes in a destroyed state throughout the rest of phase three. Not only does Marvel know how to grasp our attention with with amazing advertisements but they also successfully hide the true plot of civil war. Can't wait to see how this movie will kick off Marvel's phase 3."
"Mar 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War is not bad, but certainly overrated. It has several flaws and issues, few of them are:
1. Too much of shaky camera view. Why many action films want to be another Jason Bourne movie?
2. Is Zemo the villain a prophet? How does he estimate the arrival of Ironman and prepare a video for him?
3. Non-stop changes of establishing shots, especially the different country shots. Are they trying to sell tourism?
4. The cause of conflict is ambiguous
5. Why does the mastermind Zemo has to kill all other winter soldiers instead of making good use of them to fight Captain America? So what's the point to trap the superheroes in the secret base? If Ironman never arrived, what could he do as a non-superhero (so he must be a prophet)? Mastermind, seriously?
6. Common sense issue. If you want to kill the people at the state of hibernation, what you need to do is not to disturb them or kill them any other time. So Zemo the prophet has been spending so much time and effort to plan just to kill hibernated people and then commit suicide? Seriously....
7. If Ironman never arrived, how does this Zemo fight against Captain America? What's his plan B? Clearly he must be a prophet....
8. Another common sense issue. Enemy of your enemy can become your friend, what you got to do is to use brain. So what's the point to kill those hibernated winter soldiers? When you are killing the enemy of your enemy, you are helping your enemy. Mastermind huh.... 
8. The quick changes of personality (or you can say ""character development"") for few characters are not making sense
9. The airport fighting sequel is fun to watch, but not epic or even realistic. Why? The main issue of Marvel films is they tend to avoid any violent shot which make the superhero fight look like kids' fights and unreal; in addition, when the cause of conflict is ambiguous, it is hard to establish epic fight scene. Why the fight sequel in Return of The King and Mad Max are great? Established motivation (do or die) and realism (blood were shed, any character could be killed)

The best Marvel movie so far is none other than The Guardians of Galaxy; the best superhero movie to date? The Dark Knight."
"Mar 20, 2016",NEUTRAL,this movie is probably the best marvel movie
"Mar 20, 2016",NEUTRAL,First one is still better
"Mar 20, 2016",NEUTRAL,Defintly the the best Marvel movie I've seen and it is everything a summer blockbuster should be. Spiderman was best thing in movie
"Mar 20, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The universe continues to grow, develop, and become more complicated.
Best of the Marvel Universe for me."
"Mar 20, 2016",NEUTRAL,Must see again & again & yes again!!!!!
"Mar 20, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I enjoyed every second. Great action, great humor, great emotion, and every character has a great moment. I'm not the biggest marvel fan in the world, but this may change my mind for movies to come."
"Mar 20, 2016",NEUTRAL,Might be the best Marvel movie to date. DC should watch and take notes on how to introduce new characters.
"Mar 20, 2016",NEUTRAL,The best Marvel film yet.
"Mar 19, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best movie I have seen in a really long time!! Amazing in every way.
"Mar 19, 2016",NEUTRAL,Amazing movie... Great action scenes and very interesting plot line... Definitely some curve balls! So good I think I'll see it again in the theaters!
"Mar 19, 2016",NEUTRAL,All round fantastic and entertaining film
"Mar 19, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Almost on par with the original Avengers in terms of ensemble super hero movies. Its main flaw is in its writing, since it tried to get philosophical but in doing so had to portray normal people as complete morons. Its hard to be sympathetic towards characters who seem to be set on blaming the wrong person for their issues. The new movie is filled with people who want to make the Avengers accountable for the collateral damage they cause. But it fails to address the obvious point of ""what would have happened if they had not stepped in?"". In most cases in this movie universe the answer is the complete destruction of the entire planet, or at the very least a city or two. So while I was watching I kept waiting for someone to point out this obvious fact, but no one did. Maybe that's the movie point. That people don't care about logic, all they want is someone to blame. That rant aside, I thought this movie was tits. It had great visual effects, good acting, and wonderful action scenes. None of the boring, drawn out scenes of smashing robots from Age of Ultron. These scenes were creative, well filmed, and chaotically enjoyable."
"Mar 19, 2016",NEUTRAL,Excellent installment in the Marvel universe. Addresses the difficult trade-offs between security and freedom as well as loyalty and justice.
"Mar 19, 2016",NEUTRAL,Amazing movie! The characters and everything amazed me! Most definitely marvels best!
"Mar 19, 2016",NEUTRAL,Awesome show! Loved when all the Avengers were fighting each other. Can't wait for the next installment.
"Mar 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,"2nd best Marvel movie to date, after Winter Soldier (my opinion of course). I thought Black Panther was great, and that Tom Holland played a great Peter Parker/Spider-Man. The rest of the cast was top notch as always, so much so that I forgot that Spider-man was even in this movie until I saw him, and for me, that says a lot about the plot."
"Mar 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Totally Awesome movie,must see"
"Mar 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,A close second to the first Avengers.
"Mar 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Good movie with great action and some emotionally powerful moments.  However, once the movie ends, I felt as if the whole movie accomplished nothing.  There haven't been lasting stakes in marvel films for a while now, and the last scene of this movie proves that trend will continue"
"Mar 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,Marvel doing their thing! Black Panther was legit.
"Mar 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,I wished it was more closer to the civil war storyline and the ending was not that great
"Mar 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,did a better job than both avengers movies. 
"Mar 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,Great story. Great pacing. Great action!
"Mar 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,Good movie. Be sure to stay for the credits
"Mar 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,An extremely entertaining movie with the misfortune of being named incorrectly. It should more correctly have been titled: Avengers: Civil War.
"Mar 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best Marvel movie to date! Exhibits the superheroes vulnerability
"Mar 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Not sure I can put rate it higher than Winter Soldier, but this film is fantastic. Everything you could ever want in a super-hero movie, like the first Avengers film.  Absolutely captures the feeling I used to have as a kid reading Marvel comics.  The only fault, is the now common, weak villain we get in almost every Marvel movie. Why? They have such iconic characters to choose from."
"Mar 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Another triumph for the Russo Brothers. With its compelling & emotional story as well as action sequences with substance in them, ""Captain America: Civil War"" will give you an adrenaline from start to finish similar to its predecessor ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier""."
"Mar 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,a big disappointment. can't see them fighting themselves.
"Mar 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,An emotional thriller that will have you on the edge of your seat for the entire film
"Mar 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,Fantastic!! Really fleshed out the comic perfectly!
"Mar 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Initial thought was good and had some funny scenes, but they added politics and it ruined it overall.  Attention Marvel, next Avengers should be the last and go out with a bang.  I think we all want to see a huge battle where all the Avengers are together and if you want to kill off someone; kill all the politicians and Hollywood elites.  American and the world would pay $40 per ticket for that. I'd pay $1M to see that and I don't have  million."
"Mar 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,what else can I say if you know the history this story doesn't end on happy note this will be one the best movies and highest grossing movies in marvels movie making history should top winter soldier in ticket sales
"Mar 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,This was a really good super hero movie with great action and was even really funny at points. However it dragged on a little too long in my opinion.
"Mar 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,The best part of the latest installments and worthy of carrying the Captain America name. The spy movie style has and appears to continue working for the first avenger.
"Mar 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,Nearly perfect superhero movie that raises the stakes for all involved.  Had the best fight scenes in any superhero movie and the acting and new characters are spot on.  Only flaw is that it drags a little too much near the beginning and the end credits scenes were kind of weak.
"Mar 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,ok. I suppose. would watch again on netflix etc
"Mar 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,5 stars better then 1 and 2
"Mar 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,loved it. Spiderman and Antman were awesome. Black Panther was a great new addition.One of the best Marvel movies I've seen
"Mar 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Too many super heroes, but they were all amazing. I like how they brought the government in and a couple new supers who were dope. Ending was great and sets the tone for upcoming movies."
"Mar 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,One of the best for Marvel. They have a knack for injecting humor into action sequences like no other...even with a darker story line.
"Mar 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,Great movie overall but I did have some negatives which include the cgi which was very obviously is some scenes and not seamlessly integrated.  The airport scene to me was cool but didn't feel like they were fighting each other more like sparing.  Other than that I think everthing  was done well.
"Mar 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This was everything I hoped it would be and more, probably the best thing Marvel has ever done honestly. I had no idea how they could possibly incorporate that many amazing characters into one film and still make it work but rest assured, the Russo brothers have another winner. The acting, cinematography, editing, direction, writing, and pretty much everything you can think of what incredible, and this somehow exceeded the astronomical expectations that I went into it with."
"Mar 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,looks brilliant !!!!!!!!!!!!!:);)
"Mar 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The Marvel movie I've been always wanting to see; the theme of the movie isn't about saving the world, it's about world's reaction to the consequences of saving it and the Avengers themselves. The screenplay is amazing, and the villain, surprisingly for a Marvel film, actually feels threatening."
"Mar 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,I've seen the best. :) I can die happy.
"Mar 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,Perfect comic book movie. Go see it now. That's all.
"Mar 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,I think they did the civil war saga to soon!!! It still look good!!!
"Mar 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,Captain America: Civil War is the awesome movie ever!!!!!!
"Mar 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,"spiderman!!! black panther!!! antman!!!
 i can't wait@â~...â~...â~...â~...â~..."
"Mar 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This goddamn movie! I was kinda thinking that the critics were giving the movie too much credit for nothing but I was so wrong.
The movie is everything you'd wish from an 'avenger v avenger' movie!
The fight scenes are so well choreographed and so friggin' creative, the storytelling is so intriguing and the new characters are spectacular.
Speaking of new characters ""Blank Panther"" is epic, wasn't a big fan before but now I'm all about him and his amazing fighting skills (bucky v black panther is phenomenal)
and ""Spider-man"", boy oh boy Marvel wasn't a tiny bit wrong when they casted Tom Holland for the role, he did the job so damn right to the point that you might forget that there are other badass characters around him! His Peter Parker is everything we deserve, his awkwardness, trying to be cool but fails and of course his wit! All I can say is the theater couldn't stop laughing everytime he opened his mouth.
The one thing that was not quite as interesting in the movie was the villain ""Zemo"", it's not that the actor was bad or anything but everytime they changed to him you just can't wait to get into the 'Civil War' action again.
Overall the movie is so good and I advise every comic fan/ non comic fan to go and enjoy this masterpiece."
"Mar 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Awful, how can you base a entire movie where you have to comic icons fighting each other! This movie sucks, how can The Captain America allow the killer of Iron Man parents live. I was a Captain America fan until today."
"Mar 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Representing the culmination of nearly a decade of comic book films, Captain America: Civil War exceeds par and delivers a true spectacle. The titular character is surrounded by a myriad of superhero legends, both as allies and opposers. Such clout is deftly handled by the razor sharp direction of the Russo brothers."
"Mar 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Solid Marvel entry with a good blend of character, mystery, edge, and of course humor - the latter admittedly coming mostly from the bug-men (Ant-Man and Spider-Man) during the face-off between heroes, with a few other fun moments as well."
"Mar 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best superhero movie I have ever seen. PERIOD!! ð~?
"Mar 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This is a very good action film. Not being an avid reader of comic books, I can just enjoy the stand alone franchise movies well enough to follow along. There are a few odd references that are lost on me but nothing I can't grab on to as it happens. The next reboot of Spider-Man is going to have a lot to live up to from this installment though. A far better casting choice this time around. I still miss seeing Toby McGuire in the role though. Overall, a solid action movie with a strong plot that is just enough to keep up with."
"Mar 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The movie, sadly, derails every time the main villain is on screen. Everything other than that is pretty much perfect.

A"
"Mar 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"my least favorite one due to them fighting each other, but overall still good to watch."
"Mar 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"i believe russo brothers will do good job , not bad humor movie like age of ultron ....."
"Mar 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Definitely need to know the back story going into the movie but the action scenes, as usual, were amazingly crafted."
"Mar 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Hey knuckle heads go to this movie and have your mind blown
"Mar 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Can't quite put my finger on it. Very good movie, strong story, well done, but what I love about having the Avengers around is the fun and the humor. And that's hard to have when they're divided. Diggin Black Panther and the new Spidey though."
"Mar 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,Kept me on the edge of my seat.. I love these movies hope they keep making them!
"Mar 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"So fucking good, it was non stop awesomeness!!!! And I hate marvel!!!!!!"
"Mar 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This was a good movie, but it made me incredibly sad. And there were a few characters I was entirely lost on who they were or where they came from. I don't know whether I'm more mad at Netflix for not having the other Marvel movies I need to catch up on or at my boyfriend for never having the time to take me to movies. even with all the characters I did know it felt like a fabulous orgy of action and personality and I can't fathom how Infinity War is going to manage to be anything less than orgasmic, but I wanted more happiness in the ending here. And I had NO idea Black Panther was already so well established before his solo movie came out. I think this movie did everything it was supposed to do though. Great acting, stunning visuals, jokes landed, action wasn't monotonous, understood everyone's motivations. Just maybe a little too sad to be the right choice to watch alone in the middle of the night."
"Mar 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,OMG CANT WAIT FOR THIS FILM !!!!!!
"Mar 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best Marvel movie so far!
"Mar 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Spectacular Action Film, with the most precise fight schemes I've seen this spring.  Mostly due to bright, open areas of layout, which allowed each Marvel characters it's opportunity to shine within its audience...the movie sequel left me in awwww from start to finish!!!

Appreciated the same awesome cast's of both sides brought back to defend against what they believe to be righteous...

On the other hand, this movie introduced several talented new cast super Hero's who were fantastic in their roles ! 

With an extra scheme revealed during credits, I agree this is a definite must see film, which left me anticipating the next sequel film..."
"Mar 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,Not that great. Good for a one time watch.
"Mar 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Just awesome. Loved every second of it, the build up of he tension and everything were perfect."
"Mar 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,Kept on the edge of your seat with suspense throughout. Also really hilarious which helped shine a light on the sad themes. Brilliantly executed by Downey and Evans.
"Mar 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,One of the best marvel movies so far!!!
,NEUTRAL,Good Mavel Fare. Black Panter..good.

"Feb 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,Very well done.  Pulls the viewer in and allows suspension of disbelief.
"Feb 26, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Another winner from Marvel, hats off for managing to put everything they did into that 2 and half hours. I LOVE THIS FILM."
"Feb 26, 2016",NEUTRAL,Great movie ! Best Marvel movie yet.
"Feb 26, 2016",NEUTRAL,Damn near perfect. I just don't like the new Spider-Man. Big big big fan of where they're taking black panther and Cap
"Feb 26, 2016",NEUTRAL,absolutely incredible! perfectly balanced movie.
"Feb 25, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This is for sure the best superhero movie since The Dark Knight, just everything about it's polished, voilent, awesome, exciting, dramatic. The Russo Brothers they make such an exccellent personal history and you really fell for the character. And Zemo is just good"
"Feb 25, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best Spider-Man movie ever.
"Feb 25, 2016",NEUTRAL,Boooooooringggggg! Horrible plot! It's only saving grace is the addition of a new super hero Chadwick Boseman as the Black Panther.
"Feb 25, 2016",NEUTRAL,Very good movie lots of action great characters and a solid story
"Feb 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,As good as the first avengers movie. Loved it ð~?
"Feb 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,Comple su cometido aunque siento que bajÃ³ un poco el estÃ¡ndar con respecto a lo que ya venÃ­a acostumbrado con marvel
"Feb 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,A wonderful compilation of superheroes with a good reason to fight. Fun and thoughtful.
"Feb 23, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Action packed, every MCU hero in their full glory, good battle scenes, leaves you satisfied like it was an Avengers movie instead. Team Cap All The Way"
"Feb 23, 2016",NEUTRAL,"(NOTE: I will try to keep any comparisons/references to ""Batman v Superman"" to a minimum in this review. I apologize in advance if I fail in that task; 
ALSO, VERY mild spoilers ahead). 
As many others have said, the action in this movie is spectacular (although, similarly to 2014's ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier,"" it was plagued with some of the same ""shaky-cam"" issues); it should also be noticed that without the ""Winter Soldier"" stuff,  it would be less of a Cap film and more like a regular ""Avengers"" film, as well. The thing that I really liked about it was that it felt the truest to the genre more than any other superhero movie has by far. The source material and the movie's main themes not only serve, but also improve each other beautifully; praise goes to the creative team at Marvel and directors Joe and Anthony Russo for handling the entire production in a deliberate, yet still delicate, way (though sadly, by the end of the movie's second act, the main concerns with ""justice and security vs. privacy/freedom"" becomes superfluous and recedes into the background for the script). My enthusiasm for the Raimi ""Spider-Man"" as portrayed by Tobey Maguire cannot be denied, so I will not say whether Tom Holland's new take on Peter Parker is superior; instead, I will say that he was hilarious, and unlike Andrew Garfield's""Amazing Spider-Man,"" I actually want to see this iteration of the character in another flick. Paul Rudd as Ant-Man also gets redeemed in this film after starring in his own lackluster movie. The hands-down best character introduced into the fight in the film, though, is the Black Panther. He was always a cool character from the comics, and here Chadwick Boseman does a terrific job of bringing the character to life! Honestly, Robert Downey, Jr. and Chris Evans are as good as they ever were in their roles as Tony Stark and Captain America, respectively. The Vision (Paul Bettany) and Wanda/the Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) are also given some stuff to do as far as character progression is concerned. The only snags that the movie hits, unfortunately, are problems in advancement of the plot. First of all, mirroring a part of a film by the distinguished competition, Tony Stark is too easily duped by the deaths of others to fall into the line of thinking for the flick's villain to triumph over the good guys; I will give credit to the writers because they at least tried to overcome the past wishy-washiness of the character's shifting actions and motivations and explain them away, even if it was not very cohesive or simple to follow the gymnastics of Stark's priority-waffling. Secondly, when one views the villain's plan closely, it seems fairly rudimentary and does not totally add up. The evil maniac may be thoroughly driven to achieve his goal, but it seems like it was merely a portion of a larger, undeveloped endgame; still, character actor Daniel Bruhl is excellent and committed in portraying one of the most-intelligent (and best) Marvel baddies to make it to the MCU - in fact, he may be even better than Loki. Additionally, Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye played an almost-inconsequential role and could have easily been excised from the film. Overall, it is definitely the best Marvel team-up film so far, and it might even be the best Marvel movie since the first ""Iron Man"" installment (depending on how parts of the main plot may or may not have bothered you)."
"Feb 23, 2016",NEUTRAL,"""Captain America: Civil War"" combines thought-provoking themes with an intense set-up which is impressive in the midst of its thrilling action sequences, occasional humour, and surprising depth."
"Feb 23, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Just saw it for Martin Freeman as Everett K. Ross (which I hope to see in future MARVEL films...''hope'' is a word I don't use much but I hope he does stays and do more films with them). The other reason was Daniel César Martín Brühl González as ""Zemo"" (brillante el condenado!). The rest of the cast? I already has seen them in every Marvel movie...no comments for them (just for the new ones in this saga). Enjoy and watch if you are a fan of Marvel (I'm more DC sorry) or watch it coz you are a Martin fan or coz you love 7th art or superheroes...don't if you don't apply for any of the ones before or coz superheroes already suck to you (so many movies non stop right?). Bye! - May 13, 2016"
"Feb 22, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Slow 1st :30, and the next 2 hours goes by too quickly. Great story. Good chuckles. Best of the Avenger Movies"
"Feb 22, 2016",NEUTRAL,"From start to finish ""Civil War"" is an exciting and action packed film, and in my opinion I would say that it stands out as the best Marvel movie to date."
"Feb 22, 2016",NEUTRAL,"love every moments of the film. especially, spiderman & black panther!"
"Feb 22, 2016",NEUTRAL,The only reason I'm writing a review is because of all the trolls i'm seeing on here saying Batman vs. Superman was a better movie and because of all the comic book fanboys that said its nothing like the Civil War comic. I'm sorry but if you want 60 marvel characters in the same movie then maybe you should just make your own movie. I'm sure it would be a box office hit! The Russo brothers are one of the most talented story tellers that the film industry has to offer.
"Feb 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,One of the best movies I’ve seen in a long time.. story action drama it has it all
"Feb 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,BEST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN
"Feb 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,Great build up and great action.
"Feb 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Loved it!  This is what a civil war is, deep friendships torn apart at the core"
"Feb 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Good and entertaining, but quite flawed. The performances across the board are astonishing, the new coming heroes Black Panther and Spider-Man are adapted properly from the source material, and there are some genuinely powerful moments between characters. But, an unneeded, cheesy sub-plot and certain unnecessary characters water down this ""Civil War"" into a simple ""Civil Dispute"" with little to no consequences, making this less powerful than it could have been."
"Feb 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,can wait for the next one this one was grade
"Feb 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,This movie got pretty much everything right...
"Feb 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Again, no need for comments."
"Feb 20, 2016",NEUTRAL,"One of the best movies in 2016, FAX!"
"Feb 20, 2016",NEUTRAL,I'm absolutely amazed what I saw in Captain America Civil War. This was one of the best comic book movies I've seen in a while.
"Feb 20, 2016",NEUTRAL,Tried way to hard but just failed
"Feb 20, 2016",NEUTRAL,One of Marvel's best!
"Feb 20, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Filled with outstanding action sequences and a more mature plot than most of the other MCU movies, Civil War is a thought-provoking superhero flick that might be the best Marvel movie I've seen yet."
"Feb 19, 2016",NEUTRAL,To call this movie perfect would be an understatement.  One of the greatest superhero movies ever made
"Feb 19, 2016",NEUTRAL,One of the best Marvel films of our time.
"Feb 19, 2016",NEUTRAL,Loved it! I also just love the Civil War storyline from 2006!
"Feb 19, 2016",NEUTRAL,with flying colors!!!!
"Feb 19, 2016",NEUTRAL,best marvel movie or of every movie I every seen
"Feb 19, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Fun, action packed film with The Avengers team divided in two factions, resulting in exciting fights. Way better than Age of Ultron, I highly recommend it to Marvel fans, although fans of action films will definitely love it as well."
"Feb 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,Another fantastic marvel movie
"Feb 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,terrible dc is better
"Feb 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,Too much comedy and some pointless characters. Feels like Disney buys reviews but still a good action movie
"Feb 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best superhero movie to date!
"Feb 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,"In regards to Captain America: Civil War...

Honestly, this movie wasn't as good as people claim it to be. It was extremely overhyped, had many plot holes,especially involving Bucky, had some characters acting out of character, dealt with a small little over escalated problem instead of how civil war should have been, and just ended up ending in a train wreck. Fight scenes had no tension and jokes were cracked too often. Should take a note from DC and try to be a little bit darker.
Spider-Man was amazing as usual, but it doesn't excuse the screw ups and every Spider-Man scene seemed too rushed as if they put it in last minute(hint hint, that's what they did). 
The winter soldier was a way better movie.

Can't wait to see x-men apocalypse and suicide squad blow this movie out of the water."
"Feb 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Great film, go see it"
"Feb 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,Epic! That is all I have to say.  5 Stars.
"Feb 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,"An action packed final chapter of the Avengers phase 2 films. Some fantastic scenes and witty banter. New characters were introduced (and reintroduced) well, without boring the audience. My only gripe is that it was perhaps a little overly packed, and overly long."
"Feb 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,Great Film ð'?ð?»ð'?ð?»
"Feb 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,my favorite Marvel movie so far that tops even the first Avengers! perfect combo of comedy and action and just a great movie beginning to end!! can't wait to watch it again!
"Feb 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I love the MCU. So I will approach this in two ways. Looking at it critically, and as a fan. Hopefully the bias won't seep through.

Civil War pretty much takes off where Age of Ultron since Ant-Man (the movie) wasn't central to the general plot of the MCU, rather an origin story. It grounds all of the capes and spandex to turn into something far more real, much like Captain America: The Winter Soldier, except all the characters get the treatment. However it does this without becoming gloomy and depressing, much like Batman vs Superman. Also to note is that this movie has some of the best jokes of any Marvel film. Thanks Spidey and Paul Rudd's Ant-Man. And now Marvel has it's second GOOD villain (excluding fake Mandarin by Ben Kingsley, that was awesome), Zemo. He was subtle enough to be a driven and strong character, but operate in the background of the movie's title events. Spider Man and Black Panther were both excellent additions and stole most of their scenes. The action was one of the things I was most taken by in Winter Soldier, so I was keen to see the Russos' very well choreographed yet still very intense. Civil War delivered despite having more characters with very extravagant powers. Lastly, the plot was complex and managed to develop each character's motive so they didn't just seem like foot soldiers to add to the spectacle. By the time the final twist dropped, Captain America and Iron Man's struggle that had been building since the Avengers to be honest came into one payoff which leaves the audience with a cliffhanger demonstrating the effects of the movie"
"Feb 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,"absolutely spectacular
amazing
wonderful
well done
perfect
unlike the last Avengers this one had so many stars and did not confuse or bore at all. even with the introduction of the new Spider-Man character it did not disappoint or take away from the movie. this is by far and away the leading candidate for movie of the year so far. Let's see if it hangs on.

and for those looking for those teasers at the end........ yes there are two one in the middle of the credits. one at the end of the credits."
"Feb 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The darker themes presented in this film add fear, uncertainty, and more relatable issues to the film, making Captain America: Civil War not just an amazing superhero movie but an amazing movie in general."
"Feb 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,great movie I love the action and everything
"Feb 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Probably my favorite Marvel movie. Brilliantly written, thought-provoking, and filled with action. A blockbuster for sure."
"Feb 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,"A good movie, but a subpar Marvel movie."
"Feb 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,best one so far. Iron man starting to be a d..... tho
"Feb 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,This is a must see for comic book fans and it test the bonds of friendship.
"Feb 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,Spider man will be great addition!
"Feb 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,The greatest superhero film of all time.
"Feb 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,one of the best of the year
"Feb 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,thy could have done better
"Feb 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This movie was so exiting. It got my attention the entire movie. The visuals and the special effects were phenomenal. They looked so real and they really made this film great. Loved the character development. I thought almost every character was introduced perfectly and unlike Batman V Superman, the fighting between superheroes and the buildup of it actually made perfect sense and it was really cool to watch. Go see this movie right now."
"Feb 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Wonderful, Marvel does it again"
"Feb 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best Marvel movie to date. Everyone is going on about the airport scene but the tunnel chase is what dreams are made of. Someone call Zack Snyder and tell him this is what a superhero v superhero movie is supposed to look and feel like.
"Feb 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,Ducking awesome! My favorite of the MCU so far!
"Feb 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Spider Man and Black Panther make this movie 4 stars. Better than Avengers 2, not as good as Avengers 1, but is the best of the ""solo films"" as this is a Captain America film. Go see it ! My only critique is the length of the film. It moves a little slowly."
"Feb 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I've enjoyed most of the Marvel movies quite a bit, but was semi-disappointed with the second Avengers film,so I was worried about this movie a little.  I also thought that adding so many characters into one film would be too much, but it works well here.  I've never been a huge fan of Captain America, so I was definitely rooting for Team Iron Man (even though I knew Cap would be right).  Spider-Man was perfect in this and they didn't over explain him and him and Ant-Man added a lot to this film. Overall, not one of my favorite superhero films, but definitely one of the better than average films that I really enjoyed."
"Feb 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,10/10 best MCU movie out to date!!!!
"Feb 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It's rare I give a 5 star, but WOW!!! Fighting sequences, action sequences, dialogue, storyline, and most of all the ideas presented and challenged."
"Feb 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Not the best 'story' too much of a feeder for Spider-Man and Black Panther. They were the best parts but they shouldn't have been as Iron Man, Captain America and Black Widow have enough of a story but it's not allowed to run."
"Feb 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"(Non-Spoiler Review of Captain America: Civil War (2nd March 2016)

Captain America: Civil War is the film die hard Marvel fan needs and the one they deserve. 

Not only did The Russo Brothers (Directors of Captain America: The Winter Soldier) bring us another action packed, emotional, thriller, but they have re-defined the MCU and perfectly introduced the next Phase (3) into the Universe. 

Introducing new characters like Black Panther, Ant-Man (to the Avengers) and most importantly Spider-Man, has supported this movie even further in the wake of Phase 3. Spider-Man is undoubtedly the greatest adaptation of the character in a live-action movie we've seen on screen and we've only seen 30 minutes of him (Peter Parker/ Spider-Man). There are elements of Garfield and McGuire's portrayal of the famous web-slinger, but there are new elements, which are fined down to a point which are much truer to see in that the mind of a 15 year old teenage boy from Queens. Tom Holland's interaction with Downey again is perfected by the Russo Brothers and such fine casting of yet another British Spider-Man

Black Panther, my God! They nailed Black Panther. Chadwick Bosman has given us a fine performance and a great sneak peak into his solo film coming 2017 (Black Panther). His dark, but yet hero driven goals are riveting to watch and relatable for many of us who will understand his character further once they have seen the film on its release in the states. 

The whole plot of CA:CW is perfectly tuned to possess sense, enough action, humour and connection of characters. As we have seen Tony Stark and Steve Rogers have it out for the last 6 years or so, they've finally punched it out, Tony ""put on his suit"" and he isn't afraid of Cap. However, he is now at a cross roads, he is a new man, he caused the deaths in Sokovia with the creation of Ultron, he blames himself and he goes through this film at conflict with morality and sentiment. He wants to redeem himself in the eyes of the law and public, but Steve wants the Avengers to stay the Avengers, making their own decisions. 

Cap has stayed strong to his morals throughout the course of the MCU and this is what you see here in Civil War, his ideologies don't change, I'll let you see in the film if anything happens to suggest conflict for those ideologies. His character is cleverly crafted and the Russo brothers have used each characters direct conflict to their advantage in this phenomenal movie. 

Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany's characters have greatly developed and it was interesting to see how they grew and adapted to the Avenging lifestyle. Ant-Man having less screen time than Spider-Man is only there for a short time, but its great to see a fan in the mist of all these heroes, but only his reaction, but the Avengers Reaction to him too. 

Now. The Airport scene. I think we as fans or movie goers can all agree, this scene has probably got to be the best Action sequence of possibly all time. Everything is happening all at once in different parts of the screen. Not one shot holds to long on one fight between a set of different characters, humour is perfectly added in, I was sceptical after watching a TV Spot containing Hawkeye and Black Widow that the humour in this was ""cliché"", ""cheesy"" and unnecessary for the moment of the scene, but I was wrong, it all works perfectly. 

Coming out of the movie theatre, I am ready for Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) and Black Panther (2017). Spider-Man I'm pretty sure will be the highlight of the movie for people everywhere and yes, there are after credits scenes, one after the actors and directors, then one at the very end, which by the way are both very pleasing for the films I am excited for."
"Feb 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,My favorite Marvel movie so far.
"Feb 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,Everything I expected and more.
"Feb 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Jam-packed with connective references (big and small) to almost every other Marvel Studios movie to date, Captain America: Civil War is a near-perfect balance of humor, character moments, and depth. While it still suffers from the MCU's continual lack of compelling villains, Civil War more than makes up for it by delivering so many fist-pumping set pieces. Also, the Russos and their screenwriters manage to perfectly nail Spider-Man in a few scenes, something other directors and writers haven't been able to do in five other full-length movies."
"Feb 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,I think it will be good either way but they should have it good on both sides keep the fans eyes on the screen and yes it's captains movie but it still should have a lot if iron man and yes some should die make it a good film don't waste time you have about 2 hours it could have been two movies this is a good comic make it a good movie
"Feb 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War starts off phase 3 with a bang and great teases to look forward in future films.

All of the cast were fantastic, especially Tom Holland who steals the show and is the best Spider-Man since Toby Maguire. He had the humour, personality and is the right age for his character. The same goes for Chadwick Boseman's character Black Panther, who was greatly developed. His costume was fantastic, stunning and excellently detailed. I really look forward to seeing him more reprise this role in the standalone Black Panther film. Chris Evans once again shows how good he is in his role as Captain America. Likewise for Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man, although he mumbled a bit in the first stages, but for the rest he was great. However, for Daniel Bruhl's character Baron Zemo, he was good but personally I felt that more could have been done with his backstory and reasoning in why he's doing what he's planning.

The camerawork from the filmmakers was shakily and off-putting with the first action sequence but for the rest, it was greatly shot. The action sequences were fantastic and excellently choreographed. As for the visuals, they were great and nicely polished.

Henry Jackman's score is much better as it felt more like his style than his score for The Winter Soldier which sounded more like it was composed by Hans Zimmer! The showdown between Cap, Iron and Bucky towards the end of the movie, would be a good example to show that this is Henry Jackman's style of music which is great.

The story itself was nicely developed and properly explains the reasons of why both sides in this conflict fought against each other. Compare that to Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice which pretty much didn't offer any explanation as to why these icon heroes fought each other.

To sum it all up, apart from some of the camerawork and Daniel Bruhl's character development, Captain America: Civil War, is the best Marvel movie since the first Avengers film. It's utterly enjoyable with great characters, (Spider-Man being the best) and all round a fantastic blockbuster action film that will blow you mind away.

DON'T WAIT FOR THE BLU-RAY"
"Feb 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I've been a fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe since The Avengers came out in 2012. I've grown attached to most of the characters, engrossed in their stories, and I've become excited for every new MCU movie that has come out over the past few years. I've decided that Civil War ranks as one of the best in the series so far, gaining the same prestige that the original Avengers and The Winter Soldier earned. Anthony and Joe Russo take the reins once again behind the third movie in the Captain America series. The movie, as the title suggests, pits Captain America against Iron Man in a political and personal standoff, and it is fantastic. It serves many purposes: a sequel to The Winter Soldier, a sequel to Age of Ultron, a character builder for the Avengers, an introduction for newcomers Black Panther and Spider-Man, an action movie, a drama, and many other things. The ensemble cast is as excellent as always: Robert Downey Jr. reveals more layers to Tony Stark's personality as he confronts Chris Evans' Captain America, this time in a less friendly manner. Spider-Man makes his debut in the Marvel Universe for the first time, and his portrayal by Tom Holland is the most accurate, funny, and smile-inducing version of the Web-Slinger that audiences have encountered. I was happy to see other additions to the spectacular cast, like Chadwick Boseman as the Wakandan Black Panther and Daniel Bruhl as the sinister Helmut Zemo. Every member of the cast contributed to the story in some way, and the inner conflicts between the members of the Avengers kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. The action, of course, is well-done as usual: hand-to-hand combat sequences were appropriately accompanied by a jarring shaky camera, and the superhero throwdowns (particularly the soon-to-be-famous fight at the airport) were jaw-dropping. Perhaps my only complaint about Civil War was that its plot did seem a little unfocused at times, and I wondered if Marvel was trying to fit in too much in one movie, but by the end I realized how things tied together and that it was still, overall, well-done. It's hard to talk about Captain America: Civil War much more without giving away any spoilers, so I'll say this: as a Marvel fanboy, I'll definitely watch this movie over and over again once it's released on DVD. It's a tremendous opening for Phase 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and I can't wait to see what Marvel has in store next."
"Feb 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I had high expectations for this movie, and it looks like I was right. Captain America: Civil War is like an avengers 3 really, but it kept it close to the events that happened in Winter Soldier. The reason why this one is so good is because every marvel movie now is realistic in a way. The scenes and the events made it look so real that its scary..in a good way. Now my favorite parts in superhero movies is the fighting scenes, the fighting scene were good but just went by too quick. The last thing im going to say is that spiderman in this movie was mildly cringy to watch, like what happened to Andrew garfield. The scene were he fights Captain America and Cap says he is not bad and tells him were he's from. But other than that it's a good movie"
"Feb 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,Action packed and a thrilling start to phase 3.
"Feb 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,Take that DC. Learn how to make a versus movie...
"Feb 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,This was an okay movie though love ant-man's part
"Feb 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,The early fight scene was choppy and hard to watch. The story was great.
"Feb 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,the action was on point 100% the dialogue was a little boring but overall great film.
"Feb 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This is for you Disney and Marvel for bashing BvS:
This movie is completely overrated, too long, to kid friendly no character development, and is a Giant mess.

How you like dem apples?"
"Feb 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,Marvel beats DC. Period.
"Feb 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Having seen it twice now with a third viewing coming this weekend, I think it's safe to say this is right there with (or ever so slightly behind) The Avengers as my favorite film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
"Feb 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Excellent. One of the best, if not the best, films I've seen from The Avengers canon (and I've seen all but Ant Man and the older Hulk films). Story line is engaging, character interaction is great and fight scenes were superb. Thoroughly recommended"
"Feb 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Unconventional and personal, Captain America: Civil War explores emotional grounds while retaining a fun action-packed extravaganza of a superhero film. This is one of the greatest of the Marvel franchises and will most likely always be."
"Feb 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,Right into the action the first 20 minutes was so exciting and awesome which made up for the lack of great action in age of ultron. This movie is a pure masterpiece in action and a little comedy it sure was not a let down and you can see it many times over
"Feb 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,Great action movie! Civil War was definitely the best comic book movie of the year so far.
"Feb 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,One of the best Marvel movies to date.
"Feb 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,Dude... one of the best so far!
"Feb 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,GREAT movie!!  Def one of the best Marvel movies to date!  Unfortunately the scene I was in got cut :(
"Feb 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,Better than Batman v. Superman
"Feb 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,This is my favorite Marvel movie now
"Feb 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Honestly I'm not blown away by these movies anymore. As in I can walk into these movies & know what to expect. Nothing different. So I don't set the bar high for these movies. Winter Soldier actually really surprised me so with Civil War, Russo Brothers again, I did raise the bar up a little. Was disappointed. Hated the camera work. The music was pretty good but nothing that stood out. The acting was probably some of the best from a Marvel film ever. Loved Tony Stark's character development. Awesome fight scenes and action. Black Panther was cool and his story. Scarlet Witch was bad ass. Loved getting to see her with her powers more but not much of a character development which was disappointing. I also love Emily Van Camp so it was great seeing Sharon Carter a lot more than I thought. Where was Vision though? What a waste. Would have loved to see more of him. The story, OMG so slow & boring especially in the beginning. It took me forever to get into if ever at all. Yes these movies usually have a ton of jokes but felt all weird with this somber tone they were trying to set. Then a lot of the heroes felt shoe horned in, like Spider-Man, Ant Man & Hawkeye. When you really think about it, Spider-Man had no reason to fight. Maybe they were sent in to save the movie from its horrible story line cause Spider-Man & Ant Man were my FAVORITE parts of the movie. They made the movie more enjoyable and raised my original rating from a 2 and a half to a 3. Yes the airport battle, main scene was awesome especially in IMAX. Beautiful. So awesome!! But really? Only that scene in IMAX? So disappointed with that. I thought movies were moving forward with capturing more scenes in those glorious IMAX scenes.  O & the giant words across the screen telling me where they were at? What the? Lol. Once again they ruined another villain. Made the mistake of asking how he was in the comics & yeah sounded cooler in the comics. It's like Disney/Marvel is seeing how boring they can get away with making their villains. But if DC changes something everyone gets mad & crazy. Bad ending as well. Bottom line, same old same old, nothing new just surprised how little I enjoyed this. I get it though, why change the formula when they continue to have massive success. I try to make an effort and buy movies filmed in IMAX on Blu Ray cause I love those shots but this one I'm not even sure I want to own. While I'm loosing my interest in these movies I will probably continue watching them. For the MOST part they are quite entertaining."
"Feb 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War is a adequate and outstanding entry to the Avengers canon. It's a delightful blend of action, drama and humour. The action scenes are brilliant and the storyline is complex. I would definately recommend this film."
"Feb 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Entertaining and gripping,really fun flick..With state of the art action scenes..With a surprisingly good villain.."
"Feb 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,"A definitive chapter in the MCU with wonderful character moments, sometimes however there is a severe lack of tension (with no payoff)"
"Feb 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Fantastic flick. My early Birthday present. Really enjoyed both sides because of the winter soldier and the one liners were fantastic.
"Feb 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Spider-Man saves this film. Otherwise another dull movie about B list Superheroes who in fact don’t really have any super powers at all. Is it the first gay Superhero film as well? The gay undertones between Captain and Bucky is very strong. They should have advanced this part of the story and it would have made it more interesting. 
"Feb 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"An incredible ride of a movie as Marvel's most iconic team is sundered apart after the events of The Avengers, Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Age of Ultron forces the world to put a leash on ""Earth's Mighiest Heroes."""
"Feb 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"They needed a villain, but Spiderman was cool"
"Feb 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It's certainly not a new sort of plot because Batman vs Superman got it first. But, it's a fresh start of something new."
"Feb 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Took elements from the ""Civil War"" comic arc and turned in a Marvelous movie which is fun to watch and features of the best narratives of any comic book movie.  Plays to the audience's joy of watching the heroes in action while forever changing how Iron Man & Captain America will view one another after a gut wrenching plot line is revealed for the audience.  The movie also establishes two new heroes to the MCU in the form of Black Panther & Spider-Man (who finally has a home in the MCU).  It's a great watch, and though it doesn't top the original Avengers as my favorite MCU film it ranks right up there with ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"", ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", & ""Iron Man""."
"Feb 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"great action, nice twist, new characters. Spiderman was funny"
"Feb 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It sucks, I spend my money on this crap and I go home without my devolution, nothing like the comics, forced humor, what can I say?...it sucks, that's it."
"Feb 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Best Marvel movie out there! Really enjoyed it. They did a great job of explaining both sides of the conflict, plus Black Panther and Spider-Man were awesome!"
"Feb 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Marvel Phase 3 starts off here with an awesome huge BANG!!! Instead of hero vs villain, its heroes against heroes. Scarlet Witch vs Vision, Falcon vs Spider-Man, Cap vs Iron Man, you name it!! And Daniel Bruhl as Baron Zemo's villainy drives the plot through really well enough to being Marvel's best movie villain since Loki. And it was awesome seeing another superhero political thriller set within the already expanding Marvel Cinematic Universe."
"Feb 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The Russo Brothers delivered again. This movie is electrifying, funny when it should be, extremely emotional and truly delivers on all grounds. New characters were spectacular addition to the already outstanding cast. #InMarvelWeTrust  #RussoBrothers #TeamCap"
"Feb 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,The airport fight scene may very well be the best scene in any Marvel movie to date.
"Feb 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"So good the new Spider-Man really made me fall in love with this movie, also ant-man was hilarious even if you haven't seen the other captain American's or other marvel movies. Go see this one"
"Feb 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,I thought I was going to see a Captain America movie!  Harshly disappointed. Snooze-ville.
"Feb 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Fantastic action, great characters but for a movie with sooo much going on it moves too slow"
"Feb 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,My full opinion: 8.9/10.

"Feb 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,The best movie of the summer with the hottest men.
"Feb 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,Civil War is a spectacular cinematic achievement with unbelievable action sequences and fantastic storytelling. Every character is a breath of fresh air and the few surprises throughout make this Marvel's best film to date.
"Feb 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,"As of now, it's my favorite comic book film ever."
"Feb 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,Great movie might be the best superhero movie ever.
"Feb 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Capitan America:Civil War contiene las escenas de accion muy bien hechas con en su precuela.La inclusion de nuevos personajes fue muy bien manejado al igual que la formacion de los bandos.Pero otra vez ,por parte de Marvel,no entregan un villano muy mal manejado"
"Feb 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,Captain Americað~?need I say more!!
"Feb 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,loved this movie... lots of action.. did like the two pend against each other but made for a great storyline... go team captain..
"Feb 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,The best marvel film  a brutal blockbuster film.
"Jan 31, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Great flick that leaves you torn between teams. Tons of action, just the right amount of comic relief... overall a pleasant experience."
"Jan 31, 2016",NEUTRAL,"My all time favorite movie. Everything has purpose and the action is amazing. Imagine Captain America: Winter Soldier on steroids with an amazing and funny Spider-Man. I can't wait for the standalone Spider-Man film. This movie was pure entertainment. Make sure you've seen Winter Soldier and Avengers age of Ultron before watching.

DC:Marvel as Call of Duty IW:Battlefield 1"
"Jan 31, 2016",NEUTRAL,"As someone who isn't crazy about superhero movies, I can't help but be impressed by Marvel, and just how far their stories and characters have progressed in such a short time. Arguably the best of those characters is Captain America, simply because he's the one character people are most likely to relate to. The Captain isn't a billionaire or a king, and he doesn't have super abilities from another planet, he's just this wholesome, level headed guy, who you can't help but like. In his third feature film, Captain America (Chris Evans) comes into conflict with other members of the Avengers, as following a tragedy, the world governments decide the Avengers shouldn't be free to do whatever they want anymore. Some of them agree, some of them don't, and that's where the split occurs, leading to one of the best fight scenes I have ever seen. When I saw the previews for this film, I couldn't understand why the story wasn't used for an Avengers film. Even while watching it, I noticed that much of the focus isn't solely on Captain America, and I became even more convinced. This film was not a true stand alone like we've seen in the past, and that's because I think it was more of a transitional project than anything else. Clearly it seems as though Marvel is putting Captain America on the shelf for a while and trying to draw our attention to the new Spider-man series, starring Tom Holland. I must admit, I have never really liked Spider-man. I always saw him as bland and weak compared to the rest of the Marvel universe, but Tom Holland changed my mind in this film. He was all personality, in a way that Toby McGuire and Andrew Garfield couldn't even imagine. The charisma this good looking young actor puts out there should be enough to get anyone excited for the new series. As far as this film goes, the story was a bit complicated, and in my opinion there are far too many characters involved for this to be titled Captain America. In that sense I was disappointed, because I love the character, and was looking forward to another feature film about him. On the other hand, amazing new characters were added, a major story line was introduced into the Avengers genre, and I got to see the best action sequence I've ever seen, so while it wasn't what I expected, I still highly recommend seeing this film."
"Jan 31, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best marvel movie yet. GO SEE IT. GO. SEE. IT.
"Jan 31, 2016",NEUTRAL,Great movie!!! Best Superhero film of the century!!!
"Jan 31, 2016",NEUTRAL,This is AMAZING !!!!!! This is probably the best movie in the MCU I've seen till now!!!
"Jan 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,The new Spider-Man was the best part. Marvel sure knows how to make a superhero movie.
"Jan 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,I liked this but it didn't blow me away. Also between Vision and Scarlet Witch couldn't this battle of been avoided. Ant-Man and Spider-Man were stand out and I have to say Captain was quite annoying
"Jan 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Seeing somewhat edited version the film early I can tell you that it is indeed very interesting and well made. However, this film fails to deliver any unique aspects and the audience viewing the film will think they have seen this type of film 1000 times. I fails to live up to the hype, but enjoyable non the less."
"Jan 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"An enthralling ride of political tension, polished action sequences and all withstanding humanity."
"Jan 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Civil War plays a MAJOR part in the MCU... I CANT WAIT TO SEE IT. I'm a HUGE Marvel fan and has seen every MCU movie out and future ones too! The story- the government wants to have full access to the heroes powers until needed. This is the effect of NEW YORK,D.C. And the Age of Ultron. I'm team iron man because I personally think that Buck should be captured because of his assassinations. What team are you on? Tell me on my Instagram!- MarvelFanMCU"
"Jan 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Honestly, Marvel tends to have some of the best action scenes in film, this was no exception. The way they managed to have so many characters and give just enough of them all to keep it interesting is something other movies have failed at in the past.

I highly recommend this film!"
"Jan 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"If there is one word to describe this movie it is INCREDIBLE. When I saw winter soldier I was blown away by how good it was, it was simply incredible, I didn't think that that movie could be beat. But the Russo brothers did it again. Although the story started out rather slow and I did not enjoy the first action sequence to much, the story got better and better. And once spider-man was introduced,  this movie simply became something else. The acting is amazing, the cgi is stellar, the airport battle may be the greatest action sequence of all time, and the story was incredible 10/10 best marvel movie of all time."
"Jan 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Easily the best super hero movie to date. Marvel presents us with a grounded and emotional film where both sides are not only standing up for what they believe but have logical and understandable reasons for doing so. The conflict and the resolution thereof are both well thought out. The tone is darker than previous Marvel offerings while still managing to maintain Marvel's trademark humor and family friendliness. There is an instance of the young Spider-man using the ""s"" word that might give parents of young children pause. While an excellent movie for fans of the comics and non-fans alike, there are so many moments of fannish glee that it is almost enough to distract from the actual movie. The only real complaint I would have was some of the fight scene cinematography was jerky. I saw the film in large format 3D so I don't know if the 2D offering has the same issues."
"Jan 28, 2016",NEUTRAL,Meh. to long battle scenes were just to long and ridiculous.
"Jan 28, 2016",NEUTRAL,Siperman was excellent
"Jan 28, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The best comic book film since ""The Dark Knight."""
"Jan 28, 2016",NEUTRAL,Great!!! Awesome i could go on
"Jan 28, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Great action, way too much exposition."
"Jan 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I'm very sad to say this movie was disappointing, especially sense my favorite character/actor is in it (Robert). It wasn't very funny, and felt like a repeat of Winter Soldier."
"Jan 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,This movie was amazing great movie can't wait for Marvel to make more movies
"Jan 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,Fun movie with some good laughs at parts.  Overall though the movie doesn't add anything really new that we haven't seen before.  I wonder if superhero fatigue could be setting in soon.
"Jan 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This was a great movie it got right down to fighting and action the fighting was cool!! The scenery was great as well as the special effects. The graphics were great! Now there are New characters in the movie witch will double the action !!I like black Panther fight Buckeye and jumping off roof tops and sliding down buildings! And much more. There where funny parts in this movie. This was a confusing movie with flashbacks in the past. Ironman man and captain fighting was pretty scary and cool. The fight with Team Cap Vs team Ironman was existing and cool it just went right Dow to a fight!!

The fight of Cap Vs ironman was a good fight with lots of aggression and anger was good.

The fight with Cap fighting Ironman  and Bucky helping Cap that was a dangerous fight!

I did not like the ending to this movie because it had so much ministry to find out before the next movie. And another reason why didn't like the ending was during the end of the war do they all team up again or do they have a new leader? Now if you like superhero movies with action-packed and fighting with teams. this could be a good movie to see!!! Couse your side team Cap. Or team Iron Man

The only thing I don't like is the New Spider-Man why must he be a Avenger and I don't like his new suit. Tom Holland is a bad actor for playing Spider-Man, to me Spider man is Not a Avenger!!!! OK OK!!!"
"Jan 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,Emotional. It's not just Cap vs iron man. It's emotion vs logic. Makes you feel for both sides! Amazing movie!
"Jan 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,"SPOILER ALERT: This movie possibly suffers from the great success of past marvel movies which left very high expectations with me.  Past marvel sequel movies on the avengers, iron man, and captain America managed to surpass their predecessor movies. If I am honest, it was a good movie that entertained and what more can you ask?  But, somehow I expected to be wowed and I was not.  At one point, one hero intervenes in the battle between two others accusing them of pulling punches and that is what I feel the entire movie did.  The conflicts seemed forced and without good justification.    Spiderman's mantra, ""with great power comes great responsibility,"" was never referenced literally, figuratively, or metaphorically and I did not see adequate justification for these hero's to relinquish their judgement to lesser men and women.   Without that justification, the entire basis of the movie fails. 

I enjoyed batman vs superman much more and looked for the eventual reconciliation of the heroes that never came.  The fate of the winter soldier was not nearly as heart wrenching as the fate of superman and this movie missed the mark that batman man verses superman set.  I hope that we have not seen the peak in the marvel movie franchise, but if so, the DC movie franchise seems to be still going strong."
"Jan 26, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Better than Age of Ultron, but not as good as it should have been"
"Jan 26, 2016",NEUTRAL,Slow off start then gets really good mid way through until the end.
"Jan 26, 2016",NEUTRAL,a classic. a true blast
"Jan 26, 2016",NEUTRAL,better than Avengers 2 Age of Ultron!!
"Jan 26, 2016",NEUTRAL,Loved loved loved it and can't wait for the next marvel installment.  Saw it 3 times already and probably once more before it's gone.
"Jan 26, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Not as good as Winter Soldier, but better than Batman v Superman."
"Jan 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,I can't wait for this movie
"Jan 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This movie had it all together right out of the starting gate. The plot was well thought out, the acting was good and the action was entertaining and meaningful. This is in my opinion the best Marvel has brought to the table so far. I'm not trying to jab at anyone but the only people that would give this less then 3 stars are Trolls and people who have to have everything their way in a movie in order to be happy."
"Jan 17, 2016",NEUTRAL,Great movie!! The only thing I would say as a con is that it was a little too long but it doesn't take away from the movie.  Definitely a must see.
"Jan 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,"CIVIL WAR WAS FREAKING AWESOME! Captain America: Civil War is one of the BEST Marvel Cinematic Universe movies I've EVER SEEN! The Russo Brothers really know how to make a Captain America film that really is emotional at some parts. Knowing that they're directing the Infinity War movies for 2018 and 2019 makes me pumped up! Spider-Man is one of my favorite super heros and it was so awesome to see him on the big screen with Iron Man and Captain America! I think the final battle in this movie was super emotional for me though. This movie does what ""Batman v Superman"" failed to do: have humor, make sense, and having both sides to each other characters choices. I give Captain America: Civil War 5 stars."
"Jan 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Next to Guardians of the Galaxy, this was my favorite Marvel movie."
"Jan 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Incredible build up and conflict resulting in action packed fun with your favorite supers. Some characters are there just to be there, but who cares?"
"Jan 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This review contains spoilers, click expand to view. WOW this movie is BAD BAD BAD!!! I am SO glad that I got a free pass when the projector broke on Deadpool and I used it for this movie as I would have HATED to waste my hard earned cash on this garbage! Longest 4 hours of my life! Oh what it wasn't four hours you say? Well it FELT like four hours since it was SO bad! Where to start...

**SPOILER IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT AND WANT TO STOP HERE AS I'M GIVING SOME THINGS UP**. 
Bad starts right at the beginning. Black Widow is in an armored vehicle and the main bad guy throws a grenade in there. NOT a scratch on her! Yes she did use one of the guys to partial block the blast but there would have been SOME shrapnel that would have hit her! Speaking of her, she also is thrown 25 yards through the air at the airport scene and hit's a plane walkway and yet again, doesn't even mess up her makeup! !! UN explosion blowing up 1/2 a building...just some dirt on her cheek...COME ON!!! 

The jokes were just BAD and inappropriate for the ""seriousness"" of the subject matter. The only joke that was good was at the end when Stan Lee showed up in his self gratuitous cameo like he does with EVERY Marvel movie. 

The tunnel chase scene had HORRIBLE CGI making them look ridiculous as they were running through the tunnel. 

Bucky blocking machine gun bullets with his HAND!!! His HAND folks!!! From a MACHINE GUN!!! 

The UN blowing up was stolen DIRECTLY from Batman vs Superman when Superman was on trial. 

Plot was SO predictable a two year old could see what was coming next. 

A ""main villain"" in Zero, Zeno, Zemo...oh WHO CARES what his name was he was SO forgettable! 

Bucky told to leave ""NO witnesses"" when he killed Tony's parents. Yet there is a static camera at the EXACT spot of where the car crashes in the MIDDLE OF A FOREST to record it all! 

Spider-Man's aunt is....Marissa Tomei!?!?!? HUH?!?!?!? 

The ""Civil War"" where NONE of the heroes die. War Hero breaks his back, but it's ok with some rehab and Stark tech he's back up and walking already by the end of the movie! 

Captain America is willing to turn his back on his COUNTRY and his friends in the Avengers for ONE friend, his oldest BFF Bucky! 

Ironman's right hand gets squished by Bucky yet magically starts working again when fighting Captain America. 

The airport that had ZERO people in it...not ONE worker, nothing...and only like one plane? lol smh 

This movie is SO bad yet the Marvel sheep fans will lap it up like it's the best thing since sliced bread. Pathetic r"
"Jan 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,Awesome movie. Cannot wait for Spider-Man!
"Jan 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,Amazing! Must See Movie!
"Jan 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,Damn you Marvel ..you are winning me over
"Jan 16, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Marvel's Captain America Civil War epic feels like the end of a season rather than the start of a new phase. And that's it's strength, the culmination of 13 films of character building which leads to a very emotional and personal climax for the 2 main protagonists - something which the recent Batman V Superman failed to achieve on account of us not caring. In Marvel we care. As for the action, the airport rumble is arguably the greatest fight scene of any superhero film - there is so much going on. It's in this sequence that we get to see the much heralded new take on Spider-Man in action and he really doesn't disappoint spinning all the best bits from the Sam Raimi version into a younger and better hero. However the real scene stealer in that sequence is the return of Ant Man who is all creatures great and small. Ultimately it is Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jnr who provide the most drama - both are morally right and wrong and both will never be the same again. The finale is rather brutal and at the same time heart breaking (or is if you have invested the past 30 ish hours in the Marvel Cinematic Universe). That all said this isn't the best Marvel that it's been touted as (The Avengers and Guardians take some beating) and probably not the best Cap film (Winter Soldier is a much tighter plot) but it does showcase everything that is right able Marvel - Excelsior!"
"Jan 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,A grand adventure and I have no clue where we go from here.
"Jan 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best marvel movie yet
"Jan 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,Great action and plot line!
"Jan 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,"As a Marvel fanboy, this movie kept me on the edge of my seat for the whole thing! The Russo brothers did it again and I can't wait to see what they'll do for the Infinity Wars!"
"Jan 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Everything I thought it would be! Looking forward to what the future holds, especially with Black Panther and Spider-Man."
"Jan 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,Without doubt absolutely F*ckin amazing!!!! The scenes with Spidey are brilliant and then Ant-Man does his little trick well not so little!
"Jan 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,"well crafted story that fully develops, catches us up without assuming that we are idiots. non-stop action that leads to future storylines"
"Jan 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Good, but not great. Action scenes were really cool, but overall it left me wanting more and looking for a better plot"
"Jan 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The movie was good, but the reasoning for their fight is all over the place. Captain America wants Avengers to remain a freelance team of heroes while Iron Man wants the team to be under the supervision and limitations of the government in order to be more controlled and not put the people in danger. Then Captain America wants to save Bucky from the government while Iron Man wants to make sure that Bucky is put in the hands of the government, but later just wants to kill Bucky because, even though he was under the mind control of Hydra, Bucky killed Iron Man's parents. The movie is a great movie overall."
"Jan 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,"My favourite Marvel movie to date. A believable villain, combined with the consequences of free roaming superheroes. It deals with those consequences in a way that is unique, that gives the film a deeper understanding than ""two sides of heroes at war""."
"Jan 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Best movie in the MCU for me! We’ll see if Infinity War can surpass it. Boy oh boy, has Civil War set quite the high standard! "
"Jan 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Arguably the best of the MCU films; the Russo brothers have done a fantastic job. The action is perfect, and the comedy isn't overdone. The beauty in this film is how well done all the characters are in a film that has so much happening. As with the other Cap films, this film has the most adult themes to date -serious enough that younger kids will enjoy the action but may not necessarily understand some of the underlying messaging. GREAT FILM. A must see."
"Jan 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,Awesome!  Spidey and Panther stole the show.
"Jan 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This really should have been another ""Avengers"" movie, because all the heroes from Age Of Ultron, except for Thor, Hulk, and Quicksilver were in it. It even added Ant-Man and Spider-Man to the mix.  The story is good and not too complicatated for those of us who have seen all the other movies. It's also packed with just the right amount of action. Marvel and Disney scores with another super hero movie."
"Jan 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,Good movie with some fantastic action scenes. I recommend watching the previous movies before seeing this one. That means almost all of the marvel movies in the past 5 years.
"Jan 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,the fight secne team cap and team ironman was the best part
"Jan 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"One of the best super hero movies and certainly the best Marvel movie since Guardians of the Galaxy. The Russo brothers show again that they make the best action scenes in the MCU and are able to give proper treatment for all the heroes in the movie. Another stand out are the new comers, Black Panther and Spider Man that steal the show in every scene they are in. Don´t miss this one!"
"Jan 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War is a fantastic movie, it's action packed, dramatic, and amazing!"
"Jan 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Soooooo many fucking characters felt like Game of Thrones episode. 
Thank God for the combined comic relief of Ant Man and Spider-Man, wish they'd do a film together. Great casting call on Spidey, fortunately seems like we won't have to deal with a third origin story but looking forward to his release"
"Jan 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Fantastic movie, worth seeing."
"Jan 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,Could have been better.
"Jan 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,another marvel knock out
"Jan 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,Loved it! If I say more about what I most liked about this movie I'd be giving away spoilers...
"Jan 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Although the film felt bloated at times with so many characters on screen, Captain America: Civil War is one of the best MCU films - perhaps even one of the best superhero films - to date."
"Jan 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,"IMO it might be the best movie Marvel has put out to this point.  It has the right balance of intensity and humor.  It has Chris Evans keeping his mask on (because that's what Captain America does) and not having it fly off every second minute (for whatever Hollywood preening reason).  If Marvel is going to make a misstep with having too many characters and not enough movie for them, this offering is definitely not going to be the one that offers viewers a look at the chink in the company's armor.  There are some pleasant surprises within for comic fans and casual fans alike in here.  I'd happily go to the theatre again to see this and am anxiously looking forward to buying the DVD."
"Jan 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Captain America Civil War is not only a great superhero movie,but also a great movie, period.The only problem that this movie stops it self from being a flawless movie,is the movie's villain."
"Jan 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,Great action and humor! The plot actually made sense and the new characters are great too! I am a big critic and this movie was great!
"Jan 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,Awesome vs movie. Very long. Yay Spider-Man. 2 post credits scenes.
"Jan 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,Was very good loved Spider-Man
"Jan 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Brilliant movie these captain America movies just get better and better 
Tom Hollands portrayal of spiderman is the best version up to date more like the comic book"
"Jan 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,One of the best Marvel films to date
"Jan 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,Thought this movie was pretty good. For me I preferred Captain America: The Winter Soldier more but I did enjoy this. My favourite part of the movie was Spider-man and I'm pretty excited for the new Spidey movie coming next year. #TeamSpidey
"Jan 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"There were a lot of good elements to this film, especially the government oversight issue. Too often, when the government gets involved too deeply it's difficult for justice to be served and situations are handled to get votes instead of to do the right thing. Tony's character is such a hypocrite throughout that the film can be a little nauseating, mostly because he blames everything that he has done on everyone else and doesn't know how to reconcile collateral damage with the number of lives that are saved in contrast. This is also apparent during the Scarlet Witch incident. If she had not accidentally killed the numbers that she did, more would have died through her inaction. Lots of moral flaws in this film, but the film doesn't look at these flaws as wrong, and I think this is where it suffers the most."
"Jan 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,EXCELLENT!!! ESPECIALLY IN 3D!!!!
"Jan 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,I think this one was one of the best movies A a lot of action
"Jan 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,Has one of the best superhero fight scenes ever. Spider man was finally done right. Black Panther is awesome. Villain lacked a little but other than that it was one of marvels best.
"Jan 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The greatest marvel film hands down. Perfect balance of action and character development. Tops Avengers for me. Black Panther, Spider-Man, and Ant-Man are amazing. The airport scene is one of the best action scenes I've ever seen in a theater. I can't wait to go back and watch it again."
"Jan 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I'm amazed by the outpouring of favor for this movie. Was it fun: yes. Was it memorable: no. Not enough time was given to the tropes of heroes that graced the screen for any genuine heartfelt development. It was like a hot dog with every ingredient thrown on. Too much. I like chile dogs. I like mustard and relish. I even fancy ketchup and onions, but all of it together was a mess."
"Jan 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Full of humor, touching, and thought provoking moments. Whatever side you choose, you will feel for both."
"Jan 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,This is a turd movie. The spfx look horrible. Marvel keeps making crap. Black looks horrible.
"Jan 8, 2016",NEUTRAL,A little darker than others--but just as funny and riveting--Civil War is another excellent installment to the MCU.
"Jan 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Hands down great! Having 12 heroes on one screen is pretty badass
"Jan 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Refreshing to have the action with story substance.
"Jan 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,It was ok movie sorry but I feel it could had been much better. Felt more like avengers civil war.  Movie was a bit long.
"Jan 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,Typical comedy over substance marvel film.
"Jan 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Awesome! This is easily in my top 3 to 5 of the MCU films! While it's not my favorite story of the MCU, it is the overall best made film in the series, I think. It's always great to see a bunch of heroes battling on screen at the same time, which is probably part of why I like the 2 Avengers so much too. This was easily the most emotionally driven story and it really made you contemplate just whose side you were on. I was Team Iron Man the majority of the film, but ended up just abut 50/50 in the end."
"Jan 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It was a struggle getting around to watching Civil War and I think, in hindsight, it was because I am struggling to admit what we all know to be true. Superhero fatigue isn't just real, it's right here on top of us. Despite this being the era of Deadpool, we've watched Age of Ultron, Fantastic Four, Batman v. Superman and Apocalypse, four franchise pillars, fall anywhere from dull to downright awful. Well over a billion (or two) in expenses and, if we're being truly honest with ourselves, not much to show for it. Characters we love have been reduced to boring stereotypes or counter-character abominations. Action sequences have become green screen, physics defying CGI affairs with minimal stakes and zero tension. Quips, signature lines and tired storylines are getting phoned in these days and are preceded by trailers so predictive of the film, it may not even be worth seeing at all. In many ways, Civil War is the crux of this. Don't get me wrong, the latest Cap installment (and make up Avengers film) has better production value, effects and story than BvS ever was going to have but at the same time, you can tell that the Marvel team is getting stale in their own way and/or they simply don't have to try anymore because the competition is so pathetic (Fox is just hugging rights while DC shambles through its half wit schedule like a zombie). Halfway through, no credible villain has emerged. Halfway through, the team is still having nonsensical, black and white arguments over nuanced issues that seem easily solved. Halfway through I'm less of a Team Cap/Team Iron Man guy and more of a Team Get Me The Fuck Outta Here. Spiderman is a painful shoehorn while Black Panther is both a black friend and a confusing bundle of irrational anger and Wakandan mumbo jumbo. Somewhere in this overly polished and mass produced turd there's a floating prison, some super soldiers, some wierd, underdeveloped romance nods and a crazy doctor. Crossbones is a 30 second afterthought. It isn't as packed as Age of Ultron but in some ways, it's even flatter. No real conflict ever develops because Marvel isn't capable of the dialogue to set that up and no one could really die anyhow. I won't blame this solely on the Russo brothers however, as someone managed to right the ship in the last 20 minutes, where the movie suddenly regains some of the serious nature that Winter Soldier had. In these waning moments, the meat of the movie comes to light, the conflict between friends struggling with how to go about doing the right thing. Unfortunately, like so many other films, it's too little, too late. Captain America is barely fun anymore. The movie isn't a sign of Superhero Fatigue, it is Superhero Fatigue. Slog through at your own peril."
"Jan 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The best Marvel movie...and action that makes The Raid and Matrix movies step back. Best incarnation of Spider-Man. Ant Man was great and Black Panther surprised me. Bucky is always insane fun.

Cap and Iron Man were excellent especially Iron Man...best since Iron Man 1. 

Still like The Dark Knight as my favorite comic book movie but if that's #1 this is 1a. Bravo."
"Jan 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Nothing is perfect but this was darn near close, it's causing confusion for me, on whether it's the best Marvel film to date Top 5 Marvel Film Top 10 all time movie."
"Jan 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,great movie way better than batman vs superman sorry DC your movie absolutely sucks balls I see cats fuck better than your movie marvel rules.
"Jan 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Amazing and satisfying!
"Jan 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,Civil War is so freakin spectacular. I can't even explain. It couldn't get any better than this. Definitely became one of my top 5 favorite films of all-time
"Jan 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,that was too much cgi for my liking.
"Jan 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I can't imagine a better version of this story for the MCU or a better introduction of two of the most iconic superheroes in history in Spider-Man and Black Panther. It raises the bar for all comic book movies to come, and cinematic storytelling in general. Marvel continues to create and expand on a world and characters that I can't get enough of. The Russo Brothers have taken the mantle and ran with it. Can't wait to see what they come up with next."
"Jan 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Another absolute snooze-fest. Too many characters, too much nonsense, just too much. Too long too. It really feels like a 2.5hr endurance event. I've ran marathons faster than this...and enjoyed it more."
"Jan 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,The best Marvel movie to date! Must see it again soon!
"Jan 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"the end of this trailer hit home with me, when capt . America tell iron man he's my friend"" iron man response is"" and i thought u were my friend""....i know the feeling....to familiar"
"Jan 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Well... They haven't done a bad one yet. I was worried with the great critic reviews that it might fall short.  It did not! What a great balance of action, depth of characters, and confusion as to the ""good side."" All of the characters did a great job and continue to push these story lines and to give us reasons to come back. Side note... The Spider-Man addition seemed a little misplaced and random... Though, the young man playing the new Spider-Man seems great, I'm not sure they had to ""make"" it fit (as well as Ant-Man)..."
"Jan 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best Captain America movie to date.
"Jan 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,Amazing movie! True sequel to winter soldier. Must watch
"Jan 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,Awesome movie. It's a must see.
"Jan 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Essentially Avengers 2.5, without Thor or Hulk, but still excited notheless. I'm very eager to saw what they do. with spiderman."
"Jan 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,The best marvel film so far infinity war has a lot live up to. will over 63 characters.
"Jan 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Holds up to the standard set by Joss Whedon. Fun, full of action and funny. Having so many powerhouse characters competing for you attention does detract a bit from the experience."
"Jan 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,Action packed with humor!
"Jan 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,Overall such a great film there was only a few minor issues that I wasn't totally cool about.
"Jan 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Excellent movie, surprised at the ending!"
"Jan 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Another solid Marvel Film. I'm gonna forgo any of the plot as to not spoil it for anyone. I enjoyed the film it continues the Marvel Cinematic Universe and still has enough surprises to keep the audience guessing. This time around there's less of a villain and more of a focus on the inner conflict of the two sides (thus the Civil War title). Having read the Civil War comic series itself I knew it would be loosely based on it, but for what its worth the cinematic version did it justice. The film does have some lows still regardless of the rave reviews coming in. The central villain is very week (especially after you figure out his whole scheme) and at times especially near the end I felt like it could have went another 20 minutes to clear up some plot holes (a Civil War with only one battle? cmon haha). I enjoyed it regardless especially finally seeing Spider-Man (Tom Holland) join the Marvel Cinematic Universe and also Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) getting his due. Regardless of what I write here I know everyone's gonna go and check it out still, so enjoy!"
"Jan 3, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The best marvel, and superhero movie to date."
"Jan 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,This should have been avengers movie more than captain america movie. :D :D I loved this one. True to comic book fans and ending was little unexpected but ya it was good.. :D
"Jan 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The most epic movie ever made, thank you Russo brothers."
"Dec 31, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Maybe I'm being too critical, but the plot of this whole movie was them not agreeing on whether or not their battles should be regulated?!!! BORING!!!"
"Dec 31, 2015",NEUTRAL,Awesome movie! Two after credit scenes! Dc comics needs to learn from marvel
"Dec 30, 2015",NEUTRAL,One of Marvel's best movies!!!!!
"Dec 30, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Smoothly combining the best parts of the Marvel Cinematic Universe into one massive film, Captain America: Civil War is arguably the best entry in the franchise. It seamlessly bounces back and forth between political thriller and fun action blockbuster, allowing you to appreciate both the serious moments and the silly. Chris Evans continues his spot-on portrayal of Captain America, and is supported by a cast of returning actors who are confident and comfortable in their roles. Newcomer Chadwick Boseman plays a fierce Black Panther, and is set up well for a solo film a few years from now. The runaway star of this already filled-to-the-brim film is Tom Holland as Spider-Man. Easily the most accurate depiction of the character on screen, Holland's character is simply a delight to watch. Captain America: Civil War has what is perhaps the best superhero scene ever put to film in the form of the airport fight that was teased in the trailers. After the adequate Avengers: Age of Ultron and underwhelmingly solid Ant-Man, this is a reminder that the Marvel Cinematic Universe can still deliver."
"Dec 30, 2015",NEUTRAL,very very good  drag some spots
"Dec 29, 2015",NEUTRAL,"More dialogue than normal, but still awesome!"
"Dec 29, 2015",NEUTRAL,"What a great fun movie, marvel definitely knows what there doing as this is by far the best captain America movie, DC take notes this is how you make a great comic book movie.... Spider-Man stole the show for me if can't wait to see more of him and I way impressed by the young actor who played him."
"Dec 29, 2015",NEUTRAL,I enjoyed watching this movie more than age of ultron. The effects were better but there nothing keep you thinking about what will happen next.
"Dec 29, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Captain America Civil War was a very good movie, not a great one.  The action scenes we're very good and eye catching  and did a little to make up for the plot holes present in movie.  The overall plan of Zemo was a little far fetched and there were too many cogs in it for it to work as exactly as planned, but it did. Crossbones wad a throw away villian and was wasted.   Even after Tony found out about the real plan, he went right back to the way he was before he knew the truth.  the introduction of Black Panther and Spider-man were done brilliantly.   I really enjoyed seeing them in the MCU. overall a good movie.  Loved Ant-Man and Falcon was a Breakout star in this too"
"Dec 29, 2015",NEUTRAL,THE BEST COMIC BOOK MOVIE OF ALL TIME!
"Dec 29, 2015",NEUTRAL,"A spectacular film. Marvel gas really pulled off the whole crumbling from within idea and it's hard to remember that this isn't an Avengers film. I really liked the backstory with the Black Panther and the sneaky credits scene that (apparently) ties in with the gives hints at Thor: Ragnarok. 

However, I wasn't particularly happy with how they included Spiderman and Ant-Man - Spiderman's actor was changed again and he was nerdified even more, while Ant-Man was easily dismissed as a minor character -  even when he has his own movie. 

Overall, a superb film that I would gladly watch again. Thanks Marvel!"
"Dec 29, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Great movie!  The addition of Black Panther, Antman, & Spider-Man was perfect."
"Dec 29, 2015",NEUTRAL,Another great movie from the Russo brothers. All the characters were great. Black Panther and Spider-Man were a great addition.
"Dec 29, 2015",NEUTRAL,Yep... Worth the price of a ticket. Good story... Good acting... Amazing fight scenes!
"Dec 29, 2015",NEUTRAL,Awesome crazy good.  Fight scenes are amazing. Love it
"Dec 29, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Once again, Marvel Comics has lived up to the hype. Unlike DC Comics, their comic book movie competitor, Marvel successfully gave us two of our favorite superheroes waging ideological warfare over how to protect the civilians they swore to protect. A plot with which Batman v. Superman made a widely known failed attempt. 

The plot here is less inherently interesting than the sheer intestinal fortitude it takes a studio to produce a film like this. Civil War undeniably reads as yet another episode in the television show made of movies that the Marvel Cinematic Universe has turned into, but this is like one of the really good ones. The action is top notch, always keeping you on your toes with different fighting styles ranging from Captain America to Iron Man to newcomers like Ant-man, Spider-Man, and Black Panther, all of which add their own perfect touches to the fabric of this picture. Credit goes to Joe and Anthony Russo, the directors of this film, as well as its predecessor Winter Soldier. They find a way to give every character a moment to shine, realizing that all of these characters are someone's favorite, and deserve their second in the spotlight. Personally, I was delighted to see Paul Rudd's return as Scott Lang/Ant-man. He has quickly become my favorite addition to the MCU, and this film locked that up for me. 

However, it's not all perfect. As fun as the movie is, it weighs in at 147 minutes, and it feels it, particularly toward the beginning and again around the three quarters mark. While the amount of characters involved leads to some of the films best moments, it also adds to the bloat, and leads to the film being torn between whether it would rather be another Captain America movie or another Avengers movie. It's understandable why the filmmakers felt the need to put those two films together, but the execution of it perhaps wasn't as clean as it should've been. 

Regardless, Captain America: Civil War is a fantastic time at the movies and a terrific way to start off the summer movie season. This one continues to build off of Ant-man, which helped to refocus the MCU after the mixed results of last year's attempt to dominate the summer with Avengers: Age of Ultron. If for nothing else, the airport scene, which is briefly shown in trailers is more than enough reason to see this movie, possibly multiple times. This is easily one of the strongest superhero movies to date."
"Dec 29, 2015",NEUTRAL,Surprised me and exceeded expectations. Black Panther was the best thing
"Dec 28, 2015",NEUTRAL,"This movie is another big success for Marvel and it is one of there best. If anything the solo films of Captain America always seems to be better than the previous films unlike Thor and Iron Man where there sequels are good still doesn't compare to the first. Captain America Civil War has a very serious tone to it. The comedy doesn't really come in till we get scenes with Ant Man & Spider-Man. The Russo Brothers does a great job on keeping this as a Captain America and Iron Man story rather than and Avenger movie. The movie continues rate off from the events of Age of Ultron which where is now at the point people are afraid of the Avengers because of the threats that comes there way. Yes the Avengers always manage to save the day but still can't save everyone and can't fix the damaged that has happened to the innocent. Captain America Civil War is not just a story on freedom but it is also can be a story of revenge which is what made a great way to introduce The Black Panther and to see Tony's connection with Hydra. Another great thing about this film was seeing Spider-Man in an MCU film. If anything he and Ant-Man were the best parts about the airport scene. Marvel nailed it with Spider-Man on his attitude and made the right choice on casting a teenager for this part. It was also nice to see that his first costume was crappy looking because he is just a kid that is getting his foot in the door of being a superhero. I really think this was Sony's wises choice on canning the Amazing Spider-Man series and start of fresh on a new series with the help of Marvel. Because of Civil War I am now more looking forward to Spider-Man Homecoming. If there is one thing I did not enjoy of this film it was the villain Helmut Zemo, This is not the Zemo that people know from the comics. In the comics he is Captain America's second arch nemesis and is also one of the big threats to the Avengers. He is smart, dangerous, involved with hydra and has great fighting skills. In this movie he is just smart and wants to tear the Avengers apart for the pain they have caused him and by tearing them apart he uses The Winter Soldier. Besides from another unlikes villain in this series the movie is still great."
"Dec 28, 2015",NEUTRAL,very good movie didn't even realize how long it was to good to care
"Dec 28, 2015",NEUTRAL,The Winter Soldier is still the best of the Captain America films
"Dec 28, 2015",NEUTRAL,This was an excellent movie! One of the best Marvel movies ever made! It's a must see! You don't want to miss this.
"Dec 27, 2015",NEUTRAL,greatest marvel movie yet!!!
"Dec 27, 2015",NEUTRAL,Good form beginning to end. from when spiderman is introduced to the end nothing but action and laughs. amazing cast and writing. Stan Lee does make cameo just have to wait lol. end credit seen leads into a character (spinoff) movie. go see it worth the $$
"Dec 27, 2015",NEUTRAL,Very Good Long But Overall Necessary For Story Build. Loved Seeing Some new and Old Characters And Some Amazing Action Sequences. Especially Funny When Fed-Ex Shows Up (Thats all im saying...)

"Dec 27, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Very very good. 
They've made a good'en. Great special FX, funny, exciting, well choreographed fight scenes. And I love the new SpiderMan!!!!"
"Dec 27, 2015",NEUTRAL,Amazing! Was an amazing Marvel movie. Marvel Cinematic Universe really out did themselves. They set the bar high for their other movies. But it didn't really follow the comics that much which is kind of meh.
"Dec 27, 2015",NEUTRAL,Lots of characters and action and CGI - if that's for you then go see it.
"Dec 27, 2015",NEUTRAL,Good movie! Civil war is hurt but it is necessary.
"Dec 27, 2015",NEUTRAL,Maybe the best marvel movie thus far.
"Dec 26, 2015",NEUTRAL,this movie  was off the charts awesome  i love it
"Dec 26, 2015",NEUTRAL,"I really enjoy the Marvel movies that don't come up with a plot that has a clear cut bad guy and then clear cut heroes, I like it when it's a little more grey, just like this one.  Each side to this fight has their merit which makes it hard to route for either one, but that makes for a more compelling story and also really good dialogue. This definitely advances the MCU story into more interesting an serious territory and I'm looking forward to them."
"Dec 26, 2015",NEUTRAL,A bit slow but still epic! Black Panther stole the scenes!
"Dec 26, 2015",NEUTRAL,Best MCU movie yet. This movie was absolutely amazing.
"Dec 25, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Captain America's 3rd installment, Civil War, improves on everything before it. The central conflict between Team Cap and Team Iron Man really makes feel for the characters and makes you understand where each and everyone of them is coming from and why they chose their respective side. To keep this brief, Spiderman is seriously the BEST Spiderman we have ever seen on screen. Black Panther also shines in this movie as do all of the characters. My only complaint would be the villian. He is the most lamest villian in the MCU by far. I really like the DC characters/movies but DC seriously needs to step up their game. Just go and see this movie, you will NOT be disappointed."
"Dec 25, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Best Marvel movie to date! This movie really did not need any villains as the conflict between Captain America and Iron Man heats up the screen. Both men recruit there team and we end up with a huge slugfest at an airport that is brilliant. The introduction of Black Panther (finally) is genius, fantastic character with some bad ass moves and seeing Wakanda on screen has got me excited for 2018 and his first solo movie. Who steals the show? Well it may be Spider-Man, this looks like the definitive version of the character to date and a great portrayal by Tom Holland. He is on screen for quite some time with and without his mask, the rest of the crew are great and the showdown between the two main guys is fantastic. This leaves the Marvel universe open for some great stories to come. Awesome!"
"Dec 25, 2015",NEUTRAL,"I felt like the Avengers were the best part of Any Man, and ant man was the best part of this movie."
"Dec 25, 2015",NEUTRAL,It is FANTASTIC! And Black Panther is AWESOME!!!!
"Dec 25, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Great film, entertaining, fun, lots of action, great cast, and Good story."
"Dec 25, 2015",NEUTRAL,Loved it absolutely incredible film so glad the Russo brothers are doing infinity war. everyone get there chance to shine such a great movie yet again from marvel.
"Dec 25, 2015",NEUTRAL,Couldn't have been better than that. Best action movie of the year.
"Dec 25, 2015",NEUTRAL,great movie in every way
"Dec 25, 2015",NEUTRAL,Best Superhero movie to date. wasn't sure if one could top Dark Knight or Avengers but this one did just that.
"Dec 25, 2015",NEUTRAL,This movie rocks!!! Tops all other super hero movies. While Age of Ultron meet with mixed reviews little did we know that Age of Ultron was the set up and Civil War was going to be the payoff and payoff it did in huge ways. This film is 98% perfection with only 2 complaints 1 the fight scene in the beginning was too close up and too fast. 2 I didn't like Spider Mans costume. Other than that this movie is on point from start to finish. With huge expectations and tons of hype this movie doesn't disappoint.
"Dec 24, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Marvel's latest installment Captain America: Civil War is a fantastic entry in what appears to be the unstoppable Marvel machine headed by Disney and Kevin Feige. Civil War while having all the big set pieces of an Avengers movie and the fight scenes that will make any nerd sweaty is more of a character piece that explores the themes of loyalty, betrayal, friendship, revenge, and forgiveness. But the question of course everyone wants to know is which is better Civil War or BvS? The answer is Civil War but its really not a fair comparison. What makes Civil War great goes beyond the inner workings of the movie itself rather it is the culmination of the the stories Marvel has told about the characters through their shared universe. The audience feels like they know Tony Stark because we have seen him in 5 movies, we know who Captain America is and what his motivations are because we have seen him in 4 movies because of this Civil War is made all the better. The movie as a standalone file is excellent in its own right a moral question arises after an Avengers mission that asks the question who do the Avengers and other super powered beings answer to? Should their actions be regulated and controlled will that control serve the interest of the common man or the governments that control them and breaks down the very idea of being a hero or a vigilante and what separates the two. Lets not forget about the performances either Black Panther is incredible in this movie and I left wishing that movie was coming out alot sooner Chadwick Boseman was a force in this movie and brings a different tone to the Avengers. Spiderman is also amazing for the time that he is in the film as well. Final act of this movie is great and provides an unexpected emotional weight that will possibly move you from one side of the argument to the other. At the end of the day Civil War is probably the best film in the MCU no you don't get that same feeling that you got when you first saw the Avengers together but it shouldnt that moment can never be replaced but this movie stands shoulder to shoulder with Avengers and Dark Knight as the best superhero movie ever created. Who would have thought Captain America movies would be this amazing as I was the first person to say ""Nobody wants to see a Captain America movie, he looks ridiculous"", Marvel so far can do no wrong lets just see how Doctor Strange turns out."
"Dec 24, 2015",NEUTRAL,This movie was incredible!! It blew me away with awesome action and amazing performances by the actors. I highly recommend it.
"Dec 24, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Captain America was what we all wanted! This movie was not like the let down of Batman Vs Superman's 8 minute fight scene but for this it was the whole movie. You felt the hatred between all the characters and it was difficult to choose a side! But this movie is what I was looking for after BvS, 5 stars!!!!"
"Dec 23, 2015",NEUTRAL,Awesome. I really love the addition of this Spiderman. Lots of funnies and heartache for me. I would watch it again and again.
"Dec 23, 2015",NEUTRAL,"It's just OK, which is a disappointment. Spider-Man is amazing (sorry for the pun) and the big fight is colorful, manic entertainment, but it's never anything more than a skin-deep superhero action flick."
"Dec 23, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Marvel once again smashes one out of the park in Civil War. The excellent cast lives up to the hype, and the Russo's direct an even better film than The Winter Soldier. A lot of the action is perfectly shot, but some choppiness does occur. Even though the plot is filled with a lot of dialogue in the middle, it's all very well scripted and executed. Once again though, the villains in this film are either underused or don't do enough to make them terribly compelling. Marvel also takes an unexpected darker take on this film than past movies, and it works out to be amazing. In the end, I can say that Marvel has not lost the touch that made their debut film, Iron Man, a smash hit, it may even have improved on its formula."
"Dec 23, 2015",NEUTRAL,Great movie great plot
"Dec 23, 2015",NEUTRAL,Phenomenal movie from start to finish!!!
"Dec 23, 2015",NEUTRAL,Freakin' awesome! The best Captain America yet!
"Dec 23, 2015",NEUTRAL,Awesome movie. Great cast and great special effects. A little slower paced then most marvel movies and the villain wasn't very strong. The action scenes were very well done and spiderman was by far the best part of the movie.
"Dec 23, 2015",NEUTRAL,fantastic but extremely long.
"Dec 21, 2015",NEUTRAL,"There are not word or I cain't think of them, to describe how much I loved and enjoyed it. The whole entire movie was amazing!"
"Dec 21, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Much more of an Avengers movie than a Captain America movie. Still, this is one of the better action-adventure flicks. Obviously setting the stage for things to come, but totally grounded within itself. The tension and emotion were excellent and balanced well with the action and CGI. It might be worth a second look just to get all the sight gags and one-liners."
"Dec 21, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Sure it may not have been comic accurate, but I had a blast!"
"Dec 21, 2015",NEUTRAL,One of the best Superhero movies!!!!
"Dec 21, 2015",NEUTRAL,Definitely out beat the other Avengers Captain America
"Dec 21, 2015",NEUTRAL,Marvelâ(TM)s best yet by far.
"Dec 21, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Comic book fans and moviegoers that have enjoyed the great aspects of Captain America: The Winter Soldier are going to be bombarded with what Captain America: Civil War was able to do with those same aspects, making this the greatest Marvel Cinematic Universe film to date."
"Dec 20, 2015",NEUTRAL,Captain America: Civil War is an absolutely  blast to watch. Marvel have yet to disappoint with the Captain America film franchise as it;s quickly becoming the staple of how Marvel films should aspire to be. With amazing scenes that would make any super hero fan happy. In end. what is there to say just to say fantastic movie probably the best marvel movie yet.
"Dec 20, 2015",NEUTRAL,Spidey done right! Well done movie heart wrenching at times but still really good!
"Dec 20, 2015",NEUTRAL,Best comic book movie since the Dark knight and one of best movies of the 21st Century
"Dec 20, 2015",NEUTRAL,Best superhero movie ever! Love the struggle of the characters and their relationships they have with themselves and others. It makes for interesting plots from here on.
"Dec 19, 2015",NEUTRAL,This movie was a thrill till the credits
"Dec 19, 2015",NEUTRAL,That scene DEFINITELY needed to be shirtless!
"Dec 19, 2015",NEUTRAL,"The best movie of the MCU, so far"
"Dec 19, 2015",NEUTRAL,"I've been on my own since I was 18. I never really fit in anywhere, even in the army. My faith's in people, I guess. Individuals. And I'm happy to say that, for the most part, they haven't let me down. Which is why I can't let them down either. - Steve Rogers #teamcap"
"Dec 19, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War get even more serious, dark and gritty than its predecessor and this proves that Marvel is still the one to beat!"
"Dec 19, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Amazing movie, it's funny, action packed and emotional all wrapped in a burrito of goodness. A few minor flaws but other than that it is an awesome theatrical experience. Can't wait to see t again."
"Dec 19, 2015",NEUTRAL,The greatest superhero movie ever
"Dec 19, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Strong storyline, great actors, fantastic story line and unarguably features one of the best fight scenes to feature in a movie."
"Dec 18, 2015",NEUTRAL,"If you like a load of marvel comic book characters fighting each other in CGI you'll love Civil War. Personally, I found it a little over the top."
"Dec 18, 2015",NEUTRAL,Action packed! Stunningly epic! Visually dazzling!
"Dec 18, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Great movie! It had everything a action, adventure movie could have. I'm going to see it again. This is only meant to be seen in the theater."
"Dec 18, 2015",NEUTRAL,It's full of plot holes. And boring movie
"Dec 18, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Takes notes DC, this is how you do a versus movie."
"Dec 18, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Best Marvel movie Sense The Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy, and Deadpool"
"Dec 18, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Highly entertaining, well done and substantive."
"Dec 18, 2015",NEUTRAL,Awesome. Everything Batman vs Superman should've been.
"Dec 17, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Excellent movie, this film lived up to the hype and more. I will be adding this to my Collection."
"Dec 17, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Only be cause Ant Man made an appearance and introduction of Black Panther.  It's very slow and too much time spent in fight scenes.  One more thing, Chris Evans is still fine as ever!"
"Dec 17, 2015",NEUTRAL,The film has great action sequences along with a strong story and interesting characters Civil War is great way to end the trilogy of one of Marvel's most iconic hero.
"Dec 16, 2015",NEUTRAL,"This movie is not just about super heroes fighting, It does have some depth to it about friendship with Bucky and captain America, and conflict between iron man and captain America. Also best Spider-Man to be see on the cinema screens, and best choreographed action on a marvel movie!"
"Dec 16, 2015",NEUTRAL,"This was a must see. Great action and fighting, too bad it was amongst themselves. Some friends is just hard to let go. Can't wait to see how the next one will unfold."
"Dec 16, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War, one of my most anticipated movies of the year and it did not disappoint, this movie was fun, entertaining and gritty. Firstly, I wasn't looking to forward to Spider-Man but after watching this I am confident that this is the best representation of Peter Parker/ Spider-Man EVER. Literally everything that comes out of that kids mouth is hilarious. Ant-Man, as you'd expect, is also very funny and these two characters bring the most laughs. The introduction of Black Panther was also very welcomed and he really is a bad ass and very noble as well. Also I think this is the most likeable I've seen Iron Man as he has more emotion and compassion than in previous films. There is one fight scene that I won't spoil but it is one of the best sequences in any super hero movie ever. Look out for that. Furthermore, unlike Batman v Superman this film didn't spoil the plot in the trailers so I was actually able to be surprised while watching this. I guess the villain could of been more compelling but at the end of the day he did his job. As superhero movies go, this was one of the most enjoyable in the whole of the MCU and it made some gutsy decisions that will change it forever."
"Dec 16, 2015",NEUTRAL,"I just have one word to describe ""Captain America: Civil War"": PERFECT!
10/10 all characters were amazing.

The Russo brothers was the best choice and they should run all the MCU.

They are magicians, that's how you do a superheroes movie, I never wanted to finish watching it, it's a magnificent piece or art 

The only advice that i can give to the people is: if you will never understand than comics or books movies will never be adapted exactly, you will never enjoy any movie based on that, you people need to understand that the MCU, and de DCEU, aren't the comic's exactly adapted to the movies and it will never be like that"
"Dec 15, 2015",NEUTRAL,"""Sometimes I want to punch you in your perfect teeth""

Well, here we are

Finally Civil War is here!

And my verdict....it's good! But not as amazing as I hoped it would be

The good? Civil war is two and a half hours long and somehow manages to include all these superheroes with just enough time deserved for each of them and perfect introductions. Black panther and Spider-Man...wow. Just wow. I don't even want to spoil it, they are amazing additions to the MCU and I am sweating to see what they do next. What else is good? Action pieces are on point, the airport scene was humourous and spectacularly flashy. And what about the narrative....well here's where Civil War Shines and Dims itself at the same time. There are some truly great moments of emotional resonance between Stark and Rodgers. You can see similarities between them and how they are fighting uselessly against a greater hidden enemy, their biases. 

But

Civil war can get very messy and constricted. The showdown is stuffed to the brim with plot points that it does get uncomfortable to a certain degree. And I hated that, I want to see them fight for a reason and they did....and then it deflates into obscurity.  They are both clearly passionate heroes and have massive intentions for action. There were just some enraging moments where sections of the film seem unfilled with a competent resolutio, and other parts where it feels like the scene was unecessary and used to fill time. Very annoying 

Overall, I am going to give Captain America: Civil War a very generous 75/100 for its highly impressive comic book side and a story which is designed to make you feel uneven being done with such impact is a tough thing to pull off, but they manage it just about. And that's well done.

B+

75/100"
"Dec 14, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Someone should film Zack Snyder watching cap: civil war and right at the end go,,,,, you see!!! That's how it's done!

Funny, smart and great action. Best marvel yet."
"Dec 14, 2015",NEUTRAL,Phenomenal movie. Everything I wanted from a superhero flick.
"Dec 14, 2015",NEUTRAL,Probably the best superhero movie i have ever seen.
"Dec 14, 2015",NEUTRAL,"The third film of Steve Rogers is a smart adaptation of one of the most important events of the modern era of Marvel Comics. With a fully appropriate to its own universe own story, including new characters that bring much to the table and spectacular action scenes, expectations for Phase 3 of Marvel they are higher than ever. We hope not disappoint us.

Similarly, Robert Downey Jr. has changed organically in their way of being Tony Stark. This is not the same arrogant Stark revealed to be Iron Man on the tape that opened the MCU. Everything that has lived has reformed and damaged. From the first Avengers and Iron Man 3 we saw more thoughtful and, of course, all that burst into Age of Ultron. And although it is still the same charismatic guy, Tony Stark has changed and Downey Jr. has managed to achieve with grace.

On the side of the action, Civil War has spectacular sequences that take advantage of both the current film technology, such as the powers of all the heroes, to shine and make her feel the original. In particular, the fight of the airport will most likely be remembered for a long time and a reference in action movies will become.

It is very clear that Anthony and Joe Russo brothers dominate the spectacular action movie Captain America: Civil War is a taste of what they will do with the two parts of Avengers: Infinity War, the event promises to bring together the full MCU.

In the end, Civil War has everything you can expect from a tape of Marvel Studios in 2016: great visual effects, endearing characters, sense of humor and clues about what is to come later in other deliveries."
"Dec 14, 2015",NEUTRAL,Everything BvS wasn't. Civil War juggles so many elements so expertly that you can't help but sit back and admire how well it all works. It also has THE greatest action sequence of any superhero movie.
"Dec 14, 2015",NEUTRAL,didn't like the ending of it :/
"Dec 13, 2015",NEUTRAL,"A great movie.  Spoiler review ahead.

Each character is more or less given a reason for choosing the side they're on, which is one of if not the most important part of this conflict, to me.  I, personally, would have liked more on the reasons, which would've strengthened and outlined each character's perspective.  The new guys, Black Panther and Spiderman, were fleshed out well, though I didn't really see a lot coming from the leaders of either side (Captain America and Iron Man) in terms of being advocates for their beliefs.

The conflict sort of takes a backseat when Tony realizes it was all a misunderstanding and Bucky was being framed, and then goes on his own to help Captain and Bucky take down whoever was pulling the strings.  To be honest, I didn't care for the ""villain"" in this, he kind of just took up screen time that I would've enjoyed better watching Tony and Steve debating or other more important characters being developed.  At the end it's kind of questionable why the ""villain"" only planned to make Tony mad because Bucky killed his parents, and not something a little more elaborate.  I'm not doubting the motivation for Tony to snap and turn on Bucky, I just don't really get how that's a major move in pulling the Avengers apart.

Where this movie works best is in the fight scenes and quips.  Each superhero has distinct personalities, and they're all shown pretty well.  The fight scenes are glorious, the big one being when they all kind of throw down.  I say kind of because it's all focused on what's happening on screen.  It's sort of like everywhere else is stopped until the camera shows what's going on.  For example, I would suspect Vision would have incapacitated/taken out several of Captain's team, though it's odd because he doesn't do anything until he is on screen.  I also would've thought Scarlet Witch would've taken out several of Iron Man's team, but she doesn't do anything until she's on screen.  It kind of puts in an unrealistic element of having only some stuff happening at once while everyone pretends to fight/not fight until the camera picks them up.  Don't get me wrong, whenever the fighting on screen happens it's amazing, but I don't get why nothing else happens until the camera goes to what's next.

Overall, a very solid movie and I look forward to the next installment of the MCU."
"Dec 13, 2015",NEUTRAL,They made Spiderman a tool! I disbelieve Iron Man gave him gadgets and a suit to wear.
"Dec 5, 2015",NEUTRAL,Un peu weird dans l'ensemble pour quelqu'un qui est pas habitué à cet univers de comics mais les meilleurs cascades et combats des 3 films.
"Dec 5, 2015",NEUTRAL,What batman vs superman should have been... Marvel did it again another great addition to captain Americas legacy. The movie had great especially the airport scene and it had comedic moments that were great. The only thing that made the movie suffer was it had a few plot holes other than that it would be considered a masterpiece. Rate 9/10
"Dec 5, 2015",NEUTRAL,best one yet. watch to the end...
"Dec 5, 2015",NEUTRAL,I believe they made this movie The Avengers instead of Captain America. Not bad but not what I expected.
"Dec 5, 2015",NEUTRAL,amazing.absolutley amazing
"Dec 5, 2015",NEUTRAL,This movie was amazing
"Dec 4, 2015",NEUTRAL,"This is an dynamic movie that fills the role as a follow up to the Captain America and Avengers films. The presentation, mystery and action all complement each other for a well rounded story. It covers some deep topics: vengeance, law and order, breaking of friendships, protecting others for their ""own good"" and the consequences of war. Among the hard stuff Disney/Marvel/Russo Bros. have excelled at placing just the right amount of humor where it's needed. At least two characters will have your sides splitting with laughter! My biggest negatives were the cursing and intense physiological violence; it's PG13, but steps carefully around an R rating at times. {Note for kid viewers: If you've seen any Marvel movie you should know be now there're not meant for little kids. Parents should be aware that there are multiple closeup death and torture scenes. Older kids will get excited when heroes use their powers and team up to fight in ""Captain America: Civil War"".}"
"Dec 4, 2015",NEUTRAL,Hit all the right notes. Very fun & the perfect summer movie.
"Dec 4, 2015",NEUTRAL,Captain America Civil War was excellent. Black Panther debut was fantastic & new Spider-Man returning. Didn't thing had enough Crossbones & didn't care the way they used Baron Zemo. To many cities it went as well. Fight scene between Steve vs Tony was great. Highly recommended seeing it. Would of done so just if one Avengers no one really cares about was killed off.
"Dec 4, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Somebody tell spiderBOY to STFU!!!!

XD"
"Dec 4, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Tomatometer is totally broken.  Civil War is a good CBM (comic book movie). CBM's are a world unto themselves; can't be graded same as other movies IMO.  Civil War has some good scenes, good action and likable characters.  Not great.  Spider-man is great, but the rest of it is just good. Story was weak.  Conflict between cap and iron man was weak and pointless - does not successfully carry the movie.  The bad guy in the movie is a real head scratcher.  His motivation, the end scene, how he (spoiler) kills some super soldiers that are frozen -  weak plot, motivation and just pointless.  Highly trumped 'airport' scene was very cool, any Spider-man scene was A material.  Overall, better than Avengers 2, not as good as Winter Soldier, which i give A- .  (update - i watched it again and like it less).  
Related topic - tomatometer is BROKEN! 90% doesn't tell truth about this movie.  As of today, Civil War gets 90%.  Batman vs Superman 27%.  From my viewing, I would go 90% BvS (A-), 80% for Civil War (C+).  BvS has better characters, costumes, story, action, conflict, drama.  I cared about the whole movie, didn't want it to end.  Civil War got long and story was weak. I agree with BvS criticisms about Lex, yes the plot had holes, the editing was questionable, but in spite of that the characters, visuals, action was so powerful it easily overcomes that stuff.  Loved it, saw it 5 times, own it.   Civil War, I couldn't sit through it a second time.  90% vs 27%?  Totally WRONG."
"Dec 4, 2015",NEUTRAL,Awesome! Best Movie Ever!
"Dec 4, 2015",NEUTRAL,Better than the previous Captain America movie and superior to the two Avengers movies (which wouldn't take much) 'Civil War' is entertaining yet didn't win me over due to too much time spent talking up all the characters and action pieces with long periods of dialogue. At least it was easy to follow all the main players and understand what was going on with each one yet at some point these comic book movies need to rein in the nearly 3 hour runtimes...
"Dec 4, 2015",NEUTRAL,this was cool better then 2nd avenger
"Dec 3, 2015",NEUTRAL,"The wait was worth it, this movie deserves five star. Spider-Man and antman stole the show, can't wait for the next avengers movie."
"Dec 3, 2015",NEUTRAL,A real exciting movie. it kept me on my toes..
"Dec 3, 2015",NEUTRAL,"AWESOME in IMAX !!!
Best Avengers Movie yet !!!"
"Dec 3, 2015",NEUTRAL,"What an outstanding film !

Best Marvel Studios film to date !"
"Dec 3, 2015",NEUTRAL,Probably the best movie of the franchise. Disney continues to  dominate the comic book landscape. I think the best part was the introduction of Spider-Man to the mix at the correct age and character. The plot seemed evenly paced and the special effects and fight scenes were beautifully done. Two big thumbs way up. Probably going to come to this and the new Star Wars for top movie of the year.
"Dec 2, 2015",NEUTRAL,"It will Be the best marvel movie! Captain america Has fought, And brought damage to citys, of sokovia, New York, Washington DC, He has unlimited power and no supervision, Captain america, Is trying To Save his friend buckey as well.

Whose side are you on?"
"Nov 25, 2015",NEUTRAL,"I think this is the best MCU film that I have seen to date. Spider-Man, Black Panther and Ant-man shine throughout this film. The conflict in this film is real instead of just a guy and an alien hating each other for dumb reasons."
"Nov 25, 2015",NEUTRAL,Easily one of the Top 3 MCU films to-date. Wow.
"Nov 25, 2015",NEUTRAL,"All the people who are giving this movie shit reviews because they wished that BVS success was better... Stop. No one payed critics because this movie is fantastic. All the characters get a good amount of time, the spidey and Panther are great, the story is good and it has some of the best action in a superhero film. The only thing I could say negative wise was that the villain wasn't that great, and I was really excited for zemo"
"Nov 25, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Great story, amazing action, worth a repeat."
"Nov 25, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Phase 3 starts with one of the best films in the MCU to date, It is basically Marvels version of BvS and even the writers said the Civil War movie only exists because of BvS but Civil Wars tone is so much lighter for the kids (Thanks again Disney)...Not, Adding Spider-man and Black Panther who both make great first impressions and fit perfectly almost instantly into the MCU, Just a shame one line from Vision completely ruined the timeline and now doesn't make sense, The plot was very good but again it was like BvS in more ways than people realise, I was worried with the amount of superheroes on show it would get over crowded but they all had enough screen time and they also have one of the best Comic action scenes to date but most of the humour during this epic fight did ruin it in a way as we know no one is going to get killed off thanks to the whole tone of the scene, The effects were brilliant yet again, I can't comment on the 3D as I watched the 2D version but it's not really essential, There's some pretty good shocks and moments no one would see coming which all work well, The whole plot of the film eventually comes unraveled and just when we think it's going to be a huge showdown it flips it on its head, But another epic fight between Iron Man, The Winter Soldier and Captain America makes up for it, There's a few plot holes in the story but it all made sense if you don't look too far into it, Although it's like BvS more than you think this this film gets more praise for some reason, Because the tone is so much lighter and appeals to more people, DCEU is for hardcore comic fans, Marvel films are popcorn flicks made for the casual audience, I know I'm talking about BvS allot but they are so similar and BvS got slated."
"Nov 25, 2015",NEUTRAL,Best Captain America movie yet!
"Nov 25, 2015",NEUTRAL,Phenomenal. Period. Best Marvel movie to date.
"Nov 25, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Yayyyyyy!!! Captain America Civil War is fun and a truly entertaining film. It tells a great story with compelling characters who share different political views causing them to go at odds at each other and it actually works. Thanks to previous installments that set up the characters for each and new movie that told a unique story about themselves, Marvel was able to have each character acquire enough amount of screen time getting across their motivations without feeling underdeveloped. Nice job.

The film has nice visual effects, it has engaging characters that share chemistry, and it has good choreographed action that's a joy to watch. It's great film. Definitely check it out.

Oh and Marvel Studios version of Spiderman is not only cool but is incredibly dorky and witty like the comics. But hey, Marvel knows their characters better then anyone. We all knew they'd get him right.

Marvel you did it again. 

9/10"
"Nov 25, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Action packed and surprisingly nimble, considering the number of characters being shoehorned and a slightly melodramatic tone. Does raise the question whether the next Avengers movies will prove too clunky to ever work..."
"Nov 25, 2015",NEUTRAL,Another great movie from Marvel. The fight scenes are excellent and the story is good as well. Worth watching.
"Nov 24, 2015",NEUTRAL,I think this new Spider-Man is right for the job
"Nov 24, 2015",NEUTRAL,So far the bet super heroes movie out there. For the full experience please watch Iron Man or The Incredible Hulk.
"Nov 23, 2015",NEUTRAL,Super freaking awesome.
"Nov 23, 2015",NEUTRAL,"GREAT action and character use, weird and awkward story line."
"Nov 22, 2015",NEUTRAL,Captain America is a bad ass and he's played so well by Evans. I'm not a huge Iron Man fan and I find Batman boring but I've always been a sucker for Captain America and Superman- real superheroes if you ask me.
"Nov 22, 2015",NEUTRAL,good but not the best captain America movie
"Nov 22, 2015",NEUTRAL,This movie is awesome it's the best marvel movie yet.
"Nov 22, 2015",NEUTRAL,"""This is the most incredible IMAX 3D experience I have ever witnessed! Another superb epic and a comic book triumph! There are some parts I could not take my eyes off of, moments that will be emotional to fans, and this very film will be the one fans have been waiting to see! And as always, Go Team Captain America!""Team Captain America!"""
"Nov 22, 2015",NEUTRAL,"I don't normally like Marvel, but this was really good"
"Nov 22, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Buena, mucho, la mejor, no... Hay cosas que están porque deben, pero el conflicto es creíble, y las escenas de acción, geniales... Like"
"Nov 21, 2015",NEUTRAL,"A serious story, with only good occasional laughter. Civil War is one of Marvel's best movies to date."
"Nov 21, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Darn near perfect. 
Minor gripes.. 
During battle scenes the whole sorry I'm not really against you but I'm against you! Let them fight!!
No decent villain, again. They do get away with it!
No consequences, no trimming the fat. What did Aaron Taylor do to p*ss off the powers that be. Just when it's perfectly set up for someone to hit the end of the Rhode, Marvel pulls its punch."
"Nov 21, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Undoubtedly the perfect mix of everything superhero. First movie where I looked forward to the dialogue scenes vs the action. Cap kicks so much ass . Russo Brothers have mastered the comic book movie These critics who are throwing out Rotten ratings are click bait.

"Nov 21, 2015",NEUTRAL,Always #TeamIronMan â?¤ï¸?
"Nov 20, 2015",NEUTRAL,Marvel accomplishes (yet again) what DC wishes it could. Perfectly paced. Amazing confrontation of themes. One of the best.
"Nov 20, 2015",NEUTRAL,"This is 'Batman vs Superman' done right. You understand every character. The action is tons of fun. The stakes actually matter, even though they're intimate to the characters rather than world ending. Very well done."
"Nov 20, 2015",NEUTRAL,Great!  Can't wait for more.
"Nov 20, 2015",NEUTRAL,The Russo Brothers bring the most mature Marvel movie to date. Characters are wonderful and their actions are completely justified. I can't wait to see what's next. I loved this movie.
"Nov 19, 2015",NEUTRAL,While enjoyable i thought Batman V Superman was dramatically and visually a far superior movie. In civil war you knew none of the Avengers were really going to get hurt. And War Machine doesnt count he is a b squad Avenger. Scarlett Witch was the most realistic character acting wise. Spiderman was shoe horned in at the last minute and it was obvious. 3 stars.
"Nov 19, 2015",NEUTRAL,Quite possibly the best Marvel movie yet. Right up there with Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy. Spidey steals the show.
"Nov 19, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Greatest marvel movie of all time, spiderman was amazing and just overall the humor and all of it was just perfect, A MUST SEE!"
"Nov 19, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Hands down the best Marvel film. It definitely makes up for the divided opinions from Avengers 2. Civil War is more serious and gritty than all of the Marvel films while keeping the humor that we all come to expect. The Avengers have been divided up due to the fact that the government doesn't feel that the Avengers shouldn't be a private group. Therefore the plan is to have the Avengers setup as a task force for the UN. Captain America doesn't appreciate the idea of being exploited by the government therefore he disbands along with his allies. Iron Man supports the government plan due to the mistakes of the past. The backstory of the Winter Soldier is somewhat the focus of this film.
Civil War is pretty much Avengers 3 (sans Thor and Hulk). The film plays out as if it would be the last Marvel film. This film goes out with introducing new characters and bringing along beloved superheroes. If Avengers was the film we all dreamed of, Civil War takes it a step further. The battle between Team Cap and Iron Man is one of the best action sequences in superhero film history. The Russo brothers did a good job with Winter Soldier. Civil War has proved them to be worthy successors of Joss Whedon. They're really good at translating the comics to film. Great sequences that span across the globe. The film is chocked full with effective drama and tension. During the battle of Iron Man, Cap and the Winter Soldier. It really feels like one of the heroes was going to die.
The Black Panther is badass. During the first fight sequence when we are introduced to the character , the ruthless Winter Soldier has met his match. Bozeman did a great job of bringing this highly anticipated hero to life. And Spider-Man........With Sony constantly revamping the franchise to bring a crowd pleasing adaptation. This incarnation of the webslinger should let Sony know that they should just revert the rights. Tom Holland did an excellent job and I look forward to his new film. His Spider-Man is funny and annoying but in a good youthful way. Paul Rudd once again does a great job as Ant-Man. It's funny seeing the character in this film who has to assist in the battle while at the same time surprised to be fighting alongside and against the Avengers.
Out of all of the villains in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Daniel Bruhl does a great job as Zemo. While his character does not posses the superhero strength or power of the latter. His hunger for revenge makes him powerful. Bruhls portrayal of the villain adds a layer of maturity to the film. As Zemo has lost his family in the battle from Avengers 2. He concocts a plan to destroy the Avengers from within. Zemo is not seeking dominance over the world or trying to become an all powerful supreme being. His character is focused on destroying the Avengers to avenge the deaths of his loved ones. This was a great idea amongst the filmmakers.
This film is a breath of fresh air to cover up the stink from Batman v Superman. Both films focused on the casualties of battle and how it affects our heroes. However the ultra serious tone in BvS failed to produce the same effect of Civil War. The build up worked in favor of this film due to the lead up. Yes the sequences in New York, D.C. And Sorkovia were spectacular however people have died during those battles. This film is focused on the negative backlash from those prior films. Therefore villains and negative perceptions  arise from said conflicts. Ones hero may be perceived as the enemy. This film explores that to the fullest. Which is why a film like BvS that was so focused on being an adult, philosophical look at superheroes failed. Civil War allow us the audience to understand the views of the heroes and villains. We can understand the actions of the villains and why they feel that said actions are justified. When compared to DC, Marvel is seen as playful and lighthearted. However when it comes to films tackling the subject of different perspectives amongst our superheroes. Civil War knocks it out the park."
"Nov 19, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Quick review of Civil War: It was epic, jarring and wonderful all at the same time. And yes, Spidey steals the show..."
"Nov 18, 2015",NEUTRAL,great movie. want to see it again
"Nov 18, 2015",NEUTRAL,Spider-Man is in tha house!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Nov 18, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Can't get enough of this franchise. Visually amazing, funny, fun and great characters."
"Nov 16, 2015",NEUTRAL,My fav of the series yet! A must see!
"Nov 15, 2015",NEUTRAL,"It's definitely not flawless, but neither are the characters. This movie had my heart pumping from start to finish. I was never once bored during this film"
"Nov 15, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Marvel and its cinematic universe seem to be a powerhouse at the moment, they are on fire! Having said that I'll start with the issues, the cuts in the opening fight scene is a little slap dash and borders on using too much shaky cam, but that doesn't ruin the overall enjoyment of the film. Also the main villain, Zemo, is underdeveloped and his main storyline is a little flimsy. Now lets move onto the positives... EVERYTHING ELSE! This is how you do a massive ensemble film, what Joss Whedon set as standard for Avengers, The Russo Brothers take it onto a new level. Yes not all the characters get a lot of screen time, this is after all a Captain America film, not Avengers 2.5. So they are in the background a lot. The action scenes are brilliant. The all star superhero fight at the abandoned airport is a standout, with a lot of surprises and easter eggs if you are a comic book geek. The newcomers, Black Panther and of course Spiderman, steal the film in every scene they are in, take note Sony, THAT is how you do Spiderman properly and as we wont be getting another origin story for his solo film in a few years time. Story wise, I wont go into anything as it'll spoil it for you, but there are a few things you will probably guess correctly before they happen. But again, it doesn't ruin the enjoyment. Civil War is one of the most epic comic book storylines, but don't expect that level in this film as it has to fit in with the MCU and it does it in a fitting way. Both sides of the argument are voiced brilliantly and your loyalty does sway during the film. I cannot wait for the next films in Phase 3. This is a good time to be a Marvel fan!"
"Nov 15, 2015",NEUTRAL,Captain America: Civil War takes it's first real serious plot and makes an all around entertaining comic book film. While also still having it's clever heart and humor that the previous films had but still satisfies it's fanbase
"Nov 8, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Once again, Marvel proves that louder does not mean better. It's about time the DCU got with the program. #teammcu"
"Nov 8, 2015",NEUTRAL,"IT'S FREAKING INCREDIBLE. It's so remarkably well done, so much fun, and so worth seeing as many times as possible. The action was the best in any Marvel movie, the emotional build-up was intense and satisfying , and it has a great plot and great dialogue. The disagreement between the two teams was well laid out and you believed it. Spider-Man was spectacular, Black Panther is wonderful, Ant-Man has some great scenes, and everyone else is simply awesome. I can't say yet where it falls in my all time comic book movies but it will be close to the top."
"Nov 7, 2015",NEUTRAL,best marvel movie since Iron man
"Nov 7, 2015",NEUTRAL,Best one yet. Love the new characters. Airport scene is amazing.
"Nov 7, 2015",NEUTRAL,Watch all the Marvel movies before you watch this one. It's to die for!
"Nov 7, 2015",NEUTRAL,I loved it so much I went back a saw it again and it was even better
"Nov 6, 2015",NEUTRAL,The Cap movies are the only MCU that are consistently great standing on their own...
"Nov 6, 2015",NEUTRAL,As always love marvel.... But it should of been named an Avengers movie instead of Captain America.
"Nov 6, 2015",NEUTRAL,Probably the best Avenger movie so far.
"Nov 6, 2015",NEUTRAL,It's just a great movie full with action and emotions
"Nov 5, 2015",NEUTRAL,"People with land on either side, Team Cap or Team Iron Man. I personally sided with Iron Man. Overall this film is up there with Winter Soldier as quite possibly the best Marvel movie to date."
"Nov 5, 2015",NEUTRAL,"It was pretty legit, but wayyyyyyyyyyy over hyped; it had me expecting a little more!!!"
"Nov 5, 2015",NEUTRAL,The best Marvel ever made so far. All the characters were great and the story will never end
"Nov 4, 2015",NEUTRAL,The best Marvel movie yet. You've gotta catch this in theaters... more than once!
"Nov 4, 2015",NEUTRAL,"great movie, full of action. A bunch of battles"
"Nov 4, 2015",NEUTRAL,"This movie was poorly put together; it was awful! Who wants to see the avengers turn on each other? Total nonsense and corny. I'm so disappointed; I expected so much from this movie. I don't know what movie everyone else saw because this movie really ""SUCKED."""
"Nov 3, 2015",NEUTRAL,fast paced with a few holes in the plot but we'll done!
"Nov 2, 2015",NEUTRAL,#TeamCap Down with the Accords. Spider-Man will return!
"Nov 2, 2015",NEUTRAL,"One of the best comic book films made, Civil War pits characters we've known for years against each other, mainly by their own personal objectives. Never overly heavy-handed, this film breezes along to an amazing battle scene and a more impactful end fight."
"Nov 2, 2015",NEUTRAL,"First off I just wanted to say I liked this movie, It was very well written and the cast and crew did an amazing job making this film. Secondly the newer cast did amazing, Ant-Man and Spider-Man are really funny! But I gotta say, from what I was expecting from the comic, this movie fell a little short. I still liked it, but didn't LOVE it like how I did with Captain America: The Winter Soldier"
"Nov 1, 2015",NEUTRAL,Was pretty good also Spider-Man was awesome and funny ð'ð? 1/4
"Nov 1, 2015",NEUTRAL,"great movie, very entertaining and fun to watch"
"Nov 1, 2015",NEUTRAL,Great movie and action. Go see it
"Nov 1, 2015",NEUTRAL,Pretty boring.  Snooze
"Nov 1, 2015",NEUTRAL,Wow. That's all I got.
"Oct 31, 2015",NEUTRAL,"I was really excited to see this . The flashbacks and all were ok, the early action scenes were regurgitated scenes just to kill some civilians off. The story isn't believable, all of a sudden the world wants to lock them down ? Ironman becomes the crusader of world legislature ? Civil war? No one is fighting to kill anyone in this movie . Just some fancy one upping each other. Pretty basic movie."
"Oct 31, 2015",NEUTRAL,this is by far the best Marvel movie to date ...Spider-Man was awesome ...a great superhero trilogy.
"Oct 31, 2015",NEUTRAL,"I finally got to see this one tonight and it was really good.  Though not as good as Winter Soldier it held its own but it was more like an Avengers Sequel than a Captain America one.  This movie is not without its problems.  I didn't like the Zemo villain at all, Captain America has so many good villains like Red Skull and Pierce but to turn the Avengers against each using the Winter Soldier wasn't like the Zemo on the comics.  Plus Crossbones wasn't in it long enough and I didn't like the way the character went out.  Second, I thought they should've killed off a few of the heroes. The one thing about the heroes is that they can always be resurrected so maybe Rhodes or Hawkeye or even Cap could've been killed off and been resurrected in the next movie. The pluses in this movie was the addition of Spider Man and Black Panther.  Panther was bad ass and I can't wait for his movie.  Spider-Man was cool too and so was Ant-Man/Giant-Man.  I loved Tony Stark's role in this movie, he is always the more rebellious one and this time he's more of the protagonist in this one.  There is a lot of back story for him and his parts in this movie deliver.  We really need another Iron Man movie because I never tire of Robert Downey, Jr.  He was cool and I can't wait for his next movie.  All in all, it's worthy of another billion dollar entry of the Marvel Universe and I'm sure there will be more to come with X-Men and Dr. Strange."
"Oct 31, 2015",NEUTRAL,It was a greatest marvel superhero movie ever of captain America civil war
"Oct 30, 2015",NEUTRAL,"From the preview, I didn't really expect much from this movie. When I saw it, I absolutely loved it. One of the best MCU this far!"
"Oct 30, 2015",NEUTRAL,To be perfectly honest Marvel is on point with all the new movies and the universe hopefully DC will follow suit no hate. just to be a happy fan oh what a time to be alive
"Oct 29, 2015",NEUTRAL,Burnt out on these characters and loud random punching.
"Oct 29, 2015",NEUTRAL,Great movie cause usually most movies with superheroes fighting each other most likes fails but Civil War great and funny but they have more scenes at end and after the credits its with every marvel movie
"Oct 29, 2015",NEUTRAL,Thoroughly enjoyed Civil War. Loved all the action and Spider-Man was superb. Can't wait for Homecoming.
"Oct 29, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Granted I'm a bit bias due to my love of superhero movies but I loved this movie. It was two and a half hours which is longer than any other movie in marvels current story arch but it didn't feel like there was any part that was droning on or wasn't necessary. The movie was exciting throughout and there were a lot of cool fight scenes. If you're a fan of the other marvel movies you'll probably enjoy this one too. Keep in mind however, it is the darker portion of the story arch but they do a good job of keeping the characters lovable, while also showing the darker conflict."
"Oct 29, 2015",NEUTRAL,It's just another marvel movie.
"Oct 28, 2015",NEUTRAL,As great as advertised
"Oct 28, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War is the Russo Bros. attempt to top their first Captain America sequel Winter Soldier, and wow, do they deliver again. Civil War is not quite up there with TWS, but the directors proof they can work extremely well with ensamble casts, as they give just the right amount of screentime to a ton of characters, and still manage to make an extremely intriguing story, who's central character is clearly Cap and his relation to Bucky. It pushes the limits in action and specual effects, and superbly introduces us to Spider-Man and Black Panther, who deliver just as amazing acting jobs as the main cast we know and love."
"Oct 27, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Awesome, but I didn't like it when zemo's origin story"
"Oct 27, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Traditionally, the larger the ensemble in a superhero movie, the more prone for error it is.  Spider Man 3, for example, loaded itself with way too much and proved burdensome to watch.  Civil War, on the other hand, shows exactly how to put a lot of characters on screen, give all of them time, and not feel like the film is an endless series of bounces from scene to scene or a burden to keep track of.  We start with a lot of guys, we add a few more, and it just seems to fly along, hitting home runs with both its action sequences and its real-life feeling plot.
Civil War brings the classic comic storyline to the big screen in a very different way than it played out originally.  The casualties in the comic were, in fact, much greater than those given on screen, and it was not an international incident.  But the way things play out here, it is retold perfectly with the exact right touch that brings Black Panther into things without it seeming forced.
The heroes' ideologies show early on, and we see that this is a moral, interpretive disagreement as much as anything, and that is a great way to keep our empathy on board with everyone, whether we choose sides or not.
The action, as with all Marvel movies, is fantastic.  It is not an exaggeration to state that the sequence in the airport is the greatest superhero fight ever put on film.  The characters are all over it, the stakes are high, and as is integral, they hit the mark with some humor to keep things on a fun playing field.
A review of this film can't go without talking about Spider Man, who finally winds his way into the MCU, and after there now having been three actors playing him, finally is characterized in the perfect way.  Just a bit insecure, smarmy, and nerdy all in one package that can kick ass without breaking a sweat.  Tom Holland was a good choice, and the writers nailed it.
The best part of this film is that it leaves a lot of threads hanging for the future installments that are due in the next few years.  Phase 3 has been laid out, and it is clear to see a number of the paths that the universe will be taking as it moves towards Infinity War.
The Russos have once again captured Marvel's essence, telling a terrific story grounded in character with the perfect amount of humor alongside action that works at breakneck speed, taking the superhero movie to its next level.  The next film will have a lofty standard to live up to."
"Oct 23, 2015",NEUTRAL,"So amazing! Blew me away! Great balance of action, story, and comedy. Marvel delivers again!"
"Oct 23, 2015",NEUTRAL,"""Captain American: Civil War"" is a blockbuster smash thanks to the direction by Anthony and Joe Russo. This time around, Team Captain American duke it out with Team Iron Man on whether or not superheroes and S.H.I.E.L.D. should be limited and controlled by a governing body after it is proven all the damage they cause and the lives they take.

There's a perfect blend of storytelling and incredible action sequences that explore the deeper beliefs of our beloved superheroes. And while there's plenty of Captain American and Iron Man present, there is also a proper amount of time dedicated to exploring the newer characters like Black Panther and Spider-Man."
"Oct 23, 2015",NEUTRAL,You go Captain another great movie
"Oct 23, 2015",NEUTRAL,This movie is a movie you want to watch 25 times its that good.And personally Its my favourite movie and super hero movie ever made.The Russo brothers did a great job putting together such a Highly anticipated movie.Everyone had their moments and the story Was awesome and the way they put it in the movie was Spectacular!!!!
"Oct 23, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Was fine, but just seemed an excuse to have all the characters beat the snot out of each other for no good reason."
"Oct 23, 2015",NEUTRAL,Definitely a full-ride adventure. It is not the best marvel movies but it produces such thematic flow regarding friendship and order.
"Oct 21, 2015",NEUTRAL,Better than Dawn of Justice by far.
"Oct 21, 2015",NEUTRAL,"In the hit-and-miss track record of the Marvel Universe, this is a gem"
"Oct 21, 2015",NEUTRAL,"I can easily say this is marvels best movie is has great characters, fantastic chemistry, and some of the best fight scenes of all time it has a great soundtrack and I think they finally found the definitive Spiderman"
"Oct 20, 2015",NEUTRAL,Entertaining but a bit predictable. The giant ant man stunt was just stupid.
"Oct 20, 2015",NEUTRAL,"It has all the action, giggles and personalities from your favourite characters to make this mpvie amazing. However there was something missing to make the movie seem meh"
"Oct 19, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Take notes DC.  This is how you develop a plot and characters, while including exhilarating action sequences and uniting a universe.  The leaders at the center of the conflict: Captain America (Chris Evans) and Ironman (Robert Downey Jr.) arrive at their quarrel in the fulfilling and natural way.  Rest of the cast was great with particular kudos going to the new members of the MCU, Spider-Man (Tom Holland) and Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman).  Edges out Winter Soldier to become my favorite Marvel film to date. 5/5"
"Oct 18, 2015",NEUTRAL,Thank god for Spider-Man and Ant man. This was cliched to the max and just boring. Why does Captain America just have so much trust in Bucky. It’s cause he loves him. Come on Marvel just let them come out as gay lovers. 
"Oct 18, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Solid movie, lots of feeder information for the rest of phase 3."
"Oct 18, 2015",NEUTRAL,IN top 3 Marvel movies ever.i guess Dark Knight will always be the pinnacle of Super Hero movies but this was pretty great.
"Oct 18, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Enjoyable. Fun. Divergent from novel in many ways, but a good adaptation."
"Oct 17, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War is a film that is able to take two conflicting sides and make audiences see both points of view, putting viewers in a moral dilemma. The balance of action and thought provoking ideas makes Captain America: Civil War a movie that is much deeper than what is on the surface. Everyone gives great performances, particularly Chris Evens as Rogers/Captain America, Robert Downey Jr. as Stark/Iron Man, and Chadwick Boseman as  T'Challa/Black Panther. Though I do like Captain America: The Winter Soldier slightly more, Civil War is one of the best MCU films to date."
"Oct 17, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Amazing film , i loved all the characters , greatest Spider-Man on film yet !!!!  Black Panther and Ant Man were awesome. Another entertaining movie from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Very cohesive story line and some of the best action scenes i have seen in a super-hero movie to date. A very deserving 5 out of 5 stars !"
"Oct 16, 2015",NEUTRAL,all a bit meh! too much going on but somehow really boring too.... except spidey & ant man
"Oct 16, 2015",NEUTRAL,Possibly the best Marvel film so far!!
"Oct 16, 2015",NEUTRAL,"BRILLIANT, STUNNING........."
"Oct 16, 2015",NEUTRAL,"A cinematic experience that is candidly critical and subversive while not shying away at humor. The Russo brothers prove that sometimes sequels of sequels can be moving, entertaining, and franchise-promoting at the same time (can't think of a III that is nearly as good outside of Toy Story and Godfather). Will update after seeing again"
"Oct 14, 2015",NEUTRAL,"I just want to start off by saying, I am in no way a hardcore fan of Marvel or know every story and character origin/past it has to offer. In fact I knew very little about some of its biggest characters, such as Zemo. However, its safe to say that no matter how much you do or do not know going into this movie; you will have not only one of the best superhero movie experiences, you will enjoy a truly great plot ripe with interesting and compelling characters, top notch action sequences, and a balance of tragedy, comedy, and spectacle. Much to my surprise, the new Spider-Man not only worked well in the movie, He was THE HIGHLIGHT of the movie! There is no question that Tom Holland is the Spidey we've been waiting for. His solo film of course, will be released mid 2017. Black panther is also introduced in this 2 hour and 22 minute film, and he is integrated smartly and seamlessly. You should come for the action, and stay for the story. 4.5/5 stars"
"Oct 14, 2015",NEUTRAL,"It was... A - W - E - S - O - M - E!!!!  I think there is enough storylines and action for it to stand alone but if you are a Marvel fanatic like me, you might want to rewatch the last Captain America and the second Avengers.  I did miss one or two Avengers in this flick but they did something to make it up!  I can't wait for more Marvel!!"
"Oct 14, 2015",NEUTRAL,I enjoyed this super action movie I just hated how long it felt and the plot to me seemed to have a bunch of holes.  My favorite new character was the Black Panther who I thought they did a great job embodying and incorporating seamlessly (unlike Spider-Man).  Though I thought Spider-Man's lines were some of the best.   I don't understand why everyone seems to live this movie.
"Oct 14, 2015",NEUTRAL,I hate the cursing wow why do they do that. Great movie horrible mouths. I don't remember super heroes cussing when I was growing up.
"Oct 14, 2015",NEUTRAL,well planned well executed
"Oct 13, 2015",NEUTRAL,Geek out heaven. This was amazing.
"Oct 13, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Saw Captain America Civil War last night.  A great movie?  Yeah.  One of the best superhero movies of all time?  Yeah.  Is it better than Batman v Superman?  Batman v who?

Some parts early on in the movie reminded me of a slow burn Jason Bourne movie, but the pacing accelerates towards a truly satisfying (and totally unexpected) conclusion.

I'm not totally nerdgasming over Civil War.  To me it is less an amazing spectacle that blew my mind as a standalone movie as it is a well crafted narrative step in the overall Marvel Cinematic Universe that I am heavily invested in as a fan.  I'm totally pumped for the next instalment."
"Oct 12, 2015",NEUTRAL,Not as great as Winter Soldier but its definitely on par.
"Oct 12, 2015",NEUTRAL,A blast. The movie that batman v superman tried to be and failed miserably at.
"Oct 11, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Tight story, great action, and RDJ is amazing."
"Oct 11, 2015",NEUTRAL,Best Super Hero movie ever!!!

"Oct 10, 2015",NEUTRAL,"""I loved it. It was exciting, intense, it had me on the edge of my seat. It's now my favorite Marvel movie yet..."""
"Oct 10, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Great film. Stay to the end, one cut scene a minute after, one right at the very end of the credits =)"
"Oct 9, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Easily the best and most enjoyable superhero movie I have ever seen, Civil War neatly picks up and continues Steve Rogers' search for his childhood best friend and bring him back from the brainwashed assassin Hydra had turned him into some 70 years earlier. Despite the inclusion of a number of other Avengers, there is never any doubt that this is a Steve and Bucky story. The Russo brothers, along with writers Markus and McFeely dos their best to ""honest trailer-proof"" the story and it shows. The plot is easy to follow even if you are not familiar with all their back stories. The action sequences are intense and made even better with the witty banter between the characters. As Steve says, ""I could do this all day."""
"Oct 9, 2015",NEUTRAL,"I really expect a WAR but really was solved one-on-one without Bucky unnecessary bromance! 

Definitevily Black Panther was the best appearance in the movie and spidey with his mask on! 
Thanks Robert, you make this one entertainment!"
"Oct 8, 2015",NEUTRAL,"The Perfect Civil War Movie
It's big shoes to fill, trust me I went in expecting to see some weird story arc to pit them against each other, but with resounding applause at the end of the movie I showed my praise by clapping as hard if not harder than anyone else. The movie was just plain fantastic in every way, fleshed out characters, deep story, emotions that feel genuine and real, powers felt more down to earth and visceral, and at its heart a great story of friendship. The relationship between Bucky and Cap drive this movie and without spoiling anything I'll just say that friendship is the whole backbone to this movie. Character depth and exploration had been scarce in these movies but each one builds and expands on the last and really with this movie I feel that I know the avengers truly. It's amazing to see old generations and young enjoying this movie it's transcendent. Let's talk action there is more than anyone can ask for its crazy awesome . Effects galore and also a nice blending of reality to make it realistic and not so obvious"
"Oct 8, 2015",NEUTRAL,Great movie all the way around!
"Oct 8, 2015",NEUTRAL,Love it. It was amazing.
"Oct 7, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Excellent! Not quite as good as the original Avengers film or Captain America : The Winter Soldier, but a must see for Marvel cinema fans!"
"Oct 6, 2015",NEUTRAL,"The best non-Avengers Marvel Cinematic Universe film by a mile. Even though it kind of is an Avengers movie in a sense, it still works perfect well as a separate, stand alone film that gets everything right. It's an absolute must see."
"Oct 6, 2015",NEUTRAL,"You must know going into this movie that it is first and foremost a Captain America movie.  There's part of me that's a little disappointed in that, I kind of wish the Civil War storyline had been done as an Avengers movie rather than a Captain America movie.  Having said that, as a Captain America movie, this thing is great.
It reminded me an awful lot of Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice, and not just because it's two titans facing off against each other, but because of how big this movie is and how much stuff it crams into it.  Unlike BvS though, it never feels overstuffed or confusing.  The closest it comes is with Spider-Man, who feels like a shoehorned last minute addition, because that's exactly what he is.  I didn't like how abruptly he shows up and how equally abruptly he leaves, and his motivation for joining Team Iron Man seems mostly motivated by how star-struck he is by meeting Tony Stark more than any ideologies.  Having said that, the mere nature of seeing Peter Parker interact with RDJ's rendition is so surreal that I'm easily able to forgive this.  I never thought I'd get to see Spidey in the MCU, so when it finally happened, I could forgive a lot.
Speaking of additions, Black Panther is great.  Seeing him pop on screen for the first time gave me that same sense of joy at a new character joining the Marvel movie world that I got in the early days of seeing Phil Coulson find Thor's hammer.  I haven't had that feeling in a long time, and it was great to get again.  He's also just a fantastic character.  He doesn't feel forced in, he's and integral part of the story, and a wonderful character with some truly badass moments.  This is mostly Captain America's movie, but every Avenger has a moment to shine.
My one major gripe with this movie is that it can start to lull a bit and it takes a while for its main story to really get going.  I also wasn't crazy about the villains, who have always been a weakness in the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies (with the exception of Loki of course).  Still, the true antagonists of this story are the conflicting ideals and emotions of these characters who used to be friends, and the lulls in action are only there to build on these moments.  Not to mention when the action does hit, it hits hard.  There was one scene in particular that had me cringing and holding my breath it was so tense, and the climactic airport battle is just an absolute blast.
I bounced around in my rating for this movie for a while, before ultimately coming to the conclusion that the only thing holding me back on this was that it wasn't an Avengers movie.  Yeah, I wish Civil War had been an Avengers movie, but it's not fair to rate this based on the movie I wanted.  The movie I got is still too damn good to ignore.  Cap's story here is still a good one, and the continuing saga of the Winter Soldier is damn interesting.  Having Civil War as the cherry on top of this is just a bonus to what is already a great third chapter to the Captain America story arc that began in First Avenger.  Captain America: Civil War is emotional, intriguing, and a helluva lot of fun."
"Oct 5, 2015",NEUTRAL,Great movie with all out amazing fight scenes and great plot.
"Oct 5, 2015",NEUTRAL,awesome.everything you love about a marvel movie
"Oct 5, 2015",NEUTRAL,"What an awesome movie. Great effects throughout.  I will have to say that this ,oviedo was by far the best of all the Captain America movies."
"Oct 5, 2015",NEUTRAL,The deepest of all Marvels movies so far.
"Oct 5, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Very good, where will The Avengers go from here."
"Oct 4, 2015",NEUTRAL,DAYUM Iron SHADE errywhere!!!
"Oct 4, 2015",NEUTRAL,"awesome start to Marvel's phase 3, tons of action, funny, Spiderman was a great addition to the MCU, there are 2 credit scenes, make sure to stick around!"
"Oct 4, 2015",NEUTRAL,"probably the best one in the series for me. think it does a good job setting up future films including infinity war. Remember there are 2 after credits scenes. if you like Marvel films, definitely a must see."
"Oct 4, 2015",NEUTRAL,disney is the home for marvel
"Oct 4, 2015",NEUTRAL,Great flick. Would had preferred if It had ended how I wanted.
"Oct 4, 2015",NEUTRAL,best movie so far in 2016
"Oct 4, 2015",NEUTRAL,Good movie only thing I didn't lik was Spider-Man wasn't the best one
"Oct 3, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Honestly, this movie, without a shadow of a doubt is the best Marvel since CA: Winter Solider and it is on par with the The Avengers. The introduction of Spider-Man was EXCELLENT! Tom Holland captured the spirit that the web crawler possess. Also, Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther was wonderful. The movie showcased every characters side in the argument perfectly. The airport scene only would give all comic book fans a nerdgasm
multiple times."
"Oct 3, 2015",NEUTRAL,"A comic cook hero masterpiece. The film has been stitched together in exquisite fashion, layering in a bounty of heroes without feel like too much, a perfect balance between comedy and seriousness and some of the finest acting in a Marvel feature. Magnificent."
"Oct 3, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Great movie, but Winter Soldier are still number one for me :-)"
"Oct 2, 2015",NEUTRAL,An emotional roller coaster
"Oct 1, 2015",NEUTRAL,Captain America Civil War redefines the Russos' steadfast potential to enrich the post Avengers gallery as their intensely psychological adaptation of a classic comic book storyline -- and its villains are agreeably necessary.
"Sep 30, 2015",NEUTRAL,"4.75 stars.  I really enjoyed this movie.  Some really good battles between the heroes we all love.  Marvel keeps killing it with their super hero movies.  I thought the story was good, although it was quite a bit different from the comic.  Just imagine all awesome it would have been if Marvel had the opportunity to use all of their characters.  I highly recommend this one."
"Sep 30, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Wow!!! That was an amazing superhero movie!!! A lot of things have been building up to this movie, and the story juggles it all, very very well. Every character felt like they got screen time, and you could feel the tension building with every argument. As a viewer you see both sides, and how both sides are right and wrong. This is a movie where choosing a side actually matters, and can make you debate why for quite a while. This is a big turning point for the Avengers, and is packed with amazing action, heart felt drama, and some serious ideologies. Full of comic info, and previous movie build up, along with whats to come. Fantastic movie!!!"
"Sep 30, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Captain America is definitely the best  comic book trilogy for me after this movie . Marvel has a good grip on Captain America than any other superheroes . A very matured plot , thrilling encounters makes this definitely the best movie of Marvel . Black Panther and Spidey have been excellent additions to the movie . Black Panther is a standout  character . The Russo Brothers again prove their potential .  Downey  ,Evans and Scarlett Johansonn perfomances   need no special praise because they always are a treat to watch."
"Sep 29, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Steve Rogers: Sorry, Tony. You know I wouldn't do this if I had any another choice. But he's my friend. 
Tony Stark: So was I.

Are we suffering superhero fatigue? That seems to be the hot question that has been beat like a dead horse as of lately and one that really needs to be dismissed immediately."
"Sep 29, 2015",NEUTRAL,Captain America: Civil War is a game changing movie for Marvel. 
"Sep 29, 2015",NEUTRAL,A great game-changer in the MCU!
"Sep 29, 2015",NEUTRAL,"It was everything I want out of a super hero movie.  A good mix of action and humor, with a little bit of meaningful, smart drama thrown in as Marvel acknowledges the thousands that probably die every time the Avengers spring into action.

Grade: A"
"Sep 28, 2015",NEUTRAL,"One Of The Best Superhero Movies, That I  Have Every Seen. Plenty Of Action, Great Story And Cast.Great Director's The Russo Brothers. This Movie Was Never Disappointing Like Early Superhero Movie This Year Batman vs Superman Dawn Of Justice. I Hope DC Movies Can Get Get Their Act Together Like Marvel Movies. Last Superhero Movie I Seen That Was This Great WasThe Dark Knight. It Would Be Hard To Chose Which One Is  Them Is Best Movie Between Them It Is That Close. I  Would Highly Recommend This Movie."
"Sep 27, 2015",NEUTRAL,best marvel movie yet.
"Sep 27, 2015",NEUTRAL,Winter Solider was better
"Sep 26, 2015",NEUTRAL,This movie is so like Batman vs Superman it is not even funny. It works a little better because almost all the characters involved have had enough screen time in other movie's the it is easier to accept them being shoehorned in.  In trying to keep both side the good guy they make the same mistakes. I personally liked both movies but find it funny how much better the critics are treating this one...
"Sep 26, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Non-stop action, constant plot twists, and a thriller for all ages."
"Sep 26, 2015",NEUTRAL,i think I might have grown out of marvel films
"Sep 26, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Compelling and thought provoking, Civil War blends the best of superhero action with political thriller to produce an exhilarating film that boasts a well rounded cast and a smart storyline."
"Sep 26, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Great movie, and oddly enough did not feel overstuffed. Spider-Man and Black Panther were great. It leaves us off in a very weird place though as tons has happened, and I am not sure what comes next. I am excited for everyone's next outing."
"Sep 25, 2015",NEUTRAL,The Cap movies just keep getting better.
"Sep 25, 2015",NEUTRAL,Not as good as the previous Captain America films although still nice to see the different plot of them fighting each other as well as fighting a different evil!
"Sep 24, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Avengers lo hace de nuevo y no me refiero a que redefina el genero de super heroes, lastimosamente, Civil War no aporta nada nuevo a lo que ya parece la misma estructura de siempre: si revisamos cuidadosamente Avenger, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Guardianes de la galaxia y Civil war Veremos la misma formula: Los Heroes cometen un grave error, Los heroes Pelean entre si, NADIE IMPORTANTE MUERE y finalmente los que se habían estado enfrentando derrotan al villano al admitir sus errores. Nada nuevo, lo único que vale la pena es la participación de Ant-man y de Spiderman, eso si, esta última MUY, MUY forzada, fuera de esto, la pelea central se siente algo floja, pues sabemos de sobra que la cosa no va en serio, una pelicula más de la interminable maquinaria de disney, sin nada nuevo, vale la pena solo si de verdad eres fanático del MCU, fuera de esto Batman v Superman se arriesga más y eso No es un cumplido."
"Sep 23, 2015",NEUTRAL,This movie is SO damn DOPE!! Go watch it now!!!
"Sep 23, 2015",NEUTRAL,"This was great!  I so wish Batman v. Superman was this good.  The action was great, there was humor, the intro of Spider man and Black Panther was great.  It's worth catching in the theater!"
"Sep 23, 2015",NEUTRAL,there was only one part I didn't like and I must say I agree w Hayley Atwell 100 percent
"Sep 23, 2015",NEUTRAL,Pretty good movie.   Gets you ready for the next one coming.
"Sep 23, 2015",NEUTRAL,Everything I expected! Only problem. it could have been 4 hours longer! lol
"Sep 23, 2015",NEUTRAL,Am I slightly Marveled out? Enjoyable and like so many films these days... forgettable.
"Sep 22, 2015",NEUTRAL,Get rid of the blasphemy
"Sep 21, 2015",NEUTRAL,Loved it! Can't wait to see what's in store next in the MCU! Going to interested in how they play every thing out heading into Thor and Avengers
"Sep 20, 2015",NEUTRAL,This film has me even more pumped for Black Panther and Spider-Man: Homecoming
"Sep 20, 2015",NEUTRAL,Now this is a movie!
"Sep 20, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Eliminating the slightly clunky start (which was needed to avoid glaring plotholes later on) this is a great movie.  It follows the same route as Winter Soldier.  You can see the Russo brothers amazing skill in juggling so many chracters (Age of Ultron, though not bad, couldnt get this right).  Spider-Man is just awesome and the addition of Black Panther couldnt have been more masterfully executed.   I think we can expect great things from their solo movies."
"Sep 20, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Fantastic new Marvel Universe adventure that could be the studio's best film to date. Filled to the brim with exciting action and intellegent scripting this is the years summer blockbuster to beat.
After another incident involving the Avengers results in collateral damage, political pressure mounts to install a system of accountability, headed by a governing body to oversee and direct the team. The new status quo fractures the Avengers, resulting in two camps, one led by Steve Rogers and his desire for the Avengers to remain free to defend humanity without government interference, and the other following Tony Stark's surprising decision to support government oversight and
accountability.
Returning Winter Soldier directors Anthony and Joe Russo prove yet again that they can balance complex plot with brilliantly edited action. The action sequences on display here are top notch, an airport showdown when the divided Avengers (plus some new recruits) go toe to toe needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible and could be the MCU's most thrilling sequence to date.
Another neat trick the film pulls off is that with its complex plot and large number of characters it never feels over stuffed (like Age of Ultron). Each character has a moment to shine and in some cases steal the film (more on that later).
The well written script does well to show both sides of the arguement and although this is a Captain America film both he and Stark are morally right in their actions. Stark is trying to make amends for Ultron and Rogers is rightly nervous about Government control.
Downey Jnr, Evans and the rest of cast are all great in their now familiar roles. But as good as they are the film is stolen by the new characters Black Panther and Spider-man. Black Panther in particular is the stand out, Chadwick Boseman is brilliant in the role and he has a handful of exciting set pieces as well as looking very cool. Great african accent too. And Tom Holland's Spider-man is easily the best version of the web slinger seen on screen and he's only in a handful of scenes. They both leave you craving more and the thought of upcoming solo films for them both is exciting.
Kudo's to Daniel Bruhl too as main villan Zemo, his motivations are freshingly basic (no world domination plans here) and Bruhl has a handful of sinister moments.
Forget Batman v Superman here we get Iron Man v Captain America, Ant-Man v Black Widow, War Machine v Falcon, Black Panther v Winter Soldier and too many more to name. This really is as good as it gets in terms of summer entertainment and could be impossible to beat for quite sometime.....well at least until the Avengers return in 2018"
"Sep 20, 2015",NEUTRAL,awesommmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmnes
"Sep 19, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Phase three of the Marvel Cinematic Universe begins with a political and action-packed thriller in the form of Captain America: Civil War. The story is more sophisticated than Age of Ultron and the fight scenes are amazing, though some of the light tone is lost which is acceptable. The characters are top-notch and especially Robert Downey Jr. who gives an incredible performance as Iron Man and Cap as always is stern but kind. Spiderman is a good newcomer, along with Black Panther  and all the returning Avengers step it up. As for the villain, Zemo is not as good as Ultron or Lokie and the end is good, just not as epic as Avengers 2...but the airport scene in IMAX  is incredible and the best fight I've seen in a while. As for the comparison to Batman V Superman, I liked both, B v S had better visuals but not as good of a story while Civil War felt like a more complete story, it's hard to favor one over the other as they are somewhat different. Captain America: Civil War is the best Marvel movie yet and the story never relents. Unfortunately it's two years until Infinity War where the loose ends are tied but I've got this movie to watch over and over, which is fine enough."
"Sep 18, 2015",NEUTRAL,"This was a great movie. I don't feel like it should have been a Captain America movie. Although the story centered around Steve and his long lost friend, it felt slightly forced. Civil War was so much bigger than just the mentioned Avengers and extra heroes. It's tough to capture EVERY little detail from the comics. But, Civil War should have been saved for its own movie. It was still fantastic. I really enjoyed Black Panther. His role was very important and Tony can learn a lot from him. Ant-Man was funny, by his character seemed different this time around. Almost in an annoying way. All that being said, I am no critic. I just love Marvel. Last thing, Stan Lee had a great cameo."
"Sep 18, 2015",NEUTRAL,"I agree with others that say this is the best Marvel movie, but it doesn't deserve a perfect score in my book.  It was a fun, action packed affair but was a hair long in the tooth.  Black Panther's debut was awesome and Spider man looked mis-cast.  Definitely worth checking this out."
"Sep 18, 2015",NEUTRAL,great movie! the action was amazing and the story was awesome.
"Sep 17, 2015",NEUTRAL,More like Avengers Civil War. Probably the best Avengers movie. Iron Man is still my least favorite.
"Sep 16, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Highly entertaining, interesting and well put together- this is a great and energetic addition to the Marvel films. (P.S. Iron Man, Spider-man and Ant Man are the best of this one)"
"Sep 2, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Quite simply one of my top 3 superhero films. In the interest of not spoiling anything for viewers, I will only say that the balance of action and story and character development created a new take on comic book cinema. Go when you are in the mood for explosions, a fist fight, and junk food :-)"
"Sep 2, 2015",NEUTRAL,"As much as I understand they make almost every right choice, I don't like some of them"
"Sep 2, 2015",NEUTRAL,Everything about this movie works. It takes what Batman v Superman has and amps it up to a thousand. The cast works. The story works. The villain works. The new Spider-Man works
"Sep 2, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Amazing Amazing
loved it. Yes Captain Yes ð'?ð'?ð'?ð'?"
"Sep 1, 2015",NEUTRAL,Best. Comic Book. Movie. Ever.
"Sep 1, 2015",NEUTRAL,good movie but Winter Soldier was better
"Sep 1, 2015",NEUTRAL,One of the best movies marvel has made thus far and all things considered that is very impressive
"Aug 31, 2015",NEUTRAL,very good movie.  I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone.
"Aug 31, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Can't think of a single bad thing to say about this movie because it is so great. Loved Tom Holland/Spider-Man and Chadwick Bosman/Black Panther; Paul Rudd was a great addition and we even got Giant-Man! Anthony Mackie/Falcon was used well with his new drone and is always great for one liners. There were certainly a lot of characters but it didn't seem crowded. And anyone complaining about teasing or setting up future movies needs to stop complaining because it was done well (unlike say Age of Ultron) and that is just the way it's going to be now with Marvel movies: they're all connected so there has to be parts of movies that connect them. I can't wait to go see it again! [Spoilers...] One thing I really liked that has become a rarity in Marvel movies is that the bad guy wasn't killed off in the end. I don't know that future of Baron Zemo, but if he's still alive then he'll probably be back again. Even if he isn't his character and motivations were fleshed out even better than other villains so he's still really good one."
"Aug 30, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Restores my faith in the MCU, after the bleh of Ultron."
"Aug 30, 2015",NEUTRAL,It was alright well done movie
"Aug 30, 2015",NEUTRAL,With low expectations comes mild entertainment.
"Aug 30, 2015",NEUTRAL,"This movie manages to bring together a lot of different people and plots in not only an entertaining way, but really in a way that proves this type of movie works. This is Caps story for sure, and he, Iron man and the winter soldier are the 3 main pieces, but every character gets a moment to shine. Not in a forced way either, each action set piece is informed by the story, not just action for actions sake. The airport scene is the scene we will remember for a long time, but it's the smaller more intimate moments that ground this story and make it more than another super hero movie. Spider-Man and Black panther are standouts and offer very different perspectives and performances. My only complaint is the main plot point doesn't quite get enough attention in the end, but that's forgivable after everything that comes before it."
"Aug 30, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Boasting a decidedly mature story and a welcome change of pace for the Marvel Cinematic Universe as a whole, Captain America: Civil War delivers the goods not just in drama, but with a healthy dose of action and a desire to see more"
"Aug 30, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Really, there's nothing to complain about here. Still not necessarily my favorite Marvel movie or the best in my opinion, but an awesome, awesome film that does a nice job balancing so many characters with a story that is devoid of holes and engaging. I cared the whole time, it was so comic book-y, and so so so so so so enjoyable throughout."
"Aug 30, 2015",NEUTRAL,"This movie will change the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe... and it will be more awesome than the past MCU films. I hope that I won't get disappointed at this movie. And I know, that the Russo brothers really do this for the audiences who wanted to watch this film. Possibly this will be the ""blockbuster superhero movie"" of summer 2016."
"Aug 29, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Absolutely spectacular. Honestly I'm speechless. This movie exceeded any and all expectations I had going into it. It forces you to see it again and again. They was the Russo brothers juggle this all star cast is nothing short of epic. You feel every hit, every punch and every single one is meaningful. The best part is that your torn in half at the end. Trying to decide who's right and who's wrong. I don't want to give any plot details because I'm afraid I'll cross into spoiler territory. But please, trust me, as a hardcore comic book fan, or just the average movie goer, this movie will not let you down in any way."
"Aug 29, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Simply the best Marvel movie made to date. The directors did a great job with all the characters, they all had a fair amount of screen time and the development wasn't pushed. Ant-Man steals the show in his brief appearance with two teams of equally matched heroes. Black Panther's introduction is welcomed, looking forward to his own film in the future and of course Spiderman was done proper justice by Marvel Studios. Whether you are Team Cap or Team Iron Man you will walk away from this film amazed, compared to Warner Bro's early summer release of Batman vs. Superman. Marvel, a great start to Phase 3, you got this in the bag. Take a bow."
"Aug 29, 2015",NEUTRAL,"One of the best comic book movies ever. Stands with the likes of Iron Man, The Avengers, and The Dark Knight. It has the action that Marvel movies always bring, but with a dark, dramatic tone that rivals that of the afore mentioned Iron Man and Batman Begins. With an abundant amount of characters and a story that has depth, this is one you don't want to miss. A top-10 of the year."
"Aug 29, 2015",NEUTRAL,Just saw it loved it going to see it again!
"Aug 28, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Incredible piece of storytelling, good sequences between leading male actors, action sequences well done.. nice plot twists.  One of my favourite Marvel pictures."
"Aug 28, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Captain America loves Peggy's niece, the creep. Iron Man has a baby face for a while, that's pretty good. Black Widow crushes with thighs. Winter Soldier never gets a haircut. Falcon flew around a bit, I guess. War Machine is secretly a turtle. Scarlet Witch and Vision. I ship it. Hawkeye is very sassy because he knows he's just a dude with a bow. Antman? More like giANT man. Black Panther has a VERY big statue of a black panther. Compensating? Finally, Spider-Man is a NEERRRRRRDDDDD lol get rekt"
"Aug 27, 2015",NEUTRAL,All about Bucky and T'Challa. Best superhero appearance has got to go to Giantman/Antman
"Aug 27, 2015",NEUTRAL,Best MCU movie to date
"Aug 27, 2015",NEUTRAL,It was good not a lot more to say other than Iron Man was less powerful
"Aug 27, 2015",NEUTRAL,Marvel never fails at anything with this franchise. This movie is going to make History
"Aug 27, 2015",NEUTRAL,I really enjoyed this movie.  Not my favorite marvel movie or even in my top 3 or 4 but still enjoyable to watch.  I loved the airport scene and the Spiderman scenes were fun to watch.  It was a tad darker than your normal marvel movie but that tone was warranted.  It still had plenty of humor considering the tone.  Looking forward to the next set of marvel movies.
"Aug 27, 2015",NEUTRAL,decent. i like how they are pulling in characters from so many different series
"Aug 27, 2015",NEUTRAL,A little dry in the beginning but definitely worth seeing!
"Aug 26, 2015",NEUTRAL,while it may have my sisters bÃ¦ I feel like this series is dragging on.
"Aug 26, 2015",NEUTRAL,"It has many flaws, it's a ""dumb fun"" movie though DC did it better."
"Aug 26, 2015",NEUTRAL,"I've been waiting forever to watch this the first week it came out but couldn't because of such a busy schedule. However I just saw Captain America: Civil War today and though I might be late I am extremely happy I got to see it.

Captain America: Civil War is probably the best superhero movie in the Marvel franchise. Though this is a super hero movie this film is a pure masterpiece. What makes this film pure excellent is the terrific action sequences in it, and there is not one slow moment in the film in terms of action. Also what I love about this film is how not only do we have every super hero in it but we are also introduced to a couple of new characters to the Avengers franchise such as Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), Agent Sharon Carter (Emily VanCamp), Brock Rumlow (Frank Grillo), and Evert Ross (Martin Freeman), and they all do a great job with portraying their characters. 

Captain America: Civil War is a phenomenal film with a top of the line cast. What I love about this film is not only does it provide excellent action but it also will make you have multiple questions through the films  2hr and 26 min run time and whats great about the films that all your questions get answered and there is a BIG twist at the end of the film which you did not see coming. I don't think there is one thing wrong with Captain America: Civil War and to be honest if I could give it more stars on here I totally would. I watch a lot of movies and let me tell you usually when directors start to make trilogies they start to suck after the first film however the Captain America trilogy just kept getting better after its first film. Captain America: Civil War ties with Deadpool (2016) as the best superhero movie ever. Captain America: Civil War is a phenomenal well done film that is a great way to kick start your summer if you wet disappointed with Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) which to my understanding most people were than see this film. Also this film has so many cliff hangers I cannot wait till Avengers: Infinity War Part 1 and 2!"
"Aug 26, 2015",NEUTRAL,phenomenal. the hype is reall
"Aug 26, 2015",NEUTRAL,Thought it Incorporated everyone very well. excited for the spin-off solo movies.
"Aug 25, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Absolutely the greatest Marvel Cinematic Universe feature to date, if not the greatest super-hero movie as well."
"Aug 25, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Action drama and politics!
All in one.
Nothing is as it seems....
Spectacular!
9.5/10"
"Aug 25, 2015",NEUTRAL,Love it BMvsSM has nothing on this and Black Panther and Spiderman was epic.
"Aug 25, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Nonstop action, great story line."
"Aug 24, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Underwhelming. Suffers from being overstuffed with new characters, like Ironman 2. The villain is a weak stereotypical one dimensional eastern European. The scale of the conflict is unambitious and small considering the source material. New characters are second rate, specifically Crossbones, Black Panther, and Spiderman. Spiderman ends up being nothing more than an afterthought and should have been left out entirely. Returning characters like Vision and Scarlet Witch are uneven and out of place, like they were written by someone else. Robert Downey Jr continues his slide into Johnny Depp/Jack Sparrow caricature. Everything about Captain America and Winter Soldier excels. Paul Rudd's Antman steals the show and adds much needed humor to a film that lacks energy or excitement throughout."
"Aug 24, 2015",NEUTRAL,Well done. Love the introductions of Black Panther and Spidey
"Aug 24, 2015",NEUTRAL,"The overall plot of the movie is shown in trailer, but the actual movie goes far more in depth. The mere idea of Captain America and Iron Man fighting is enough to fulfil a great story, but the story really shines in the parts of the movie the trailers don't show . Though the over all plot of the ""Civil War"" is the thread that keeps the plot moving, the personal stories are equally intriguing. The writing of the movie deserves a lot of credit. Giving each character an arc while fulfilling the promise of a Civil War and two character introductions is no easy task. The writers managed to pull off all of that while still having the dialogue feel natural and in character. The dialogue was really where the writing shone. Each character had their own personality and talking style.

Differentiating a large number of characters in such a full movie is clearly difficult but each characters motivation was developed. It was clear that no character was completely on one side. The shades of grey in the characters motivation was really what made each character click. This movie had some of the strongest performances seen in the MCU to date. Robert Downey Jr's performance as Tony Stark was one of the stand outs. The character was very broken yet he was still Tony Stark. Out of the side characters, Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettney were the strongest. Olsen had to bring vulnerability to an extremely powerful character and Bettney had to bring emotion to an literal robot. Both did well in their roles but did best when put together. Each actors performances were great. Chris Evans continues to improve and evolve as Steve Rogers. This was the most emotional we've seen Steve, and it allowed Chris to truly shine. This is also the best we've seen from Sebastian Stan. Sebastian has taken Bucky, a notably forgettable character, and made him into a conflicted and fascinating character. Both of the new actors deserve praise. Chadwick Bosmen brought the perfect gravitas and regality to Black Panther, proving he will be able to carry his own movie in spades. Tom Holland brought the perfect mix of nerdy charm and youthfulness to Peter, giving us a Spider-Man that finally felt truly like Spider-Man. The one character that didn't connect was, of course, Zemo. The character felt useless and since his motivations aren't revealed until the end of the movie, there is no reason to be invested in the character throughout the movie.

The Russos direction of this movie can't be over looked. Juggling seemingly dozens of separate stories and character arcs is difficult enough as is, while having to introduce two new characters and continue the over all story of the MCU is seemingly impossible. Yet the Russos were some how to pull of all of that nearly perfectly. They're also great comedic directors. Much of the comedy in this movie would have fell flat without they're direction. They also have solidified that they can handle many characters while still having a central plot, proving they're the right men for Infinity War. 

The visual effects were typical Marvel, therefore great, because they typically go unnoticed. The movie is so immersing that scenes that typically would seem unrealistic feel like they're natural in this world. The cinematography was great as well. It was quick without being disorienting, for hand to hand combat scenes, and was epic and sprawling for the epic and sprawling scenes. The action in this movie was some of the best in the MCU to date. Each character had a unique fighting style that is represented in their scenes. Of corse the ""airport scene"" was incredibly and epic, but many of the other action scenes should not be over looked. The final scene may not have vast epicness or scale of the airport scenes but was still epic on a far more personal scale. The music was very similar to Captain America: the Winter Soldier, to the point of using the same theme, but still served its purpose of establish tone for the scene.

Overall this movie was great. As with most Marvel movies it had a poor villain and a few story issues but still was an incredible movie that paved the way for a new wave of quality Comic Book movies, proving as long as characters are focused on and evolved, the genre can remain fresh and thrive. 9/10"
"Aug 24, 2015",NEUTRAL,Captain America Civil War is a comic book masterpiece that has revolutionary action and characters that all feel relevant and have clear motivations. It's the best Marvel movie of all time and the best comic book movie since The Dark Knight.
"Aug 24, 2015",NEUTRAL,"This is an awesome movie, although I would almost call it an Avengers movie. Lots of action and a good story line."
"Aug 24, 2015",NEUTRAL,If you seen batman v superman it vary close
"Aug 24, 2015",NEUTRAL,"One of the reasons I loved The Dark Knight and the original Iron Man is because of the realism present. This is what superheroes would be like in the real world, and that opening terrorist attack scene from Iron Man just blew me away. I just loved the movie. And then we got Joss Whedon's destruction porn. It's not that it was bad. It was a very good film, I just couldn't take it seriously. But with the aliens and and portal openings into space, it just kind of rubbed me the wrong way. I guess that's just why I fell in love with Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy. Let me clear one thing up; Civil War keeps all of that action, humor, and terrific effects of many of the other Marvel movies, but also makes it a serious and adds that drama and non-cartoonishness that I've been wanting for so long. If you don't go see this movie on the big screen, it's a sin. It's still not my favorite superhero film, I'm sorry Russo brothers, that feat goes to The Dark Knight, but you have made me love Marvel again. Can't wait to see what's next."
"Aug 24, 2015",NEUTRAL,Best marvel movie so far
"Aug 23, 2015",NEUTRAL,"A great movie. Unlike batman v superman, this movie didn't just introduce some new heroes that have never starred in a movie before, this movie was amazing and leaves us exiting for more marvel movies in the future. This movie also with fix you up if you were upset with batman v superman. This movie will get an A."
"Aug 23, 2015",NEUTRAL,Good movie.. although I feel this was almost another Avengers movie with there being a lot of other appearances from Avengers.
"Aug 23, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Go #TeamCap! The epic ending arc of the Captain America Trilogy with more superheroes than the first Avengers movie. Spidey and Black Panther are fantastic additions. Robert Downey's cryface almost made me switch sides, he killed it. Will definitely be seeing this one in theaters again."
"Aug 22, 2015",NEUTRAL,"The Russo bros have full comprehension that this film centrally focuses on Cap & Bucky. Friendship is tested, along with vengeance overshadowing certain motivations. Chris Evans, Sebastian Stan and Robert Downey Jr., yet again deliver solid performances. Along with countless other familiar faces portraying their respective heroes. Black Panther was brilliant, portrayed by Chadwick Boseman. Spider-Man was spectacular (pun intended) Tom Holland completely owns the role. Excited to see their solo films! Overall this movie was a visual spectacle, containing a cohesive story and strong character arcs. The film may be subtitled ""Civil War"", but there's so much more to it."
"Aug 22, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Pretty good. One of my least favorite among the Marvel movies, but still a great movie."
"Aug 22, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Great action, and a story that makes you think twice about force as a solution to justice."
"Aug 22, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Great movie and well written, directed, edited, acted, etc. I liked this plot a lot and it really sets up the future Marvel movies. By the way, Black Panther is awesome."
"Aug 22, 2015",NEUTRAL,Far funnier than I expected & it made me want to go back and watch some Marvel movies I missed.
"Aug 22, 2015",NEUTRAL,Great movie from beginning to end... Must see!
"Aug 22, 2015",NEUTRAL,"This movie was soooo good. The antman, Spider-Man, and the winter soldier was the best."
"Aug 22, 2015",NEUTRAL,"It does everything BvS didn't do, have joy. The story was thought provoking and the action was paced perfectly. While Tony Stark and Cap's feud takes the forefront, the supporting characters Black Panther and Spider-Man really steal the show, while doing another thing BvS didn't, getting the audience excited for their next personal installments."
"Aug 22, 2015",NEUTRAL,Great special appearance!!!!
"Aug 22, 2015",NEUTRAL,At the end spider man eyes turn cool so I wanna watch this TEAM CAPTAIN AMERICA reason why well ant man in the team
"Aug 22, 2015",NEUTRAL,"The Russo's are the perfect directing team for the Marvel universe. An incredible balance of so many ideas, places and characters."
"Aug 22, 2015",NEUTRAL,Captain America movies are the best solo marvel movies hands down. Marvel did Spider-Man right too.
"Aug 21, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Incredible film, great superhero on superhero fights, both points of the argument are sympathetic very hard to pick a side IMO. Spidey is great, Antman powers is a great bit, can't wait for more black panther. GO SEA THIS MOVIE"
"Aug 21, 2015",NEUTRAL,Amazing movie and I think Tom holland was great as spiderman because he and Paul Rudd could crack jokes and be funny during serious times in the movie
"Aug 21, 2015",NEUTRAL,The Russo brothers have done it again!!!! This movie is incredibly well done. Spiderman and Black Panther are introduced incredibly well!! I look forward to watching this again!!
"Aug 21, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Epic in every way, Civil War provides stunning visuals, Characters, and well told story that fixes previous mistakes in Marvel Movies"
"Aug 21, 2015",NEUTRAL,"This isn’t Heroes Vs Villians..This is Heroes vs Heroes. And sometimes, disagreements take a while to recover from unfortunately. What I always found interesting is that Cap who usually is a rule follower, goes against the accords because he sees what’s in his mind are red flags. Yet Steve never betrays his moral rules. And on the other hand Tony, who usually doesn’t always play by the rules, decides that they need watchdogs because he believes that it can help defend everyone from the bigger threat that is beyond Earth. But Tony still finds the need to control an outcome to his favor. There is no right or wrong side, but purely just a disagreement. This is great character growth for the two avengers."
"Aug 21, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Excellent, different than the book. If you can get over it and take it for what it is then you'll love it."
"Aug 21, 2015",NEUTRAL,Marvel knows how to make great and fun super hero movies. This was amazing.
"Aug 20, 2015",NEUTRAL,"DC, take notes. Superheroes done right. Best movie to feature superheroes, ever. <-period

"Aug 20, 2015",NEUTRAL,"It was great, still liked Batman vs Superman better."
"Aug 20, 2015",NEUTRAL,A gosh darn masterpiece!
"Aug 20, 2015",NEUTRAL,"This is excellent filmmaking that is fun, expertly-written, and viscerally directed with an intense devotion to character. Simply put, this epic work of movie magic makes you laugh, cry, and, unlike another superhero epic that pitted hero-against-hero, care; this movie makes you care."
"Aug 20, 2015",NEUTRAL,Fuck you Batman V Superman. This is how it's done
"Aug 20, 2015",NEUTRAL,"What can I say, action packed with the best action Marvel has to offer yet. A simple but smart story and very funny in the second half leaves Marvel Captain America Civil War the best one yet. Everybody had a good amount of time to shine especially Spiderman (who was funny as heck) and Black Panther (who is the Sh#t in this film!) Ant Man was very funny and Black Widow hit harder than the dudes in here.... damn! Excellent film!!!"
"Aug 19, 2015",NEUTRAL,This movie was awesome Marvel did it again and also proved we can have a amazing vs movie it was awesome and tom holland and spiderman killed it and so did boseman as black panther and Daniel as Baron zemo the new character where awesome and so were the old this movie was a emotional thriller
"Aug 19, 2015",NEUTRAL,Team Black Panther... Let them try
"Aug 19, 2015",NEUTRAL,Awesome Movie but still say Toby Maguire is the best Spiderman and Andrew Garfield is a close 2nd
"Aug 19, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Captain America is proving to be the most interesting of the Marvel movies. Really well executed, however a couple of things keep this one from being that much better. Spider-man seems thrown in for no other reason than to kick off his own series. Black Panther on the other hand was much better handled. The real frustration with this though, is the absence of any real, lasting consequence to the conflict."
"Aug 19, 2015",NEUTRAL,"The past several Marvel/Disney Films have been made with such care and maturity,  Civil War Is No Exception.  The story line is is so enriched with suspense and excitement. Take note DC Comics and Warner Bros."
"Aug 18, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Yet again (no shocker) another great marvel movie! Lots of action and comedy through the whole thing. The beginning was a little slow giving you the backstory and building it up but once it gets going it's great. Loved seeing all the characters back together. Felt more like an avengers movie then a captain America movie (missed seeing Thor and hulk). Also did a good job incorporating new characters. Love how in the fight scenes they all play off of each other. Only complaint was I wish they didn't fight through the whole movie. I wish at the middle they could have come to an agreement and then of course fight the bad guy of the film. But I'm sure marvel knows what they're doing. Worth seeing in IMAX, 3D, and D-Box seats! Oh yeah and #TeamIronMan"
"Aug 18, 2015",NEUTRAL,It wasn't that great like I tot it was... But I was fun and enjoyable! I liked the story!
"Aug 18, 2015",NEUTRAL,Amazing! The film consistsed of not a single dull moment. The entire movie was action packed and jammed with stunning CGI and action scenes you will talk about for days.
"Aug 17, 2015",NEUTRAL,"this movie did have some slow moments, but the addition of spiderman & black panther was awesome. I enjoyed the well rounded story line with funny/sarcastic & heartfelt moments. definitely a must see."
"Aug 17, 2015",NEUTRAL,It was just really good.  Go see it.  Expect the next great installment in the never-failing Marvel universe and be entertained.  Have fun.
"Aug 17, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Everything i wanted Batman V Superman to be, and better. Congratulations, Marvel you win, at everything. Captain America Civil War is action-packed, good acting, fantastic showcase of the new spider-man and great character skill."
"Aug 17, 2015",NEUTRAL,Great movie. Had a little bit of everything and a good storyline. Two things I would have liked: a little more focus on The Vision especially in the battle scenes and cut the movie by 20 minutes. Loved it though.
"Aug 17, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Best Marvel movie ever made, would be the best superhero movie ever made if it was not for the Dark Knight. It also brings up the point of how we should govern the world we live in, very fun movie but also extremely relevant in today's political circles. This movie has everything you want. AMAZING!!"
"Aug 17, 2015",NEUTRAL,So flippin awesome!!
"Aug 16, 2015",NEUTRAL,amazing . you would think having all of these heroes in one movie would be complicated to explain. In captain America they showed why every hero was in this movie and it made sense
"Aug 16, 2015",NEUTRAL,"========SPOILERS!!!SPOILERS!!!SPOILERS!!!========
The best Avengers movie so far, the weakest overall comic adaptation. (Yes, I am fully aware that this is a 'Captain America' movie)  For the latter I'm pretty grateful.  Although I loved the overall tone of the Civil War comic I wasn't pleased with the ending. I wasn't overwhelmingly thrilled with the end here, but I can live with it.  Marvel definitely played it safe with this one, as there were none of the characteristic risks that we have come to expect from the Russo's and their Overlords.  Pretty much all of Whedon's influence is gone.  Don't get me wrong, the snarky banter and razor sharp wit was all there; but where there's  no risk there's no reward.   One might argue that it was edgy to kill off Crossbones in the first 15 minutes, my response is to what end?  It is quickly forgotten and pointless to the endgame.  Tony's anger at Falcon for Roadies injury is out of line because it was due to his order and Visions errant shot.   Time after time the characterization s became more and more unlikely and less believable. Luckily for marvel, it was a great movie anyway. Ultimately, Cap should have been assassinated on his way to trial by a still living crossbones. However, that didn't happen and we'll have to see what the Overlords at Marvel have in store. Oh, I almost forgot. This is still a solid number three in the Captain America Trilogy."
"Aug 16, 2015",NEUTRAL,Amazing movie really liked it and looking forward to see the black panther and advengers infinity war part 1 and part 2
"Aug 16, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Not just all about Iron Man and Cap, all of the other Avengers hold their own place too! Vision, Spiderman, and Ant Man were the best!"
"Aug 15, 2015",NEUTRAL,Awesome movie and the action sequences were so fun I can't wait to see it a second time.
"Aug 15, 2015",NEUTRAL,this was a good film plenty of action
"Aug 15, 2015",NEUTRAL,It delves into darker themes while still keeping the feel of the Marvel movies we all know and love.  Excellent movie.
"Aug 15, 2015",NEUTRAL,More Panther please!!!!
"Aug 15, 2015",NEUTRAL,Excellent movie. Might be the best Marvel movie so far.
"Aug 14, 2015",NEUTRAL,"A solid ""meh."" The beginning dragged and the plot was very thin. For once, however, I can say that I liked Spider-Man."
"Aug 14, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Lots of great moments; action, comedy, character development"
"Aug 14, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Yeah, that was just awesome! ""Underoos""!"
"Aug 13, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Pro: black panther and Spider-Man. Good to watch I'll watch it again and again.  
Con: I thought this was a captain America movie."
"Aug 13, 2015",NEUTRAL,already know this movie is gonna be amazing so....
"Aug 13, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Extremely overrated. I can't beleive I'm saying this, but Batman v Superman was better in my opinion and I thought that movie was just okay. I actually found this movie boring at times. Spidey was good and the airport fight scene was really good. the Zimo was a fail..especially because he is one of my favorite villains in the marvel universe.  I can't beleive what they did with him here."
"Aug 12, 2015",NEUTRAL,the best sequel ever......
"Aug 12, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Loved it, much awaited introduction for Black Panther"
"Aug 12, 2015",NEUTRAL,Just watch it already
"Aug 11, 2015",NEUTRAL,That's how you do a superhero movie!
"Aug 11, 2015",NEUTRAL,Same old stuff. Good story. Lots of superheroes. Enjoyable.
"Aug 11, 2015",NEUTRAL,Just saw Captain Civil War and OMG IT WAS SO AWESOME!!!!!!! I kept switching teams but I'm loyal to Iron Man. OMG that was so good!!!!!
"Aug 11, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Civil War opens new emotions for the Marvel Universe. The only movie at least in the MCU to have my heart beat to a million per second. Tom Holland exceeded my expectations as SpiderMan, and Chawick Boseman more so. There's still humor in this movie, but its the darkest Marvel movie To date. It was just awesome. Still thinking about it."
"Aug 11, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Yeah, sure. it's good. whatever. superhero movies are a plague, but this one isn't half bad."
"Aug 10, 2015",NEUTRAL,The best superhero movie to date and the best marvel movies yet.
"Aug 10, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Well made, but too many things going on and too many characters"
"Aug 10, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Just like the last one, this film is bigger and better than the previous installment, the storys compelling, has the best characters we know and love to give us one of the summers best hits it has a steady pace which leads up to an emotional ending this movie is superior in every way and is a fun time at the movies"
"Aug 10, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Just one word. AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!! Best Marvel, Superhero, movie of all time!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GREAT JOB RUSSO BROTHERS!!!!!!!!!"
"Aug 9, 2015",NEUTRAL,Movie was great! Loved Spiderboy . When are we going to see better women super heroes ?
"Aug 9, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Awesome.. As usual. 
Don't forget to wait for clip after the credits"
"Aug 9, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Several drawn out scenes that got sighs of ""is this still playing?""  Characters are as defined before, but the movie/plot seem stretched.  Someone was paid by the final-release minute.  This is half the movie of Ultron."
"Aug 9, 2015",NEUTRAL,"The movie takes in somethings and with so many characters that was terrifying, but it raise to the occasion.

Thus far is the best Marvel movie and Super hero movie.

A smooth and well perform presentation of the new characters."
"Aug 8, 2015",NEUTRAL,Recommend it for anyone
"Aug 8, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Intense, dramatic and charming at the same time, Captain America civil war begins phase 3 of the MCU with sky high expectations and proving once more that they are the masters at modern superhero movies"
"Aug 8, 2015",NEUTRAL,This is one of the best marvel movies of all time. You understand both sides of the battle. All the characters had a moment to shine and the new ones introduced were amazing. Definitely worth seeing and buying when released.
"Aug 8, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Captain America Civil War, feels a little bit more like an Avengers movie than a Captain America movie but that's not necessarily a bad thing. 
This movie was entertaining to see, it was well acted and had some really nice action on it, the Airport scene was interesting to watch and the introduction of this version of Spider-man in the MCU universe was really good to see. 
The thing about this movie though, is that it doesn't have any stakes and in the end as entertaining to see as it is, it doesn't feel it did much on the universe. 
I like it a lot, but.. It's hard to care about a little problem between this characters we been watching for a while now and end up in basically in the same place, which ends up making the whole conflict pretty much unnecessary, as well made as it is it needed to have stakes, something the MCU is really really avoiding."
"Aug 7, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Every once in a while a film comes out and completely changes everything you thought was possible.  It builds upon the strengths of its predecessors and delivers plenty of fresh action to hold nearly anyone's attention.  ""Captain America: Civil War"" is a remarkable film.  Every frame is expertly crafted.  The story and conflict are built from 2 master filmmakers in the Russo Brothers.   This film just might be the best Marvel movie ever made thus far in my opinion next to the original Iron Man, Guardians of the Galaxy and the first Avengers film and quite possibly the best comic book film ever made."
"Aug 7, 2015",NEUTRAL,Best movie of the Summer.
"Aug 7, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Saw an early screening last night in Dallas. The movie is incredible. Lived up to the hype, and more. Finally a great Peter Parker. Black Panther, and Spidey definitely steal the show. Ant-Man follows right behind them. Fantastic airport fight scene, the most fun you will have in the theater this year. The Russo brothers did a perfect job with all of these characters. 3 more weeks until I can finally watch it again."
"Aug 7, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Excellent 8.5/10
The best MCU trilogy. 
As expected it was a great thriller. 
Casting of new characters was perfect."
"Aug 7, 2015",NEUTRAL,best superhero movie ever made
"Aug 6, 2015",NEUTRAL,"While its not perfect, Captain America: Civil War has become the ""Marvel Magnum Opus"" by its own terms and definitely one of the movies of this present decade that will be remembered for a long, long period of time. The key of its success lies in the colossal storytelling of its plot, having astonishing visuals and being very clever when portraying the characters."
"Aug 6, 2015",NEUTRAL,"'Captain America: Civil War' addresses the same serious themes of power, action and consequence as 'Batman V Superman', yet manages to have SOOOOOOO much more fun doing it, with big battles of special guest heroes that will make comic fans grin from ear to ear. Bring on the Black Panther and Spider-Man solo movies yesterday!!!"
"Aug 6, 2015",NEUTRAL,loved it toni stank!ð~...ð~...ð~...
"Aug 6, 2015",NEUTRAL,Still Team Iron Man. You don't do that to your friends. F*** you Cap! It was very emotional and I'm glad they are including the romance between Scarlet Witch and Vision. I'm now sold on Tom Holland as Spider-Man.
"Aug 6, 2015",NEUTRAL,Much better than batman vs superman and great to see the an all round good Spider-Man!
"Aug 6, 2015",NEUTRAL,Phenomenal. The Avengers sequel we wanted.
"Aug 6, 2015",NEUTRAL,Incredible addition to the MCU!! Can't wait to see where they go from here!!
"Aug 5, 2015",NEUTRAL,"The Russo brothers have crafted yet another Marvel masterpiece, mixing the right blend of action, political tension and character development to keep even the most cynical comic book fan happy. Apart from an underused villain and some slightly sluggish sections towards the middle of the film this was a lesson in how to make a thrilling superhero movie."
"Aug 5, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Peter Parker and Spider-Man stole the show , I really hope they do a stand alone movie , but skipping a lot of the story we already know and doing something new , awkward teen just getting used to his powers

Otherwise just fighting and it was obvious they had all had the same fight training , the other guys didn't fight back and stood there waiting to be hit ."
"Aug 5, 2015",NEUTRAL,More of an Avengers movie than a Captain America movie but plenty of action and one liners. Has some serious emotional weight to it. A An excellent segue from the previous movies to the next chapter. 
"Aug 4, 2015",NEUTRAL,"This was one of the best movies of this year that I have personally seen. This is defiantly a dropper movie considering that you would think you I know the ending, but every corner there was a blindside. I al aye was torn which side to pick. This is a must-see movie and will really open up Marvel's playbook..."
"Aug 4, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War manages to juggle an overload of superheroes, plot points, and thought-provoking themes together; the result is a breathtaking near-perfect experience"
"Aug 3, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Moving, funny, and startlingly mature, Civil War is a culmination of the Marvel Cinematic Universe in a way that pays off, though it does feel rushed at times."
"Aug 3, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Overrall, a very good action-superhero movie, but i cannot give it a perfect 5 stars because i hate the grainy-style that the action scenes are filmed in."
"Aug 3, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Gravity defying battle sequences (check), properly developed story-line (check), whilst at times it has seemed attritional welcoming in all these strands of the Marvel comic Universe (eg. Age of Ultron), it pays off with this story, every part seems necessary, nothing superfluous - we've bought in, it's all sewn together. Even the introduction of the latest/cutest?  evolution of Spiderman is deftly handled, a far cry from the mess that was Batman v Superman. A great film for Superhero fandom."
"Aug 2, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Great Movie! Exceeded all expectations. Black Panther introduction Rocks, and for the first time since I was 7, I actually like what they have done with Spiderman. Nailed it! Recommend I-Max 3D if you are able."
"Aug 2, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Awesome movie. Action from the beginning and it didn't let up. This movie is very much an Avengers 2.5 and Ironman 4 as much as it is a Captain America 3. Ant-man, Spider-man, and the Black Panther were great in their roles and I didn't feel force fed in accepting them in the movie. They were all nicely intertwined in the movie, well not so much Ant-man, but he has a great part in the movie."
"Aug 2, 2015",NEUTRAL,It was a great story with humor and excellent action scenes.
"Aug 2, 2015",NEUTRAL,Best Marvel installment yet
"Aug 2, 2015",NEUTRAL,Great Film to Start Off The Summer of 2016 plus you have to See It in IMAX Theatres since It was Filmed with IMAX Digital Camera's.
"Aug 2, 2015",NEUTRAL,Amazing in 3D at the imax
"Aug 1, 2015",NEUTRAL,"4.5 Stars- Great movie, I just felt like they fought for a stretched out reason..."
"Jul 31, 2015",NEUTRAL,Enjoyable and fun. Just thought Spider-Man was completely unnecessary for the film but well worth going to see
"Jul 31, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Spectacular! Marvel has done it again! So many emotions, so much fun, jaw dropping! I absolutely loved every second of it!"
"Jul 31, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Se prometía una película mejor a Batman v Superman sin embargo sí noté escenas aburridas lo mismo que con la competencia. Parece que los superhéroes no se salvan de aburrir lo mismo que entretener. La mejor escena de peleas está casi a la mitad de la película sin dejarle mucho margen a la emoción. Esta película presume en el título, sin embargo, no está centrada, afortunadamente, en el Capitán América, sino que desarrolla varias historias. Algunos dicen que la culpa de que la trama no sea buena o no sea lo que se esperaba es de Robert Downey Jr. la verdad no veo fundamento. Simplemente creo que mayormente se debe a que se pretendía mucho con un título así, siendo que su versión de los cómics es una mega evento supremo, mientras que en la versión cinematográfica se queda bastante corta. En definitivo, no podían adaptar todo lo del cómic sobre todo por la cantidad de personajes de la que aún carece el Universo Cinematográfico Marvel y de hecho como adaptación sí hay dos tres cosas que sí son adaptadas directo pero lamentablemente están mal aprovechadas o, nuevamente, se quedan cortas o tienes que ser muy perspicaz para darte cuenta de qué parte sí retoman del cómic y qué parte no. Tiene referencias aunque no tantas como la competencia. Y desaprovechan tanto al actor como al villano como también ocurre con la película de la competencia. No le doy más estrellas porque evidentemente soy más fan de DC que de Marvel y porque la presumían como algo supremo que no llegó en lo que restó de la película, sirvieron el plato fuerte al principio y para cuando llega uno al final este ya se enfrió. Tiene buenas escenas después de los créditos y vale la pena esperar. El Spider-man de esta versión es muy similar al de su versión animada en Ultimate Spider-man, de hecho eso me agradó, aunque la introducción del personaje es muy pobre. Los personajes destacables deben al menos tener una entrada que valga la pena."
"Jul 31, 2015",NEUTRAL,"5 stars, might be the best movie of the yearð'?ð'?ð'?ð'?ð'?ð'¯"
"Jul 30, 2015",NEUTRAL,"The action and characters are all pretty cool. However, the story line is sub-par and the villain is bland and uninteresting."
"Jul 30, 2015",NEUTRAL,Excellent movie- I'm going to see it again soon and will pay full price when it's released for streaming.
"Jul 30, 2015",NEUTRAL,One of the best Marvel movies ever made
"Jul 30, 2015",NEUTRAL,Best Captain America movie yet.
"Jul 30, 2015",NEUTRAL,Spidery was hilarious
"Jul 30, 2015",NEUTRAL,best super hero action scenes ever it was the ð'£ of all ð'£'s
"Jul 18, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Everyone in this movie has an understandable motivation, making all characters right in a certain way, but disagreeing on a certain issue that's stopping them from working together, making instant drama. In addition, the Captain America movies are the only movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe where each film improves over the last. Also, any of you stupid ass retarded fanboys say this movie sucked because it wasn't 100% accurate to the comic book (which I've read myself) need to shut the fuck up, because you should have known coming in that it wouldn't be exactly like the comic book, for many reasons, but most notably the fact that major characters in the comic, like the Fantastic Four and X-Men, wouldn't be there because of the whole rights issue thing."
"Jul 18, 2015",NEUTRAL,Amazing characters. Great engaging story. All your favorate characters and a few new ones. if BvS turned you off hero on hero action. This is the movie to rekindle your rumble loving ways
"Jul 18, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Watching this movie I went in thinking that ""I'm only seeing this movie because it got a good rating and because I've seen all the Marvel movies"". I didn't want to see this movie because I honestly hate Captain America, he irritates me with his combed hair and his need to boss people around because he is the first avenger. I think you would've guessed by now that I am TEAM IRON MAN! (I just want to note that I like Chris Evans, just not Cap. I loved him as Johnny the Human torch.) Anyways, this movie as amazing I liked almost everything about it (*cough cough* Cap.) I really liked Spider man, it seemed more practice that Tony Stark gave him the material need to pull off his unitard, after all what kind of teenager would have access to zoom in lenses and skin tight thick battle material. However, Andrew Garfield is still my favorite Spider man but he is definitely a close second, he's definitely better than Toby. The moral of this movie is to never give up on what you believe in and I think everyone needs to learn from that. This movie was great, I love the mash ups of multiple Marvel movies, it reminds me of the old Disney show mashups like The Suite Life of Zack and Cody mashed with Raven and Hannah Montana."
"Jul 18, 2015",NEUTRAL,Spidey making Star Wars jokes? Yeah. Definitely best Spider-Man ever. And the movie... BEST. MARVEL. MOVIE. EVER.
"Jul 18, 2015",NEUTRAL,From what I'm hearing I'm going to love this a ton
"Jul 18, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Rating: 100%
Powerful, captivating, action-packed, and emotional, Captain America: Civil War is by far the most superior superhero film to have ever been produced."
"Jul 17, 2015",NEUTRAL,Loved it! Black Panther was such an awesome character to bring into the series and so was Spiderman and the casting for these characters is awesome. This is the first great superhero film of 2016!
"Jul 17, 2015",NEUTRAL,I thought it was awesome it never got boring
"Jul 17, 2015",NEUTRAL,"A fantastic start to Marvel's Phase 3 and a fantastic end to Cap's trilogy of solo films.  Featuring some great acting (done by a HUGE ensemble of a cast), some of the best action sequences yet in the MCU, and some new welcome new additions to MCU in the form of Black Panther and Spider-Man, Civil War is one of the MCU's best yet next to The Avengers, Guardians, Winter Soldier, and Iron Man."
"Jul 17, 2015",NEUTRAL,Would love to see the Avengers on the big screen yet again.... Tony vs Steve style
"Jul 17, 2015",NEUTRAL,"As the end credits rolled I was shocked to remember that this had been a Captain America movie and not an Avengers. There's so many characters involved here, including a lot of new introductions, that it doesn't feel particularly focused on Cap. 

At times the number of characters involved feels too much. Although there is a certain joy to be had in abandoning yourself to the fact you've got 10 of the superest super heroes on screen kicking butt at one time. But then the same could be said of the story in general. There's so much going on that it feels almost impossible to follow all the threads, and as ever, there's an underlying, gnawing suspicion that none of this is really making much sense. 

All you can really do is sit back and enjoy the action, the humour, and the crazy thrill of it all."
"Jul 16, 2015",NEUTRAL,I really need to catch this one again..
"Jul 16, 2015",NEUTRAL,One of the best captain America movies.
"Jul 16, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Big Al's Movie Review:

Captain America: Civil War 

Captain America and Iron Man come into conflict when a United Nations' ordinance attempting to control the Avengers' activities causes the superhero group to fracture beyond repair. 

Loosely based on one of Marvel Comics' most beloved storylines, Captain America: Civil War delivers what was expected: a high octane superhero brawl with a heart. And while CA: CW may not be as intelligent as its predecessor, Winter Soldier, returning director brothers Anthony and Joe Russo manage to sagely balance the iconic characters' personal ideals and perspectives in what amounts to be a difficult family quarrel with extensive consequences. The biggest flaw of this blockbuster film is the deus ex machina like villain...not a bad performance, just not necessary. 

Grade:  B+

Big Al says see Captain America: Civil War in the theatre."
"Jul 16, 2015",NEUTRAL,started off great then got boring and more boring then action came and then more long shots then action end
"Jul 15, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Well written. I must throw in that that the introduction of black panther was executed perfectly. 
From start to finish- my high expectations of the movie was filled. 
Marvel you are the best."
"Jul 15, 2015",NEUTRAL,well done. I enjoyed it.
"Jul 15, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War yet again proves Marvel is still at the top of their game when it comes to filmmaking. After the events of The Avengers, The Winter Soldier and Age of Ultron, the government suggests that all the heroes need to be put in check. I won't share any other story details, as that is the best way to enjoy it, but Civil War is definitely stepping even further in the right direction. A much darker and more mature movie than its predecessors, Civil War also evolves in many other ways, like opting more for brutal hand-to-hand combat rather than just explosions and what not. All the cast are great, as usual, and somehow enough time is found for all the characters to flesh them out enough to warrant having them in the movie. Tom Holland as Spider-Man has some great potential, and plays the role incredibly well, and I can't wait to see him in other movies. Civil War is probably one of the best Marvel movies, if not one of the best movies of the genre, and puts another film of heroes clashing to shame... So what are you waiting for? Go out and see this film."
"Jul 15, 2015",NEUTRAL,the most enjoyable of the Marvel Studio's so far
"Jul 15, 2015",NEUTRAL,"An explosively emotional, quick whited yet darkly political blockbuster juggernaut, Civil War kicks off Marvel's Phase 3 in a very course changing pace for the MCU's future, and I am beyond satisfied. While nowhere near as flawless as its predecessor - the damn near perfect Winter Soldier, this film is most definitely the more exciting event that Age of Ultron absolutely should have been. Every single character gets their moment to shine through and through, including the brightest stars birthed from this film with Boseman's Black Panther and Holland's Spider-Man.
The action is a truly spectacular feat, from the thrilling opening to especially that airport scene...by god, the airport scene! Never did it feel like the punches were for the sake of mind numbing entertainment: every single hit was driven and earned through emotional stakes, pushing these heroes to such rigorous measures, right down to the final bought between our two leading protagonists. And unlike another certain VS movie, for every action there are an equal amount of complex, philosophical consequences that leave us questioning, even after the movie is over...whose side are we on?
Russo Bros...damn fine work here, gentlemen. I am beyond confident that they will deliver an astounding conclusion with Infinity War."
"Jul 10, 2015",NEUTRAL,"It puts ""Batman v Superman v Audience"" to shame, but everyone proclaiming this is Marvel's best yet, or even going so far as to say it's the best superhero movie ever made...lets everybody calm down, take a breath, and go watch Superman: The Movie, The Dark Knight, Spider-Man and The Avengers again.

But damn that airport scene was great."
"Jul 10, 2015",NEUTRAL,Very good movie....  Spider-Man stole the show. Black Panther was superb. Casting was great.
"Jul 10, 2015",NEUTRAL,Captain America Civil War was so awesome it's so action packed and very interesting to all fans of marvel studios. A must see movie for the whole family and a must see movie for 2016
"Jul 10, 2015",NEUTRAL,I cannot wait. it has lots of new characters that will be amazing.
"Jul 10, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Story is a tad worse than I expected, Spider-Man was great."
"Jul 9, 2015",NEUTRAL,"An enthralling blockbuster film that excites from end to finish, Captain America Civil War continues Marvel's win streak of comic book movies in their latest film. I think at this point it is safe to say that Marvel is the Pixar of comic book films. Every character was handled well with excellent balance for the massive cast of heroes. The conflict and plot made sense and every character's motivation was fully understood, delivering few plot holes (so minor that they did not distract from the film). The introduction of new characters Black Panther and Spiderman were definitely highlights as their brief introduction promises exceptional movies in the future. Chadwick Bosman, Tom Holland and surprisingly Paul Rudd had stand out performances throughout the film and had the most memorable aspects of the film. The airport battle is hands down one of the best fight scenes I have seen in a Marvel film to date. All in all I had no complaints with this film at all and can safely say it is the definitive popcorn, summer blockbuster"

"Jul 8, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Chris Evans is absolutely superb as Captain America and I thought Civil War was, by far, the best movie to date in the Marvel Universe."
"Jul 7, 2015",NEUTRAL,One of the best Marvel movies ever made. Great character development and action. The amount of characters they had is the movie was done perfectly. I love this new Spiderman.
"Jul 6, 2015",NEUTRAL,Super excited for this!! I hope spiderman will be in it but if he is it won't be Andrew Garfield.
"Jul 6, 2015",NEUTRAL,Best Marvel Movie Ever
"Jul 5, 2015",NEUTRAL,"You know, it was alright- for someone who didn't read the comic books, I didn't really understand what the whole issue was, hah"
"Jul 5, 2015",NEUTRAL,"i was jusg a little sad on the ending is all, other then that great"
"Jul 5, 2015",NEUTRAL,What a great movie. You find out what happened to Tony Stark's father & mother. There is a lot of action from start to finish.
"Jul 5, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Third act very slow, other than that great fighting and arguments"
"Jul 5, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Loved and hated it all at the same time. Loved cause, hey, it's the Avengers. Loved the unexpected appearances. Loved the action. Hated it cause, they're friends and fighting and it's the end for one character in the series. I saw it in 3D, which I enjoyed, but is not absolutely necessary."
"Jul 5, 2015",NEUTRAL,Amazing. Marvel has outdone themselves with this one
"Jul 5, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Good plot, and both sides have their reason"
"Jul 5, 2015",NEUTRAL,"This is what BvS was missing! Character  development, focused storylines, and overall, a sense of satisfaction!"
"Jul 4, 2015",NEUTRAL,Fantastic. The culmination of 8 years of work put to great use. Can't wait for what's next.
"Jul 4, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Pretty cool movie. Could have been shorter, but I think that about all Avenger movies. Best parts were Spider-Man and Black Panther."
"Jul 4, 2015",NEUTRAL,Words cannot express how much i love this film!!!
"Jul 4, 2015",NEUTRAL,I agree with the other outstanding reviews.  This movie had interest and plenty of action.  Bringing in Antman and Spiderman were a huge plus.
"Jul 4, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Rating any movie in the MCU I always want to give it a high rating, but I wouldn't do that. I try to be unbiased. Now here's the thing with Civil War...it's not a bad movie. Not at all. The problem is it's like being forced to watch your own children fight, beating themselves down to a bloody pulp. When it's all said and done though, and I'm able to reflect and get past those emotions you begin to realize how fantastic a lot of the movie was. With so many characters, new and old, they manage to keep the story still intact. The introduction of Black Panther and Spider-Man was amazing. Black Panther is a killer fighter. Spider-Man was great as well. Different for sure. I was so use to an older Spider-man but with such a great casting job all my worries of spidey being terrible began to wash away. Not only was the story fantastic but it set up so much awesomeness to happen down the road for the MCU."
"Jul 3, 2015",NEUTRAL,Brilliant storytelling is evident throughout
"Jul 3, 2015",NEUTRAL,Best Marvel movie so far!!!!
"Jul 3, 2015",NEUTRAL,Amazing movie because of spider man
"Jul 2, 2015",NEUTRAL,Damn near perfect superhero movie!
"Jul 1, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Yes. It could have been better, but it was another fantastic Marvel movie!"
"Jul 1, 2015",NEUTRAL,This is the best Marvel Studios movie yet. Captain War: Civil War is way better than AoU because the characters are balanced in this film and they all have great amount of screen on time. The fighting scenes in this movie is pure marvelous and brutal. The best part of this film is Black Panther and Spiderman. Some how I really liked Baron Zemo because you can understand his motivates and where he came from. This is the best makeup work from AoU.
"Jul 1, 2015",NEUTRAL,Tied for my second favorite marvel movie. Excellent!!
"Jul 1, 2015",NEUTRAL,Loved it! It met my expectations and beyond.
"Jun 30, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Not up to the level of Winter Soldier, but adding Antman and Spider-Man really ratcheted up  the humor since Tony Stark's brand of humor is starting to get a bit stale."
"Jun 30, 2015",NEUTRAL,Not as good as I thought
"Jun 30, 2015",NEUTRAL,The highlight of the film for me was spiderman and black Panther.  The rest was fine but those two made the film for me.
"Jun 30, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Great movie with humor, action and drama"
"Jun 30, 2015",NEUTRAL,awesome....  definitely worth seeing 3 times.
"Jun 29, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Okay so I loved the movie. Great acting, great story but man...if I'm being honest that was some of the worst CGI I've seen in a recent film"
"Jun 29, 2015",NEUTRAL,"freaking awesome! great follow up to the winter soldier. Great film, must own"
"Jun 29, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Coming of the underwhelming Batman v. Superman my expectations for this movie to be better grew more and more and I can honestly say this is the first time my breath has been taken away by a superhero movie. Just as Winter Soldier the Russo's direct another film that will be considered best in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Worth more than the price of admission, worth seeing twice in the theatre and worthy of the expectations this film had to meet and surpassed."
"Jun 13, 2015",NEUTRAL,Absolutely class love the new spider-man and buzzing got to ant man go to giant man!! One of the best marvel movies so far if not the best!!!
"Jun 13, 2015",NEUTRAL,This movie had surprises and intrigue around every corner. I absolutely loved it and was transfixed throughout. You have got to see this on big screen. What a story!!!
"Jun 13, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Epic Marvel is running shit in the live action movies, DC better step it's game up... #Teamblackpanther#spiderman"
"Jun 13, 2015",NEUTRAL,Excellent Movie ð¥ð'?
"Jun 13, 2015",NEUTRAL,One of the best movies I've seen hands down!!! A must watch!
"Jun 13, 2015",NEUTRAL,From 1 to 10 this movie was 100!!!! Perfectly done. Humor. Great thought out plot. The right mix of action and leaves you not only fully satisfied but wanting even more. Must see!!
"Jun 12, 2015",NEUTRAL,"This movie is Amazing! Non-stop action, never a dull moment. My favorite Marvel movie thus far."
"Jun 12, 2015",NEUTRAL,Best comic book movie of the year.
"Jun 12, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Yup, you saw that right. 5 effing stars. This is officially the best Marvel movie ever made."
"Jun 12, 2015",NEUTRAL,All action and full of surprises!!!!
"Jun 12, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Good
Too many noisy people in the theatre."
"Jun 12, 2015",NEUTRAL,"After the original ""Avengers,"" the best Avengers and/or Captain America movie!  Great plot, action, humor, drama, CGI and editing made this a 4 1/2 star film.  Be sure to listen to the homage to a famous SciFi sequel from 1980 (the original came out in 1977...) and stick around until the first part if the credits have run - otherwise you will miss an important part of the movie!"
"Jun 12, 2015",NEUTRAL,Top notch action with the greatest superhero throw down ever with emotions completely driving the story and the consequences of the past 12 movies all leading into this. And then there was Spiderman and black panther who were phenomenal and I loved them in this movie. Thank you marvel!!!
"Jun 11, 2015",NEUTRAL,It looks like a great movie if I could see the trailer
"Jun 11, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Still can't stop smiling after seeing this movie.  Everything Batman v Superman tried to do and got wrong, this movie got right.  Can't remember a time when I felt so much conflict as a viewer for the character on screen.  The bar continues to be raised.  Job well done."
"Jun 11, 2015",NEUTRAL,With Dennis Macquarrie... it's OK...but the near ending is better
"Jun 11, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Really, really good. With some serious flaws at pivotal moments. As a moviegoer less familiar with the comic book, the movie falls way short of making it clear what the motivation is behind Ant-Man, Hawkeye and even Spider-Man to join the fray. It is really weak. Plus the most compelling story in the movie (the one between Zemo and Bucky) is totally underplayed and would have made the Ironman vs Cap 'Murica plotline so much more believable and heartbreaking. But the action is great - the best of any Marvel movie. Black Panther is terrific. So are the Spider-Man scenes."
"Jun 10, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Was an amazing movie, I liked how spiderman and black panther was played and over all was awesome. The story line was good I liked how they changed it from the comic books."
"Jun 10, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Fantastic, edge of your seat action that is a joy to watch. Weak villain and his subplot but overall very good and satisfying. Perfect spiderman"
"Jun 10, 2015",NEUTRAL,Awesome movie!! Well worth seeing in the theater!!
"Jun 9, 2015",NEUTRAL,Everything I was hoping for!  Nothing more than what's expected from MCU.
"Jun 9, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Marvel backslid with this convoluted mess. The first 2/3 had me, but the tacked on plot that restarts the conflict between Tony and Steve was nonsensical, and undermined the character of Tony Stark as established in this film series. -Spider-Man and Giant Man are the only reasons I'm giving this three stars instead of two. Utterly disappointed."
"Jun 9, 2015",NEUTRAL,Brilliant...this is definitely how to do it.take note DC. Loved the new characters.
"Jun 7, 2015",NEUTRAL,Best superhero movie ever
"Jun 7, 2015",NEUTRAL,"One of the greatest super hero movie scenes of all time, wrapped in two additional hours of boring shit."
"Jun 7, 2015",NEUTRAL,Marvel can do no wrong. Shut up and take my money!!
"Jun 7, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Everything a superhero movie should be, plus a whole lot more."
"Jun 7, 2015",NEUTRAL,Might be the best MCU movie to date.
"Jun 7, 2015",NEUTRAL,great movie can't wait to see the new spiderman movies this new guy is funny
"Jun 6, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War was good! Even REALLY good. But it is far from great. The new Spider-Man (not being a huge Spider-Man fan myself) and seeing a live action the Black Panther are the best parts. I'm borderline between a 3 and a 4 of 5, so I'll round up.

(5: Loved It, 4: Really Liked It, 3: Liked It, 2: Didn't Like It, and 1: Hated It.)"
"Jun 6, 2015",NEUTRAL,Amazing movie! Certainly one of the best thus far coming from the MCU.
"Jun 6, 2015",NEUTRAL,Incredibly Awesome. Smart. Funny. Unbelievably Action Packed. Black Panther is The Shit. Spider-Man was Spectacular. Fucking Amazing. 9.5/10
"Jun 6, 2015",NEUTRAL,I thought it was well done and the story line was good......I think they are taking Stark and Rogers to the extremes in their characters and I thought BvS was better.....just saying
"Jun 6, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Whereas a great director in Sam Raimi couldn't balance 3-5 character arcs in Spiderman 3, ""Captain America: Civil War"" successfully balances 7-11 stories: Iron Man, Captain America, Black Panther, Spiderman, The Vision, Scarlet Witch, and The Winter Soldier, and to lesser degrees, Black Widow, Rhyno, Hawkeye and Ant-Man. And it is probably the best character development in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, especially when it comes to newbie Black Panther, only rivaled by ""Captain America: The First Avenger."" But it's even better than that movie in other departments, namely the action setpieces: Two of the main three spectacles stand out in the MCU, and indeed, all of comic films, in that they no longer feels like video game levels. They feel like legitimate conflicts, where each character has their own emotional motivation, and their thoughts and feelings progress throughout the fighting. Most important, Civil War brings what is quite possibly the debate of 21st century American politics - freedom vs. security - in a very intelligent two-sided discussion, bringing valid arguments of both sides in manners typically story-driven, minimizing the necessary amount of dialogue that would contribute to the argument. The movie flies through its impressively short run-time, outside of the ending. Finally, the plot twist - holy crap. Go see Civil War. It is the first movie in this shared universe series to earn its high tomatometer rating."
"Jun 6, 2015",NEUTRAL,this movie may have just created the next great step into the superhero movie genre the way it tagged multiple superhero movies into one mind-blowing its a push and pull even harder at your thoughts type of movie my god is this a absolute 5/5
"Jun 6, 2015",NEUTRAL,One of the best Marvel movies if not one of the best superhero movies ever made. With a great cast that is also visually stunning and great twists and an amazing story arch. Captain America: Civil War is one of the best movies I've seen this year.
"Jun 5, 2015",NEUTRAL,maybe not as incredible as everyone is making it out to be but an absolutely awesome fight scene maybe the best one in a marvel movie but the movie is exciting fun dramatic and every character gets a cool moment super fun and sad at moments but has a lot of dull moments the villain is boring and ultimately the climax of the movie can be anti climactic
"Jun 5, 2015",NEUTRAL,One of the all time great films of our time
"Jun 5, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Actually enjoyed it, was pleasantly surprised by turn of story"
"Jun 5, 2015",NEUTRAL,I've waited a year to see this movie and I'll say I it was worth the wait great flim
"Jun 5, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Marvel has done it again, great movie. It was very emotional and had a lot of excellent actions."
"Jun 4, 2015",NEUTRAL,Even better then the winter soldier.
"Jun 4, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Fantastic from start to finish, the fight scenes were great.  Ant man and the new Spider man were excellent. A Must See. If you have no plans today Go See It trust me you will be happy that you did"
"Jun 4, 2015",NEUTRAL,Excellent movie! A lot of action that has you at the edge of your seat. It was a very well put together movie.
"Jun 4, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Action packed, amazing, funny, Spider-Man & Black Panther were awesome and this is the best marvel movie since The Avengers."
"Jun 3, 2015",NEUTRAL,Absolutely the best yet. Total action!
"Jun 3, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Great film, has the best superhero fighting scene to date. Both Spider-man and Black Panther are great addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. 8/10"
"Jun 2, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Solid, ensemble cast movie. I want to give it 4.5, but there were many things it did wrong."
"Jun 2, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Civil War offers are much more emotionally powerful film than any installment in the MCU and you can't help but care for these characters. It also allows the audience to develop their own opinion on who is right or wrong without forcing you either way. You understand where every single character is coming from. Their are no mindless evil plots to destroy the world or cliche power-hunger evil villains. That was what Civil War really did well and I loved that aspect. My problems were with the action sequences. Those scenes themselves were extremely shaky and hard to follow, especially with the insane stunts that were going on. But mostly I didn't like how frequent they were. This movie couldn't wait to blow stuff up when I cared infinitely more about the story and characters. It was actually becoming frustrating. Only 2 or 3 action scenes were necessary when they had almost triple that."
"Jun 2, 2015",NEUTRAL,"In my humble opinion, this film absolutely lived up to the hype. It blended the story and the action together spectacularly with just enough humor spaced throughout to avoid the film feeling over saturated of it. The movie was well paced with action from start to finish, keeping the viewer wondering what would come next. Both sides are clearly defined but in a way so the viewer can empathize with either of them. As with any war, each side takes significant losses and this civil war is no different. While there are victories on both sides, they are not without their casualties which reminds us that conflict of any kind comes with its costs. I look forward to seeing the future of the franchise and the ramifications of this movie in films to come."
"Jun 2, 2015",NEUTRAL,"I thought I'd be falling asleep in my recliner chair, late night on a week day, but that was not the case. Time flew by. Tons of action. Great character integration. Highly recommend. My 14 year old son loved it too!"
"Jun 2, 2015",NEUTRAL,"solid Marvel installment with some good doses of humor and action. the story was interesting but a bit convoluted, and am tired of the Bucky focus. new characters were really good, and looking forward to their next installments"
"Jun 1, 2015",NEUTRAL,Quite possibly Marvel's best movie to date!! Everything about this movie worked and worked great!! The new editions of Black Panther and Spider-Man were fantastic!! Arguably the best on screen portrayal of Spider-Man so far. After seeing this I'm super excited to see solo Black Panther and Spider-Man films! As always Cap gives this movie a lot of heart but Downey Jr. also brings a lot to it this time around. Paul Rudd was great again as Ant-Man and Paul Bettany brings great human qualities to Vision. I'm very excited to see how these events will shape the MCU going forward. I highly recommend this movie!! Check it out.
"Jun 1, 2015",NEUTRAL,Great movie!!!! Loved it!!!
"Jun 1, 2015",NEUTRAL,Good movie - not the best Marvel movie ever but it was decent - 4 out of 5 for me - not better than BVS Lol
"Jun 1, 2015",NEUTRAL,"I just got to watch an advanced screening of Captain America: Civil War. And before you continue you should know there will be no spoilers. Just general thoughts about this film. 
Okay. Let's begin shall we? 
So before the movie even started... 
Ready...
Wait for it...
Chris Evans and Sebastian Stan who play THE two MAIN characters in Civil War, Captain America and Bucky Barnes show up to the theater to welcome us and yeah did I mention life changing?
... On to the movie ...
The movie starts and within the first 15 minutes I already want to rewatch everything I've already seen. They throw you into a political war film and you feel it. Heat from both sides. You understand why they are fighting. And you never quite know who to root for because they are both right. From start to finish this movie is a heart wrencher and when I say that I mean parts of the film literally had my heart beating 110 mph. 
Not to mention the fight/action scenes in this movie ARE the best action scenes in any super hero movie. If not the best of all time. (I know what you're thinking ""all time, whatever"" but just wait. You'll understand). From the introduction of Black panther and Antman into this family of heros. To the best Spider-Man we have ever seen on the big screen. This movie will have you locked in for the whole two hours and thirty one minutes. And leave you asking where did the time go. 
So there you have it. Captain America Civil War.
If you were wondering what was bad well..
...
Nothing. 
It joins the 5/5 club. Possibly topping the avengers and becoming the best super hero movie of all time. Possibly. I'll let you know after my 15th watch."
"Jun 1, 2015",NEUTRAL,"There's only one word...
Cap-tastic!
(and Spidey is ok!)"
"Jun 1, 2015",NEUTRAL,Batman v superman can't hold civil war's D**k.   civil war Amazing!!!
"May 31, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Arguably the best Marvel Cinematic Universe movie to date. If you're a fan of these movies, you will really enjoy it. Highly recommended."
"May 31, 2015",NEUTRAL,"I loved the fight between the two teams at the airport, that was brilliantly done, every character was great there. I found myself switching from Team Cap to Team Stark as the film went on, which surprised me. I wouldn't say this is the best MCU film so far, though - probably top 5, maybe top 3, but still not as good as Avengers Assemble or Guardians!"
"May 27, 2015",NEUTRAL,Great version of Civil War. Russo brothers have succeeded.
"May 27, 2015",NEUTRAL,That's how a super hero conflict movie should be made
"May 27, 2015",NEUTRAL,"nice job!

very well done. like how they tied in that bucky was the one responsible for Tony's parents death."
"May 27, 2015",NEUTRAL,Amazing!!!!!! Loved it!!!
"May 27, 2015",NEUTRAL,Another Great movie by Marvel Studios!
"May 26, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Just simply amazing!... Perf ft for what you're looking for in a movie, not just a super hero movie, a great time. Fun, action, adventure... A twist, a few surprises! And just great characters and fights! Can't wait to see where they go next."
"May 26, 2015",NEUTRAL,another classic from the house of marvel
"May 25, 2015",NEUTRAL,What an incredible movie! The story was awesome and the characters were great! This was the best story line of the MCU! This movie is gonna make some money!
"May 25, 2015",NEUTRAL,"There's a lot to be said about this movie, but bottom line is: it is absolutely fantastic. After being disappointed with a recent superhero duel (Dawn of Justice) I was relieved to see a fight that actually had meaning to it and reasons doing so. The villain Zemo was a little weak, but the appearance of Spider-Man made up for it as he's welcomed into the Marvel Cinematic Universe in grand fashion. Tom Holland practically steals the show and I can't wait to more of his interpretation of Spider-Man in Homecoming."
"May 25, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Spoiler alert


This film was so crap, people were queuing up outside the cinema for fertiliser. Full review to come when I recover."
"May 25, 2015",NEUTRAL,It truly was Iron Man 4. Great cast of characters. Great locations & a Great story background for the main villian
"May 25, 2015",NEUTRAL,I think it's safe to say the Russo Brothers are a force to be reckoned with. What a complete movie. For the life of me I don't understand how you can have so many complex characters to deal with in just one movie and nail it like this. This makes batman vs superman look like a made for TV movie. By far the best marvel film ever made.
"May 25, 2015",NEUTRAL,Superhero movies don't get better than this! Pure Comic Book Gold! Another slam dunk by Marvel.
"May 25, 2015",NEUTRAL,It was really good I can't wait for the next movie
"May 25, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Emotionally loaded, heart-pumping action, and characters you can get behind. Go see this in IMAX."
"May 25, 2015",NEUTRAL,It was decent. Not the best of the Avenger movies. This movie really seemed to be a set-up for Marvel movies to come. A foundation movie. It's difficult to be overly thrilled when a movie has no real villains. Everyone in the film is a hero with differing points of view.
"May 24, 2015",NEUTRAL,"extraordinary, leaves you wanting way more. (in a good way)"
"May 24, 2015",NEUTRAL,"This movie is the best Marvel, Super Hero, Marvel Cinematic Universe film of all in my opinion. The roles for all the characters, the CGI, and the story was just so superb, I just don't know how else to say it. Joe and Anthony Russo had a great direction in this and hope they do just as great in Avengers: Infinity War."
"May 24, 2015",NEUTRAL,Best superhero movie since the last Batman movies. Spider-Man appearance!!!! Can't wait to see the upcoming movies in this series!!!!
"May 24, 2015",NEUTRAL,very very cool loved what they did wth spider man
"May 24, 2015",NEUTRAL,Epic adventure continues
"May 23, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Good solid movie. Nothing amazing but a good performance from the cast with a good written story. 

The movie presents two compelling opposing views which sets the stage for our heroes. The story is held together throughout the movie with the personal stories and issues of both Captain America and Iron Man. From beginning to end. It is a good story for our time considering it touches on issues of security vs personal freedom. 

I recommend this film for any comic fan and those wanting to get a good story."
"May 23, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Words can't even describe. Wow. I could write an essay about this flawless movie, but I'm just gonna sit back and let it sink in. Best MCU, no superhero, no movie (possibly) ever imo."
"May 23, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Great movie; Great cast; would like to see more of the web-slinger in future ""Avengers"" movies. Enjoyed it from the beginning all the way to the end. Based on this movie, I kind of already know how the next Avengers movie (expected to be released in 2018) is going to play out. Only negative is that it seemed more like the ""Avengers"" and not a Captain America movie. 4.5/5"
"May 23, 2015",NEUTRAL,If I could I would give this movie more than five stars. Tom Holland plays a way better Spider-Man than Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield did.
"May 23, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Good movie. I feel like Spider-Man may have been portrayed a little to young and starstruck. Good mix of action, drama and comedy otherwise."
"May 23, 2015",NEUTRAL,A overall awesome movie very balanced and Spidey was amazing looking forward to Spider-Man Homecoming. A must see.
"May 23, 2015",NEUTRAL,"another near flawless masterpiece of casting, storyline and special Affects... the juggernaut (Marvel) Continues to dominate the industry... here's a suggestion for movie makers... if your film opens the same weekend as a Marvel flix .... change the opening date."
"May 22, 2015",NEUTRAL,Best marvel movie so far!
"May 22, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Good, not my favorite. Perfectly fine within series. Would definitely watch again, but not sure it's a need to own for me."
"May 22, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Captain America Civil War 2016

This was such a good movie. This was the 2nd Avengers movie we should have have had instead of Age of Ultron. this is the redemption Avengers film after seeing Age of Ultron. This is a film where everyone will find something to like. 

This is probably this best Captain America film because this film helped to develop Characters the most of Captain America as well as the surrounding characters. This movie also went into directions you would never suspect it to go. 

It was great seeing the development and interaction of characters you were not exactly sure which direction they would go and to see this in this film is what we all want to see. 

This film also goes into the loss factor and 

I loved seeing Ant-Man and had the special surprise of turning gigantic.

I surprised by how Rhodes and how Vision got involved. 

I was interested in how they developed Vision. 

I loved the actor who played Spider-Man in this film. He had some great lines in this movie. I loved his introduction with Tony Stark. I was not sure about it because I was skeptical about the look of the costume looking too much like the 1960's version 

I loved the early tech in Peter Parker's room to show what kind character he is. 

This film just has me much more excited to see what we see next in the super hero films. 

This film film travels all over the world and I was not expecting that. This film actually travels to more parts of the world than seen in any of the Super Hero films including Age of Ultron. But this film does a Great job of not spending too much or too little amount of time in each location. 

I was not expecting the twist of Black Panther's costume being made out of the same material as Captain America's shield. 

This film does fail to answer where is Thor, Hulk, or Nick Fury are in this film. Nick Fury is not even mentioned in this film. 

After seeing this film I just want to see and understand to know more about Black Panthers origins and what drives him. 

I was surprised to hear Bucky was not only brain washed by the Nazi's at Hydra, modern Hydra, and now we learn he was also brainwashed by the U.S.S.R. Communist. This only makes you feel more sympathetic towards Bucky. 

This film did a great job of explaining how Tonk Stark and Steve Rogers could flip on one working for the global government under contract vs. making the decisions for themselves. 

I think this film went further in much more depth as far as relationships and loss. 

The Russo Brothers did a great job on this film on all cylinders making this a great film but also being able to make you invest in why they are on the side they are. This film also felt the most like a Captain America and a Avengers film more so than any other film. 

You felt invested in the conflicts but you also did not want to see anyone get hurt in this film. In this film we see people we care about get hurt such as Iron Man, Bucky Barns, Captain America, Rhodes, the entire Stark family, and Agent Carter. 

What I think is interesting is in this we finally see what exactly happened with the Stark family and who was Tony's mother. I was not counting on seeing that in this film.

This film did a great job showing what Tony Stark looked like younger back in 1991. Amazing. 

I enjoyed this film and it is one I will buy. 

I wish we got a little more from Agent Carter's niece. I did not get enough character development from her in this film. 

 I wish that there was less hand held and quick cuts in the action sequences. It looked sloppy and it was difficult to even follow what all exactly was going on in this film. 

I did love the action sequences in this film and how each sequence in this film you were very much character and emotionally invested in the scene. 

I loved the tunnel chase. It was Awesome. I also enjoyed the final fight between Tony, Bucky, and Steve Rogers.  
I was not exactly sure how that was going to be pulled off in this film as far as how come they would go at each others throats but this film did it well. 
It may be possible to say this battle may even be equal to the final conflict between Luke and Vader in Empire Strikes Back. 

Every conflict in this film is invested at the heart. 

I think it is interesting how it is Black Panther at the end of the day who is the one able to clearly see how to deal with the bad guy not Captain America or Iron Man. An interesting twist I did not foresee. 

I love the two end credit sequences. 

I loved how Spider-Man is the one who makes the remarks about the At-At's in the Empire Strikes Back. 

What I think this film did a great job at concerning the timing and introduction of each character. This film gave each charter a good introduction and they were not all introduced at once but were given their due. They appear in the film where you are super excited when they finally do appear in this film. 

This film does take an interesting twist making Aunt May young rather than old. Also the home looks different and more comforting than seen in previous films. 

This film I felt like this film was much better than Age of Ultron. However I think this film needed more work on the motivations to the villain. It was mentioned but never gone into enough in emotional depth. 

I think that this film got more out of Bucky and Steve Rogers characters background and past than had been done and told before in previous films which helped me to better invest in the characters more.

I think it was interesting how we thought about how many civilians do super heroes kill or harm while trying to protect the greater whole. 

This film also got me back to being invested into Rhodes character once again after seeing the first Iron Man film. Honestly I have not really been invested in the character of Rhodes at all since the actor change. This film brought back the heart of Tony Starks relationship once again particularly after seeing what Vision does. 

I think what I think this film was missing is seeing more switching within the film of sides. I was expecting more switches within the film of Hawkeye, Scarlett Witch, Vision, Rhodes, Ant-Man, Spider-Man, Black Panther, Captain America, and Iron Man. Like I was expecting that within the film all of these characters would continually switch sides based upon perspective. 

I think that this film takes an interesting choice when it comes to the the musical score. This film does not incorporate any of the established themes from the previous films but instead goes more towards following the emotional rout."
"May 22, 2015",NEUTRAL,Overall the best marvel movie yet but I feel it had a lackluster main fight and a few letdowns.
"May 22, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Excellent!! I really enjoyed it, although I did feel that they played certain elements a little safe."
"May 22, 2015",NEUTRAL,a very epic awesome movie!! better than the winter soldier for sure!! worth seeing in the theaters 2X!!!
"May 22, 2015",NEUTRAL,"I give this movie 5 stars, but really the title of this was an upset, Marvel and the Russo bros. tried to give  us an adaptation of the comic with the same name, but instead feels like a direct sequel of the winter soldier, that was my only concern, out of that the movie is amazing, it have too much characters but never felt ovestuffed, all the characters shine in this one being the more surprising the new characters of the MCU, The Russo gave us an excellent drama with excellent action in this one, I can't wait what Marvel have in stuff for the next few years."
"May 22, 2015",NEUTRAL,loved it even though there were inaccuracies that were in the comics but not in the movie or things that were in the movie but not in the comics. all in all its an epic movie.
"May 21, 2015",NEUTRAL,best marvel movie I've seen so far. everyone is awesome and spiderman steals the movie
"May 21, 2015",NEUTRAL,could of did better with the villain.
"May 21, 2015",NEUTRAL,Best movie ever made!!!!! :) #TeamCapistherightchoicetomake
"May 21, 2015",NEUTRAL,It's off the chart. Worth watching over and over again.
"May 21, 2015",NEUTRAL,A big let down after the last one. Don't think I get the super hero v super hero genre!
"May 21, 2015",NEUTRAL,Absolutely amazing and one of the best films I've ever seen
"May 21, 2015",NEUTRAL,Exactly what a superhero movie should be!
"May 20, 2015",NEUTRAL,"For the most part this was fun, but there are some really dull moments. Winter Soldier is better, but this beats out Age of Ultron."
"May 20, 2015",NEUTRAL,Impressive. Shocking. Great cast. On point.
"May 20, 2015",NEUTRAL,Non-stop action and the pacing was really good.  Cool to see new characters like Black Panther and Spider-man in the Marvel U
"May 20, 2015",NEUTRAL,Standard Marvel greatness. Can't wait for more.
"May 20, 2015",NEUTRAL,Strong work by the leads. Best integration of new characters Black Panther and Spider-Man ever.
"May 19, 2015",NEUTRAL,Captain America Civil War Was Everything I Wanted In A Marvel Movie.
"May 19, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Um can you say Black Panther??!! The tie-in towards the final sequence was perf.  However, with all the cameos and add-ons seemed more like an Avengers 3 than a Captain America movie?  Kind of sad Steve can't even be the star of his own film."
"May 19, 2015",NEUTRAL,I'm a dork and biased but I just loved how almost everyone was in the movie and how it introduced new characters.
"May 19, 2015",NEUTRAL,"starts out kind of slow, but the movie was mostly about iron man and captain American and the winter soldier 
overall it was not a bad movie"
"May 18, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Much better than I anticipated, since I wasn't trilled about seeing infighting between my two favorite Marvel heroes. They did a great job with the build up for seeing why they were on opposite sides, and kept this long movie moving along.

The one thing I disliked was how additional Marvel characters somewhat abruptly came in and out at times. Generally it made sense, but would think slightly more build up within this long adventure. 

Solid Marvel movie, though."
"May 18, 2015",NEUTRAL,Can not express in words how amazing this movie is!
"May 18, 2015",NEUTRAL,one of the best marvel movies
"May 18, 2015",NEUTRAL,Loved this movie! Great action and battles. The tension between Rogers and Stark had been brewing for years. Spider-Man and Ant-Man were a pleasant and funny surprise.
"May 18, 2015",NEUTRAL,Loved it. Best Marvel movie yet.
"May 18, 2015",NEUTRAL,This one is up there with Guardians & The Avengers (original)...not as good as those but better than The Winter Soldier.
"May 18, 2015",NEUTRAL,Almost Avengers 2.5.
"May 18, 2015",NEUTRAL,A! Best Damn Movie of the year no question..........
"May 10, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Battle scenes were epic
Black Panther is my fav new superhero"
"May 10, 2015",NEUTRAL,THE MOVIE WAS MIND BLOWING AMAZING
"May 10, 2015",NEUTRAL,"It's good, but Captain America: Civil War suffers from being more of a promotional advertisement than a stand alone Marvel film."
"May 10, 2015",NEUTRAL,One of the best films in the MCU so far.
"May 10, 2015",NEUTRAL,My brother in-law and i got tickets for the night befor it comes out so excited to see it
"May 10, 2015",NEUTRAL,2nd place ain't bad.
"May 10, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Well yet again Marvel up the game on the comic - movie franchise and show DC how a multi character film can work (unlike Batman v Superman did). We are finally introduced to Black Panther and Spiderman (not entirely sure why we needed a new actor/reboot), the film is wall to wall action and is well worth anyone's hard earned money and time flys by without an ounce of boredom. By the way I'm team Captain America. â~º"
"May 9, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Civil War tackles some pretty heavy issues while still being a fun action romp. Despite the film having practically every Avenger in it, it actually manages to not feel bloated and unnecessary (something  Age of Ultron couldn't quite get a hold on). Tom Holland makes an outstanding Spider-Man, and I can't wait to see what else he's got up his webshooters. Chadwick Boseman also makes a great debut as Black Panther. With so many characters to keep track of, and so many storylines, the MCU is becoming almost to grandiose for some filmmakers to handle, but the Russos (also directed The Winter Soldier) have now made two of the best MCU films to date, and I am so happy they are charge of the next Avengers film, because they are 2 for 2."
"May 9, 2015",NEUTRAL,Fabulous. Want to see it again.
"May 9, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Great Marvel movie, can't wait till the next"
"May 9, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Very disappointed with this one. Thanks to the trailer, I knew all the big shocks and reveals and is pretty much seen the fight sequences that define the movie. The only part then worthy of watching was the post credit sequences. It's a shame, as going in blind would have made this movie great. But the trailers Marvel released were too much footage and not enough tease. Shame."
"May 9, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Much the way Wonder Woman's benevolent presence centers Batman v Superman, it's the Gee Whiz entrance of Marvel's recaptured (from Sony) Spiderman which lops a good bit of heaviness off of Civil War. He's helped, in part, by the arrival of Ant Man, who's lost none of the sardonic charm from his own run. 

Civil War is top middle and bottom heavy with these cameos and guest shots, and it would be easy to bill this Avengers 3 or some new all hero configuration; yet, oddly enough, the film rises and falls in Evans and his stalwart portrayal of Cap, all good intentions and sturdy compass. Like BvS, Marvel too has come to ask about the collateral damage of superhero and here as there, it falls to the American dreamiest of the characters to stand up for the price of heroics.  Marvel's strength lies in the morally ambiguous in betweens, here represented by the enduring of bond of Steve and Bucky, the Winter Soldier, whose dark history complicates all the other relationships in this story, chiefly between the Captain and iron Man.  

If Downey has seemed a bit weary of these enterprises lately, Civil War turns that weariness into its own mini opera, a Lear surveying the hellish landscape and regretting the path to victory. The conflicts set up here tear at the foundations of the Marvel universe. And that, really, speaks to why the comic book franchises have shown more staying power than many would have guessed - few big entertainments, especially with this many installments, have nearly as much at stake.

That said, more than the other parts of the MCU, Captain America has produced a string of top flight, well made stories that both serve the greater narrative and stand well in their own.  In the longer run, it's whether the others rise to meet them, or muddle along that may be the real test of how this comic world lives or dies on film."
"May 9, 2015",NEUTRAL,Grrrrreeaaatttt!!!!!!
"May 9, 2015",NEUTRAL,Interesting storyline. well acted and directed
"May 9, 2015",NEUTRAL,"The Russo Brothers show us once again how amazing the MCU can be and how Captain America is actually an interesting character. Whenever Cap feuds with Iron Man and an entire scene dedicated to the avengers fighting steal the show easily with great characters like Black Panther, Spider-Man, and a pretty solid villain."
"May 9, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Civil War is just deeper than previous colourful marvel movies ,Russo brothers know how tell a story that encase so many characters without underdevelop any of them expecially new entries :Spider -man,Ant-man and black panther among all."
"May 8, 2015",NEUTRAL,"An overall solid movie, but the more I think about it, the more and more it kind of ticks me off. The movie wasn't even about the Accords, it was about Bucky, and neither side acted like heroes. At least the airport fight was cool."
"May 8, 2015",NEUTRAL,Awesome! Can't think of any other word or words other then awesome.
"May 8, 2015",NEUTRAL,This was the best marvel movie because it was fun and entertaining to watch!!!
"May 8, 2015",NEUTRAL,Wow this movie is so epic action packed with some comedy. I love this movie
"May 8, 2015",NEUTRAL,Hits every mark that BvS missed. Great movie in all aspects and without question the best superhero movie of all time.
"May 8, 2015",NEUTRAL,Marvel really nailed it.  This is easily one.of Marvel's best movies. Spider-Man was great but Black Panther was simply INCREDIBLE  !!!!!!! I'll definitely be seeing this multiple times.
"May 8, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Too much good they don't screw up, as opposed to Age of Ultron..."
"May 8, 2015",NEUTRAL,One of the best movies I have seen in a while. Simply stated.
"May 8, 2015",NEUTRAL,Campy Marvel has arrived. Worst superhero movie since Daredevil. Ya know there is a limit on humor in a action flick and this surpassed it to stupidity.
"May 8, 2015",NEUTRAL,The role of the BlackPanther was awesome! He needs his own movie and animated cartoon! I will go see it again!
"May 7, 2015",NEUTRAL,I highly recommend for any Marvel fan. It was great!
"May 7, 2015",NEUTRAL,"While it may not be up to the standard of The Winter Soldier, Civil War none the less proves once again that it is possible to make a good film out of the superhero genre instead of just churning out popcorn entertainment. Civil War is sharp, smart, in addition to being fun, managing to tackle the issue of government regulation of private citizens with intelligence. It's easy to overlook the 180 in personality from Tony Stark and the bloated cast of characters as pretty much the entire Marvel universe is given screen time. The writers and filmmakers some how manage to make it all balance out, with Chadwick Bosman making a strong case for his upcoming Black Panther film and Tom Holland almost making a case for not automatically writing off our 3rd Spiderman film in the last decade. Even so, Civil War would have greatly benefited from editing out at least half of the character and allowing those left a chance to breathe and you know, have more than a couple lines and an actual story arc. But despite this major issue, Marvel has once again managed to elevate Captain America from simple pro-US propaganda to give us a thinking blockbuster."
"May 7, 2015",NEUTRAL,"This movie is fantastic, and really well written. Marvel knows how to introduce new characters properly, have multiple heroes in a movies and not take away from the story line."
"May 7, 2015",NEUTRAL,TrÃ¨s bon. Meme la venue de Spider Man est rafraichisante et donne un autre soufle au film.
"May 7, 2015",NEUTRAL,Best Marvel Movie Ever!!!!
"May 7, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Was excited about the movie until the released that awful spider man look. Too cartoony, doesn't match at all the feel the other character display. Who ever thought of that appearance should never EVER have any input on any other movies. Honestly that costume beep.....hope marvel changes that before movie release. Else they just lost a ticked sale , imagine I'm not the only one."
"May 6, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Good movie, GREAT Action sequence. Awesome storyline and character building. The only flaw is the script, lots of miss emotion moments that could of been fixed with a simple sentence or two. Other than that. Awesomeness!"
"May 6, 2015",NEUTRAL,"I have to hand it to marvel they really nailed it with this one. The action, storyline, drama and good ole surprise was really good. Ole Cap and Iron Man went to war with the help of some friends. The only problem that rubbed me the wrong way was the spidermonkeyboy and they didn't bring back the original McCoy. All in all...job well done with that one glaring exception. Go check it out. #KIRRAPPROVED #CIVILWAR"

"May 6, 2015",NEUTRAL,The greatest superhero film to date. Perfect in every way.
"May 6, 2015",NEUTRAL,Loosely based on the comic material for new style new themes surprising character development and a hilarious spiderman
"May 6, 2015",NEUTRAL,I watch this movie yesterday and I loved it. One of the best MCU movies so far for phase 3.
"May 6, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Wow!  Where do I begin on this?  I absolutely loved this movie.  The story, the themes, the characters... I could go on for ages.  Potential spoiler ahead, so beware...  This film introduces Black Panther and Spider-Man to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and let me tell you they did it beautifully.  Spidey/Peter Parker is perfect.  If you're familiar with him in the comics I'm sure you'll see exactly what I mean.  Thank heaven Marvel got the rights to him back.  The action sequences are even more spectacular than ever before (Black Widow -- greatest female action character of all time, just sayin').  If I wrote about everything that was great in this film I'd be typing for another few hours, so I'll end this by simply saying, ""Incredible.""  Can't wait to own the Blu-ray."
"May 6, 2015",NEUTRAL,"It was okay, good effects the script seemed hurried at the end. Overall enjoyable movie, just a step down from Singer's movies."
"May 6, 2015",NEUTRAL,"A film split into three very distinct sections; Political Thriller, Comedy, Horror.  The political thriller first 90 minutes sets up the concept and allegiances, the comedy brings more jokes in half an hour, which all land hard, than most comedies manage in 2 hours, then the horror of seeing characters you've come to love fighting because of a differing opinion.

It may be a little disjointed, but I can't deny it has everything you want from a film."

"May 5, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Fun, action packed, and thrilling! Civil War boasts incredible action sequences/choreography, an outstanding balance with its hefty amount of heroes/characters, and explores deep themes of friendship, family, and vengeance all while remaining a funny & entertaining blast from beginning to end!"
"May 5, 2015",NEUTRAL,good action great story.
"May 5, 2015",NEUTRAL,"I like the movie a lot and I enjoy superhero movies. But there is no way Captain America: Civil War is that much better than BatmanvSuperman in ratings. Don't know if one should be higher or one should be lower. All kinds of weird....never mind, just enjoy the movie. Spider-Man was best parts."
"May 5, 2015",NEUTRAL,Entertaining but doesn't move the story much at all.
"May 5, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Great shock scenes but why are the GOOD GUYS trying to kill their ""friends""?"
"May 5, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Very good film, but I still think Winter Solider was better. You would think in a Captain America film you'd be rooting for Cap, but I have to say I was team Iron Man all the way. While I appreciated Cap's loyalty, I just feel he wasn't seeing the bigger picture. I guess that's why I feel the Winter Solider film was better; I want to cheer for Captain America, I just couldn't in this film. Don't get me wrong the film is really good, and better than Batman V Superman (I really hate admitting that btw).

Though a tad slow in the beginning, the build up to the main fight and ending fight was worth the wait. Standouts for me were Ant-Man (Rudd is just hilarious), the new Spider-Man (so looking forward to Homecoming), and the Black Panther (who was just awesome). I also really liked the main villain (Zemo) too; it was a nice change to see a manipulator instead of just maniac wanting take over the world.

It seems like Marvel can't do no wrong. Highly recommend this flick."
"May 5, 2015",NEUTRAL,Most incredible thing I've watched in a long time!
"May 5, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Once again, Marvel shows that you can mix philosophy, action, drama and comedy to create a film of substance.  While a little disappointing in places due to a need to build up future galaxies in the MC Universe, Captain America gets a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy.  Whether you believe that you have to protect your friends at any cost or that actions have consequences you either learn to live with or weigh you down, Civil War has a little bit of everything.  And a villain who actually has a lot of meat instead of being just window dressing."
"May 4, 2015",NEUTRAL,"At first I thought it was vacuous and pointless.  Boy I was wrong, putting Captain America against Iron Man with new characters is the most invigorating thing marvel has done to date and may be their most rewarding. Whilst it has the Captain America name slapped on the front it's like a paradoxical avengers film. Seeing other heroes like Ant-Man, Spider-Man, and Black Panther in here is refreshing and you just wish they could have gotten more screen time. It gave Spider-Man and Black Panther the accentuation they need for their upcoming standalone films. All-in-all Captain America: Civil War was a great financial and lionized success."

Movie Review: Captain America: Civil War
Date Viewed: May 6 2016
Directed By Anthony Russo and Joe Russo (You, Me and Dupree and Captain America: The Winter Soldier)
Screenplay By Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, Based on the Marvel Comics created by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby
Starring: Chris Evans, Robert Downey, Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony
Mackie, Jeremy Renner, Don Cheadle, Paul Bettany, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Rudd, Elizabeth Olsen, William Hurt, Tom Holland, Emily VanCamp, Marisa Tomei, Frank Grillo and Daniel Bruhl.

""Captain America: Civil War"" is an energizing start to the summer movie season. Not only does it feature great action sequences, it also wants to acknowledge that thousands of people died all for the sake of creating blockbuster entertainments. A morally difficult choice fractures the Avengers into two opposing teams, one led by Steve Rogers, a.k.a. Captain America and one led by Tony Stark, a.k.a. Iron Man. Even though this is another Captain America installment, it feels like another ""Avengers"" movie if you look at the ensemble cast. ""Civil War"" also marks the exciting debuts of two new superheroes, Chadwick Boseman as the Black Panther and Tom Holland as the new Spider-Man.
Both will have their own feature films in the near future.

After the disappointing smackdown between Batman and Superman, the showdown between Captain America and Iron Man is worth seeing because ""Civil War"" tells a compelling story and gives the many characters in this movie room to develop.
One year after the Avengers defeated Ultron, the superhero team gets involved with another international incident which results in extensive collateral damage. The latest incident involving the Avengers puts the U.S. government under pressure to find a political solution, that's where former general and now Secretary of State Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (William Hurt, reprising his role from ""The Incredible Hulk"") comes in.

He comes to Avengers headquarters to inform that the U.N. is preparing to pass legislation known as the Sokovia Accords, this will give governments from around the world the right to oversee and control the Avengers. This issue heavily divides the Avengers, while Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) still believes his own judgment in doing the right thing, Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) surprisingly supports the legislation because he feels responsible for creating Ultron and for the destruction of Sokovia.

Suddenly, a bomb explodes at a U.N. conference in Vienna killing King T'Chaka of Wakanda, the man who was overseeing the Sokovia Accords. Security footage reveals that the Winter Soldier, a.k.a. Steve Rogers' former friend Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) was responsible for the attack and T'Chaka's son, T'Challa, a.k.a. Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) vows to take him down. With his friend now on the run, Captain America has to make a difficult choice, turn over Bucky to the authorities or help him in eluding capture.

While Bucky returns to his normal self, he is now a internationally wanted man and he and Steve must go to a Siberian Hydra facility where more brainwashed Winter Soldiers like him are being kept in large cryogenic stasis.
That's the place where they'll find Helmut Zemo (Daniel Bruhl), a former Sokovian colonel now turned terrorist who is obsessed with tearing the Avengers apart because his family were among those killed in the destruction of Sokovia. Unwilling to wait for authorization to go after Zemo, Captain America goes rogue by recruiting his team, Bucky Barnes, Sam Wilson, a.k.a. The Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Wanda Maximoff, a.k.a. Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), Clint Barton, a.k.a. Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Scott Lang, a.k.a. Ant-Man (Paul Rudd). To stop Captain America from making a bad situation to an even worse one, Stark assembles his team as well by recruiting James Rhodes, a.k.a. War Machine (Don Cheadle), Black Panther, Natasha Romanoff, a.k.a. Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), The Vision (Paul Bettany) and Peter Parker, a.k.a. Spider-Man (Tom Holland).

By having thought-provoking themes such as accountably for so much destruction and many innocent lives lost, ""Captain America: Civil War"" is the most mature installment yet in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It may lag behind ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" in terms of being overstuffed and overlong but nevertheless it's still an entertainingly smart summer blockbuster. Steve Rogers and Tony Stark are at the heart of this story because their friendship and teamwork helps the Avengers stay united, if they are divided the team gets crippled. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo (who both did ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"") do a complex job of holding a great story and compelling drama together while having a dozen comic book superheroes in the same movie.

Chadwick Boseman who in the past few years has played Jackie Robinson and James Brown tremendously well on the big screen is just outstanding as the Black Panther. I really enjoyed Tom Holland as the new Spider-Man, his gleeful tone in ""Civil War"" is just perfect for the webslinger. His terrific appearance makes you can't wait for the upcoming ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" which is due out next year.

Action-packed and exciting, ""Captain America: Civil War"" proves that you can make a movie about superheroes fighting each other smashingly well as long as you strike all the right notes."
"May 4, 2015",NEUTRAL,SPIDER-MAN. BLACK PANTHER. CAPTAIN AMERICA. IRON MAN. ALL IN ONE MOVIE. IT WAS BEAUTIFUL. May just be the best Marvel movie ever made. To the Infinity War we go!
"May 4, 2015",NEUTRAL,"It was so well done, but at this point, I'm so lost in the ""Marvel Cinematic Universe"" because there are so many movies that I can't remember most of them. I can't remember what happened in the last Captain America because that was like two Iron Mans and an Avengers ago or something. Anyway, there was a lot of star power. I hate that they're rebooting Spider Man, so that took a whole star off this rating by itself."
"May 4, 2015",NEUTRAL,"I really, really enjoyed this. I know everyone loved the Spider-Man cameo but Ant-Man stole the show for me even though his screen time was limited."
"May 3, 2015",NEUTRAL,MCU keeps topping themselves just when I thought they couldn't
"May 3, 2015",NEUTRAL,"C'est ben bon, mais c'est dur de raconter cette histoire-là sans les X-Men. Il manque quelque chose."
"May 3, 2015",NEUTRAL,I love it antman is so freaking funny!
"May 3, 2015",NEUTRAL,who would have thought the best Marvel movies would be Captain America movies. Awesome new characters and the trailers do a real good job of saving the big surprises unlike B v. S. I can't wait to see it again.
"May 3, 2015",NEUTRAL,Great movie with mixed issues on both ends! Loved the way they introduced new characters yet kept the movie moving forward. Way to go Marvel!! It was like an Avengers 2.5...
"May 3, 2015",NEUTRAL,"I find myself legitimately worried that Marvel won't be able to top themselves after this. Spider-man steals the movie, and Black Panther helps."
"May 3, 2015",NEUTRAL,Best superhero movie. Ever!  Amazing the second time and ready to watch the third time.  Team Cap!
"May 3, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Whether or not this film is great depends largely on if the actions in this movie have any lasting consequences in the MCU. If they do, then wow, what a great movie.

If they don't, then... what an action-packed waste of time and potential. Spidey is awesome, though!"
"May 3, 2015",NEUTRAL,Action-packed movie with a good storyline. Excellent movie. Best movie of the year!

"May 3, 2015",NEUTRAL,Decent flick. I liked Batman v. Superman more.
"May 3, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Best Action Pack Marvel Movie & Captain America 3 Is The Best

First I have to say big thanks to the Russo Brothers for doing a fantastic job directing this film as this film contain lots of very good action pack scenes mostly the fight and chase scenes and bring lots of Marvel's top character's together for one of Marvel big Comic issues.

The Russo Brothers did a great job turning Captain America saga around with the huge success of Captain America 2 the Winter Soldier and now this film big time.

Marvel have once again done a great job with bring Their version of Peter Parker aka Spiderman as he is so funny and half the time is so childish because of his age and just stupid. Kids are going to love Spiderman big time, so please if you have kids go and take them to watch this film big time. In the comics and the animated fox kid show, Peter Parker is very childish and likes Captain America and also likes Tony Stark. I was so wrong and glad as Tom Holland does a great job acting as young Peter Parker and Spiderman.

Also Marvel thank you for selecting Chadwick Boseman to act as Black Panther. He was very good, had some good fight scenes between him and the Winter Solider.

Oh man and how can I forget Paul Rudd who acts as Ant-Man. He was just as funny as he was in the Ant-Man movie. I loved that part where we get to see Ant-Man bigger.

The main reason to watch this film is for the big marvel battle. The battle of freedom between Captain America and Iron Man. Tony Stark VS Steve Rogers. Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. are very great at acting together and bring both these two Marvel character's to life. Having read the graphic civil war novel and watching this film, Marvel have take some elements from the comic and put it in this film. The fight scenes between Captain America and Iron Man was just too good for me and stress as one minute it looks like Captain America is going to win and in the next minute Iron Man is going to win. The amount of emotion thrown into this film pretty much told the story of this film, we can to see a more serious Tony who does not want to do this but has no choice while Captain America does not want to follow the new rules and always goes by his gut feeling.

Do you need to watch all marvel films to understand this film ? Yes and No, you only need to watch Captain America to know who Steve Rogers and Bucky is. In Captain America 2 you find out that shield has gone down and you learn that hydra have always been there and you really do understand why he is against Tony in this film. You should watch Iron Man 1 to know who Tony Stark is and also watch Avengers 1 and 2 to know who the rest of the character's and to fully understand what the government takes action against the Avengers.

I am going to give this film 5/5 Stars as this film was brilliant and awesome."
"May 3, 2015",NEUTRAL,"This might be the greatest action packed event of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, setting up a serious plot and also adding humor to it and having everything extremely well balanced with its huge amount of characters and subplots."
"May 3, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought this was a Captain America movie and NOT an Avengers film. Don't get me wrong, the movie served its purpose for the most part but it just didn't quite feel right to close out a Captain America trilogy if you ask me. So the film Captain America: Civil War is loosely based off of Marvel Comic's major comic book event Civil War from 2007. The plot entails, in the comics, that after the superheroes saved the world so many times they leave behind a lot of collateral damage in their wake. Which catches up to them after the UN government wants every super powered person to register to the government so it puts the general public at ease. An absolutely retarded concept, but Marvel had to come with SOMETHING for a story. This plays out the same way in this movie only this time Cap has to help the Winter Soldier after he is framed for murder. And even though the movie deviated from the original Marvel Comics storyline by a considerable amount, one of which being 10 superheroes fighting each other onscreen as opposed to the 100 characters in the comics which I can understand, I still felt like it could have done better.

The actors in here were fine and did their part when it came to their roles. Especially Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans who do a phenomenal job with their respected parts. But when they brought in Tom Holland's character as Spider-Man, I felt he was a little rushed with him at times even though his wise cracks did make me chuckle. Another disappointing part was that there were next to no super-villains in here AT ALL! Sure they had Crossbones for all of five minutes and Helmut Zemo was nothing more than a whiny little bitch who just hated Cap and the Avengers. I mean in the comics he was a formidable enemy to Cap as he is a highly skilled swordsman and assassin, but in here he is just the complete opposite. Not to mention the actress who plays Sharon Carter is briefly here and there at times but felt more like a throwaway character. It's like Batman v. Superman all over again where the side characters who are a part of that one main superhero (Superman) are either killed off or tossed to the side. That's what I think when they did was do the exact same thing to Cap's side character friends. Not to mention that despite this being a Captain America movie, they focus half the time on pretty much everyone else. Which it does work in here. The overall man-hunt type story was interesting but they really didn't do that much sleuthing like in the previous Cap movie, where in this one some computer tells Cap or Iron Man that ""so & so did it"" and they are all like ""huh."" One of the best parts in this movie is the superhero brawl fest at the German airport where all the commercials kept highlighting that on TV and the twist near the end which makes Iron Man want to kill Winter Soldier even more is awesome as well. But overall, this movie made me feel the same way how I felt about Dawn of Justice. In which it is a two hour and forty minutes worth of okay-ness with a bunch of superheroes coming together for a meet and greet with their fists. Which is why I give this movie a three star rating."
"May 3, 2015",NEUTRAL,Would have been excellent if Captain America died.
"May 3, 2015",NEUTRAL,Pretty amazing!! #teamcap
"May 2, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War was everything both fans of the comic and fans of the movie could have wanted and then some. The story was great, and fresh for the MCU, it was gritty, the fight scenes were beautiful, the humor never missed a mark, the pacing was perfect and it was just down right fun from beginning to end. I'm a huge fan of so many of the Marvel movies, but this was by far the best one. My favorite, of course, was Tom Holland's Spider-Man... great reintroduction and great performance to get us by until Homecoming"
"May 2, 2015",NEUTRAL,Amazing Spider-Man! Ant-man kills it again. I don't know how they are going to top this movie! Batman v Superman who?
"May 2, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Who would've guessed all it took to fix The Avengers was to remove Thor, Hulk, and Joss Whedon? 

I did."
"May 2, 2015",NEUTRAL,I  think the best super hero movies so far. Awesome!
"May 2, 2015",NEUTRAL,Love it!!! This may be the best Marvel movie ever!!! A must see.
"May 2, 2015",NEUTRAL,Very good movie. Only problem was the kid that played Spiderman/Peter Parker not as good as Andrew and Toby.
"May 2, 2015",NEUTRAL,"This is a thrilling, emotional journey about power and the power of friendship. Alternately serious and seriously hilarious, Civil War raises the bar for blockbuster filmmaking. It succeeds because Marvel has taken their time to create this vibrant world, and the patience more than pays off. It also helps that the new Spider-Man was so incredible and full of so much promise. Keep it up Marvel. I'll be first in line."
"May 2, 2015",NEUTRAL,"This movie was a huge let down, and I don't understand the high rating."
"May 2, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Not as traumatic as I feared, LOTS of story, maybe a bit much at times, but pretty dang solid. I am satisfied with what I saw."
"May 2, 2015",NEUTRAL,"I was not looking forward to this.... avenger vs avenger is wrong... and apart from Peter Parker being a toddler, it's an awesome movie #teamcap"
"May 2, 2015",NEUTRAL,Not necessarily the best marvel movie out there.
"May 2, 2015",NEUTRAL,made more sense for why they should be fighting each other over batman vs superman. spiderman was great! cap movies are always more focused on stories which i appreciate
"May 2, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Five Star Instant Classic. Best Marvel Studios Movie by far. Both Avengers movies are left in the dust by this one. Of course, there's a certain magic that we all go through with the first Avengers film - seeing all 4 heavyweights (Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, Captain America) on the screen at the same time has a true historical feel that can't be replicated.
But this movie has been building for 8 years and it has an undercurrent and emotional weight that I have never experienced by any film franchise, including Star Wars: The Force Awakens. We pick up where Age of Ultron left off with Cap leading his ""Quirky Quartet"" of Falcon, Black Widow, and the Scarlet Witch on a covert ops mission to take down Brock Rumlow now operating as a terrorist named Crossbones and his flunkies in Lagos. Spoiler Alert: the team is successful in their mission. But here's the problem: there are casualties...
That's what made Stan Lee and Jack Kirby visionaries: every action has an opposite and sometimes, equal reaction.
In the Avengers, we had an alien invasion in NYC that caused billions of dollars in property damage and an untold amount of lost life. In Captain America: The Winter Soldier, we saw 3 hover crafts crash into the Potomac river over D.C. also costing untold amounts of damage financially and existentially. Finally, Age of Ultron saw a foreign nation rise above the Earth only to crash catastrophically back to the planet with a fatality rate too morbid to comprehend. Throw in the tragedy in Lagos and you get the point that the public is terrified of these ""Heroes"" and want them to be held accountable for their actions.
In the comics, it was the Super Hero Registration Act. In this film it is the Sokovia Accords. The point is that the Marvel Cinematic Universe has laid out this question in every film that they have released: the good guys arrive to save the day, but at what cost? And just how much is the collateral damage?
Those questions are why DC/Warner Bros. is getting their asses handed to them. Its why Sony had no idea what they were doing with Spider-Man and why they HAD to allow Marvel to fee manage the character in movies. Its why Universal missed the boat with the Hulk and has the audacity to try and recreate the magic with their monsters (Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster, the Wolfman, the Mummy, the Invisible Man, ...hell throw in the Creature from the Black Lagoon while we're at it...). Fox figured it out with the X-Men but that was after they screwed up with X3 and X-Men Origins: Wolverine. They've just recently hit home runs with X-Men First Class, Days of Future Past, and Deadpool. Their poised to hit another homer with Apocalypse. With all that said, they grossly missed the boat with the most recent iteration of Fantastic Four.
...and do I need to even begin to talk about Batman vs Superman?
In a world where we are forced to suspend our disbelief and accept Supersoldiers, Men of Iron, Not-so Jolly Green Giants, and Norse Gods - it is still a world that is so much like our very own. There are consequences for these actions. There is a price for global conflict. Are our ""Heroes"" willing to pay that price?
That is the central theme of Civil War. That theme is what leads to our conflict between Steven Grant Rogers and Anthony Edward Stark. We saw the rivalry begin all the way back in the first Avengers. We are now placed smack dab between these two polar opposites in a very controversial issue. They are both right and they have every reason to disagree.
But whatever happened to Tony Stark's parents? This movie answers that question. Its why Cap and Tony have the best superhero fight scene I have ever witnessed on film. Its why the movie's third and final act is a complete triumph. Its why this movie deserves every accolade it has achieved. All parties involved deliver as they should on-screen. From everyone that we already know, they all remind us why we like them so much.
Which brings us to Spider-man and the Black Panther. All I have to say is that it is obvious that those two characters will be the cornerstone of phases four and five of the MCU and I cannot wait to see their films.
But back to Captain America: I honestly believe that this is the greatest Super-hero trilogy ever produced and it is a perfect ending (if it is indeed that) to this initial story arch regarding Chris Evans' interpretation of the Star Spangled Patriot. The First Avenger was a solid World War 2 movie. The Winter Soldier was an unbelievable spy thriller and I had no idea that it would be THAT good. This film was the perfect finale for this three part saga. I'll even go so far as to say that this is the best 3rd installment film ever made and I am comparing it to Return of the Jedi, Matrix Revolutions, Spider-Man 3, X3, Iron Man 3, The Dark Knight Rises, and any other movie you want to throw up there in the conversation. I can't begin to say enough about this film and I have typed up way too much, but it was really that good and I can't find anything bad to say about it.
Again: Instant Classic.

"May 1, 2015",NEUTRAL,I have seen this movie three times. I love it every time. One of my favorite Marvel movies.
"May 1, 2015",NEUTRAL,"The comic book movie we all need. Unlike the faliure of other competitors. Captain America: Civil War truly shows what the Russo Brothers and casr are capable of doing, as well as introducing Phase Three of the MCU. The character development and action sequences was well-done as it dosent fall into an Avengers 2.5 movie. It focuses more   on the situation with Steve Rogers and the Sakovia Accords. In addition the new characters that were introduced, Spiderman and Blackpanther these two only were the supportive characters and judging by their performances. They are capable of pleasing audieneces when their solo films comes soon. To wrap up the whole experience I enjoyed watching the humor and emotional conflict between each character. This is what the audienece expects the fun, comedic, and well executed action sequences."
"May 1, 2015",NEUTRAL,It was a solid movie.  Had many more slow parts than some of the other avenger movies.  I would say overall I liked it the least of them all but even at that it's still a good movie.
"May 1, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Felt its length, the shaky cam was rampant and there were many pacing problems and inconsistencies. However, it was still enjoyable enough to recommend."
"May 1, 2015",NEUTRAL,"This movie was fantastic, and surprisingly so. I was generally expecting your average watered down bland marvel movie, but this was not the case for this film. This gave me everything I wanted from a movie like this, and more. A lot of people are comparing this to Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice, and I can see why. There is one major difference between the two films however, and that is quality. Everything BvS did wrong, this did right. I hope that the rest of the upcoming MCU films follow in the footsteps of this movie and improve even more in quality. Definitely go see this as soon as you can, it's a ton of fun. Also, Spider-Man and Black Panther were fucking awesome."

"May 1, 2015",NEUTRAL,"This is a story largely about collateral damage of previous films. While the action and plot play out fine, I'm worried going into Infinity War that there will be more focus on fate of ancillary extras rather than the fight against Thanos, which would likely have more collateral damage than we've seen thus far in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. As for the elements of this installment, Spider-Man's introduction to the MCU was brilliantly played. In the end, the theme about not allowing vengeance to consume you make this film poignant in a world where emotions can be manipulated to elicit a certain outcome."
"Apr 30, 2015",NEUTRAL,totally awesome just a great movie
"Apr 30, 2015",NEUTRAL,"No spoilers, but any fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe need to get out and see this. Not quite up to par with the first Avengers film, but better than the second. A great flick overall. And as always... stay through the credits."
"Apr 30, 2015",NEUTRAL,"This was amazing, way better than that Batman vs Superman..."
"Apr 30, 2015",NEUTRAL,"I thought it was excellent movie
I will watch it again"
"Apr 29, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War takes place in a world where you'd want an independently wealthy and powerful individual made dictator-for-life because you can ""trust"" powerful people to be above the petty ""agendas"" of us mere mortals. And you must just grieve, never seek justice for, the innocent victims killed by the actions of the powerful.

In the moral universe of this film, you have to assume:

1) War-level combat among powerful forces accountable to no one is a fact of life literally everywhere; 

2) Innocent civilians casualties are an inevitable consequence--everywhere; 

3) National and international governing institutions cannot be trusted to shield civilians from these conflicts because their leaders have ""agendas""--i.e., politics, vested interests, human desires and needs.

Yes, this is an imaginary world, a fiction, an escape.

But this isn't exactly a film about unicorns finding that love is magic. 

This is explicitly a film about power and accountability. And I'd argue it says ""trust the powerful, you don't need accountability.""

(Spoilers follow.)

One of the worst moment for me was when Chris Evans mutters about the ""agendas"" of governments, like a right-wing radio host. And no one calls him on it. I wanted to say it loud: ""Everyone has agendas, Steve."" Having an agenda means having interests, having wants and needs. It means not being dead.

As I suppose that implies, I don't really believe in selfless heroes. Even the people I admire have needs, wants, flaws, interests, agendas. 

I believe in us checking one another when we overstep.

Of course, it's a lot harder to check a billionaire tech genius armored against the world or teams of super-soldiers created to physically dominate any kind of battlefield.

So, I felt most touched by the journey Tony Stark has traveled in these films: When we met Stark, he was a self-absorbed tech billionaire who bragged to lawmakers that he'd ""privatized world peace."" Instead, Stark now realizes that he just pioneered a new kind of war. To his credit, Stark faces up to the casualties of that war and agrees to be held accountable. 

Of course, the decision costs him much more emotionally than if he'd just kept telling the world to just deal with his unilateral power.

Interestingly, as Tony has grown a conscience, Steve has actually sunken into himself and the past. The one-time soldier and symbol of a nation now only has faith in himself and his one sole surving war buddy--no matter who that buddy has killed. Cap waves away civilian casualties as collateral damage like a Donald Rumsfeld.

After all the shooting is over, we leave the theater for the real world of sharp power distinctions. 

But power here takes the shape first of wealth, above all organized into corporations designed to extract profits from the earth and us. Power also exists in the form of mass-produced weapons used by invading armies, by police more trained to punish than protect, and by hate-driven vigilantes. Finally, power often exists in the form of governments captured by wealth, by military juntas, or by parties of hatred. 

For the past 100 years, powerless people worldwide have found their best defenses against powerful predators in organized collective resistance and democratic self-government. A gathering of political equals where both guns and bribes are banned allows us to check one another's ""agendas"" and gather our strength against the ""agendas"" of the powerful. More than one or two people are needed to move a piano, as Civil War oddly chooses to have an old king put it.

Democratic governments can empower us against wealth, military force, and tribal hatreds. Democratic governments can turn wealth and force into tools for defense and growth, and shield us from becoming the casualties of warlords or slavelords.

When the powerful try to wrest democratic institutions away from us, the best, first answer is not to try to become a millionaire or a vigilante or a warlord in a civil war. 

The best first answer is to reorganize the vast numbers of the powerless to control the powerful and shield our loved ones.

I think of all those first responders, those public servants, who struggled to subdue their hero and role model, Captain America in the Civil War comic series--because the Cap had lost perspective and his war against the government was causing civilian casualties. Self-recognition set in. And he stood down.

But what does this movie say about powerless people? About civilian casualties? About accountability?"
"Apr 29, 2015",NEUTRAL,BEST...MOVIE...EVER!
"Apr 29, 2015",NEUTRAL,Wow! Best Marvel movie of the year so far!! Action packed!!..
"Apr 29, 2015",NEUTRAL,So funny!! Loved the battle scenes too!!
"Apr 29, 2015",NEUTRAL,"It's doesn't get a five because of the villian. (Baron Zemo) he outsmarted all the good guys but that's it. The original Civil War didn't end this way. Oh well, maybe I'm being picky."
"Apr 29, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Alright movie, fun at the most"
"Apr 29, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Team Captain America all the way!!!!
This 3rd installment is probably one of the best from the Captain America Series! It was flawless! The action, the funny, the characters, etc...the plot wasn't lost at all notwithstanding the plethora of superheroes."
"Apr 28, 2015",NEUTRAL,Well made cant wait for the next one
"Apr 28, 2015",NEUTRAL,Great movie! Full of action.
"Apr 28, 2015",NEUTRAL,Best Marvel movie so far!!!!
"Apr 28, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Dense but never messy, Civil War surely stands as one of the best Marvel film's not only by virtue of spectacle, but also in the presentation of a rich yet tragic story. This, along with phenomenal performances from cast-members (both old and new), make this an occasionally somber and yet somehow frequently hilarious viewing experience."
"Apr 28, 2015",NEUTRAL,Captain America Civil War is a superhero vs. superhero movie that's actually good
"Apr 28, 2015",NEUTRAL,"overall, I thought it was a very good movie.. my only complaint is the fight scenes, the camera work was so jumpy.. almost made me nauseous... I hade to look away a couple times because of it...  but good movie nonetheless."
"Apr 28, 2015",NEUTRAL,"It's the best MCU movie to date. It is exciting, it is emotional, and it is funny. It's covered all aspects that it needed to cover, in that it was able to introduce new characters excellently. Spiderman was on screen for about 45 minutes and he easily stole the show. This is a great superhero movie, this is a great action movie, but best of all, it's a great movie in general."
"Apr 28, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Definitely not better than Winter Soldier, but definitely better than Age of Ultron. Spider man was fun and it was just your typical marvel movie with sweet action and cheesy jokes."
"Apr 26, 2015",NEUTRAL,"There are a lot of interesting ideas at play, but there could easily be another 30 minutes to further explore those ideas. B+"
"Apr 26, 2015",NEUTRAL,"This movie did a fantastic job of showing two equally well reasoned sides of an argument.  Uniquely this huge cast of dynamic characters  balances the time spent with each of them artfully, allowing the audience to both get to know the new characters while spending time with the ones we already love.  Marvel also held up its reputation of balancing comedy, action, and drama, and there is no better example than the 20 minutes of splash page we are given in this movie."
"Apr 26, 2015",NEUTRAL,"*No spoilers* An enjoyable ensemble piece - all the established characters have moments to shine that feel true to their personalities with Black Panther and Spider-Man welcome additions. This is very much Avengers 2.5 rather than Captain America 3, though and the good Captain is rather lost in the mix. Another miss was that this entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe lacks a strong genre identity which has been a strength of earlier outings, e.g. Captain America: The Winter Soldier which plays as a political thriller with superhero shenanigans thrown on top. Civil War has a generic superhero movie feel to it rather than a distinctive voice of its own. The pieces take a while to come together and inevitably the plot has to go to great lengths to get our heroes in conflict with one another but overall the results are satisfying and the humour strikes its mark. The Winter Soldier stands as the superior Captain America outing but there is lots on offer here and plenty of set-ups for future outings. 4/5 stars."
"Apr 26, 2015",NEUTRAL,So many questions to be answered so little time. Awesome possum
"Apr 26, 2015",NEUTRAL,"(This will contain *mild* spoilers, assuming that you read this and have the ability to infer what may happen. If you don't want to know anything, why would you read this?) With Captain America: Civil War, I feel like I can now safely say that Marvel Cinematic Universe is past its prime. For a movie that builds itself up for its event-status quality and introduction of new characters, themes, and story arcs, its an oddly subdued and safe movie. I'm not saying that everything has to be 2001: A Space Odyssey. This is a movie that has a good grasp on its humor and often times its self-awareness and some genuinely entertaining scenes, and for that I cannot call it a bad movie. That doesn't stop it from feeling like a missed opportunity, though, and despite its occasional fun, the movie feels somewhat inconsequential. Here is where I would ordinarily put a logline, but you already know what this movie is about if you care. In fact, you've probably already seen this movie, so my voice is rather futile. Anyways, I have to say that I enjoy the slightly political angle that these movies have been taking as of late. The themes on the table here are timely, engaging, and present an interesting break from the blockbuster norm. The way in which the characters defend their actions and ideologies are understandable and sympathetic, and of course the actors do a good job for what this movie entails. In terms of more traditional blockbuster fare, Captain America: Civil War also has some fun action sequences sprinkled about at a rather even rate. They're well choreographed, paced, and--despite some distracting handheld camerawork at times--are nicely shot. The Russo Brothers have demonstrated their ability to balance humor with action with Captain America: The Winter Solider, and their abilities generally carry on here. With these aspects, I was mostly enjoying the movie. However, it's the last hour or so that begins to show how constricted these movies are by their studio formula. Kevin Feige's obsession with only creating a cinematic universe instead of movies that work well on their own is really starting to catch up with him, and it's becoming more and more apparent why Edgar Wright left Ant-Man. Of course there's the obligatory issue of ""wait, what is happening and how are all of you connected?"", but I've come to accept this flaw in this sort of franchise-based filmmaking. This isn't as messy or crowded as Avengers: Age of Ultron, but it still exhibits some of those same issues. They aren't as pervasive, but instead rear their head towards the end. Suffice it to say that the climax doesn't do nearly as much with its potential as it could have. It appears to have some punch when you're watching it, but when the resolution comes about, you realize that not much has changed and that the stasis is pretty much the same as act one. It plays it safe, which is underwhelming when this movie could have been somewhat of a game-changer within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It ends up being more of the same, and the amount of humorous moments alone can't make it feel like more than it really is--more of the same. Captain America: Civil War allows itself to surpass the previous entries of the MCU, but this entry seems to further establish that these movies are just getting bigger and more populated as opposed to newer and more exciting. It knows how to balance its humor; the ingredients are there. But when you sidestep the available opportunities for the sake of introducing more characters and maintaining the franchise's relevance in an ever-growing scape of superhero blockbusters, it's undeniably disappointing, even if it isn't bad. 6/10, okay, one thumb down, average, etc."
"Apr 26, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Captain America: Civil War's emphasis on themes and characters makes it far more interesting than most other Marvel films, albeit not quite as groundbreaking as it wants itself to be. Because we have gotten to know most of these characters fairly well over the course of several films, the conflict is delivered with genuine weight and tension. As far as the hero characters go, nobody is really a hero and nobody is really a villain, and this moral dilemma is perhaps the film's greatest strength. Furthermore, Civil War also is surprisingly funny at times, its action sequences (for the most part) are terrific, and yes, Spider-Man absolutely steals the show. Unfortunately, the ending of the film felt a bit rushed and unsatisfying, and the first twenty minutes or so are pretty rough. However, once the movie gets going, it keeps getting better and better as it goes along. Overall, it is probably one of the better entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe in quite some time. Maybe not groundbreaking, but it does renew my excitement for these movies at least a little bit."
"Apr 26, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Answered many childhood ""what if"" questions of heroes fighting each other! One of the best Marvel movies till date. Pacing of the movie was good too."
"Apr 26, 2015",NEUTRAL,"This movie really held up to its predecessors, but wasn't quite as enjoyable as the avengers movies. With a lot of down time in the movie and not as much humor as the Marvel movies have been delivering lately, it just can't make it all the way to 5 star rating for me. However, the character development and the cause-and-effect progression was very effective for growing the marvel cinematic universe to include new heroes and villains. Can't wait to see the next big one!"
"Apr 26, 2015",NEUTRAL,It was really awesome totally better than BVS. I loved how the fights lasted longer than BVS and it actually made me and everyone in the salon get exited. Hope you people enjoy!
"Apr 25, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Civil War is a complete package. Great Action, interesting characters, emotional investment, funny quips, and the amazing debut of Spiderman and Black Panther. This one is a must see. 4.75/5"
"Apr 25, 2015",NEUTRAL,Spider Man / Black Panther / Ant Man 'Awesome' Great Movie! Must See!
"Apr 25, 2015",NEUTRAL,Good Overall Movie with one amazing fight scene but not much else after that.
"Apr 25, 2015",NEUTRAL,Good... though why they chose to identify the automatic weapons at the beginning of the movie as AR-15s is beyond me.  AR-15s are not automatic weapons.  But it does fuel the hype against AR-15s.
"Apr 25, 2015",NEUTRAL,"The tension between Iron Man and Cap, both in costume and out, was intense. The addition of Black Panther and Spider-Man were highlights for me."
"Apr 25, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Loved it action packed great storyline,stand out characters are The Winter soldier and Black panther!"
"Apr 25, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Pretty good movie, kinda hard to understand by not watching other Marvel movies though."

"Apr 25, 2015",NEUTRAL,Amazing movie from start to finish
"Apr 25, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Honestly, I was blown away while watching this movie. The Russo Brothers are back at it again with an amazing Captain America movie. From the action to the acting, I was on the edge of my seat the whole time in the theater. I give Civil War 4/5."
"Apr 25, 2015",NEUTRAL,One of the best Marvel movies in so long
"Apr 25, 2015",NEUTRAL,Great story with a lot of action of a lot of different/new superheroes. Team Captain America all the way.
"Apr 25, 2015",NEUTRAL,The BEST Marvel movie to date. An amazing thrill ride from beginning to end. And the best portrayal of Spider-Man on film. The Russo Brothers are kings of the Marvel movies
"Apr 24, 2015",NEUTRAL,Absolutely loved this movie. I've seen it twice already. And I loved it even more the second time. I strongly recommend seeing it in theaters. Be advised of 2 end credit scenes. And Tom Holland as Spider Man will make you forget about Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield. Holland is the perfect Spider Man.
"Apr 24, 2015",NEUTRAL,"good movie.  action, humor, more action.  black panther was super cool."
"Apr 24, 2015",NEUTRAL,"His is honestly the best marvel movie. The performances are fantastic and the humor is great. The action sequences were awesome and exhilarating. I like how you see the characters become emotional and realize that they need to be put in line. 
Overall, this is awesome, and I totally recommend seeing this."
"Apr 23, 2015",NEUTRAL,The a good Marvel Movie! Spider-msn was flipping amazing in the movie! And so was Iron man!!!!!!
"Apr 19, 2015",NEUTRAL,The best superhero movie of all time. My favorite part is when captain america & iron man fight. 9/10
"Apr 17, 2015",NEUTRAL,"I don't think I've put anything particularly spoilery in this review, but don't come crying to me if you read to the bottom and say I've spoiled it because you've been warned.

So, Civil War. To me it was perfect. Like I have nothing to gripe about. Some questions perhaps, but not questions in a bad light. Just more something I'm interested in.

What works about Civil War is what you'll have seen in reviews time and time again, none of the main players in this film are heroes, nor are they villains. Regardless of who's team you choose, you'll still see the other's point of view and understand why they think that way. There is a villain in this film, but you even stop and think through is motivations and can actually empathise with why he's doing what he's doing. Even if his plan is slightly convoluted, it still works very well!

The mish-mash of characters and personalities in this film gel very well and they all play off each other in a really satisfying way! You more or less get a different interaction between every pair of characters at some point, and they all fit so well to the characters they are. That was one of the big highlights for me. There's a lot of comedy between them all, but it's not as excessive as Iron Man 3, or Avengers: Age Of Ultron, it fits in all the right places.

Thank goodness for Chris Evans as Cap though, the guy nails it every time. I find it difficult to put into words what I thought of his character development. I could just totally buy it, it fits his character so well. He was loyal to his friend no matter what anyone else said, and his ideals were about doing what is right morally, rather than logically. It just totally worked for me, and I couldn't be happier. 

Besides Cap (who is of course my favourite), one of the best characters in this film (for me) was Scott Lang/Ant-Man. He was just a joy to see whenever he showed up on screen, and his one-liners absolutely slayed me every time! And he does have one of the ""biggest"" moments in the film which is mind-blowing and hilarious at the same time.

Tom Holland as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, he absolutely killed it! I saw someone say he embodied each of the parts of the Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield's versions that made them great, and I completely agree! I can't wait to see more of the MCU's Spider-Man. His chemistry with Tony Stark is amazing though! I'm very glad they've cast RDJ in Spider-Man: Homecoming.

T'Challa/Black Panther was excellent. Though, more of a man of action than words. He has the occasional laugh, but is mostly a stern character, driven by his emotions. Which is great by the way! Because that's the type of character he's always been. His action scenes are some of the most kickass stuff I've seen from superheroes in film. I'm very excited for his solo movie now.

Tony Stark has gone through some serious character development since he nearly destroyed the world in Age Of Ultron. He's still very cocky, but much less so than before. He's moved much closer to the Tony from the comics, who sometimes the line between being a hero/doing what he thinks is right regardless of the costs blurs a little. His motivations scream logic, and at the same time he's suffering some personal problems. He's a very broken man in this story, and kudos to RDJ because it really shows. Looking at it as someone who agrees with Cap's views, he IS irritating, and whiney, but it just helps the story along. And by the end of the film you can see why he's taking the actions he takes, and you half root for him, but you also wish he'd stop!

Natasha, Natasha oh how I weep for Natasha! She's back at full strength, just like she was in Winter Soldier. There are hints towards the atrocity of what was done with her in Age Of Ultron, but nothing that'll carry over in the future. But I weep for her because she's so conflicted in this film, she's trying to do what she thinks is right ""the path of least resistance"" but at the same time her heart is strongly with Steve, she's there for him when he needs her, and it's beautiful. But you can tell she really wishes he'd just go along with Tony's ideals for his own good. Once Steve breaks the rules she does come across slightly as Tony's bitch, but I think that's just because Steve has made things much worse and she's pissed that he wouldn't trust her advice as a friend. There are also a few good references to her strong friendship with Clint too. It's just a shame that she vanishes from the film at the end of the second act. But overall I was happy with her portrayal here.

I thought Scarlet Witch and Vision were super cute throughout, although there is a point where Vision gets this creepy, overprotective, Twilight vibe to him which feels a little gross, but it doesn't last long. He's like an awkward teenager around her, still struggling to understand what his emotions are. It was actually one of the funniest parts of the film. Wanda is in a similar conflict, coming to terms with what she is, all of the power inside her and how dangerous she can be. I think that's what connects them quite well. I'm hoping it'll build towards something for them in the future.

Surprise, surprise! Clint has very limited screen time, but I think what we see if him is some of the best Hawkeye material we've had in the MCU. He's becoming a much more rounded character each time. He wasn't afraid to tell Tony what he thought of him, and as in the comics he's pretty funny. There's still small reference to his miraculous family from Age Of Ultron, but they kept in his father-like relationship with Scarlet Witch, which I thought was nice. You can also tell that he still (platonically) loves Natasha to bits.

Sam Wilson/Falcon is another comedy powerhouse in this film and the way Anthony Mackie delivers one-liners just had me in stitches every time. At the same time there is a lot of emotion there, he's totally a loyal right-hand man to Steve, and he's not afraid to tell him when he doesn't agree. His chemistry with Bucky is phenomenal too, I loved their banter so much! I'd love to see more of that in the future.

Bucky was another highlight for me, in that we get to see a much more of him as a person again, which is a delight. The chemistry between Steve/Bucky and Sam/Bucky (as I already mentioned) were both great. There's a scene where Steve and Bucky have a small moment which feels like you've jumped back to them in the first film, I was really happy with that. He's not the same though, having gone through brainwashing by Hydra he's much more solemn and broken as a person, which is heartbreaking. Even more so because he's still willing to follow his best friend into battle as he always did.
The climax of his story here is both happy and sad at the same time, it's not the ending I wanted, but it works.

This is clearly a film where best friends have heartbreaking stories. Because Rhodey remains a serious character throughout. He has a couple of funny lines, but I found him to be a small voice of reason. The trailer teases some bad stuff for him, and what that leads to I thought was very sad.

Sharon Carter has limited screen time in this film, I was quite happy with her. She didn't annoy me, and she was genuinely loyal to Steve. It didn't feel just shoehorned to me. The chemistry between them isn't massive, but I thought it was enough for them to earn what they got. There is a moment between them, and you then see Sam and Bucky's reaction to it, I thought it was so funny because it was something I could really relate to from Steve's point of view.
There is definitely a small progression in their relationship since Winter Soldier, but I hope we get more, because I found it very interesting in the comics.

The airport fight scene is amazing, I've felt that reviews haven't done it enough justice, which isn't surprising because when it comes, the feeling of awe and excitement is indescribable! Just seeing these characters marching towards each other, slowly getting faster just keeps building it up to this spectacle that just has you excited at every turn, wondering what's gonna happen next. Truly the best superhero action scene in film to date.

And the final fight, we come to a revelation that if you're a big fan you can probably guess already, when it happen I loudly went ""OH, Noo!"" It's an emotionally charged slug-fest which Batman vs Superman's final face off wishes it was. Tony's motivation for it is completely sound, but Steve just feels he has to do what he believes is right. You're not sure who to root for because in a way they're both right. I found it absolutely satisfying as a fan though.

I would easily recommend this film to anyone though."

"Apr 9, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Civil War has managed to up the ante in a universe where the ante is upped every movie. It has also managed to develop all the characters and give us the best action in any superhero movie ever. The airport scene is the greatest action sequence of all time.

"May 24, 2014",NEUTRAL,"While not without a bevy of incredibly well-crafted action scenes and Marvel's signature style of humor, Captain America: Civil War is the franchise's most mature movie to date, chock-full of characters with understandable motivations and complex emotions."
"May 23, 2014",NEUTRAL,"""Captain America: Civil War"" is not only one of the best Marvel films, but it's also one of the best superhero films ever made. Period. It hits all the right notes and gets everything that it's supposed to correct. There are so many elements to why this film is excellent that it is almost impossible to list them all. Marvel mostly has great cast members in their films, and that's no exception for this movie. Everybody gives a powerhouse performance and are all given a chance to shine. The direction is impeccable, with the Russo brothers proving once again that you can blend comic book fun with layers and depth into the same movie. The action is AMAZING, and not just the ""Civil War"" scene. Pretty much every action sequence is jaw dropping and puts you on the edge of your seat. The initial ""Civil War"" action sequence is one of, if not the best, superhero throw-downs ever made for film. It's so insanely entertaining and I couldn't believe that I was actually seeing this ""War"" come to life. The two sides are presented in such a way that you are constantly changing your own opinion and there is not clear wrong or right side. The villain is surprisingly good, and ended up being one of the better MCU villains to have graced the screen. The new additions to the MCU are fantastic, such as Black Panther and Spider-Man. I can't wait to see more of Black Panther, and Chadwick Boseman knocked it out of the park with his performance. Tom Holland may be the best Spider-Man to have ever been portrayed, as this finally feels like the Peter Parker I know and love from the comics. This movie almost felt like more of an adaption of the ""Civil War"" comics then a true ""Captain America"" movie, but that's ok since I absolutely loved that comic series. I can't think of a film that feels more like a true comic book adaption then this flick. Marvel has completely outdone theirselves and I don't know how they can get better then this. This is a 10/10 superhero flick that deserves to be seen by all, and not just superhero fans. This is so much more then a comic book film and you should see it if you enjoy incredibly well made action thrillers and all around fantastically crafted pieces of cinema."

"May 18, 2014",NEUTRAL,"The Best Captain America by far overall in reviews/ratings according to Rotten Tomatoes.. They added Ant man played by Paul Rudd, Black Panther, Chadwich Boseman and teenage boy Spiderman. I like the ending when Steve Rogers shows up to rescue Wanda, Falcon, Bow/Arrow Guy out of prison...  They mostly fight each other trying to convince Steve and his group which includes AntMan which blows up to Giant AntMan in the Airport.. It is the last one for Captain America but not for Avengers movie Franchise."

Fun Fact: When Trailer 2 came out, I almost cried when I saw it. This is my favourite movie of all time. If I were to compare this, Avengers: Age of Ultron & Ant - Man, Civil War would CRUSH the other two. An extreme MUST WATCH!!!!! And hoping for Avengers: Infinity War to make us ABSOLUTELY forget about this mind blowing movie!!!!!"
"May 3, 2014",NEUTRAL,"Awesome Superhero Movie. It has taught provoking ideals, one of best action scenes between heroes, the best movie spiderman, a great introduction to Black Panther, and a decent villian. A"
"May 2, 2014",NEUTRAL,No words this was almost LOTR like my fav film from marvel
"Apr 29, 2014",NEUTRAL,"I waited over 2 years for Captain America: Civil War, so I without a doubt had high expectations and worried about over-hyping the movie. 
When I say that this movie exceeded expectations, know that it truly does. There were only two or three very minor things I could classify as ""wrong"" with this movie; everything else was pretty much perfect. The action scenes were perfectly placed, and the story never lost its' way, despite all the stuff that was crammed into it. As the movie went on, the stakes were continually being raised and the story got more and more intense. All the characters had great dynamics, specifically Steve, Bucky, and Tony. They each had terrific arcs. Black Panther and Marvel's version of Spider-Man were given possibly the best introductions they could have been given in a movie as crowded as this. 
This is also a much more mature Marvel film, and easily the best to date. For someone that loves the Marvel Universe, Civil War was a more than extraordinary feat. For the general audience, I'd say that it's still pretty damn spectacular. Having seen the prior films definitely makes Civil War a much more powerful and personal film, but even as a standalone, it still manages to hold its own. 
Civil War isn't a film you want to miss. I promise you that you'll be more than impressed. 
tl;dr: Do yourself a favor and go see the movie. It's amazing."
"Apr 25, 2014",NEUTRAL,"WOW! THIS is the Avengers sequel I've been waiting for! And yes, I said AVENGERS sequel because I don't care how much the studio lies and says it's a Captain America sequel, this is straight up Avengers 2.5! All heroes were great, Black Panther and Spider-Man steal the show, the story is multi-layered and very personal and the action scenes were epic! The airport fight scene alone was worth my money! Excellent, Excellent, EXCELLENT movie!"
"Apr 24, 2014",NEUTRAL,I laughed I cried I was left in awe.
"Apr 18, 2014",NEUTRAL,very very good this was everything Batman V Superman The Dawn Of Justice could've been reached all my expectations so enjoyable a must watch for all Marvel fans everywhere and action movie fans to!!!!
"Apr 16, 2014",NEUTRAL,"Filled with great moments, but lacks the emotional punch it goes for."
"Apr 12, 2014",NEUTRAL,"A solid movie, but it has its flaws. It felt more like a Iron Man movie than a Cap movie. It also goes bad with comedic relief, sometimes there is just too much, especially for the kind of movie it is. The hype will be unreal with people saying its the best movie to date, but its not. 
Not as great as Batman v Superman, but it isn't behind by much at all. Still liked it a lot. Issues i has with bvs were one thing, and here its another as well. The movie had a major issue when it came to the overall tone, and it felt like two different movies."
"Apr 11, 2014",NEUTRAL,Awesome Movie can not wait for the Black Panther movie from Marvel!!!!!!!!
"Apr 7, 2014",NEUTRAL,Awesome!! Black panther it's the best!!
"Apr 6, 2014",NEUTRAL,There aren't enough words in the English language to describe how incredibly great this movie is! Guess I'll just have to watch it again and again.
"Apr 5, 2014",NEUTRAL,Team.... Spider-Man...... Nuff said
