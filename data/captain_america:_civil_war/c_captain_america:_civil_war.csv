"Feb 27, 2024",POSITIVE," The biggest cinematic undertaking of the last 15-plus years, Kevin Feige’s grand attempt to serialize blockbuster storytelling has featured some ridiculous highs and some bleak lows. It’s changed the way Hollywood looks at its intellectual properties, and it’s trying to figure out its uncertain future after briefly imploding under the weight of its massive overreach into film and streaming television. We’ve gone through all 33 of the MCU’s films, from 2008’s Iron Man to last fall’s The Marvels, and ranked them according to quality. We don’t include the streaming series in this list, either; just the movies. While you’ll notice a high number of recent MCU films toward the bottom of the list, keep in mind that the series’ struggles post-Avengers: Endgame have been substantial, largely because of storytelling issues. As much as those films showed real promise, they represented a Marvel Studios that lost its consistency, hence the recent efforts to retool the universe. Before we get to the sole MCU film of 2024 in Deadpool & Wolverine, let’s dive into how the 33 films that came before it stacked up against each other. This is truly the low point in the MCU, a film that purely exists to connect dozens of uncompelling dots to a future that probably now won’t happen because of Jonathan Majors being booted from his role as Kang for his legal issues. The film tries to find its own path into the James Gunn-iness of the Galaxy of the Guardians movies, but it fails miserably in that pursuit. We love Paul Rudd, but not even he could save this one from itself. It’s everything wrong with the MCU at its worst: corporate product that exists to expand the empire rather than tell a compelling story with relatable characters. Chloé Zhao is an incredibly talented filmmaker who is responsible for some of the best films of the last decade. Eternals is sadly not one of them. Pairing Zhao with the MCU just simply didn’t work for either party, producing a largely lifeless superhero slog that very much overstays its welcome. Zhao’s natural lighting works incredibly for her arthouse films, but it’s not a match for studio filmmaking. It’s just a huge miss by a major talent, which happens. Taika Waititi’s long-anticipated to the incredibly fun Thor: Ragnarok was an absolute stinker for most of its runtime, one that lost its grip the tonal excellence of its predecessor and wastes a very fun Christian Bale villainous turn. It’s not the worst of the bunch necessarily, but it’s perhaps the biggest disappointment on the list. Nia DaCosta is another incredibly talented filmmaker whose Marvel project went off the rails because of the MCU nightmare machine’s malfunctioning. The film’s story is nearly incoherent, and it leaves a few inspires set pieces to dry with nonsensical villainy and far too much reliance on having seen multiple television shows to understand what’s going on in totality. We don’t blame DaCosta for this; the signs of life feel directly linked to her creativity. Destin Daniel Cretton’s Short Term 12 is one of the best movies of the 2010s, so it hurts our hearts to rank his MCU movie so low on this list. It’s an occasional chore, one that cannot link its kung-fu homages to the CG messiness that envelops the film by its third act. Tony Leung is as good as advertised, but the rest of this movie struggles to live up to that performance. The first sign of trouble in the post-Avengers: Endgame MCU, Black Widow just felt too little, too late, an attempt to make up for the unfairly procrastinated Black Widow origin movie that can’t match its compelling human moments with its bland action set pieces. We liked the cast, but it didn’t live up to the potential of telling Natasha Romanoff’s backstory. The clever bits can’t quite save this one from forgettable territory, even if it’s a step ahead than the rest of the movies on this list. Ant-Man’s first film is the best of the bunch, while this one just felt too small and unimportant in the grand scheme of things to really register. Rather than use that smallness to its advantage, it just felt a bit superfluous. It’s not bad, though. Brie Larson is a terrific actor, but the origin story for her Captain Marvel doesn’t quite live up to what it could’ve been. It is a fun 90s adventure film, and it was about time for the MCU to give a woman her own film in the series. We just wish it was, y’know, more deserving of the moment, even if the moment in and of itself boosts this one up a bit. This one gets a bad rap. It’s by no means a great movie or anything, but it’s got a very good Tom Hiddleston performance and moves at a satisfying clip. The elven villains are notoriously bad, but the rest of the film is alright. While it pales in comparison to Ang Lee’s thrilling 2003 Hulk, Edward Norton’s lone venture into the MCU as the angry green guy was a perfectly suitable introduction for the character. It’s hard that it’s been so long since this one came out, but it’s better than you remember. Definitely the weakest Avengers film, this overstuffed sequel still found a way to take the series into a refreshingly dark direction while giving Jeremy Renner’s Hawkeye a nice spotlight to work with. Still, this one hasn’t aged nearly as well as it played in the moment. The weakest of the Jon Watt/Tom Holland Spider-Man films, this one is like a tasty burrito that is so overstuffed that it falls out the bottom and gets all over your lap when you try to eat it. The film’s second act is as good as advertised, but you have to wade through a very uneven first half to get there. It’s darn good when it wants to be, but it needs a much tighter edit. Coasting on the nostalgia of yesterday can only get you so far when the jokes aren’t landing and the plot gets a little too convoluted. Thank goodness this one found its footing in the second act and eventually lived up to the potential. It was always going to be hard to live up to Iron Man, but Iron Man 2 is probably the MCU film that deserves more credit than it gets. It’s a very enjoyable sequel that deepens the journey for Robert Downey Jr.’s Tony Stark while zeroing in on some really well-crafted fight scenes. It’s a good film; flawed, sure, but we’ve missed this kind of effectively contained storytelling in these movies. The remnants of Edgar Wright’s scrapped vision for this film and Rudd’s impossibly buoyant charm helped the first Ant-Man movie stand out. While it’s still a step behind some of the better origin films, it’s the best Scott Lang movie of the three. It’s funny, it’s got a good heist and, again, there are a few scenes in this that feel preserved from Wright’s ideas. We’ll take it. Kenneth Branagh’s take on the Norse god definitely just scratched the potential that Waititi found with Thor: Ragnarok, but it’s still a very enjoyable origin tale that took full advantage of Branagh’s Shakespeare background in building the Asgardian palace intrigue. It also is the film that first understood how funny Chris Hemsworth could be with good material. Jake Gyllenhaal’s Mysterio and some really clever visual effect sequences give the second Spider-Man a real jolt, as the lighter elements of Holland’s take on the character meshed well with the way this one raised the stakes. It’s a good Spider-Man flick, even if the Tony Stark tech of it all got a little tiring. The first half of the conclusion to the Infinity Saga left viewers in limbo with a gut punch of an ending, even if it wasn’t hard to see how it would all get undone in the next movie. It felt like half a journey, and what you do to get there isn’t necessarily as compelling as what came after it. However, it’s hard to knock the MCU with finding this dour a story and sticking to it to the closing credits. For a year, Marvel wasn’t afraid to avoid a happy ending. That was nice; they should do it again some time. A clever political thriller disguised as a Captain America movie, this one really showed audiences that the MCU could branch itself into some really interesting directions that would pay off in the future. It felt a bit riskier than some of its predecessors, and it complicated the universe in some welcomed ways. It’s not quite the achievement it’s made out it be, but it’s quite good. A spectacular opening to lament the loss of Chadwick Boseman, Ryan Coogler’s directorial savvy and a very complicated villain in Namor helped lift the second Black Panther film through the tragedy of Boseman’s loss. That alone is cause for respect. Even if this one falls into the CG fight mess of most of the MCU films, it’s still one of the better titles on this list. Doctor Strange got one of the best origin films in this series, one that utilized filmmaker Scott Derrickson’s genre bona fides with some mind-bending visuals to couple with Benedict Cumberbatch’s memorable take on the Sorcerer Supreme. Also, adding Benedict Wong to these movies was such a smart move. He never wastes a second of his screen time. The first Holland Spidey film is also the best, one that felt refreshingly removed from the MCU ongoings and scaled down Peter Parker’s universe into a New York City-set drama with real stakes and effective coming-of-age comedy. Michael Keaton’s Vulture is one of the MCU’s best and believable villains. While the MCU never fully capitalized on the fascinating rift between Captain America and Iron Man, this film deserved a lot of credit for creating that fraction in the first place. The airport battle is still one of the best scenes in all of these movies, and the introduction to Holland’s Spider-Man is still such a joy and the best use of his iteration of the character in this series. The first Captain America film is still the best, as Joe Johnston’s World War II action-adventure did an incredibly effective job of introducing Steve Rogers and underscoring the scrappy virtues that defined the character. Chris Evans earned his star power in this role, and he was never better than here. Getting Shane Black to make an Iron Man movie just felt too good to be true, as this fantastically entertaining third Tony Stark solo venture took the markings of a great Shane Black movie and put them in the MCU to great effect. It’s a very subversive, introspective film, one replete with great action sequences and a bad guy switcheroo for the ages. It’s the most underappreciated film in this series by far. The best film post-Avengers: Endgame by a country mile, Sam Raimi’s thrilling, unpredictable Doctor Strange sequel took some bold steps to complicate the MCU while playing into those Raimi staples that make him one of the best filmmakers to ever work in the genre. Elizabeth Olsen’s fascinating heel turn for Wanda Maximoff is still one of the bravest decisions in any of these movies, and Raimi knew exactly how to capitalize on it. It was so gratifying to have Raimi back in the genre, and this was a clear highlight for the MCU to learn from and build off of in the future. Perhaps the most purely fun MCU film to date, Waititi revived the Thor movies in stellar fashion with this incredibly funny, consistently impressive action comedy that boasted freakin’ Cate Blanchett as its bad guy. There are so many inspired bits in this movie, capped with a technicolor smackdown finale that rivals any other in the MCU. This movie is just a blast. Even the most cynical person had to give the MCU its flowers for nailing this grand finale to a decade-plus of storytelling, as the Infinity Saga came to its grand conclusion. It’s a gripping spectacle that closes out so many storylines with a satisfying cap and gave Downey Jr. and Evans some rich material for their final outings as Iron Man and Captain America. The series may never reach this fever pitch again, but we’re glad we got to watch the plan come together in such a memorable way. Gunn is the best filmmaker to ever work in the MCU, and his Guardians of the Galaxy films are the gold standard for this series as a whole. The second installment richened the characters while also giving Michael Rooker’s Yondu one of its best character arcs. Kurt Russell was such an inspired bit of casting as Ego, and the film just packs such a wallop with its deeply emotional finale. We dare you not to cry at what happens during the Cat Stevens needle drop. Gunn’s final outing in the MCU with his Guardians was also one of the best MCU films, period. Exploring Rocket Raccoon’s heartbreaking backstory and welding that with its main story arc just hit like a ton of bricks, as Gunn refused to let this one pass him by without a statement. The film’s final dance scene to Florence & The Machine is just such a joyous summation of why these movies worked so well and why they’ll be so missed in Gunn’s hands. Probably one of the most exciting blockbusters of the 2010s, the first Avengers film was a genuine moment in pop culture, one that pulled off a teamup movie that had never been attempted before in film history. It set the standard incredibly high for how these multi-hero movies would go, and we’re not sure any of the films to come after it ever cleared the bar. Coogler’s masterful first Black Panther film is also one of the best blockbusters of the 2010s, one that created an indelible moment in pop culture that widened spectacle representation in a way that felt sustainable. This one is just everything good about superhero films, from the stellar craftwork to Coogler’s sharp eye for staging the material and Michael B. Jordan’s unforgettable villainous turn that refused easy explanations. Of course, Boseman’s memory lingers high on this one in the rearview, as it was his true moment to shine in the role that defined him. As hard as it is to believe, Downey Jr. was not one of Hollywood’s biggest stars before his first Iron Man movie came out. This film not only led to perhaps the greatest comeback in acting history, but also launched the MCU in spectacular fashion. It’s perhaps the most grounded Marvel film to date, but it’s also one of the absolute best for a reason. Everything is owed to Iron Man, a film that launched a moment and set a standard that hasn’t always been reached. The pinnacle of the MCU was also its greatest risk, as it took a genre filmmaker who had never worked with this big a canvas before in Gunn and some of Marvel’s most obscure characters and made a masterpiece out if it. Guardians of the Galaxy essentially changed the way that superhero movies could be made, adding in a cosmic sense of irreverence and a template for building lovable characters out of oblong sketches. It launched Chris Pratt to stardom and turned Rocket Racoon and Groot into household names. It also showed how putting in the right amount of heart and pathos can essentially make even the strangest of characters the most cheerworthy of heroes. We’re not sure the MCU will ever top the first Guardians film, as it’s the shining standard for what Marvel movies can be. Take risks; hire good filmmakers who fit the mold and let them cook; cast wisely; let these things breathe without so much responsibility to the grander universes. If we can get at least one more movie from Marvel as great as this, it’s a huge win."
"Jan 14, 2024",NEUTRAL," Capitán América: Civil War (2016) completa la trilogía de este superhéroe que ha comenzado en Capitán América: El Primer Vengador (2011) y seguido con Capitán América y el Soldado del Invierno (2014), ésta última también dirigida por Joe y Anthony Russo, al igual que el film a analizar. Comenzando con un epílogo que retoma al personaje del Soldado del Invierno (Sebastian Stan), cuya psicología se vuelve cada vez más compleja, la acción nos sitúa en el traspaso de una Hydra nazi a una Hydra soviética con más secretos por develar. De vuelta en el presente, el relato hará hincapié en el mismo lugar en el que nos dejó Los Vengadores: Era de Ultrón (2015): ¿representan los superhéroes una amenaza para la sociedad? Un planteo, a su vez, copiado en la reciente Batman vs. Superman: El Origen de la Justicia (2016), en donde Superman representaba para algunos una amenaza para la humanidad. Después de todo, ¿quién no ha pensado al ver estas películas que los superhéroes -mientras salvan el mundo- destruyen media ciudad en sus batallas? En este caso el giro de Capitán América: Civil War es hacer un poquito menos imperialista la escena y darle un poco más de protagonismo a los países del Tercer Mundo. Tras los traspiés de los Vengadores en naciones como Sokovia (país inventado por el universo Marvel) y Nigeria, ocasionando varias muertes, se dudará del criterio de acción de los mismos. El debate dentro del mismísimo seno de los Avengers girará en torno a firmar o no el “Acuerdo de Sokovia”, el cual le quitaría la independencia de acción a los Vengadores para someterlos a la jurisdicción de las Naciones Unidas. Tras la culpa que acarrea Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), éste estará a favor de firmar el acuerdo, mientras que Capitán América no (interpretado por Chris Evans, quien en esta oportunidad se asentó definitivamente en dicho personaje). Desde el inicio del conflicto los Vengadores se dividirán en dos bandos, haciendo que los superhéroes peleen entre sí. De un bando estarán los aliados del Capitán América: Falcon, Scarlet Witch (cuyo personaje ya se había presentado al final de Capitán América y el Soldado del Invierno y desplegado en Los Vengadores: Era de Ultrón) y Hawkeye, hoy incorporándose Ant-Man al equipo. En el grupo de Stark estarán su fiel amigo Rhodes/ War Machine (Don Cheadle), sorpresivamente la Viuda Negra (Scarlett Johansson), con quien siempre confrontaban, Visión y se sumará en una etapa adolescente Spider-Man. El personaje del Hombre Araña será parodiado y utilizado como descompresor de la tensión, dándole toques de comicidad poco eficaz al film. Por último, en este mismo bando, los países del Tercer Mundo también tendrán a su representante: la Pantera Negra (personaje ya presente en los comics), cuya primera aparición en este film nos remitirá a un “Gatubelo” pero con una psicología de personaje más que interesante, que oscila entre la templanza de la diplomacia y la venganza. A partir de allí, desde formalismos cinematográficos como el recurso del montaje paralelo, el Capitán América e Iron Man serán dos caras de una misma moneda. La figura del “gran villano” está algo desdibujada en comparación al universo al cual los comics nos tienen acostumbrados, pues éste será un hombre bastante común con sed de venganza, lo que permitirá acentuar la dicotomía (hoy interpretado por el gran Daniel Brühl, cuyo rostro y expresiones desde el inicio nos invitan a lo siniestro). Como siempre no podía faltar el cameo del milenario Stan Lee, sin quien el universo de Marvel no existiría o al menos no tal como lo conocemos. Para concluir, la narración está basada en un desarrollo muy lento que sin embargo nos mantiene expectantes, pero no por su ritmo sino por el deseo de que la verdadera acción heroica comience. Puesto que la “guerra civil” será más verbal que física, las batallas importantes se resumirán en dos: una incluirá dos bandos y la otra un “dos contra uno”. Es pertinente destacar que las peleas, sobre todo las iniciales, poseen un efecto que produce extrañamiento: son cámaras súper rápidas que otorgan una suerte de realismo a los movimientos. Las batallas poseen pocos momentos de lucidez en comparación con otros filmes de Marvel, pues parece que allí reside el conflicto de este nuevo universo de los comics: lograr el equilibrio entre las peleas y las palabras. Quizás deberían tomarse más tiempo para desarrollar los guiones en vez de lanzar películas tan seguido, pero bueno… es sabido que estas siguen alcanzando la cima en la taquilla. En adición a ello, consideramos que los films de comics en lo que van del presente año no fueron ni son para nada brillantes, veremos qué sucede con el próximo opus de Marvel, X-Men: Apocalipsis (2016), a estrenarse en breve; después de todo a nivel narrativo esta saga es la más compleja y profunda dentro del universo de los comics."
"Aug 19, 2022",POSITIVE," While an understandable superhero movie fatigue has sat in for many, longtime invested fans look forward to each new installment to the Marvel in DC cinematic universes. For me personally, the Captain America films have been particularly exciting. Part of it is due to my love for the Cap character dating back to my childhood. But it is also because the previous two films have been among Marvel’s best especially 2014’s “The Winter Soldier”. The third Cap movie holds an unusual position in Marvel’s grand picture. It doesn’t actually feel like a Captain America film. It feels much bigger and broader – an Avengers-like installment if you will. Anthony and Joe Russo return to direct a screenplay by Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus. The filmmakers have certainly made a movie which seeks to expand the MCU’s narrative rather than telling a tighter more focused Captain America story. The story is inspired by a fantastic Marvel comics crossover event that ran from 2006 through 2007. The story had a ripple effect that reached to several individual hero comics most notably Captain America’s. Here (as expected) there are few similarities to the comic arc other than a rift between the Avengers. The massive destruction and casualties following the Avengers previous battles have driven governments worldwide to adopt the Sokovia Accords which places the Avengers under United Nations control. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) signs off on the resolution seeing the Avengers as no better than criminals if they are unwilling to play by rules. Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) stands firm in his trust of the team’s judgment and his distrust of the politics behind governments. The rift between heroes presents itself early on but the film takes its time in developing it. Along the way the it ties up several loose ends from the previous two Cap movies as well as put heavy emphasis on his continued search for Bucky, A.k.A. The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan). “Civil War” features so many moving parts and most of them function well. The established characters still have the same charm and charisma and I still enjoy spending time with them. That’s one reason it is easy to be effected once the tension springs up. Marvel Studios has done a great job introducing their characters and developing the relationships between them. A couple of noticables are missing here but some new players are added into the fold (Chadwick Boseman is fantastic as Black Panther and Tom Holland takes on the role of Spider-Man). Storywise things are the best when the focus is on the. But it flounders a bit in telling the story of a mysterious Sokovian militant played by Daniel Brühl. His story is a bit scattered and never has a satisfying end. Another strength of the film is its pulse-pounding action. Part of what made “The Winter Soldier” great was that it used a lot of traditional effects and stunt work. It’s the same here. Intensely choreographed action sequences come in spurts and each are incredibly impressive. Of course we get some CGI, but the hand-to-hand combat and wild chase sequences are mainly done via old-school means and several of the scenes are still carved in my memory. The film also steers clear of the big, mind-numbing, CGI laden finale. No crumbling skyscrapers or citywide devastation. It’s still a violent ending, but much more personal and consequential. The movie should also be commended for genuinely trying to ask some significant questions and deal with some weighty issues. And it doesn’t just toss them out there and them leave them behind. These dilemmas run throughout the film. Characters wrestle with death and loss. Others struggle with responsibility and consequences. And while the film may not be an appeal to deep thinkers, among its large amounts of fan service it does explore areas that few from the genre care to. “Captain America: Civil War” feels like it could be titled “Avengers: Civil War”. In fact, it actually serves as a better Avengers sequel than last year’s “Age of Ultron”. But we do still get plenty of Captain America and his character is still the most intriguing piece in this entire puzzle. But as a whole the movie does more to alter the landscape of the Marvel Cinematic Universe as we know it. By the end things are much different. Characters have been impacted. Relationships have been affected. Most importantly it sets before us a very interesting landscape and the potential for some incredibly intriguing storylines. I can’t wait to see where things go next. Great review! I loves this movie so much, but I did think it felt more like a Cap film then an Avengers one. Infinity Wars (or whatever they’re going to call it now) will be interesting. Interesting. It felt more like an Avengers movie to me but with Cap as the main character. Especially when you compare it to the other two movies. Still loved it though. This was a phenomenal film.  Everything felt…balanced.  That’s a hard thing to do in a movie of this scale, when you have so many important characters and plot points to cover.  I think Robert Downey, Jr gives his best performance as Tony Stark in Civil War.  Everybody else is just as good, though.  The film also blazes through the story.  For a 2.5 hour film, it didn’t feel like it.  It doesn’t slow down when introducing new characters like Black Panther, who absolutely fantastic.  For me, personally, I think that Civil War is the best MCU movie to date.  Considering that Winter Soldier was a truly exceptional film, that’s quite an achievement in my eyes.  This is the movie that Age of Ultron should have been. I completely agree. Age of Ultron hasn’t left that much of an impression with me. This one is much better. Well made and a lot of fun too.  Great read Keith, man this thing has really struck a chord with everyone (myself included, a skeptic when it comes to Captain America films). One of the main praises its receiving is its ability to balance all the characters and give them each a chance to shine without really “outshining” anyone else. (I suppose you can always make the argument Tony’s signature wit still is the most prominent ‘characteristic’ of any of them but still, even he dialed back the snark here. Things are serious man!) I really enjoyed it and gave it a much higher score than I ever thought I would. It’s really good, right. I think Winter Soldier may still be my favorite Marvel picture but this is close. It is really well written and well made with only a couple of things that I didn’t feel worked. But still (as you touch on), juggling that many characters and that big of a story arc is pretty tough. Miraculously they pull it off. Nice review. I wasn’t as big a fan as everyone (thought it took a while to get going and I didn’t feel the initial action scenes), but in the end I did think it was entertaining and I would like to see the airport fight scene again. Thanks. I really went for the action scenes. I really like the way they film hand-to-hand combat and chase sequences. It really fits characters like Cap, Bucky, Panther, Widow, etc. But I also appreciate how well they do when it’s time to go big. The more fantastic superpowers are also very well represented. Pretty much liked them all. I’ve always loved the MCU, despite some of it’s mediocre entries (Thor 1&2, The Incredible Hulk), but this one just might be my favorite. Deeply rooted in emotion, breathtaking action, and a plot that emphasized the consequences of what it means to be a superhero. I can see this becoming one of the quintessential movies in the genre a few years down the line. Great review! Thanks man. I loved how this one asked some deeper questions but doesn’t just leave them for all of the normal cliches. It makes the emotional themes a pivotal part I the story. Loved that! Another great review. Your points match my own. In particular the villain’s story. I felt that if you removed his events the film moves along just fine. I much prefer this to Age of Ultron. Yes! I’m glad to hear someone else agree with that point. The villain of the film was such a far cry from the actual comic book version which is okay, but he was so generic and his payoff wasn’t that impressive. Is that how you saw it? Too late indeed. And to be honest I thought that scene showed such an overused motive. Just didn’t work for me. But he is a smaller part to an otherwise great experience. I’m glad this film is getting an excellent response as I had fun watching it as well as the fact that it was willing to ask some big questions which is what blockbuster films should be. True. And not only ask the questions but be willing a to stick with them and explore them. Really caught me off guard (in a good way). Glad to see you had such a good time with this one. While I liked it, I definitely didn’t love it like the previous two films. Too little Captain America for my liking. You agree too? It didn’t feel like a Cap movie, right? Sure he was a main character but it didn’t have the intimacy of the other two. I thought you’d enjoy this, partly as a comic book fan but also because you enjoyed The Winter Soldier so much. This is a different kind of beast from the earlier Russo brothers film in many respects but it sits alongside it comfortably, and it’s one of the most fun times I’ve had at the cinema with a Marvel film. Liked the action scenes a lot, liked the new introductions, and there was a good blend with the returning ones too. I’m in a weird state where I’m trying to balance the old superhero fatigue with a desire to see standalone films for Black Widow, Black Panther, Spider-Man and Ant-Man sooner rather than later. I think I’d really dig a Bourne- or Bond-style Black Widow film. Marvel has done a really good job overall. I can see it being so easy to grow tired of these films. But they give us such fleshed out and compelling characters each with their own uniquenesses and identities. And then they give them good stories to tell. I also think their casting has been fantastic for the most part. Yeah, I agree. I think one or two of the villains haven’t been particularly memorable, but I think that’s down to the writing rather than the casting or anything the actors in question are doing wrong. Only Hiddleston’s Loki has really stood out for me, though if you take The Winter Soldier as a villain/antagonist, as he was in the last film, then I guess Stan was pretty cool too. (And I remember one great review of Thor: The Dark World where the reviewer asked the question ‘why would you take the most compelling villain Marvel have had to date and leave him locked up in a cell for an hour and a half?’, but I’m digressing now!) I agree. Not the best track record with their villains overall. I to think Winter Soldier was great even with his complexities. Hopefully they can make Thanos legitimately good as well. I too may the point that this could easily be called Avengers: Civil War, but if you did that, the absence of Thor and Hulk would be felt more and more people would be in more uproar.  But, I very much liked this film. Its success in handling 12 characters all at one is outstanding, but also the result of the universe taking its time over the years and actually giving their characters proper exposure, instead of being thrown into one big heap a la BvS. Probably not as good as Winter Soldier (liked that action a bit more), but still a great time and unlike AoU, you actually feel legit change. Great post. I so agree with you on several things most notably Winter Soldier, AoU, and how the universe has successfully built up these characters over time. It definitely has put the Avengers in an interesting place. Odd though, I knew all the others but I didn’t find myself invested in the battle. I also thought they kinda went overboard with the collateral damage part, they took about an hour just to introduce that theme! I do agree with you though that it is nice to see a film of this genre actually tackling such a theme, and doing quite well with it, even if I thought it was a tad overdone. For me, I enjoyed Bruhl as the villain, I thought he was great. I do agree though that his story was a bit scattered, definitely. His acting though was great I thought. And I’m with you that it could have been an Avengers movie. I think the best thing about this flick is how well they managed such a huuuuge amount of characters. Thanks for the thoughts. It is always interesting when people have different reactions. I do see where you are coming from. I just had a much different experience. I thought this one had a lot more heart and much higher stakes particularly on personal levels.  Bruhl’s performance was fine. Really good actor. I just found his character to be lightweight and his ultimate motivations were pretty weak. We’ve seen that so many times in so many movies. I think that was my main gripe about him. Great review Keith, I hope that the ripple effects follow through to Infinty War and aren’t just so easily resolved – just like in the comics.  I like the direction Marvel took with this and Age of Ultron, still fun superhero films but with a slightly more serious and thought provoking streak."
"Apr 15, 2022",POSITIVE," A cinematic superhero crossover to be reckoned with, Captain America: Civil War could have easily been a third Avengers film, given its dozen or more superhero characters; what’s more, it contains rather weighty themes of revenge and how to deal with the sometimes tragic consequences of superhero actions. Under the clear idealism of Chris Evans’ titular Cap, the film tunnels through an emotional core to discover more than just rousing superhero action (although there’s plenty of that, too). In fact, it’s superhero-against-superhero action, creating a whole film out of the best parts of The Avengers when the inner-squabbles between Earth’s Mightiest Heroes turned to blows. Among the best entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe thus far, the entire production of Civil War is a testament to the Marvel film factory, from its breathless set pieces to its sharp exploration of several characters, all within an intricate plot. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo, who helmed the gets-better-every-time Captain America: The Winter Soldier, show incredible confidence in their filmmaking, resulting in a rare superhero film of entertainment and substance on a huge scale. Arriving on the heels of another superhero-versus-superhero title, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Marvel’s film proves it doesn’t require a dour tone to deliver a comic book spectacular with gravitas. Nor does every action scene require pitch darkness and rain. Initially, Warner Bros. wanted their DC mash-up to debut on the same day as Civil War. Marvel wouldn’t give up the date, and perhaps out of uncertainty about their muddled film, Warner Bros. soon shifted their release to over a month earlier. A good thing, too, since the critical and fan reception of the former has been largely negative to abysmal, whereas Marvel’s latest confronts critics in fans but only in good ways. Indeed, writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (MCU writers since Captain America: The First Avenger) incorporate—perhaps unintentionally—an echo of the current political climate, where ultra-polarized parties can’t stop fighting long enough to solve any real problems, or think of the consequences of their in-fighting. And yet, the scripters imbue the material with plenty of levity during the 146-minute production, which somehow breezes by and feels light as a feather, despite some heavy stuff happening onscreen. Civil War was adapted from the limited 2006-2007 comic book series of the same name written by Mark Millar and penciled by Steve McNiven, one of the best comic storylines this critic (and former comic aficionado) has ever read. Just as Iron Man (2008) launched a bold new era of superheroes and The Avengers (2012) synthesized multiple heroes into an incredibly fun and engaging extravaganza, the adaptation of Civil War feels like a watershed moment in the MCU, both from a story perspective and in terms of pure filmmaking. Winter Soldier donned a ‘70s spy-thriller cover, Ant-Man was a heist comedy, and Guardians of the Galaxy was a sci-fi fantasy, but the strength of Civil War‘s narrative far outweighs the need to apply a preexisting genre. However, an in-film reference to The Manchurian Candidate wasn’t by accident; like John Frankenheimer’s 1962 classic, Civil War features a brainwashed character dealing with the emotional downfall of his condition. And like that film, it’s also paranoid, conceptually frightening, and challenging at every turn. At the end of Winter Soldier, Captain America and his friend Sam Wilson, aka Falcon (Anthony Mackie), began looking for Cap’s old friend Bucky (Sebastian Stan), a former mind-controlled HYDRA assassin on the run and trying to remember his earlier self. In the meantime, a series of public incidents (most prominently those in Avengers: Age of Ultron) has led world governments to conceive the Sokovia Accords, a document headed by the dogmatic Secretary Ross (William Hurt, reprising his role as the governmental nut from The Incredible Hulk), stating all super-beings are restricted from using their powers unless ordered to do so by the United Nations. Feeling a grave sense of responsibility for lives lost in Sokovia, Tony Stark, aka Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), signs away his superhero rights and asks others to sign as well. He’s joined by the synthetic person Vision (Paul Bettany), the military man War Machine (Don Cheadle), and shockingly Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), the latter of whom seems to see both sides of the argument, but refuses to fight the impending tide. Captain America doesn’t see registering or restricting his super-human heroism as a positive change; he views it as putting a committee in charge, possibly subjecting the Avengers to specific political agendas. He finds sympathizers in Falcon, the unpredictable Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), back-out-of-retirement Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), newly recruited Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), and eventually Bucky—though it was Bucky’s alleged activities in the first-half of Civil War that make any counterargument to the Sokovia Accord impossible. Those who refuse to sign and use their super-powers anyway become wanted; they’re soon tracked down by Ross and thrown into a floating prison in the sea. Inevitably, as Cap tries to protect his friend Bucky from those who would take him out, the ideologies implode, and friends face one another on the battlefield. From there, the story becomes more complicated with the inclusion of Daniel Brühl’s mysterious character Zemo, who schemes to get closer to Bucky for reasons unknown. Although the presence of Zemo should not be overlooked (Brühl makes a nefarious, tragically influenced villain), the most nuanced performances belong to Evans and Downey, as one might expect. Despite his character’s all-American frontage, Steve Rogers has been increasingly disenchanted by the modern world, his ‘40s idealism rocked by harsh doses of today’s cruel reality. Evans carries that pain under the surface with a just-detectable sadness beneath his unpopular optimism, and Johansson’s role furthers that sadness with her character’s similar duality. Downey offers Stark the first moments of genuine emotion we’ve seen from the ever-quipping character for several Marvel films, deepening his conviction and showing a more responsible, weighed down, and wounded character. Since both Cap and Iron Man are devoted to the ideologies concerning superhero registration, the depth of the team members who join forces with them are enhanced through association—though many of them may have only one or two scenes to shine. Still, the roles deepen even further by the final fight, inciting audible gasps at a late-film development that few will see coming, because it’s a horrifying revelation more than a twist. Most crucial to the story in terms of new Marvel characters appearing in the MCU is Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, aka Black Panther, whose African home Wakanda is the source of vibranium, and who gets his own solo film in 2018. When his father is slain, presumably by Bucky, T’Challa seeks revenge, but he’s not so blinded by his rage as other characters. Also appearing is youngster Tom Holland’s Spider-Man, the character brokered from Sony in a landmark deal. Though the teenaged web-slinging hero played a pivotal role in the comic storyline, it’s lessened here (somewhat of a letdown to the comic series’ readers, but no less welcomed. Holland shines in his few scenes. Though, this marks the third onscreen iteration of Spidey, and it’s hard to say yet whether Holland will surpass Tobey Maguire, though he shouldn’t have any trouble outperforming Andrew Garfield (we’ll find out for certain when Holland’s solo film Spider-Man: Homecoming debuts in 2017). The film also contains a fine supporting cast: Marisa Tomei makes her first appearance as Peter Parker’s quite young Aunt May; John Slattery and Hope Davis appear as Tony Stark’s parents; Martin Freeman has a distractingly small role as a task force commander working with Secretary Ross; Alfre Woodard, John Kani, and of course Stan Lee appear as well. There’s also a nice romance developing between Cap and Sharon Carter (Emily VanCamp), the former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent assigned to keep tabs on him and Peggy Carter’s niece. Each action set piece—with the exception of the shaky-cam opener set in Lagos, featuring Winter Soldier’s Frank Grillo as the villain Crossbones—looks amazing and showcases impressive choreography, stunt work, and special FX. This is all standard for the MCU, of course. When Bucky or Cap strikes someone, and that unfortunate person goes flying across the room, the audiences feels it as the poor sap crashes into a wall and leaves a dent (or flies right through said wall). Most impressive is the six-on-six battle at an airport, where the film’s engorged roster of superheroes clash in a wowing sequence. Here we see supporting players like Ant-Man (Rudd is as jokey as ever) and Spider-Man (also very talky, which Falcon points out) showcase their abilities in surprising ways. Fortunately, the potential for collateral damage has been mitigated in this rumble, allowing viewers to lose themselves the sheer spectacle of watching our favorite onscreen heroes do battle with one another, without risk of the needless death that incited the entire film. Only The Avengers outperforms Civil War in terms of earthbound size and scope. After the dust settles and our heroes have begun to lick their wounds instead of inflicting more of them, we’re left with much to consider about the role of super-powered characters in the MCU. It’s nice to know the filmmakers are weighing these ideas in a serious way. These superheroes inhabit a world in which people die; in that sense, it’s very realistic in spite of the inclusion of inter-galactic gemstones, gamma radiation mutants, and alternate spatial realms. The survivors of superhero violence have some very strong feelings about what’s happened to their loved ones. With any luck, some tense post-film debates will take place among viewers, because Civil War doesn’t provide a “right answer”, nor does it pick a side. Locking up superheroes who refuse to sign a piece of paper seems dangerous, because without them, a villain could do harm to countless innocents. On the other hand, how does the public reconcile when hundreds or even thousands are left dead after the events of The Avengers: Age of Ultron? Human beings need someone to blame when something bad happens, and super-humans are not immune to this. Captain America: Civil War creates a filmic conversation about this theme, and amid some remarkable escapist awe, leaves us thinking about its effect on our heroes in a purely dramatic way."
"Feb 14, 2022",POSITIVE," In the 8 years that the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been around, the films have gone from franchise/universe establishing films to a “they’ll come no matter what we give them” mindset. While no MCU film is overtly terrible, the last 2 films have shown the Marvel Cinematic Universe in sit back mode, as they have been concerned about their films continuing a story, rather than be an original film, adding depth and story to their characters. Captain America: Civil War has shown that when Marvel wants to, it can provide a breathtaking, action-filled, political drama, and a heartfelt story that will make even the casual film goer want more and more of it. While a big fan of the Civil War story arch in the Marvel comics, the path the Russo Brothers took with the film is just as breathtaking. The film’s importance of accountability leads to the tension between The Avengers. The government feels that the designated good guys are responsible for the deaths of innocents, despite the many they have saved. For this, a registration act is put in place in which the Avengers must register, abiding by governmental rules and requests. They can only act if they are approved to do so. This sets in motion a chain of events that leads to our superheroes taking sides and a back and forth fight that leads to one of the finest action sequences I’ve ever seen in film. The Russo brothers do not steer towards one side, as any cinephile watching this film will undoubtedly understand. They show both sides’ reasoning for signing and refusing to sign the registration act. The motives of each character are made clear and the new characters introduced within the film gain a strong development and purpose for being in the film. The added depth to Tony Stark and his character is a warm welcome, unseen since the first Iron Man. Robert Downey Jr portrays Tony’s internal conflict magnificently. The surprising, best in show performance goes to Tom Holland as Spider-Man. I have never been a big spiderman fan, but Holland stole every scene he was in and truly took Spidey right out of the comic book and onto the big screen the way we all have wanted for years. Captain America: Civil War is the best entry into MCU next to The Dark Knight, one of the best comic book films of all time. From top to bottom, this film is brilliant. DC Comics, take notes. This is not just how someone should direct a film, but what a comic book film should look like, and a great film should be."
"Jan 2, 2022",POSITIVE,"Like their previous work with Captain America, the Russo brothers make this movie a bit darker than their predecessors within the MCU, but without losing the humorous tone that has always characterized the studio's stories [Full review in Spanish]"
"Oct 9, 2021",POSITIVE," As Marvel closes out its second phase of movies with Ant-Man, it opens up the next phase in their non-stop, superhero, money making machine with Captain America: Civil War. Seemingly the last in a trilogy of Captain America movies, Civil War is a strong opening to the third phrase. It addresses a lot of the standing issues after Ultron, it plays on all the most powerful dynamics within the Avengers, and it successfully brings in a new line of characters while strengthening the relationship between the cast. But, is it really even a Captain America movie? The plot deals with the traditional issue of superhero registration within the Marvel comic book universe, something that sparked the original civil war between superheroes, but the MCU has played it a different way. With the identities of all our superheroes leaked by Nat, keeping superhero identities a secret isn’t exactly a big deal anymore. Instead, they focus on oversight for the Avengers, signing what is called the Sokovia Accords — a document that places strong boundaries on the Avengers by the United Nations — intended to keep them in check. After the devastating results of Sokovia, the fall of SHIELD, and the attack on New York, the world feels more threatened than safe with the Avengers around. Tony, appropriately bearing a large part of the blame for Ultron’s actions, feels responsible for the deaths that they left in their wake. He’s ready for boundaries, because he honestly thinks that’s what they need. He’s a man who has never been kept on a leash, and after reaching the height of his own genius and hubris, he’s fallen fast and hard. Meanwhile, Steve sees the Accords as a shift of blame and a political tool. Instead of protecting the people, they can be manipulated by the terms of the Accord. Their agency is taken away and they are left simply as tools for the United Nations. All political powers have agendas, and what happens when their agendas don’t match? He’s a man who has been a soldier, he’s seen what power can be in the wrong hands. He’s not ready to be treated like a puppet. [Disney]Civil War feels much more like a story between Cap and Tony, they have a push and pull that they’ve been dancing around since The Avengers. Despite this being a movie with Captain America’s name on the billboard, it hinges heaviest on Tony. It touches on Tony’s past, on the Starks as a family, on Tony’s guilt, on Tony’s ego, on Tony’s pain and loss. You might be buying a ticket for Captain America: Civil War, but you’re actually watching Ironman vs Captain America: Dawn of More Avengers. While there’s nothing actually wrong with the movie — it touches on some very classic tropes of heroism and guilt and collateral damage — this is undoubtedly an Avengers movie. All of the fight scenes include the Avengers, all of the dialogue revolves around them, and its conclusion suggests more about the Avengers than Cap. This poses the question of whether it’s possible to have a standalone Captain America story ever again. If you were to only watch Captain America: The First Avenger and Captain America: Winter Soldier, you’d be lost. But that’s the confidence of Marvel Studios. They rely heavily on the fact that it’s target audience are loyal Marvel fans, and let’s be real, most of us are. Marvel has undoubtedly summited the mountain of popular opinion and come out on top. It’s becoming more and more obvious that, in order to keep up with the stories that Marvel tells, you can not be a casual viewer. [Disney]How will this fair for some of the lesser known Avengers in the group who are getting their own movies? There’s no doubt that Tom Holland’s Spider-Man will be safe after the incredibly gratuitous welcome he gets in Civil War, he’s projected to be welcomed into the MCU with open arms. What about Black Panther? Chadwick Boseman’s role as T’challa, the newly made King of Wakanda, is damn near perfect and his part within Civil War should chase away any doubt of the standalone film. Boseman’s performance is genuine and incredibly warm, and his story thematically falls in line with many of the other heroes. If anything, Civil War is a better launching pad for the future of the franchise than it is for Cap’s personal story. His momentous battle with Tony is poised as the climax in this film, but it is downplayed as he leaves with Bucky in tow and puts the Winter Soldier back into stasis. For many people wondering if either Sam Wilson or Bucky would pick up the shield after Steve leaves (especially with Chris Evans’ contract running out after Infinity War) it’s unclear what will happen. Steve drops his shield and abandons the mantle completely. It leaves us wondering where they are going to take the Avengers and Steve’s mantle of Captain America. Despite a confusion in titles and a protagonist, Civil War is a solid superhero movie. It widely surpasses Ultron, which feels clunky and suffers from delusions of grandeur, and it improves upon the same emotional quality of Marvel’s The Avengers, while adding more depth and better action. While facing the task of maneuvering a story full of main characters, the Russos manage to touch on each character a little bit while focusing on the civil war between Tony and Steve. Even with a huge cast that has the potential to drown out Cap, it still highlights some of the best aspects of Cap. He’s the golden boy and the ideal, he’s a good man who doesn’t feel disingenuous or overbloated. Sure, he’s the leader of the Avengers, but he’s still that underdog from Brooklyn. He’s incredibly likable and loyal to a fault. While there’s a lot to dislike about Tony — and really you could blame this entire thing on him — Steve can only really be blamed for wanting to see the best in people and trusting in them infallibly. [Disney]The scenes with Steve and Sam and Bucky stand in place of simply seeing Cap go at it alone, but the trio have such great chemistry together it’s actually a wise choice. Sam brings Cap down to earth and Bucky connects to the man behind the Shield, they both are able to treat him simply as Steve. Bucky’s role in Civil War, despite having the whole movie named after his character, is much larger than Winter Soldier. He plays an indispensable part of catalyzing the civil war, and Sebastian Stan makes a mark as one of the most interesting new characters that should see a rise in phase 3. Given his status at the end of the film, it’s a little unclear as to how that will happen, but as a fan favorite and given the depth of emotional treasure you can mine from his relationship with characters like Steve and Tony, it’s doubtful he’ll be in stasis for long. Daniel Brühl’s Colonel Zemo, who is more a catalyst than a true villain, Wanda and Vision’s relationship (and my surprise at Marvel actually attempting this ship with some measure of success), Ant-Man’s hilariously powerful new ability, Sharon Carter’s expanded role and relationship in Cap’s life, Chadwick Boseman’s origins as Black Panther, Tony’s surprisingly deep evolution as a character, and of course, the Amazing Spider-Man. Brühl’s adaptation of Zemo fits perfectly within the scope of the universe. He’s no crazed Hydra supporter, he’s a broken man bent on revenge. He’s another victim and creation of the Avengers’ callous decisions. He’s not a man without purpose, and he’s the first to understand that in order to defeat the most powerful team in the world, he must destroy them from the inside out. His plan isn’t to unleash super soldiers, but to lure them in and break the team apart completely to take away everything that the Avengers have taken away from him. If you’re keeping  count, he’s pretty much successful. He can call this op a win, even if he is locked away. Wanda and Vision share a romantic relationship within the comic books, and although it seems difficult to imagine in reality, Civil War actually takes the time to not only flesh out Wanda’s character and relationship with big-bro-Steve-Rogers, but also a potential relationship with Vision. Wanda is still pretty powerful within the MCU — lesser than her comic book counterpart — but she can really find an equal with Vision. The two of them share a connection through infinity gems, and I’m honestly looking forward to this weird relationship come Infinity War. [Disney]Paul Rudd makes a great entrance to the Avengers as Scott Lang, and is equally impressive in the Team Cap vs Team Ironman fight as he debuts his powers of maximizing himself into giant Ant-Man. If you somehow haven’t seen Ant-Man, you need to. It stands as one of my favorite MCU movies for working off the beaten path, and Scott proves himself to be a strong individual against the other Avengers. Also, “Hank Pym always said not to trust a Stark.” Same, Hank. Same. Emily VanCamp reprises her role as Sharon Carter, playing on her chemistry with Steve from Winter Soldier. Although it’s hard not to hold a torch for Peggy and Steve, this movie made a good case for Sharon. As a standalone character, she shares a lot of her Aunt Peggy’s personality traits; she’s tough, determined, loyal, and stands firm in her beliefs. Her interactions with Steve are compelling, but despite their budding relationship and its potential it feels a bit rushed to suddenly have him making out with her. This is a relationship that needs to be expanded on, and not pushed. There’s a lot of good potential for expansion between the two of them. A story that developed perfectly in Civil War was T’Challa‘s story. His mission of revenge really gilds the essential themes of the plot. When Crossbones attacks in Wakanda and the Avengers are sent out to deal with him, the mission ends in another building destroyed and more civilians harmed. T’Challa’s father is one of the leaders who calls for the Sokovia Accords, and when the UN Building is bombed (supposedly) by Bucky and his father is killed, it’s heart wrenching. Of course a superhero’s father dying is hardly striking at new ground, but it never fails to gain empathy if done correctly. His mission of revenge against Bucky fuels many of his actions, and yet his reconciliation of his vengeance plays out as authentic even if his revelation is largely off-screen. His interaction with Zemo, the true killer of his father, is muted and defined by nuance between the two strong characters. Boseman’s T’Challa is definitely one to keep an eye on. [Disney]Tony spends much of the movie being the most conflicting character. Although I rag on him a lot, and I share a pretty strong hatred for him sometimes, he is one of the most diverse and dimensional characters. He stands as a strong foil to Steve but also as a character that has truly grown from the first version of himself nearly a decade ago. Struggling with his actions and the results of his ego, he waffles between loyalties. Being Ironman hasn’t changed his personality, he’s still brash and arrogant, lashing out at his friends and allies when his temper flares, but he’s a man with more scars than when he started. He’s a much more broken man in Civil War; he and Pepper have hit a rough patch, he’s plagued by guilt, he’s haunted by ghosts, he’s just trying to keep it all together. The Accords are seemingly his penitence, and he readily signs himself away, hoping to absolve his sins. But not only does this cause a huge rift between his friends, but it does the opposite of what he hopes it to do. He wants resolution, some sort of peace for all the wrongs they’ve committed, but instead he only finds more conflict. Through the story, he struggles with Steve in trying to appease him and keep their group together. He locks Bucky away, he keeps Wanda in her room, he confines Steve and Sam, he does his best to conform to the wishes of the Accords while trying to preserve what he has. It’s a thin thread that keeps it all together, but it snaps so easily. He must fight his allies and his friends, he sees Rhodey suffer a shocking fall from the skies that paralyzes him, he uncovers the truth about the death of his parents, and all this culminates up to severing the Avengers. The end of Civil War only sees the beginning of a resolution between him and Steve through Steve’s letter. It isn’t an apology, but it’s a sort of understanding. The two part on bad terms, with Steve incapacitating Tony’s suit by slamming his shield into the arc reactor and leaving his shield behind. While this letter doesn’t settle their differences, it does open a path to potentially mending their group. It’s one of the most compelling relationships in Marvel, and the Russos do it justice. [Disney]And then there’s Spider-Man. Tom Holland makes his debut as the nerdy fanboy Peter Parker, already suited as an amateur Spider-Man and living with his (much younger) Aunt May, played by Marisa Tomei. And here is where I have a serious gripe with the movie. It’s very clear that they are playing out some of the most likable traits of Spider-Man, with his character largely being a caricature of the beloved webslinger. The way Tony recruits him, while funny given their pithy repartée, is rife with questionable motives. Let’s think about it: this is a minor, a teenager, that Tony plucks from a relatively safe home and recruits into his personal war. Tony doesn’t recruit him as an Avenger, he recruits him as backup for Team Ironman to face-off against Captain America. He brings in a child to fight his battles and be his muscle. Hell, Peter’s first impression of the Avengers is that they fight viciously amongst themselves and are willing to damn near kill each other in order to achieve their personal goals. Peter doesn’t make it out without some bumps and bruises from being tossed around. What Tony is willing to do and use the Avengers for seemingly has no limits. Even as he draws boundaries for himself, he continues to step outside of them. He’s a conflicting character and it plays heavily in characters like Peter and Wanda. [Disney]Some of the most problematic scenes lie in what happens to Avengers who step out of line. They are jailed and kept locked up without trial or jury, and while characters like Clint and Scott are simply locked up, Wanda’s imprisonment looks and feels so deeply wrong. She’s tied up in a way that harkens back to the days of asylums. He spends the majority of the film imprisoning Wanda in one way or another, and this type of protective-yet-restrictive characteristic really doesn’t look good on him. Ultimately, Civil War feels like more of a conclusive chapter for the MCU than it does as a new beginning. New characters are introduced, but the main plotline concerning the characters we already know is frayed at the ends and we are left with a massive weight of uncertainty in where we will go and how we will end up fighting together again during Infinity War. Final Thoughts: Captain America: Civil War is hardly the best Cap movie, it stands more staunchly as a fight between Steve and Tony, spending an equal amount of time on both characters. It is one of the most involved films in the MCU to date, requiring a vast amount of previous knowledge to understand the implications of the plot. However, after the tragically shaky plot by Joss Whedon for Age of Ultron, the Russos’ take on Marvel’s Civil War is refreshing and bookends two phases of the largely successful Marvel Cinematic Universe."

"Aug 27, 2021",POSITIVE," The great anticipation that’s been building up since the last Avengers film is finally over. Captain America: Civil War bounded into the theaters this past weekend with all the superheroes one could possibly want (with the exception of Thor and Hulk). Oh, well. I suppose we can’t have everything. Although billed as a Captain America film, it might as well have been “Avengers 3.” The film begins as Cap (Chris Evans) and Scarlet Witch/Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) fight some bad guys in Lagos. They win, of course, but Wanda makes a mistake and lives are lost. Back on home turf, Secretary of State Ross (William Hurt) tells them it’s time for a change. The Avengers need to take responsibility for their actions. They need oversight and the UN is willing to assign that oversight in the form of the Sokovia Accords. The Accords say that the Avengers will have bosses and the bosses get to decide where they go and what they do. Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) thinks they should sign the accords but Captain America does not. Captain America: Civil War delivers on every level. The eye-popping action moves the story forward and the humor brings the tension down a notch or two. My favorite parts of the big showdown between Team Cap and Team Iron Man were the introduction of Spider Man (Tom Holland) and Ant Man (Paul Rudd). Both went totally fan boy upon meeting the Avengers and as they fight, they throw out great one liners like, “You have a metal arm! Cool!” From the perspective of values, the film provides much to talk about. The central issue that causes the “civil war” is not a black and white one. Should they sign the Sokovia Accords and give up their freedom to exercise their super-ness as they see fit or give the say-so to others? Iron Man and his supporters want to sign for good reasons but Captain America and his supporters don’t want to sign for equally good reasons. But instead of sitting down and talking it out, they fight. If any of the Avengers were spiritual or religious people, they might have done well to ask the Holy Spirit for guidance. They still may have disagreed but maybe they could have avoided the fight, which had it’s own tragic consequences. As each Avenger chooses sides for his/her own reasons the opportunities to talk things out continue to diminish. The more personal wedge between Cap and Iron Man comes in the form of Bucky Barnes/Winter Soldier. The loyalty that Cap/Steve Rogers shows to his childhood friend made me think that every person should have such a fiercely loyal friend. The hurt suffered by Tony Stark requires forgiveness but Tony is not emotionally able to forgive. Again, neither one of them is right or wrong. They just approach the situation with different mindsets. Can they work it out? What might you do in this situation? I don’t want to give away anything by delving too deeply, but here are some other themes worthy of mindful conversation once you’ve seen the film: conviction, self-sacrifice, hurtful manipulation, taking responsibility, forgiveness, reconciliation, discernment, friendship, and justice.

"Aug 18, 2021",POSITIVE," In the long run, it’s unlikely the notion of Team Cap or Team Iron Man will take root in the cultural lexicon in the same manner as, say, Team Beatles or Team Elvis or even Team Boxers or Team Briefs, but that’s mainly because Team Marvel overpowers them both. In an era when superhero flicks hit theaters with the same frequency as bugs hit windshields, Captain America: Civil War still manages to rise above the fray and declare itself one of the finest pictures yet from Team Stan Lee. Or should this thing have been called Avengers: Civil War? It could certainly go both ways. With no less than 12 superheroes on display, this clearly isn’t a one-man show; at the same time, it’s apparent that Captain America (as always, played to perfection by Chris Evans) is the principal character in this chapter of the ongoing saga, more personally tied to the proceedings thanks to the involvement of his childhood friend Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), now known (and feared) as the Winter Soldier. Directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo and scripters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely are able to make Civil War feel like a direct follow-up to both 2014’s Captain America: The Winter Soldier and 2015’s Avengers: Age of Ultron. Intriguingly, it shares narrative material with the lambasted Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, with a discussion of whether superheroes should be allowed to roam — and fight — as they please or whether there should be some sort of governmental oversight when their actions lead to collateral damage. This issue comes to a head right at the beginning of this picture, as civilian deaths lead both the U.S. government (repped by William Hurt) and the United Nations to propose a resolution wherein the Avengers will only act when given permission by these bodies. And here’s where the movie really starts to flex its intelligence, since it would be logical to assume that the patriotic, by-the-book Cap/Steve Rogers would be the one to agree to this and the arrogant, maverick Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) would be the one to snort and walk away. But after the events of Captain America: The Winter Soldier, wherein Steve witnessed corruption at the highest levels of government, he’s no longer the all-trusting innocent, and he balks at this executive order. Stark, on the other hand, is haunted by a number of deaths — many at the hands of his creation Ultron — and he thinks that maybe the Avengers should be reined in a bit. The line in the sand becomes even more pronounced once Bucky is fingered for a terrorist bombing and Rogers comes to his aid, thereby establishing himself and his allies as fugitives. Some, like War Machine/James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) and Vision (Paul Bettany), strongly side with Iron Man. Others, such as the Scarlet Witch/Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) and Hawkeye/Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner), firmly align themselves with Cap. And with heroes to the left of her, heroes to the right, here’s Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), stuck in the middle. Black Widow (aka Natasha Romanoff) continues to be perhaps the most fascinating and complex character in this Marvel world order: smart, brave, witty, troubled, and able to read people and situations better than most of the others. She’s a dynamic figure — gee, you think somebody would give her a movie of her own. There’s very little that Captain America: Civil War does wrong. After Avengers: Age of Ultron, which allowed too much bloat to get in the way of some socko individual scenes, this one establishes a beautiful balance between quieter character-driven sequences and splashy action set-pieces (the airport skirmish goes on a tad too long for my liking, but since it’s clearly the movie’s showcase moment, others doubtless won’t complain). Tom Holland is introduced as the new Spider-Man/Peter Parker, and after the miscasting of Andrew Garfield in those underwhelming Amazing Spider-Hipster flicks, he’s simply divine, the geeky, motormouth teen we all know and love — along with Anthony Mackie’s Falcon/Sam Wilson and Paul Rudd’s Ant-Man/Scott Lang, he provides most of the film’s knowing laughs. Also new to the roster is T’Challa (Chadwick Boseman, further demonstrating his range following his Jackie Robinson in 42 and his James Brown in Get On Up), African royalty who dons the sleek duds to fight crime as the Black Panther. T’Challa’s involvement in the proceedings ultimately becomes as personal as Steve’s, and he figures in many of the picture’s best moments. Finally, there’s the villain of the piece: Zemo (Daniel Bruhl, so excellent as Rush‘s Niki Lauda), an ordinary man as opposed to the godlike likes of Loki and Ultron. Never missing a chance to add twisty issues of morality to their saga, Markus and McFeely provide even Zemo with enough backstory to make his reasons for his wrongdoing impossible to dismiss out of hand. And, yes, there’s the requisite cameo by the one and only Stan Lee. The Marvel maestro has now clocked appearances in over two dozen superhero films, but his brief bit here ranks among the best. So does the movie itself."
"Aug 5, 2021",POSITIVE,"  Now that they are 13 movies into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Marvel president Kevin Feige and the rest of his brain trust can do almost whatever they want and have it be successful. The latest, Captain America: Civil War, is an Avengers movie without being called one by name, a subtle difference that allows it to advance the larger MCU narrative while still telling a stand-alone story.  Following the last Captain America movie, The Winter Soldier, and Avengers 2, Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) finds himself at a crossroads personally and professionally. Fallout from Avengers missions around the globe have led to a call for greater oversight on the superhero group, an idea Rogers objects to but one which Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) thinks might be necessary.  When Rogers’ old friend/new nemesis Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) is accused of a bombing he may or may not have committed, the disagreement reaches a boil, pitting not only Captain America against Iron Man but also forcing other Avengers like Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Falcon (Anthony Mackie), War Machine (Don Cheadle), and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) to choose sides.  Coming so soon after another superhero face-off in Batman v Superman, it’d be easy to dismiss this movie as a tired, unimaginative way to insert conflict where none is needed. But directors Anthony and Joe Russo and screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely make the movie about way more than just the spectacle of the superheroes fighting each other.  For one, they keep the story relatively focused, allowing the details of the escalating argument to be laid out in precise and understandable terms. Side stories such as the introduction of T’Challa/Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) are integrated so well into the flow of the plot that they never become a distraction.  And they also introduce real, human emotions into the proceedings, a concept that is often foreign to superhero movies. The concern over the unintentional but tangible damage the Avengers’ exploits cause sets the stage for final act revelations that are relatable to anybody, superhero or not.  If you’re a fan of the patented lighthearted tone of the MCU, you won’t be disappointed despite the heaviness of much of the film. The big clash between the two sides is notable as much for its great action as it is for the quips that fly back and forth. The presence of new recruits Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and Spider-Man (Tom Holland) help this aspect immensely; they're there as much for comic relief as for their fighting prowess.  Most of the actors have perfected their takes on their respective roles, leaving any critiques of their performances null and void. Newcomers like Boseman and Holland fit in seamlessly, while Daniel Bruhl offers a nice respite as the low-key villain Zemo. Captain America: Civil War shows that the overseers of the MCU have yet to rest on their laurels. If anything, given the coming onslaught of Star Wars movies and renewed interest in the DC Comics universe, this film indicates that they are redoubling their efforts to prove their dominance is well founded. 1.

"Jun 30, 2021",POSITIVE,Is this the best Marvel film so far&#63;
"Jun 24, 2021",POSITIVE," Phase 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe kicked off with a bang. All of the Avengers, minus Hulk and Thor, are present in what is basically Avengers 2.5, and they’re forced to face the music for all of the casualties that they may or may not be responsible for while they’ve been off superheroing. Similar to the start of Phase 2, we start this section of the MCU with the end of the trilogy of one of our major heroes. Despite Civil War being filled to the brim with returning characters, as well as a couple of new ones, it is still very much a Captain America movie. When an Avengers mission in Lagos, Nigeria is botched and several civilians are killed, the United Nations comes together to draft the Sokovia Accords, legislation that would put the Avengers under government supervision, signed by 117 countries. Tony Stark, reeling from the consequences of his actions in Age of Ultron, and, well, every other film, is the first to sign up. Tony’s entire story has been about accountability and the dangers of unchecked power. “We need to be put in check. Whatever form that takes, I’m game. If we can’t accept limitations, we’re boundary-less, we’re no better than the bad guys.” Steve Rogers disagrees. As someone who has seen firsthand the problems of government authority and oversight, he knows that the safest hands are their own. Steve views signing the Accords as a way of throwing in the towel and not taking responsibility for their actions. To Steve, the United Nations is still run by people with agendas, and agendas change. “If we sign these we surrender our right to choose. What if this panel sends us somewhere we don’t think we should go? What if there’s somewhere we need to go, and they don’t let us?” There’s no real right or wrong answer here (though I’m Team Cap, all the way). Both sides of the argument have strong legs to stand on. Steve and Tony’s stances are directly influenced by their previous experiences and ideals throughout multiple films, and this is what makes Civil War the first real payoff for Marvel, for all of those years of storytelling. We know both characters like the back of our hand at this point, so we understand where both are coming from and why they choose the side they choose. This journey through eight years and twelve films have left us with quite an emotional investment, so the tragedy of what Steve and Tony’s disagreement turns into resonates strongly with any fan of this universe. While the plot of the film is a direct response to ending of Age of Ultron, it also is a continuation of the story that began in The Winter Soldier. Bucky Barnes has been on the lamb since the fall of S.H.I.E.L.D., but when he is framed for bombing the U.N., he becomes the number one target around the world. Steve buries his former love Peggy Carter, and now the only remaining part of the life he once had is Bucky, and he will do anything to save and protect his best friend, even if it means becoming an international criminal by assisting him. The final chapter of the Captain America trilogy seeks to explore the man behind the shield, and we finally learn how Steve Rogers may not be so perfect after all. Steve Roger’s flaw, and weakness, is Bucky. Steve is thrown off his game and hesitates at the mere mention of Bucky’s name during the mission in Lagos, which leads to the death of innocents. He forfeits his position as leader of the Avengers to find and protect Bucky, and is labeled as a war criminal in doing so. In the end, he gets half of the Avengers team hurt and imprisoned, and loses the friendship and respect of Tony, all in his quest to protect Bucky. Steve loves Bucky more than anyone. No matter how close he’s become to his friends like Sam and Natasha, they pale in comparison to his relationship with Bucky. Bucky was there for Steve when he had no one else in his life, and protected him through it all. Now their roles are reversed, and Steve cannot sit idly by while others seek to kill his friend, even if the consequences for doing so are steep. “How nice to finally find a flaw.” Zemo’s plan is to tear the Avengers apart from the inside, fueling the fire made by the Accords, until they can no longer function as a team and collapse. “An empire toppled by its enemies can rise again. But one which crumbles from within? That’s dead. Forever.” Zemo poses no physical threat to our heroes, challenging them instead strictly through scheming and manipulation. He has no ties to Hydra (in fact, he kills a Hydra agent during his quest) or any other evil organization. Throughout the film it even seems as if he’s questioning what he’s doing, having to listen to the final voicemail left by his wife over and over to remind himself why he’s on this mission. And once his plan is complete, with the Avengers splintered, imprisoned, and their two leaders fighting to the death below him, there is no glory in it for him, and little satisfaction. He listens to the voicemail one last time, deletes it, and then attempts to put a bullet through his brain. Zemo’s plan may be a bit convoluted, with too many moving pieces that are required to go exactly right at the exact right time, but he’s a fresh take on what a villain can be in a superhero film, and I think he’s a wonderful addition to the MCU. The many years and films that Marvel Studios spent world and character building are what makes Civil War work so well. It’s a film that you really do need to have seen the previous films to understand, and it takes all that’s come before to turn in a film that’s both a huge spectacle (the airport battle was the entire selling point) and an emotional gut-punch. The Russo’s are firing on all fronts. Between Winter Soldier and Civil War, they show that they truly understand each character in the MCU roster, and can deliver personal stories within a large cast. I struggle in deciding which film of theirs is the superior one, but both are the best of the best that Marvel has had to offer, and it’s why they’ve been entrusted with Infinity War and Avengers 4. Black Panther and Spider-Man are fantastic additions to the Marvel universe. T’Challa instantly became one of the coolest heroes with one of the coolest suits, and even with all that’s going on in Civil War, gets his own character arc centered around not allowing vengeance to consume him, as it consumes everyone else around him. Spider-Man just being in this movie is a miracle in itself, a pipe dream that I didn’t think I’d ever get to see. Tom Holland is tremendous, showing us in his first scene who Peter Parker is what he’s all about with his own version of “with great power comes great responsibility”. He and Ant-Man bring the fun and the laughs in an otherwise somber film. The Russo’s continue to show off their gift for crafting action sequences; the airport battle is the most fun and thrilling set piece since the Battle of New York in the first Avengers, and Tony and Steve’s fight is brutal, becoming the most violent and bloodiest conflict we’ve seen in the MCU thus far. Would Civil War have been better, more impactful, if one of the heroes had died? It would have definitely been more dramatic, but I like the Russo’s response to this: “Civil War is about the separation and divorce of a family. If we had killed someone off it would have turned into being about a death in the family instead, which wasn’t what we were going for.” Of course, that’s not to say that there are no consequences in the film, there are plenty. Phase 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is about the end of what we know and what’s come before, as well as the birth of the new generation and the heroes they have to offer. The Avengers as we know them have to end and make way for the new, no matter how much it pains us to witness it. Iron Man’s trilogy ends with him choosing to always be Iron Man, even without his suits and weapons and gadgets. Captain America’s trilogy ends with him tossing his shield aside, and with it, the title and mantle of Captain America. The government he fought for has betrayed him, and the rest of the world has branded him a traitor and a criminal. Steve’s choice to stand firm in his beliefs against almost everyone else is solidified in Peggy’s death and hearing her words at the funeral. “Compromise where you can. Where you can’t, don’t. Even if everyone is telling you that something wrong is something right. Even if the whole world is telling you to move, it is your duty to plant yourself like a tree, look them in the eye, and say: No, you move.” Steve Rogers chooses to be himself, to operate under no orders but his own, and to protect the world and its people without a banner. “You wear a flag on your chest and think you fight a battle of nations.” The Red Skull says to him at the end of The First Avenger. “I have seen the future, Captain! There are no flags!” These words carry ominous weight all these years later. Steve’s identity is no longer tied to his country, nor is it even tied to the Avengers. Yet he is still the hero the country and the rest of the world needs. Even after their fight, Steve leaves Tony with a way to contact him if he ever needs him. And we know he will always answer the call, because he is what he promised to be to Dr. Erskine, the man who gave him his life and power. A good man. “If I see a situation pointed south, I can’t ignore it.” And he doesn’t wish he could. Captain America: Civil War marks a change in the entire dynamic of the Avengers and the MCU as a whole. It was the first satisfying reward for all of the time and years spent invested in these characters and the world they live in. The conflict is fascinating (I could watch an entire film of the characters just debating the Accords) and the personal stakes between Steve and Tony are heartbreaking. The team is split and scattered, leaving Earth wide open for catastrophe. That catastrophe is arriving in a big way very soon, and unless our heroes can reunite, they won’t be able stop it.

"Apr 27, 2021",POSITIVE," If Captain America: Civil War feels more substantial than most Marvel movies, it’s probably because it’s driven by a serious modern-day issue: accountability. After the ever-expanding superhero crew destroyed the fictional country of Sokovia in last year’s Avengers: Age Of Ultron, the U.N. wants them to be moderated by a governing body. Tony Stark aka Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.) leads a faction of Avengers who agree to being regulated, while Steve Rogers aka Captain America (Chris Evans) heads up a group who oppose the move. This deftly sets up the “civil war” of the title, which intensifies when Rogers’ friend Bucky Barnes aka Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) is accused, perhaps wrongly, of committing a terrorist act. Stark wants to bring in Barnes for punishment, but Rogers is convinced his friend is innocent and sets out to protect him. Suddenly Iron Man is pitted against Captain America not just ideologically, but practically, sparking an fiery Avengers vs. Avengers battle that rages until the film’s finale. Along the way, sibling directors Anthony and Joe Russo (who also helmed 2014’s Captain America: The Winter Soldier) do a better job of juggling a massive cast than Joss Whedon managed on Avengers: Age Of Ultron. Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow and Martin Freeman’s new bureaucrat character Everett Ross are frustratingly under-used, but the Russos smoothly introduce two new Avengers due to star in their own movies: Chadwick Boseman’s Black Panther is grief-ridden and intriguing, while 19-year-old British actor Tom Holland makes a promising debut as a younger, more giddily enthusiastic Spider-Man than recent incarnations played by Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield.  The Russos’ action sequences are supremely gripping, especially a nerve-shattering scene in which it looks as though super-strong Captain America might have his arm ripped off as he tries to pull down a helicopter during take-off, but it’s the tighter plotting and constant sense of conflict that makes this a superior superhero movie. At 147 minutes, Captain America: Civil War is probably a bit too long, but it has enough tense head-to-heads and eye-popping fight scenes to override the odd drop in momentum."
"Feb 11, 2021",NEGATIVE," Captain America: Civil War is the latest Hollywood superhero film. It is the 13th film from the “Marvel Cinematic Universe” alone. (There are more on the way.) The new Captain America is now the most commercially successful film of 2016, with its global box office revenue having reached $1 billion this past weekend. It cost approximately $250 million to make. The story of Captain America: Civil War involves a dispute within the group of “enhanced” creatures known as the Avengers over whether they should accept United Nations supervision of their efforts to combat threats represented by various “supervillains.” Governments worldwide have become concerned about civilian casualties, “collateral damage,” resulting from the Avengers’ destructive activities. Captain America / Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) leads the faction that opposes signing an agreement accepting UN regulation of the superheroes’ conduct. Ironman / Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) heads up those in favor. A terrorist attack that is falsely attributed to Rogers’ friend Winter Soldier / Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), the victim of insidious brainwashing years ago in Siberia, becomes the source of further conflicts among the Avengers, hence the “Civil War” in the film’s title. It turns out that someone is deliberately stoking the bitter discord in the group, hoping to fracture it permanently, because of his own personal grievances. Joe and Anthony Russo directed Captain America: Civil War. The action sequences, and there are many of them, are often difficult to follow. The relationships are simplistic and clichéd. There are a few amusing lines in the nearly two and a half hour film. There is also the nearly inevitable, vaguely anti-Russian angle. Overall, it is impossible to care about anyone and anything in this work. There are no coherent or significant themes here. Civil War seems to be suggesting that the thirst for vengeance is unquenchable and self-defeating. Every forceful action––even in a good cause––produces new, perhaps accidental victims, and those who attempt to avenge the latter inevitably perpetuate the cycle of violence. If this is meant to apply to the current geopolitical situation, to the wars in the Middle East and the terrorist attacks in Europe, it is less than meaningless, since it conceals the reality of relentless US and European military violence and neo-colonial aggression. With its fleeting, essentially inconsequential references to the deaths of innocent civilians, the Russo brothers’ effort deserves inclusion among those films and novels that accept––sometimes in allegorical form––the framework of the “war on terror,” but suggest that “good people” (or whatever form of life they may be) can “step over the line” and that there may be a price to pay for the overzealous pursuit of “evildoers.” In any event, the issues and dilemmas facing the characters, the gestures in the direction of “psychology,” are mere scaffolding for a large-scale money-making operation. What passes for film criticism is so prostituted in the US at this point that hardly anyone can state the obvious: that this is a bloated, pointless and dull film, which simply kills (truly murders!) a few hours in the viewer’s life. Laughably, Justin Chang in Variety, the trade publication, calls it the “most mature and substantive picture to have yet emerged from the Marvel Cinematic Universe.” More cynically, the Hollywood Reporter comments, “Call it ‘civil war’ or call it brand extension; call it a ‘cinematic universe’ or a corporate behemoth––the latest Marvel extravaganza furthers the studio’s cross-pollination of action franchises in a way that’s sure to satisfy devotees. Posing serious questions about violence and vigilantism while reveling in both, Captain America: Civil War is overlong but surprisingly light on its feet.” These comments are simply a form of product endorsement. The American media, instinctively subservient to corporate interests, treats the studios and their blockbusters as invaluable national assets that are “too big to fail.” It is a truly dreadful situation. Last July, in a comment on Terminator Genisys (2015), we pointed to the phenomenon of so-called independent filmmakers moving “into the ‘blockbuster’ vortex” as something worth “taking note of.” The Russo brothers were cited in that article as an example. They wrote and directed their first film, Pieces (1997), while still graduate students at Case Western Reserve University, in their hometown of Cleveland. Joe Russo told an interviewer that this initial movie “was a French New Wave-influenced, non-linear art piece that had no absolutely no appeal to anybody in commercial filmmaking.” He told another interviewer, “It was a genre-bending movie. It was about a heist, but completely absurdist in the style of a [Jean-Luc] Godard film,” and “[W]e grew up on foreign films, art house films. [François] Truffaut was a huge influence on us.” Thanks to Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney, who had a production company together, the Russo brothers made their first feature film, Welcome to Collinwood (2002). It was set in a rundown section of Cleveland and based on Italian filmmaker Mario Monicelli’s memorable comedy, Big Deal on Madonna Street ( I soliti ignoti, 1958), about a group of small-time thieves who horribly botch a burglary. William H. Macy, Sam Rockwell, Isaiah Washington, Luis Guzmán, Patricia Clarkson, Jennifer Esposito and Clooney himself featured in the amusing work. (Oddly enough, another “independent” filmmaker who has found himself directing bombastic fare, Alan Taylor [Thor: The Dark World, 2013, and Terminator Genisys], also began his career by directing a movie, Palookaville (1995), loosely inspired by Monicelli’s film.) The Russo brothers apparently played a role as well in developing the comic television series, Arrested Development (2003-06), eventually directing 15 episodes between them. After working on a number of other series, the Russos graduated to directing Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), and now this. They are slated to direct two more Avengers’ films, Infinity War, Part I and II, to be released in 2018 and 2019, respectively. All one can think about is the terrible waste of resources, technology and human skill represented by a film like Captain America: Civil War. The performers, for instance, include many talented individuals, among them Evans, Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Jeremy Renner, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Rudd, Daniel Brühl, William Hurt, Martin Freeman, Marisa Tomei, John Slattery, Hope Davis, Alfre Woodard and others. What are these people doing in this film? Is there any major film actor at present who would say “No” to this sort of project? In any event, the ultimate source of the problem lies in “bad times,” not bad people. What exists at present will be replaced by something very different, its opposite in many respects."
"Jan 6, 2021",NEGATIVE," As with Captain America: The Winter Soldier, directors Anthony & Joe Russo and screenwriters Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely spend so much time ensuring Captain America: Civil War isn’t bad that they forget to make it actually good. Their plotting is as carefully-managed as their shot choices are incoherent and their character-building outright timid. This is fine for the CinemaSins crowd, for whom a film’s greatest virtue is to lack inconsistencies and contradictions (you know, human traits), but not for anyone interested in art or the human spirit. You’d think a career in such masterful, narratively economic sitcoms as Arrested Development and Happy Endings would make the Russos better judges of how to effectively sketch characters in a group dynamic, but all their resume really makes clear is the extent to which the conflict in this, like a half-hour comedy, just comes down to a crazy misunderstanding. Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) is feeling guilty. His career as Iron Man has left him estranged from his girlfriend, Pepper, and put him too close to death too often. He is, he hopes, on his way towards retirement. When yet another Avengers mission leaves dozens of innocents dead, a public outcry leads the United Nations to demand an agreement that would put the superhero team under international supervision. Tony’s in favor, partially hoping some added oversight will minimize “collateral damage,” and partially hoping the agreement will be the sort of compromise Pepper might approve. Tony, as always, remains the only major character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe with more than one layer, and Downey the only star who’s developed his character through the series. Which brings us to Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), a.k.a. Captain America, who opposes the U.N. plan. He feels the Avengers only works because they know what’s right, and can’t count on ever-changing leadership to retain a moral compass. Adding to his concern, the international community is presently hunting one Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), Steve’s best friend from way back and, more recently, an expert assassin brainwashed by the villainous Hydra organization (see The Winter Soldier for this whole deal). Steve insists Bucky either never did anything wrong or was under mind control when he did, and isn’t wild about the shoot-on-sight order various government agencies have out for him. So he goes after Bucky himself, hoping to figure out what’s really going on. The rest of the Avengers – sans the inconveniently-powerful Thor and Hulk, but adding the less-destructive Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Spider-Man (Tom Holland) – are more or less split along party lines, conveniently aligning so that the balance of (super)power is not tilted in such a way that would decide the inevitable battle before it even starts. It’s unclear whether Helmut Zemo (Daniel Brühl), a shadowy figure manipulating certain events from afar, considered such balances as his evil plan slowly develops, but then he’s a pretty useless character anyway so let’s not bother with him any further. The film sure doesn’t. The general idea of Captain America and Iron Man divided over government oversight and leading forces of fellow superheroes to battle one another is inspired by a massive 2006 event story from the comics, but where that took forty years to build to and six months of innumerable tie-in issues to tell, the film compacts everything into a comparatively tight 140 minutes. The predictable effect has many supporting characters (Hawkeye, Ant-Man, and Spider-Man especially) fighting their friends for no discernible reason, and the teams form so quickly that those of us who didn’t watch the trailer fifty times mostly forget who’s on whose side when the battle comes. This would be tolerable if the much-hyped showdown was at all interesting. It’s horribly managed, pairing off various characters to fight one another in an endless series of fan-service sparring sessions that rarely relate to or build upon one another, and flatter than the pages it’s adapting. For as blandly-lit and unimaginatively-staged as their dialogue scenes are (it’s a shame the camera and lighting department wasn’t accounted for in Marvel’s massive budget), the Russos have an uncommonly bad eye for action. The opening espionage sequence is a mess of handheld camerawork that neither conveys what’s actually happening nor reaches the expressionist mayhem of our finer (vulgar) auteurs. A tunnel car chase is astounding in its conception and choreography, but only once you look past a shooting and editing scheme that lacks grace, grit, rhythm, or perspective. They cut incessantly, never motivated by a new action or development but simply to account for every set-up they produced. The Russos seem to have a camera everywhere without once putting it in the right place. They see everything and express nothing. It is remarkable, then, that the climactic showdown between Tony, Steve, and Bucky is so resonant. The stakes – once utterly arbitrary – are finally rendered in personal terms. Even Steve is allowed to act as irrationally as Tony, their selfishness and pride overtaking their plot-servicing motivation. For five or ten minutes, Captain America: Civil War becomes the film it has been insisting upon. But it’s the very definition of too little, too late, setting up a level of engagement it cannot resolve, because wouldn’t you know it, they’ve run out the clock and it’s time to wrap things up, too tidily and too suddenly. The film’s ideological sympathies were evident from the start, but by the end, they’re carried to too emotional a place to simply shrug them off. Usually such unconventional structure is admirable, but when it cut to the end credits at (by my estimation) the start of its third act, I felt shortchanged. For all their faults, Marvel has done a pretty good job of telling contained stories that contribute to a larger whole. Not here. This two-and-a-half hour film with two protagonists, nine key supporting players, and four other notable stars couldn’t even tell one story. Never mind narrative economy – where’s the story at all? Jesus, man. I’m not a fan of the MCU by any stretch, but this is downright scathing. It makes me want to see it more than a positive review would.  “…the Russos have an uncommonly bad eye for action. The opening espionage sequence is a mess of handheld camerawork that neither conveys what’s actually happening nor reaches the expressionist mayhem of our finer (vulgar) auteurs.” They relied so heavily on handheld vérité in Winter Solder, and made almost no effort to make it a piece with the parts that can only be real in a comic book. Here’s a neat scene of Cap fighting guys in an elevator, now here’s Cap jumping out of the elevator and falling 20 stories (ugly, needless Avatar-style handheld zoom) and surviving, and here is some helicopter shots of Cap leaping from a motorcycle onto a harrier jet and defusing it single-handedly. They use the style so they can avoid stylistic decisions, ones that would make sense, because their audience is undemanding children who need a minimal amount of semaphore to conclude that this is a “70’s-style conspiracy thriller”. Calum Marsh really nailed it when he said something along the lines of, “oh, so when you guys said Winter Soldier was a 70s-style conspiracy thriller, you meant a 90s-era James Bond movie.” This isn’t to knock the latter, as such, and I’m not even a gigantic fan of Three Days of the Condor or The Parallax View, but there’s a pretty wide gulf there. That serious people are still repeating this bit of ad copy two years later is…unfortunate. And I’m not against using vérité style amidst ridiculous stunts (I think the Bourne movies bridge this gap pretty effectively), but the Russos just don’t have a sense of how to utilize it. Everything “adds up” in that you can more or less tell what’s happening (really just the bargain-basement level of expectations on a movie that costs as much as these do). As you said, though, you still need to make decisions along the way – where to put the camera, how long to hold there, why you’re cutting when you do. Everything about their visual scheme suggests they just set up as many cameras as they could, anywhere they could, to ensure it would all “add up.” While I don’t necessarily respond super well to how the Russos approach action, I will say that their chaotic sensibilities seem to make more sense for a hand-to-hand combat type of film, which is what we had in WINTER SOLDIER (which is why the elevator sequence worked so well for me). Captain America as a character operates on a much smaller level than other superheroes, so it makes sense that the action would be cut from that Bourne cloth.
It’s only when the action requires a more epic scale (as in the big superhero battle in CIVIL WAR) that their instincts fail them. So I’m now officially worried about the action in INFINITY WAR, which will have a galactic scale that I don’t think they’ll be up to handling."
"Dec 4, 2020",NEUTRAL," hen an assault on a chemical facility in Lagos breaks out, Captain America (Chris Evans) and several members of the Avengers, including Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Falcon (Anthony Mackie), and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), intervene to thwart the attempted theft of biohazardous material. But their involvement comes at a price. As numerous civilian casualties becomes the much-debated result of the Avengers’ latest efforts, additionally resurfacing countless other forms of collateral damage from previous earth-shattering clashes, the world demands accountability from the crime-fighting organization. 117 countries agree on the “Sokovia Accords,” a document outlining rules that the Avengers must follow, dictating how and when they can commit to action. But when the UN building in Vienna is bombed on the day of the signing, and Bucky Barnes, aka the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), is implicated in the attack, Captain America knows he must locate his elusive friend before the authorities do – in order to save his life. While the First Avenger heads to Bucharest to look for Barnes, an arcane threat works from the shadows to cause a rift in the superhero alliance. As Iron Man and Captain America are forced to take opposing sides, each leader recruits members old and new to aid in their fight for the truth. Clearly, this third Captain America movie might as well be the third Avengers movie. By anyone’s count, there are more superheroes here than in any of the previous Marvel epics. But, that’s also part of the problem. Following the downward trend for entertainment value in the X-men movies, this continuing chapter insists upon inventing all sorts of correlating types of kryptonite (or, more specifically, technology or supervillains or superweapons) to combat the new batch of superheroes. And each new hero, whether they’re extraterrestrial or some kind of mutant, has special powers that would make them utterly invincible – were it not for the convenient countermeasure always within grasp of the antagonists (and just out of reach of the authorities). Opening with the dullest of cold opens, “Captain America: Civil War” sets about establishing an exhaustingly circuitous plot of betrayal, infighting, espionage, terrorism, and covert operations. Inevitably, all of this will lead to a cacophonous showdown in some abandoned, arctic facility with revelations abounding. But, though a battle in icy confines isn’t farfetched, a sensible reason to bring every contending party together certainly eludes plausibility. In fact, the villain’s ploy is so unnecessarily complex that when the big reveal is finally laid bare, it’s almost laughable in its simplicity. As in last year’s “Terminator Genisys,” with just a few slight modifications, the film can easily undo the entire purpose behind its own existence. “I got lucky,” insists Natasha after she emerges unscathed from a massive bombing of a United Nations complex, which practically crumbles around her. Just like before, it’s a bit much to see normal humans (regardless of martial arts training) participate in hugely destructive skirmishes with alien beings and exceptionally advanced robotic warriors. It’s as mind-boggling as a scene early on when Rogers and Barnes attempt to escape a multi-story apartment building as it’s consumed by military commandos – and they, after agreeing to reform their deadly ways, go to great lengths not to kill any of their adversaries. But nothing stops them from seriously, seriously injuring the majority of the nameless, faceless soldiers. Despite the film’s excessive running time, and the tired concept of governmental oversight placed on superheroes (like “Watchmen” or “The Incredibles” or “Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice”) – the diplomacy and politics of uncontainable creatures spoils the fun of vigilante justice or the belief in superhero righteousness – there’s an undeniable element of fun to the action sequences. Although the backstories and character arcs are compounded to the point that seeing “Captain America: Civil War” is a little like walking into a random episode from the fifth season of a television series, the creativity involved with Ant-Man’s tech or Scarlet Witch’s inexplicable mastery of levitation (and red mist) or Vision’s godlike capabilities (which are also never given any definition whatsoever) provide numerous opportunities for high-octane action. And posing. Sadly, a touch of amusing fight choreography can’t save this overlong jumble of superhero cliches from succumbing to the absolute ridiculousness of nearly all the components that lead up to the anticipated civil war – as well as the silliness of Black Panther (a man who can apparently don a skintight black suit and retractable claws and gain not only invincibility but also the power to defy gravity and physics), an adolescent Spider-Man (who appears really just for the sake of one-liners), and hot Aunt May (Marisa Tomei, showing up for half a scene and half a line of dialogue).

"Nov 10, 2020",POSITIVE," As the 2016 movie season approaches its midway mark, it's time to check it on what's been great, good, bad, or just plain okay. More importantly, what you missed and need to see. Sometimes it takes a few days to truly know how good a film was. A bad one stinks right away. While this year hasn't produced a flawless gem just yet, there have been a few great ones. As the 2016 movie season approaches its midway mark, it's time to check it on what's been great, good, bad, or just plain okay. More importantly, what you missed and need to see. Sometimes it takes a few days to truly know how good a film was. A bad one stinks right away. While this year hasn't produced a flawless gem just yet, there have been a few great ones. Trust me, I never thought the phrase ""A Michael Bay film"" would come together with ""Top Movie Picks"" ever in my life. Sure, the Rock and Pain and Gain were something different but the near three hour brain bashing servings of Transformers films negated a lot of the praise. 13 Hours was something different. Taking a page out of Peter Berg's Lone Survivor book, Bay told the brutal yet true story of six former soldiers turned mercenaries who make the fateful choice to defend a compound against rebels overnight, risking life and limb. John Krasinski and James Badge-Dale led a tough game cast and the film packed an emotional wallop. When you left the theater, you felt a piece of shrapnel sticking out of your heart. The film stayed with you and provided Bay with his best effort. A truly visceral experience. Thank god Ryan Reynolds endured and wore Sony Pictures down over 10 years before finally getting the freedom to make his own Wade Wilson story. He knocked it out of the park, making arguably the coolest comic book film of the year and the most unfiltered take on the X-Men mercenary. The film plays well over multiple viewings and holds comedy to a higher standard than mere action and wise cracks. Reynolds takes shots at Sony, the X-Men, and anybody else wrong enough to stand in his path. The man has always been talented but this film takes the cake for bringing all his skills to light. Deadpool 2 can't get here soon enough. Comic book film fan or not, this film is a must see. Yes, I'm grouping these two different yet eerily similar science fiction stories together because they both resonated on different levels. The Jeff Nichols directed Special starred Michael Shannon and Jaeden Lieberher as father/son on the run from the FBI, religious cults, and various levels of authority in a mission to get to a certain location for a supposed special event. Telling you more would ruin too much and Nichols' heartfelt tale about the bond between parents and their kids deserves as little detail as possible. Special powers are involved and the end of the film delivers a sonic boom to your chest. 10 Cloverfield Lane is a sequel to 2008's Cloverfield in name only. Here, the freak is laid on thick as John Goodman keeps a confused yet willful Mary Elizabeth Winstead captive in a basement for her own safety...supposedly. Unpredictable thrills, twists, and wow moments ensue. Each film is an original piece of work that levels you with a creativity rarely seen in Hollywood today. Each are old school delights. Credit Jake Gyllenhaal for taking an ordinary looking role and turning it into something special and director Jean Marc-Vallee(Dallas Buyers Club, Wild) for giving him the space to embody Davis Mitchell with a wounded grace that allowed for unpredictable events to follow. The story of a widowed businessman who slowly dissembles his life in order to identify why he feels nothing after his wife dies in a car accident doesn't reinvent the wheel of film but truly carves a place in your heart for days after. You may think you know where this lovely indie is going, but you don't. Gyllenhaal, giving yet another great performance as a man running in place, doesn't hold a thing back without overdoing a single take. This film slipped past you once. Don't let it happen again.  The Russo Brothers are deadly, ladies and gentlemen. Yeah, two of my top five picks are superhero/comic book related. Deal with it because like its predecessor Winter Soldier, Civil War says more about the current vulnerable state of the world than most films and political talk shows can assemble in 2.5 hours. On the surface, it's one superhero against another. Deep down, it's two friends being separated due to a difference in idealogy. Oh, and there's Chadwick Boseman's fantastic tease of The Black Panther. Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans save their best work for this film because they make every punch and kick hurt and divide an audience into a cloud of confusion. Do you think heroes should be regulated or should they be able to act when they think it is right? What happens when the good guys square off against each other? Sure, Frank Grillo's Crossbones threw a wrench into their plans and Daniel Bruhl's Colonel Zemo lit the fire before the match, but this quarrel has brewed for a few films now. The result isn't just an exciting popcorn film but instead a cool and thoughtful expose on the difference between heroism and vigilantism. It was nearly two hours and 30 minutes and I didn't want it to end.  Are either of these films legit 5/5 films? Advertise in the middle of the street type cinematic masterpieces? Probably not. 2016 hasn't driven me to take a long walk after a movie(Fruitvale Station) or made me smile continuously for hours(Chef) nor left me with a worthy hole in my stomach(Lone Survivor or End of Watch). These six films are legit delights and require your attention. They offer something different. Exciting, honest, and thrilling. Watch them and tell me what you thought. "
"Sep 4, 2020",POSITIVE," When listing the credits for Captain America: Civil War, it was mighty tempting under ""Starring"" to simply put ""Everyone."" I mean, seriously, who isn't in Captain America: Civil War?  Here's the thing. It works. I admit this somewhat begrudgingly, but it's hard to picture too many devotees of the Marvel Universe being unhappy with anything that unfolds in this nearly 2 1/2 hour long widely anticipated adventure that plants more seeds than Invasion of the Body Snatchers.  Captain America: Civil War is neither as brilliant as some will proclaim it to be nor is it anywhere near a middle-of-the-road popcorn flick. In fact, Captain America: Civil War is a damn near perfect popcorn flick, though it is worth saying that it is, in fact a popcorn flick. In short, Captain America: Civil War serves up one hell of a good time but if the words ""one of the best films ever"" are flying out of your mouth then you'd best be a pre-teen, a masturbatory fanboy or a film critic prepared to fork over your journalistic credentials. After a year that has already brought us the satisfying self-importance of Batman v. Superman and the humorous nihilism of Deadpool, Captain America: Civil War is Marvel at the top of its game offering up what may very well be its finest cinematic effort yet and, at minimum, a film certainly in its top three. We're talking about the serious collateral damage when these superheroes do superhero things that don't quite always end up with superheroic results. You know? Like people die? A LOT of people die? A lot of buildings fall? A lot of, well, collateral damage is done? Apparently not for Secretary of State, played with appropriate bluster by William Hurt, though I could have sworn I saw Trump Tower somewhere in the background. So, it's decided that these superheroes, if they are to continue being superheroes, must somehow be held accountable under the ""authority"" of the United Nations. Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), and Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) align themselves with the charismatic Cap'n. Not particularly surprisingly, War Machine (Don Cheadle), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Vision (Paul Bettany) and, in a non-spoiler, Spider-Man (Tom Holland), a newcomer to the Marvel Universe. It also shouldn't be a surprise that T'Challa, also known as Black Panther, shows up and seemingly baffles everyone while Cap's longtime BFF Bucky (Sebastian Stan), also known as Winter Soldier, both gives and receives ample doses of conflict. If you've followed the entire series, and you have, then you already know that the Russo brothers, Joe and Anthony, have taken over directorial duties for the epically building series and aren't, in fact, leaving anytime soon. In some ways, it felt like we spent the first hour of Captain America: Civil War helping them catch up so we could move on with things. Once we did move on, Civil War was pretty much a non-stop blast. Captain America: Civil War may be too long and too much and too, at times, convoluted, but the Marvel universe is such a relational universe and such a consistently developed universe that one almost wishes the teams behind Hunger Games and the increasingly awful Divergent films would have taken a graduate level course in Marvelology (I made that up!) as a way of figuring out how to effectively develop multiple threads that actually mean something and actually go somewhere! Somehow, despite nearly impossible odds, Captain America: Civil War is both convoluted yet in the end makes perfect sense. Robert Downey Jr., who seems to have bounced out of his master thespian phase and full-on into his ""I can't believe they pay me this much effin' money"" phase, manages to dish up a nicely shaded and more emotionally complex Stark/Iron Man than we've seen yet in these films. Similarly, Chris Evans adds layers of emotional honesty and spark to Cap that help to give Captain America: Civil War an emotional resonance that sits comfortably alongside all those high-tech action sequences. Chadwick Boseman is a welcome newcomer as T'Challa/Black Panther, proving once again that Boseman is one of Hollywood's best of the up-and-coming actors. Tom Holland steals just about every scene he's in as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Both Boseman and Holland have upcoming stand-alone films - I can't wait. Captain America: Civil War isn't a flawless film, though I'm guessing most diehard fans will be more in awe of it than newcomers to the Marvel universe. As a non-fanboy, I was completely geeked out by Holland's Spider-Man, but I had little trouble both enjoying the film immensely and recognizing the errors of its ways. Despite some modest reservations, there's little denying that there's much to enjoy here in a film that does right just about everything that Batman v. Superman did wrong, though I happen to be one of the few film journalists who also gave Batman v. Superman a modest thumbs up. Intelligent, insightful, consistent and the perfect balance of action-packed meets emotionally meaningful, Captain America: Civil War sets everything up and makes sure that we absolutely fall for it."
"Jul 17, 2020",POSITIVE," With the Marvel Cinematic Universe showing no signs of slowing down, Captain America: Civil War is the latest addition to the franchise.  The question is – is it any good? I still hold a strong belief that The Winter Soldier remains the best Marvel film because it was self-contained, standing on its own merits without feeling like a set up for another film.  But I guess that’s just the nature of the Marvel Cinematic Universe now – the more they expand along with the characters they introduce (or re-introduce), every film will feel that weight of expectation and tease. Civil War suffers in that respect.  The longer the film went on, it went from being a Captain America film to Avengers 2.1.  It’s not necessarily a bad thing, just an observation. I’ve seen a few reviews online and it seems customary to slyly dig at Batman v Superman.  Well sorry to disappoint you but this review won’t head that way which I will explain why. The argument is pointless.  Civil War was always going to be head and shoulders better than Batman v Superman and that’s down to two factors.  One – Marvel’s experience, given how this is their thirteenth film since 2008 in comparison to DC’s two.  Two – whilst it’s not perfect and can lead to inconsistencies and formulaic structures, the familiarity and build up of the characters means that each film serves as an insight.  This combination ultimately and positively pays off in Civil War. But ironically (which some may overlook), Batman v Superman and Civil War tackle the exact same theme and plot points based on accountability.  It’s just that Civil War executes the ideology better. If you want an accurate and real measurable comparison for Civil War, then Batman v Superman is not the answer.  You need to compare this film to Avengers: Age of Ultron.  As mentioned before, Civil War is essentially an Avengers movie but also a better executed version of Age of Ultron.  The more I think about it, with exception of the introduction of Vision (Paul Bettany) and Scarlett Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), Age of Ultron doesn’t hold up well, essentially becoming nothing more than just a filler. Building off the success of The Winter Soldier, The Russo Brothers deliver a Marvel film with an actual consequence to the Avengers’ actions.  Given the history between Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) and Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), there is an emotional pay-off adding to the choices they made in becoming Avengers in the first place. So what makes Civil War stand out, especially in comparison to Age of Ultron?  Civil War is Marvel’s attempt to make a tonally darker yet serious film that mirrors real world politics about accountability and responsibility.  With exception of a few moments, there’s not many jokes or quips, keeping it to a minimum.  The jokes were a constant issue and distraction in Age of Ultron.  Following in the same direction as The Winter Solider, Civil War continues to explore the morality of war in a grounded fashion.  In other words don’t expect Thor or Hulk to show up. The division in the Avengers comes in the form of the Sokovia Accord (a change from the Superhero Registration Act in the comics), a document backed by the UN and issued by Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt), The Avengers must be kept in check, bounded by limitations to reduce the damage and danger to innocent people.  The first half of the film is a trip down memory lane guilt trip for the team followed by each member of the Avengers weighing up their choices in signing the agreement or not. For Tony Stark and Steve Rogers, their choices are impacted by personal experiences.  Tony’s relationship with Pepper is on the rocks and despite trying to do good, when he’s confronted by a woman who lost her son in Sokovia, his decision to sign is a no-brainer and tries desperately to get the rest of the team to follow suit.  For Steve, his choice not to sign comes from his belief to help people and when bureaucracy threatens to take away that freedom, the ability to do that job comes into question.  When The Winter Soldier, Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) is blamed for a terror attack, Steve finds more justification in his reasons not to support the Sokovia Accord. The clever thing about Civil War is that it never lectures you on which side is right.  It presents both sides of the argument, leaving the audience with the ultimate decision.  But with every decision there is a cost and that can take in the shape of Bucky’s mental torture as he tries to reconcile with his previous life and actions or Thaddeus Ross locking the Avengers up for their criminal activities, keeping them “safe” from the world. In the villain department, I still feel Marvel lacks a character that really tests the Avengers.  Whilst not perfect, Zemo (Daniel Brühl) does feel like an impactful upgrade in what we’ve seen in the past and wished the film delved more into his background instead of coming off as a simple plot device.  Zemo essentially does the same thing Ultron tried to do but actually accomplishes it by driving a real emotional division in the Avengers by fighting each other, something that Age of Ultron lacked in terms of payoff. In essence, Civil War doesn’t have a “villain” – it’s more about the choices that Captain America and Iron Man make.  When the battle lines are drawn, the team recruitment begins and thus becomes an Avengers film. Besides the brilliance of Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. who seamlessly fulfil their roles, the real standouts from Civil War belong to Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Spider-Man (Tom Holland). Black Panther – hell yes!  It’s great to see this character given the big screen treatment but most importantly, his appearance in Civil War is more than just a cameo.  His reasons for the fight go beyond the “which side are you on?” argument.  He’s not interested in their internal battle.  His motives are all about justice and he stands on his own, providing another dynamic to the story. Spider-Man on the other-hand is a cameo but a very enjoyable one.  Instead of an origin story we get hints to the back story, based on his interaction with Tony Stark who recruits him.  The gripes about the previous Spider-Man films start to fade away.  Peter Parker is not the loser, down on his luck nerd like Toby Maguire was or the cocky emo kid that Andrew Garfield played (which annoyed me).  This iteration showcases Peter Parker as the awkward yet smart nerd.  When he shows up as Spider-Man, the quips are not over the top or forced – he reacts like a normal teenager would if you were surrounded by other superheroes.  From the brief glimpses there’s a better balance for the character which I’m happy about. Civil War is also blessed with other character appearances such as Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), War Machine (Don Cheadle), Vision, Scarlett Witch and Ant-Man (Paul Rudd).  The good thing about the film is that everybody gets their moment.  It’s not an appearance for appearance sake and the film makes a real effort to showcase their opinion on where they stand on the Sokovia Accord.  The downside of that is it adds to the runtime.  It was not to say that I was bored, but because it veers off to other characters to establish them, the attention is taken away from Captain America.  In a way Civil War suffers the same problem with Age of Ultron.  With so many characters on-screen, the film can start to feel a bit overcrowded. The action scenes are another positive highlight from Civil War.  At times it can be breathless but with the tight cuts in the editing between punches, the other downside is that you don’t really get to see the action as the film mostly utilises the shaky cam approach from the Bourne films.  Plus the fights do go on for a while and there’s only so much punching and kicking before it starts to feel slightly repetitive. To end this review on a positive note, Captain America: Civil War is a good film and truly believe that the Marvel Cinematic Universe is in good hands with The Russo Brothers.  In both Winter Soldier and Civil War, their expert handling of the characters keeps you interested and most importantly, caring about their actions.  Whilst Captain America and Iron Man’s future was concluded in an open-ended fashion, it will be interesting to see where their relationship will evolve to next by the time Infinity Wars comes around. Civil War is a much more meaningful film and maybe in hindsight, they could have gone from Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man and skipped straight into Civil War. Agreed in full. Winter Soldier remains the one to beat, but Civil War gives it a run for its money. The casting is uniformly great; Black Panther was a great addition, and Black Widow not having her own movie at this point seems dumber by the minute. Also appreciated Downey Jr here – dialing back the motormouth lets him stretch his acting muscle a bit, making Stark less cocky, and more approachable. Thanks for the comment!  Yes at this point, it feels very silly that Black Widow doesn’t have her own movie.  She’s been more than integral to Captain America and the Avengers films than Hawkeye for example and Civil War is another case in the argument.  Even if it’s a mini-series on Netflix, her character deserves something…and some action figures in the toy section! Agreed on Downey Jr. as well –  brilliant performance and we get a different version of Stark.  He’s definitely a character who has gone through the motions since he became Iron Man and it’s great to see that explored again in the film.  The only nitpick I would have is Tony was so convinced in his justification to sign the Accord because of what happened in Sokovia and the young boy…then halfway through the film he’s recruiting a teenage version of Peter Parker to join the fight.  Felt a bit like double standards. Someone over at AV Club commented that it was Stark’s PTSD starting to show, and pointed out that the other characters called him out on bring Peter along too. It seemed a plausible argument. Maybe they’re setting something up for the next movie, or maybe it was just a result of “hey, we have to get Peter Parker into this thing”.  Bringing Spiderman along does feel like a bit of a setup for his eventual movie but yeah, I did think it was weird to see Tony switch from being guilty, then recruiting Peter and then halfway through the fight, he’s telling Peter to go home.  It was like risking his life for nothing unlike Black Panther who had genuine reasons for fighting.  I enjoyed reading your post. I really like how Marvel introduces new superheroes that I know little or nothing about and makes me excited for them. Vision and Black Panther are great examples of that, of course Guardians of the Galaxy are another. I literally got chills when seeing Black Panther in full costume and I loved that chase sequence. Thanks!  Black Panther was brilliant.  Really can’t wait until his solo movie comes out.  I think it will be a game changer.  As mentioned in my review, I just love he didn’t side with either Avenger.  He did his own thing and that was refreshing to watch in seeing a character operate within their own means instead of the usual good vs. bad mantra. I thought Black Panther would join in the fight at the end. But I like how he didn’t because it showed he didn’t side with any one Avenger, he’s on his own path. I thought they handled that well. Yeah they handled that aspect of his character very well.  I still don’t think this is Marvel’s best movie but it was certainly entertaining for what it was worth."
"Jul 9, 2020",POSITIVE,Civil War as a whole was a well done accumulation of previous themes and atonement for the events that occurred in previous Marvel installments.
"Jul 3, 2020",POSITIVE,This is the peak of Marvel's long form storytelling approach thus far-a jumping off point for things to come.
"Jun 29, 2020",POSITIVE," Phase 3 has officially begun! With the arrival of “Captain America: Civil War,” the new set of Marvel Cinematic Universe movies officially starts. Not only will we be treated to sequels to the fantastic “Guardians” and “Ant-Man,” but we will be introduced, and re-introduced, to several characters new to the MCU, such as one of my all-time personal favorites, “Doctor Strange.” This is also set to be the longest Phase, so far, and ‘Civil War’ kicks things off on a high note. When an Avengers mission accidentally causes the deaths of some innocent bystanders from the African country of Wakanda, the United Nations looks over all of the collateral damage the team has caused around the world, especially in New York and Sokovia (the climactic battles in the “Avengers” films). The UN comes up with the Sokovia Accords, which will effectively place the Avengers under the UN’s jurisdiction, where they will decide when and where to send the team.Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) is in favor of the accords, feeling responsible for creating Ultron, and all of the destruction that wrought. Captain America (Chris Evans) has more confidence in the team’s own abilities to regulate themselves and feels the UN might keep them from helping people based upon political agendas. This creates a divide within the Avengers, with some siding with Tony and some with Cap.Meanwhile, a mysterious figure named Zemo (Daniel Bruhl) is manipulating events in order to cast a negative public view on the Avengers as a whole. Some of this plan involves framing and, eventually, controlling the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), Cap’s old friend Bucky who, you remember, was turned into an assassination weapon for the Soviet Union during the Cold War. So, while the Sokovia Accords provides the wedge between Tony and Cap, it’s the question of Bucky’s innocence that becomes the hammer used to drive said wedge into place.“Captain America: Civil War” is essentially “Avengers 2.5,” and it’s all the better for that. It also makes sense. Over the course of his own two films and the two “Avengers,” Cap has become the team’s leader. So, you almost can’t tell a story starring him without involving a good number of the other heroes. I have a feeling this may be a trend for a lot of the character sequels going forward, too.Speaking of the characters, we get both an introduction and a re-introduction in this film. First, we are introduced to the Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman, Jackie Robinson in “42”). He is the prince of Wakanda, and he’s out for vengeance against the Winter Soldier, which puts him on Tony’s side. We also get, thanks to Marvel Studios’ reacquisition of rights, a re-introduction to Spider-Man (relative newcomer Tom Holland). He’s also on Tony’s side, and his introduction in the film is one of the best scenes.Speaking of best scenes, what you’re really waiting for is the big, central fight sequence where all of the heroes face-off in a giant (in more ways than one) melee. It’s exciting, edge-of-your-seat battle that is quite often very funny. When you have Iron Man’s snarky (or should I say “Starky?”) humor mixed with Ant-Man’s goofiness and pitch-perfect one-liners from Spidey, you can’t help but laugh while your heart is racing, at the same time.The film is also unexpectedly emotional. With the question of friendships and loyalties on the line, the plot does a good job of showing how these tensions honestly affect the characters deep down. They have been friends and teammates for a long time, seen and been through a lot of terrible things. They don’t want to be on opposing sides, but they all feel they have no choice in the side they choose. Also, we get closure for some storylines, and none of the heroes arrive at the other end of things unscathed in some way or another.“Civil War” is incredible, moves along quickly through its 2-and-a-half-hour runtime, and cements the fact that Marvel is doing things right and whatever DC is attempting with their movies is only a pale imitation. I’d like to get into the comparison of the 2 comic movie universes, but I don’t think the internet has enough room for a treatise that massive.On a side note:This week, you may have heard a lot about an app called li.st, developed by BJ Novak from “The Office.” I’m not usually one to jump on the bandwagon of brand new apps. I like to let things run for a while and see how they go before I use a new app or, even, a new piece of tech. This one, though, really intrigued me.Even before I was a reviewer, I would constantly get asked for movie recommendations, and it’s only increased since I took this position. While it might annoy some, I personally LOVE it. I have such a vast knowledge of films, in such a wide range of genres and sub-genres, that goes way beyond the well-known and popular titles, and I enjoy exposing people to new viewing experiences. I have been known to go on and on about films I love that many may not have ever seen.So I have signed up for li.st. My user name is DamondFudgeKCCI. I will put up lists of favorites on occasion, but I also want your help, Dear Readers. If you have any suggestions for lists of any kind, send me the idea and I’ll try to come up with something. It doesn’t have to even be favorites. I also have many dislikes, and a few outright hates, when it comes to films.I also don’t just love movies. I’m a huge reader and I love music, too. So maybe combine them? Book adaptations? Film soundtracks, songs or scores? Whatever you’d like to know my opinions on, I’ll try to come up with a list. And, let’s make it hard for me and keep it to a Top 5, because I can easily make a top 100 if given the chance, but no one wants me to ramble that much.In honor of Friday the 13th, one of my first lists is my personal ranking of that venerable, and one of my favorite, film franchises, though I did not include “Freddy vs. Jason” or the remake. Even though some count them as a part of the series, I do not.

"Feb 13, 2020",POSITIVE," With a few exceptions, nobody sets out to make a bad movie. Whether the filmmakers are confident or delusional, they start out with good intentions. But here’s where it gets tricky. In order to make a good movie, you need a compelling story, interesting characters, and a way to bring the two together organically. Sounds easy, right? It gets even harder when we move into the world of blockbuster filmmaking. You have to factor in massive budgets, the desire of nervous executives stifling risk in order to maximize profits, and inexperienced directors getting swallowed up by their project.* These are all reasons why, when the summer movie season starts, many of us prepare ourselves for the onslaught of loud and stupid. Yet miracles happen. Blockbusters are released that not only have spectacle, but also intelligence and wit. Given how dysfunctional and cowardly the modern studio system is, it’s astounding that every year, populist entertainment of quality is released. I’m talking about movies like The Dark Knight, or Mad Max: Fury Road, or The Bourne Ultimatum. That trend continues with Captain America: Civil War, and it makes good on the promise of 2008’s Iron Man. Picking up after the events of last year’s Avengers: Age of Ultron, we’re re-introduced to a team of Avengers on a mission. Captain America (Chris Evans) is the team’s leader, and he’s joined by the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Falcon (Anthony Mackie), and the Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen). The villain Crossbones (Frank Grillo), still a little testy after having had a building dropped on him in Captain America: The Winter Soldier, has targeted an infectious disease lab to steal a bioweapon, and the Avengers aim to stop him. But things go south, and an explosion rips a hole in a skyscraper, causing civilian casualties. For the world, this is the last straw. They’ve put up with an alien invasion in midtown Manhattan, helicarriers exploding over the skies of Washington D.C., and a psychotic robot laying waste to the European nation of Sokovia. It seems that every time the Avengers save the world, they reduce a good-sized chunk of it to smoking rubble. That’s why 117 member nations of the U.N. pass the Sokovia Accords. It directs that, instead of being a private paramilitary group, the Avengers will now be a task force with U.N. oversight. Sounds like a good idea, right? Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) certainly thinks so. Enhanced individuals like the Avengers need to be accountable to the world for their actions. Cap doesn’t like it. What if the team needs to intervene in a conflict, but politics prevent them from doing so? They’re both right, and this sets up conflict between Earth’s mightiest heroes. Things get worse when a bomb detonates in a terrorist attack and Cap’s BFF The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) is implicated. A victim of decades of brainwashing, he’s a walking killing machine who has rediscovered his conscience, and the U.N. directs the Avengers to hunt him down. Cap sets out to prove his innocence, kicking off a series of escalating skirmishes between factions of heroes. Throw into the mix the warrior-king Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), who has his own bone to pick with the Winter Soldier, as well as your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man (Tom Holland). There’s also the mysterious Zemo (Daniel Bruhl), who’s murdering former Hydra operatives, and has his own shadowy connection. For anyone other than an unrepentant nerd like me, this movie shouldn’t work. It has a running time of nearly two-and-a-half hours, numerous subplots and over a dozen heroes punching, blasting, shrinking, magicking, and thwipping. It’s directed by the guys who made You, Me and Dupree. On paper, this is again a thing that rhymes with clusterduck. But look a little closer, and you’ll see why Civil War works so well. Joe and Anthony Russo, the directors of the aforementioned clusterduck, also were heavily involved with the beloved TV comedy Community. They learned how to effectively balance a large ensemble cast, how to portray emotion through action, and how to cleanly shoot an action scene with creativity. As a result, they’ve made a film chock full of propulsive plotting and kick-ass fight scenes. More importantly, the know when to slow down for character beats to let the film breathe. Some of the best moments are between characters who care deeply about each other arguing. Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have been part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe since they wrote 2011’s Captain America: The First Avenger. As much as I dig Joss Whedon and the excellent work he did on the previous Avengers movies, Markus and McFeely are a big reason why the Captain America movies are really the crown jewels in the crown of the MCU. Whedon occasionally has a nasty habit of having his characters sound the same. But Markus and McFeely go to great pains to make sure that every character, even those with minimal screen time, have their own unique voice. They know that one of the aspects making the conflict so compelling is that we like the characters on both sides.** Plus, as much as the movie might seem like Avengers 2.5, this is at heart Captain America’s story, and they never forget it. It also helps that the supporting players are bringing their A game. I’m pretty confident that most people’s favorite character will be teenage wise-ass Spider-Man. Tom Holland’s Peter Parker is a good kid, but he’s also an inexperienced ball of enthusiasm who gets by through equal parts luck and skill. As the Black Panther, Chadwick Boseman is an intriguing mix of soulfulness and nobility. Even folks with limited time, like Jeremy Renner’s I’m-too-old-for-this-superheroing marksman Hawkeye, Scarlett Johansson’s shadowy pragmatist Black Widow, or Paul Rudd’s gushing fanboy Ant-Man, make indelible impacts. Nobody gets left behind. Robert Downey Jr. has played Tony Stark six times now, and this is easily his best portrayal of the billionaire playboy philanthropist. He’s raw, going through trauma, guilt, and anger. The trademark snark Downey has brought to the character of Iron Man isn’t the default emotion, but it’s a defense mechanism, and you can track how he’s grown and changed since the first Iron Man film. Downey is one of the world’s biggest movie stars, but people sometimes forget that he’s an excellent actor, and that skill is on display here. For years, people pointed to Christopher Reeve’s portrayal of Superman as the platonic ideal of a superhero performance. As the good Captain, Chris Evans is right up there with him, equal in every way. He’s the beating heart of the MCU, a guy who does the right thing not out of revenge or loss, but because it’s the right thing to do. It would be easy to make Cap a hopeless square and a guy who’s always right. But maybe he lets his friendship with the Winter Soldier blind him. Maybe he’s escalating the situation out of selfishness. Cap has also changed since his first appearance, and seeing Evans guide him into morally murky waters is terrific. So, rejoice, since we live in an age of marvels. Captain America: Civil War is muscular filmmaking, but never at the expense of character or ideas. Every time you think it’s going to become overstuffed, it provides you with a joke, or a sincere moment, or a thoughtful point of view. Is it the best film in the MCU? I’m not sure yet, I need to see how it speaks to me over time. But if it’s not the best, it’s pretty high up there."
"Jan 22, 2020",POSITIVE," Who knew comic book characters struggle with feelings of guilt, anger, patriotism, revenge, betrayal, and loyalty? All of these issues are explored as the “Avengers” take sides. Either you’re with Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) or Captain America (Chris Evans). They duke it out in hand-to-hand combat. Civil War is an enjoyable, witty, fast-paced, overstuffed, overlong (2 hours 20 minutes) popcorn flick that ultimately delivers. Unlike Batman vs. Superman, directors Anthony and Joe Russo give us a storyline we can follow—as well as the crème de la crème: humor. Yes, humor sets the film apart, just as in all of the Iron Man films, catapulting Spider-Man or Spider-Teen (played by Tom Holland), if you will, into stardom. Holland steals the film with his youth and his charm from the first moment we meet him in his bedroom in Queens, NY. Tony Stark (Iron Man) relentlessly persuades him to help his cause, and Spider-Teen’s brilliant line reads, “I seriously can’t go because I’ve got homework!” Some of Downey’s best scenes have been with kids and teens in the Iron Man films. His character is awkward around them, which typically results in him asserting his adult status. Here, he firmly tells Spider-Teen, “Fine, if you don’t come with me, I’ll tell your Aunt May (Marisa Tomei).” We are taken all over the globe, starting in 1991 in Lagos, Nigeria, as the Avengers wreak havoc in the city while fighting the bad guys. Here’s where the heart of the story lies and asks the question, “What about all those innocent people who die in the destruction for the good of the cause?” That’s a smart question, as lives are destroyed during the “Superheroes” battles—ah, indeed, what about those destroyed lives? Quickly, the film shifts to present times. We meet the US Secretary of State (William Hurt) with a new head of salt and pepper hair and a new thick jet-black mustache. Which comically, I noticed in a later scene, a fan was purposely blowing his rather stiff glued down hairpiece to give the appearance that it’s the real deal. Nope, not buying it. The Secretary of State lays down the gauntlet, handing the Avengers a United Nations agreement that outlines their new laws of engagement; which, by the way, is to be signed by all of the Avengers. What’s odd about this story line is that Captain America, the true (red, white, and blue) “patriot” of the group, goes against the US, abruptly leaving the meeting and going rogue. He and Iron Man take sides and the rest choose teams. Good luck during their battles trying to recall exactly who’s on which side. It can be a bit tricky. The set pieces shot in a “hyper-speeded up” style with major shaky cam action can be annoying, but eventually, we settle in. At times, I found the film to be borderline dizzying, but not enough to take away from the film. The style enhances the action, causing a pumped-up adrenaline effect. You’ll see new characters, such as Chadwick Boseman (James Brown, 2014), who’s introduced as an African president who’s also the Black Panther. Sebastian Stan aka Bucky is an old buddy of Captain America; brainwashed into being a killing-machine Winter Soldier, he can “go off” at any time. Whoa, look out for his deadly silver arm. The soft-spoken villain is Daniel Bruhl (Rush, 2013) who has “nothing to lose,” as his family was killed in one of the Avengers’ battles. He’s the catalyst for the all-out ending battle. As a talented actor, he simmers in the role and one never really knows when he will reach his boiling point. In the end, Captain America: Civil War is an entertaining film while dealing with complex human emotions. Look for more great movies from Marvel, as this one opens up the playing field by presenting enormous potential with a diversified and pleasing cast of characters. Cast: Chris Evans (Captain America), Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man), Sebastian Stan (Winter Soldier—aka Bucky Barnes), Daniel Brühl (Baron Zemo), Don Cheadle (War Machine), Tom Holland (Spider Man), Paul Bettany (Vision), Jeremy Renner (Hawkeye), Anthony Mackie (Falcon), Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow), Elizabeth Olsen (Scarlet Witch), Paul Rudd (Ant-Man) and William Hurt (Secretary of State Ross)."
"Jan 14, 2020",POSITIVE,"  The emotional stakes are high in Captain America: Civil War, a film that ditches overt threats to humanity for a conflict borne from the characters’ beliefs and their love for the people who matter to them the most.  With Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice behind us and X-Men: Apocalypse looming, some moviegoers might wonder why this year our superheroes can’t all get along. Civil War shows why. This is a movie about actions and consequences. Perception and reality. Regret over roads not taken and guilt over the ones that were. Loss and acceptance and change. It’s a film where characters are haunted by relationships in their pasts that affect the present. Grief is here, too, but whenever anger drives these people, no one can think clearly.  Directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo, who helmed 2014’s Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, who wrote that film as well as 2011’s Captain America: The First Avenger, know these characters well. There are setups from the earlier films—the most significant being the childhood friendship between Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) and Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan)—that pay off here in both poignancy and motivation. Cap’s shield might defy the laws of physics, but the characters behave in ways that track not only with other Marvel films but in a way that makes sense within the film. The script draws on characters’ histories as far back as 2008’s Iron Man to show how and why they’ve arrived at where they are today. Yet even with a full slate of characters—and a running time of 147 minutes—it never feels overstuffed or slow.  When an Avengers mission to recover a biological agent results in civilian casualties, Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) says the world’s nations are tired of the heroes’ collateral damage. The proposed solution: the Sokovia Accords, named after the fictional country blasted to the sky in 2015’s Avengers: Age of Ultron, which would regulate when and how the team operates.  When they met in 2012’s The Avengers, Cap and Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) initially dismissed each other as an antiquated fossil and a loudmouth in a high-tech suit. A World War II super soldier living in the modern age, Cap finds purpose in protecting others as he struggles with melancholy because most of his peers are gone. Technological genius Tony tended to shoot or create first, then ask questions later.  Though they earned each other’s respect, experiences since then have changed them. Tony, already feeling guilt over creating the malevolent artificial intelligence Ultron, is doubly ready to reign in his independence once a grieving mother confronts him about her son’s death in Sokovia. But Cap, having learned in The Winter Soldier that the government agency S.H.I.E.L.D. was poisoned from within, is skeptical of any authority beyond the people he trusts.  Once the philosophical lines are drawn, a new villain (Daniel Brühl of Inglourious Basterds) stirs the pot, ultimately forcing the heroes to decide where their loyalties lie. Barnes—himself reprogrammed through the ages as an assassin a la Jason Bourne—is blamed for more mayhem, sending Cap and Falcon (Anthony Mackie) off the grid to find him. On their trail is Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), an African warrior King with a vendetta against Barnes. Meanwhile, Tony, Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and the others scramble to figure out how to help within their new restrictions.  Similar to The Winter Soldier, Civil War balances the clash of ideas with action sequences that are enjoyably fast-paced and easy to follow. We know who’s against whom and who’s doing what, making it even more thrilling when tanker trunks and repulsor blasts fly. The film is full of solid performances, especially Stan as the troubled killer who’s not sure he’s worth his friend’s support; Boseman (Get on Up, 42), a mix of coiled rage and dignity as the first black superhero in mainstream American comics; and Tom Holland (The Impossible), a delight of teen awkwardness and geeky charm as Spider-Man. Spidey and Paul Rudd as Ant-Man pack gleeful surprises as two fanboys who hold their own even as they’re overjoyed to be tapped as reinforcements.  There are callbacks to the other Captain America films, such as when Tony asks Peter Parker what drives him much like the way the scientist behind the super-soldier program wondered what made a gangly Steve Rogers tick. It’s no spoiler that in both cases, these heroes have unselfish hearts.  Heart is all over this movie. These characters care about one another like a family even when they disagree. And when they come to blows, there’s a layer of trying to stop the people you love from hurting themselves or making a situation worse.  Evans sometimes gets short shrift for not having Downey’s firecracker charisma, but he’s always had the trickier task of making an inherently goodhearted character compelling. Here, he shows how Cap continues to evolve while retaining his sincerity and decency, making the Star-Spangled Man perhaps the most hopeful comics character onscreen right now, especially given the DC film universe’s darker tone with Superman."
"Jan 14, 2020",POSITIVE,"Captain America: Civil War is a fun time at the movies, and among the best of its breed, but you can be excused if you feel superhero fatigue setting in."
"Dec 15, 2019",POSITIVE," (Welcome to Road to Endgame, where we revisit the first 22 movies of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and ask, ""How did we get here?"" In this edition: Captain America: Civil War pays off years of build-up by injecting politics with personal impulse.)The Marvel Cinematic Universe tries to re-invent itself every few years, albeit within a limited narrative formula. From scrappy ""real world"" solo films, to fun, landscape-shifting crossovers, to alien family dramas, the series has been laying track for its two-part finale — Avengers: Infinity War and the upcoming Avengers: Endgame — for quite some time.A decade of narrative investment in the superhero genre, especially in a series that aims to be so political, can't be achieved without a feeling of loss. Last year, after having been scattered by the events of Captain America: Civil War, the Avengers were finally defeated.While no Avengers lose their lives in Captain America: Civil War, the team tears itself apart from within; they may as well have lost their identity. The series' long-term personal and political narratives finally boil over, clashing with one another for reasons both idealistic and petty, opposing impulses that are (rightly) framed as a continuum. It's a harrowing watch at times, despite building on its predecessors' confused politics. Debates about military intervention rage on in the real world, and as of Avengers: Age of Ultron, the Avengers' legacy finally began to stand in for America's. That legacy is complicated, and Civil War finally grants the series an element it had been missing for nearly a decade: deeply personal drive behind political ideology. In Civil War, Captain America's (Chris Evans) journey away from blind nationalism comes full circle, though it leads him to an unsettling place: now a self-appointed interventionist, he represents American militarism once more. It's a fine line for a narrative to walk, one the film acknowledges by positioning its well-meaning, destructive protagonist at odds with his equally well-meaning-yet-destructive teammates. None of them are particularly wrong, and for once, a Marvel film being unable to draw a singular conclusion about military power feels textually justified.After a botched mission resulting in civilian causalities, the Avengers are put on notice by a returning General Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (William Hurt), now the U.S. Secretary of State. Ross, who was last seen in The Incredible Hulk, is all too familiar with the dangers of unchecked power. He hands the Avengers the Sokovia Accords, an agreement signed by 117 countries that would place Steve Rogers and his team under U.N. supervision.The Accords makes sense, at least in theory. A U.S.-based private military outfit has no business running unchecked missions on foreign soil, especially when they're half the reason these villains crop up in the first place. Like several other films in the series, Civil War differentiates between the American government and a fictional group meant to stand in for its faults. However, it articulates the retaliatory element of geopolitical conflict that's often ignored in western cinema, especially in the Marvel series.Military-funded Marvel movies like Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Captain Marvel were each made from scripts approved by the U.S. Department of Defense. In the first three of these films, global military conflict was framed either a status quo for American forces to respond to, or as flames stoked by outside actors for selfish motives, rather than something America had a hand in. In Civil War however, the first villain the Avengers face has a personal grudge against Captain America. From the perspective of Brock Rumlow, a suicide bomber, Steve Rogers is the reason he's scarred, and exists without a country. Later in the film, primary villain Helmut Zemo (Daniel Brühl) is revealed to have a similar vendetta against the Avengers; Zemo's family was collateral damage to the Avengers' reckless interventionism.Captain America isn't keen on being supervised. Not out of some vaguely jingoistic notion of ""freedom,"" but because he's seen the American agenda change over time, both in The Avengers and in Captain America: The Winter Soldier. This leaves him in an interesting position. He is, at once, opposed to the U.S. government's idea of militarism, as well as its very embodiment, ready to go to war at a moment's notice.Rogers opposes the corruption and duplicitousness that often drive foreign intervention, while still adhering to its core methodology. In prior films, Steve Rogers was never given a clear ideological enemy, and so his own outlook was never allowed to grow beyond the broad strokes of power. Here, as if to finally course-correct this omission, the series uses his divestment from ideology as a dramatic question: who does Captain America truly fight for, if not interests he, and he alone, deems worthy? Like Steve Rogers, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), a former arms supplier, comes back around to embodying an element of the U.S. military apparatus. But where Rogers represents interventionism, Stark now represents the government control to which he himself was once so thoroughly opposed.Time and time again, Stark has seen his technology misused. In his previous appearance, Avengers: Age of Ultron, he created an antagonistic A.I. that nearly destroyed the world. Ultron was defeated, but not everyone got out of Sokovia alive. When confronted with the death of one such individual — Charles Spencer, a young American on a mission to build affordable housing — Stark's guilt finally forces his hand.No more private militarization. No more unilateral intervention. The Avengers need oversight — but under whose authority should they be placed? The group wouldn't be needed in an ideal world, the kind of world that has been Stark's objective since Age of Ultron, but the old world of war and misery is one he helped create in the first place.For Steve Rogers, doing the right thing means refusing to compromise on his moral outlook. For Tony Stark, doing the right thing means correcting his mistakes. The overlap between these objectives is where the film's conflict is born. Both men were reminded of their missions by their dying mentors — Abraham Erskine in Captain America: The First Avenger, Ho Yinsen in Iron Man — and those missions, which now form the core of who they are, have finally collided.Rogers, once loyal to the structures of western government, has been forced to turn against the very idea of structured power. Stark, once a man obsessed with his own unchecked might, now believes it's time for governments to take charge. Not only have Rogers and Stark seen the folly of their ways — having faced the most dangerous parts of blind loyalty and deregulation respectively — they now see the worst parts of their own past decisions within one another. Per the words of the late Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), Steve Rogers must remain an uncompromising protector, and respond to those telling him to move with a resounding ""No. You move"" (a line taken straight from the Civil War comics). When Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) tells Rogers to move in Germany, he refuses. When Iron Man tells him to move in Siberia, he refuses once more.In either case, Rogers is protecting his best friend Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), whose crimes, both recent and in the past, may not be his own. Rogers' uncompromising loyalty to Barnes, however, is a character flaw that functions the same way blind nationalism would. Captain America may no longer serve the stars and stripes, but he's shackled by the same emotional instincts.Rogers knows that people need to be protected, and he refuses to wait for their safety to be debated by committee. This is his overarching political outlook as it pertains to the Accords, but it's rooted entirely in personal bias. He took similar unilateral action to save Barnes during World War II, and he carries this lesson forward in a more complicated world he doesn't fully understand. He could be right about circumventing approval to save lives, but he may be right for all the wrong reasons.For Tony Stark, a man trapped by traumas and past mistakes, the guilt of his actions has become too much to bear. No matter how many times re-lives the past through virtual reality — like his final conversation with his parents — he's unable to change it. The only results of his obsession are a broken relationship, and an electromagnetic headache that he nurses with pills. When confronted by the mother of Charles Spencer, who blames him for her son's death, he has no choice but to try and fix the future. Though, his reasons aren't so forward-thinking.The Accords aren't just a political document for Stark. They're a means for him to prevent more damage to his soul. Not long ago, Stark was America's military industrial complex. Now, he's a protector unable to move past his own destruction.Getting the Avengers to sign the agreement may not prevent future tragedy — as Rogers rightly asks, what if the Avengers aren't where they need to be, or intervene somewhere they shouldn't? —  but it's a step that shifts the responsibility away from Stark and his team. It's selfish, but it's exactly what Stark needs, though he's unprepared to admit it. Wanda Maximoff's (Elizabeth Olsen) civilian casualties in the name of protection would have been equally tragic if the mission were approved by a governing body, but at least Stark would have a clear conscience.Where Steve Rogers' political outlook is rooted in attachment to the past, Tony Stark's is grounded in his desire to detach himself from it. When Steve Rogers is close to signing the Accords, he's forced out of his decision by factors that feel like personal affronts, whether Tony Stark imprisoning Wanda at the Avengers' compound, or military forces going after his wrongly accused friend, Bucky Barnes. Rogers knows Barnes to be innocent, both for prior crimes in which he was denied autonomy, and for the recent U.N. bombing that killed Wakanda's King. Signing the Accords, at first, could result in Rogers being sidelined, and in lethal military force being used on Barnes instead.If Rogers waits to be taken in, or if he waits for a committee to decide on whether to intervene in Zemo's apparent plan (the re-awakening of more Winter Soldiers), the world could be at risk. If Stark doesn't stop Rogers from his reckless mission, the unstable, malleable Barnes could cause further harm, and the Avengers could be shut down for good.This rift is why the massive airport fight ensues, between those loyal to Captain America — Barnes, Wanda, The Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Hawkeye (Clint Barton) and Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) — and those who have fallen in line with Iron Man and the Accords — Black Panther, War Machine (Don Cheadle), The Vision (Paul Bettany), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Spider-Man (Tom Holland). Both parties are ""right,"" in that they're justified from their own perspectives, which makes the ideological conflict between the two factions engaging. Additionally, Captain America is the film's protagonist, and so we, the audience, have the same information he does about Zemo's plan — information Iron Man's team does not.This lapse in information adds stakes to the narrative, over and above the enjoyable cognitive dissonance of good guys squaring off. However, the set-piece itself, while a fun reprieve from the conflict (and some of Marvel's most enjoyable action since The Avengers) remains disconnected from the rest of the film. Light-hearted though it may be, it feels half-hearted too. It's laden with Marvel's signature quips and rip-roaring action beats, but dramatizing interpersonal conflict through action might have been a more suitable choice. The Avengers fight, but nobody really seems in danger — Hawkeye and Black Widow even joke about pulling their punches — which works in opposition to the film's own premise about the consequences of these battles.The scene does eventually shift toward a more serious tone while setting up the climax — an untrained Vision accidentally injures War Machine, thus solidifying Stark's position — but the scene lacks any real emotional punch until that point. The airport sequence, fun as it may be, is at odds with what follows. It's immensely rewatchable on its own, but in-context, it's lacking.  The film's ensuing rug-pull reveals that both sides were factually wrong. In effect, they aren't fighting for the people anymore. They're just fighting, as they were in the Civil War comics, though their battle on the page carries far more weight than their battle on-screen. The futility of their violence in the film is overshadowed by the fact that it feels like an enjoyable field trip.Thankfully, the film proceeds to foreground its emotional heft in the scenes that follow, as the story is re-framed in a manner that makes the next battle between heroes — Iron Man and Captain America — feel appropriately harrowing. By shifting its major set-piece to the middle of the film, Civil War also sidesteps a climax steeped in Marvel's signature pre-visualized action, the kind often divorced from story. Instead, the film narrows its spotlight to focus on a tale of deeply personal conflict. Helmut Zemo's mission is complicated. It depends on dozens of moving parts, and on the Avengers making precisely predicted decisions. Zemo claims to have studied the Avengers closely, so his place in the narrative is as much a scorned antagonist as it is an invisible, meta-textual hand (Your mileage may vary). His scheme feels improbable in the real-world, but guiding the Avengers to these specific outcomes feels less like plot contrivance and more like catalyzing that which was already narratively inevitable.Every decision Zemo orchestrates is rooted character, set up not only during Captain America: Civil War, but across multiple films. He convinces Tony Stark, with his newfound sense of authority, to believe he's the only one who can stop a dangerous fugitive. He also makes Steve Rogers believe his friend Bucky Barnes (the very mention of whom blinds Rogers' decision-making) is in grave danger. He makes Captain America's side of anti-establishment, gung-ho freedom fighters believe their actions will stop terrorists, while making the establishment itself, Iron Man's team, believe they're stopping future catastrophe by coming down hard on their own people.In effect, Zemo magnifies and accelerates what was already under the surface, bringing the Avengers to conclusions that feel like logical outcomes of who they are.But Barnes is not the real terrorist, and Zemo has no plans to re-awaken the other Winter Soldiers. As complicated as the Avengers' security debate is — and as harrowing as it may be to see heroes placed at such fundamental odds — Zemo takes advantage of predictable, one-track American military heroism (the way Aldrich Killian did in Iron Man 3), a self-aggrandizing modus operandi, rooted in emotional instincts to shoot first and ask questions later.The two sides clash at a Leipzig Airport because they have each been made to believe a different terrorist narrative. They are placed predictably at odds because even their differing outlooks are merely sides to the same fundamentally violent, militaristic coin. Team Iron Man retaliates without complete information. Team Captain America fights on the false presumption of future threat. Destruction ensues.Zemo has personal motives for this mayhem: his family was killed in Sokovia during the events of Avengers: Age of Ultron. To ensure Captain America and Iron Man's fuses are lit, Zemo lures them to the isolated facility of Barnes' Siberian origin. Here, he reveals the truth that Arnim Zola hinted at in Captain America: The Winter Soldier (an admittedly blink-and-miss setup, makings the ""twist"" feel sudden to those not in-step with continuity). Bucky Barnes, while under the influence of H.Y.D.R.A., murdered Tony Stark's parents to prevent them from assisting American war efforts. The man Steve Rogers has been protecting was the very person responsible for Stark's deepest wounds, a truth Rogers has been aware of for years.The political specifics are stripped away by this point. Both sides have come to realize the lies that brought them here, but the personal perspectives driving them have now been magnified. Tony Stark, who has spent years trying to regain a sense of order and control, is now faced with the man who destroyed his sense of equilibrium, Bucky Barnes. Steve Rogers, who has spent the entire film doing what he thinks is right, has to both protect Barnes from what may well be righteous vengeance, and face retribution of his own, now that his unwavering moral outlook has caused irreparable harm. Stark is right, Rogers is right, and they tear each other apart.With the question of Barnes' guilt or innocence hanging in the balance — How accountable, and to whom, is a brainwashed soldier for crimes he believed righteous? — the selfishness driving each hero's ideals comes to the fore. What good is Rogers' desire to do right by Barnes when it's hurting Tony Stark? What good is Stark's newfound adherence to law when he breaks it himself?What good are these debates on security when they're being had by wounded individuals driven by selfish ideology, rather than by common good? Individuals whose sole focus is deciding on the means by which to attack, rather than the means by which to curb their violence altogether? 
Apart from Black Widow, who's woefully short-changed after two stellar appearances, every character in Civil War gets a coherent story arc. Sam Wilson/The Falcon, a former military airman who's witnessed American governance be twisted, sides with Rogers. James Rhodes/War Machine, an Air Force recruit whose 130+ missions have prevented catastrophe, follows Stark. They each side with friends who represent their personal worldviews, despite the conflict's complicated political dimensions. And they each pay a physical price.Wanda and The Vision battle on opposing sides, despite their common and mysterious origin (the Mind Stone). Wanda, having been at the receiving end of military conflict fights to make a difference. She escapes her confines despite being held back by her guilt (Hawkeye, once again, convinces her to stand up for herself).

Expanded from an article published April 18, 2018.
 Apart from Black Widow, who's woefully short-changed after two stellar appearances, every character in Civil War gets a coherent story arc. Sam Wilson/The Falcon, a former military airman who's witnessed American governance be twisted, sides with Rogers. James Rhodes/War Machine, an Air Force recruit whose 130+ missions have prevented catastrophe, follows Stark. They each side with friends who represent their personal worldviews, despite the conflict's complicated political dimensions. And they each pay a physical price.Wanda and The Vision battle on opposing sides, despite their common and mysterious origin (the Mind Stone). Wanda, having been at the receiving end of military conflict fights to make a difference. She escapes her confines despite being held back by her guilt (Hawkeye, once again, convinces her to stand up for herself). The Vision however, knows Wanda is volatile, and claims an objective, unemotional stance in protecting people from her. He throws mathematical equations at the Avengers and calculates what decisions they ought to make ""for the greater good."" However, the realization of his own humanity — that his perspective is informed by emotion, and that he's prone to human error — makes him retreat from the fight.

"Dec 3, 2019",NEUTRAL," The Marvel war party presses on, overrunning the multiplexes this spring with Captain America: Civil War, a movie so stuffed to the gills with characters that naming it after Steve Rogers’ alter-ego is a bit of a misnomer. Rather than unifying to fight against a common enemy, the Avengers are fractured. One faction, led by Captain America (Chris Evans), doesn’t want to answer to the government, while the other, headed by Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), feels responsible for the bystanders who have died during past battles. It doesn’t really make too much sense and the sides feel randomly drawn, but at least we get some really cool fight sequences when all our heroes have a go at one another. Clashes featuring superhero-on-superhero action have long been a staple of the Avenger wing of the MCU films. The first Avengers movie felt more like a Capcom video game than an actual film of substance. This is why Captain America: Winter Soldier stands as one of the better films in the MCU. Instead of figuring out innovative ways for Thor to battle the Hulk, directors Anthony and Joe Russo crafted an action movie dedicated to just one character and the moral quandaries that come with protecting a friend who has clearly done wrong. The Russo brothers are back in the director seats again, but Civil War feels much more akin to Age of Ultron in its multifarious characters, plots and locales than the focused narrative of Winter Soldier. I’ve always taken issue with the scenes of mass destruction that rip through comic book films, usually at the climax. So many landmarks and buildings have been destroyed, yet we never feel the human cost that comes with so much devastation. In Civil War, screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely predicate their story on the innocents who become collateral damage when superheroes and villains fight. When the US government mandates that the Avengers adhere to the United Nations, Captain America worries that kowtowing to bureaucrats will destroy the Avengers. Tony Stark, however, wracked with sadness after more civilians are killed in a botched operation in Lagos, wants to work with the UN. Enter Captain America’s old friend Bucky (Sebastian Stan), the Winter Soldier, who has been brainwashed by the Russians to do horrible things. With his loyalty torn between the Avengers and Bucky, Rogers chooses to go rogue in an effort to clear his friend’s name. Tensions escalate and then it’s all-out war as a litany of Marvel heroes show up to fight one another. For some reason, we don’t get Thor or the Hulk, yet Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and the new Spider-Man (Tom Holland) join the melee. At least new hero Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) is here for a reason, and Holland’s spirited performance gives us something to look forward to next summer when Marvel reboots the Web Slinger’s franchise yet again. Though Civil War teases a climactic battle with five fearsome new villains, Markus and McFeely never follow through with this new threat. Instead, the climax comes when Rogers and Bucky must battle an enraged Iron Man. The Russos definitely know how to stage an action scene, yet the final showdown is a bit of a letdown, especially when the hinted-at melee against these five new villains never materializes. But who cares, right? We want to see folks like the Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) go at it rather than some nameless baddies. It all comes back to that climactic fight where the Avengers try to kill one another at an airport. It’s a no-holds-barred throw-down where each character gets to flaunt his or her superpower. Yet, like everything in these comic book movies, there is absolutely nothing at stake. Even when one character plummets to the ground, you know he isn’t toast. There are too many different franchises involved to kill anyone off. And even if they did, how many movies would it take for them to be resurrected?"
"Nov 19, 2019",POSITIVE," On the heels of Avengers: Age of Ultron, the Marvel heroes are left frowned upon by much of the world. After all, it was Tony Stark's fault that Ultron was created in the first place. Now, back in the United States, Captain America finds himself being governed into not being a hero at will. His biggest objection to this comes from the need to help his best friend, Bucky Barnes, after he is accused of a horrible crime. Stark, on the other hand, feels the weight of his actions in Sokovia on very intimate levels and sides with the government. At no point during Captain America: Civil War does one character seem ""more right"" than the other, and it's a remarkable achievement. Everything the filmmakers and cast members said about audiences being truly divided turns out to be true. Captain America is not only fighting for something he believes in but what he believes in is credible and organic to the film's story. The same can be said for Iron Man. When the fights begin, the action is second to none. Despite being thirteen movies in, Marvel's team found ways to innovate the action packed scenes by capitalizing on each character's abilities and chemistry with one another for impressively creative sequences. The team has worked together for a while now (both in an on-screen and behind-the-scenes capacity) and it is clearly conveyed on the big screen. Speaking of the team, having (almost) the entire ensemble cast of heroes together (minus Hulk and Thor) is something to be admired. The Russo Brothers had previously directed the acclaimed Winter Soldier edition of the Captain America trilogy, but that effort was much less dense. This time around, they were burdened with bringing in over a dozen already established characters while also introducing two new major heroes. Each character, though, is given their own arc; none are forgotten or overlooked. While some are larger than others, it is equally delightful to see Scarlet Witch and Vision's relationship explored as it is to see Captain America break the rules in an internal struggle. Even though Civil War packs a lot of characters into its runtime, it is still very much a Captain America film, another filmmaker promise made good. It takes the points of The First Avenger and The Winter Soldier that were left open-ended and builds upon them. That said, the film also does a great job telling Iron Man's story. The last time we saw Iron Man outside of an Avengers movie, he blew up his suits for his girlfriend, Pepper. The consequences of not following through on that promise, going back and continuing to make new ones, are thoroughly displayed here. The characters many fans are both most curious and most excited about going into Civil War are the newcomers: Black Panther and Spider-Man. Chadwick Boseman steps into the T'Challa role and Tom Holland jumps gleefully in as Peter Parker. The two couldn't possibly be more welcome additions to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Black Panther's arc is the most complete and noteworthy of the film. Spider-Man in action is the best it's ever been. The two characters were handled masterfully and fit right into the mix of characters without standing in anyone's shadow. In fact, there are times when they may put our existing Avengers into shadows of their own. The character who was unfortunately given the short end of the stick in Civil War was Daniel Bruhl's Baron Zemo. While Bruhl clearly poured himself into the role, the villain was the least interesting part of the film. As the momentum built between the heroes, audiences are taken to completely different locations to see what the manipulative menace is up to, only to wish they were still seeing what's going on between Cap and the tin man. As far as Marvel villains go, Zemo is arguably the darkest. Shades of Batman v. Superman's Lex Luthor can certainly be seen here The villain is cruel. His methods are more brutal than typically seen in the traditional Marvel Studios film, raising the stakes. As a whole, Captain America: Civil War is the darkest Marvel movie to date. That doesn't mean it gets serious and gritty throughout - the one liners and boat loads of fun are still there - but it tackles issues and emotional moments like no film before it. Everything that worked in The Winter Soldier is emphasized and exploited. The emotional beats never missed. There are moments that will have audiences audibly gasping. There are themes of friendship, love, heartbreak, and fear, which are blended seamlessly. For the comic fans, Civil War will certainly satisfy. While it's far from an exact adaptation of the original Marvel comics, it's not too far to see its roots. There are beats from the pages splashed right across the silver screen, and anyone thinking the movie needed more heroes to do the story justice was wrong. The airport battle scene teased in the trailers could be watched on a loop for three hours and still be worth the price of admission. It's quite possibly the pinnacle representation of where movies and technology stand today. By its end, Captain America: Civil War alters the Marvel Cinematic Universe more than any film before. The Avengers are truly left shattered heading into Infinity War and the audience is left begging for more. While it's hard to compare to the most unique film (which is Guardians of the Galaxy), Captain America: Civil War fights its way to be the best Marvel movie so far, as the studio continues to find ways to outdo themselves in emotion, action, and character.

"Nov 3, 2019",POSITIVE," To the horror of many of my colleagues in the press and evoking a chorus of gasps and boos from them at the recent press junket for CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR (although Paul Rudd cheered and Kevin Feige lit up like a Christmas tree), I dared to say that which apparently should not be said: CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR is BETTER than “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.” I said it then, I’ve said it since and I say it again now. While “The Force Awakens” is a global phenomena filled with touchstones of the past 40 years that tap into and tug at every fiber of one’s being, the puzzle pieces are not as integrated within the film as a whole as those in CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR. Hands down, CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR is not only better than “The Force Awakens”, but the best film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the best film of the year thus far. Screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, who have been with the series since “Captain America: The First Avenger”, know this world and the characters intimately, and take advantage of that, going deeper with exploration into the psyche and emotions of each, expounding on and/or introducing backstories that are interwoven within the film’s fabric, while developing situations and storylines that allow for exploration of themes that challenge the limits and boundaries of not only themselves, but their individual and collective places in an ever-changing world. Akin to the United States’ own Civil War, here we have brother against brother, friend against friend, as Markus and McFeely, together with directors Joe Russo and Anthony Russo, delve into the ideals of free will, the ability to choose, responsibility, self-sacrifice, self-satisfaction, vengeance, forgiveness and redemption, addressing an uncompromising code of ethics within Steve Rogers, Captain America himself. There is no longer a clear cut “right or wrong”. A maturity permeates the film and each character as we see each “grow up.” Although there are still enough smart-aleck one-liners bandied about, they are scaled back in number and tempered, most notably within Robert Downey Jr.’s Iron Man, replaced with thoughtful questioning and self-examination. These characters, the collective Avengers, have long gone beyond being “comic book heroes”. There is a real sense of humanity now embedded in the on-screen fabric of reality and life as we know it, with each Avenger facing the same crisis of conscience and self-questioning as each of us, resulting in friction and conflict that serves as the catalyst to the brother against brother CIVIL WAR. Character arcs are fully developed and engrossing. The script is intricately and brilliantly written making us not only think, but entertain us at the same time. Much of that entertainment factor, beyond the characters themselves, comes by way of action; and not just action sequences for the sake of action and set pieces. The action in CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR is much like the song and dance sequences in MGM musicals during the Arthur Freed years. It is a component part of the script and the story, flowing with the dialogue and story for a completely cohesive and synergistic meld of story and action. And yes, while there is the much ballyhooed “airport sequence” that brings Spider-Man, Ant-Man and Black Panther into the fold, with CIVIL WAR the Russos bring us more intimate and inventive fight choreography and sequencing that not only mirrors the emotional and moral battles between brothers and sisters, but which is also executed in closer quarters, metaphorically intensifying how personal the fight has now become for each. CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR begins with a 1991 flashback to James “Bucky” Buchanan as he is released from his cryogenic state by Soviet soldiers and programmed for duty as the Winter Soldier. We witness the pain of the psychologic transformation and gain better understanding of who this man/killing machine is. We see the man. We feel his pain. And then we see the twisted result of “science.” Fast forward to the present and we meet up with Steve Rogers/Captain America, Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow, Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch and Sam Wilson/Falcon as they attempt to capture Brock Rumlow/Crossbones, rumored to have survived his last encounter with the Avengers and now involved in some of sort of terrorism in the country of Lagos. Although successful in their intended mission, things go more than awry with explosions, destruction and mass civilian casualties. Called back to Washington for a meeting with Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross, and an unusually quiet Tony Stark, the team – including Lt. James Rhodes/War Machine and Vision – is being strong-armed to agree to the Sokovia Accords which would place the Avengers under the jurisdiction of the United Nations. 147 countries have signed the Accords, believing that the Avengers need to be put in check after what happened in Sokovia, New York and Washington, D.C. And Tony Stark, already facing his own crisis of conscience having lost Pepper Potts thanks to his obsessive and difficult nature as a boyfriend, has been pushed into agreeing with the Accords once racked with guilt after a confrontation with the mother of a young man killed in Sokovia. Not surprisingly, Rhodes is backing Stark. Also in agreement is Vision. Natasha and Wanda understand the reason behind the Accords and will agree to them but are not jumping for joy. The holdout is Steve Rogers. He looks beyond the immediate rush to judgment and sees the totality of the circumstances, the “what if” factor. What if there is a threat that must be immediately addressed but the Avengers can’t act without a UN resolution? What if they need to jump into action but for political reasons, they are precluded from so doing? No. Steve Rogers will not sign the Accords. Rogers becomes even more resolute in his position when the meeting of the UN world leaders in Vienna to celebrate and sign the Accords is attacked, leaving hundreds dead and even more injured, with all fingers pointing at Bucky Barnes/Winter Soldier as the masked man who detonated the building, something Rogers refuses to believe. He knows Bucky. He knows the humanity is still within him. He knows Bucky isn’t responsible for this heinous attack. So while there is an all points bulletin to capture and kill Bucky, Rogers determines to find his friend and save him. Making him even more determined is the death of Peggy Carter and some words of wisdom in a eulogy delivered at Peggy’s funeral by her niece, Sharon Carter; the same Sharon who was watching over Rogers while undercover for SHIELD. And standing by Rogers’ side is Sam Wilson. But it’s going to take more than Captain America and Falcon to save Bucky, especially once the pieces start coming together and a new villain is in the mix, Zemo; a villain who knows the best way to bring down an empire is from within. With battle lines drawn, the teams start amassing – Team Iron Man and Team Cap. Joining Iron Man is War Machine, Black Widow, Vision and newcomer, Black Panther aka T’Challa the King of Wakanda who is seeking revenge against Bucky for killing his father in the Vienna explosion. Of course, always on the lookout for new talent, Tony Stark discovers a young man slinging webs and swinging across rooftops and elicits his help. That young web-slinger is Spider-Man. All now deemed criminals for violating the Accords, Team Cap is led by Captain America with Bucky Buchanan, Falcon, Scarlet Witch and Hawkeye (who comes out of retirement and doing activities with his kids to stand by Scarlet Witch and Cap) by his side. And thanks to Falcon, who’s got a guy who knows a guy, Ant-Man joins in the fracas. And while Team Cap and Team Iron Man are facing off, Zemo is putting the final touches on his plan for the ultimate destruction of the Avengers. There’s no denying Robert Downey, Jr., Don Cheadle, Chris Evans, Anthony Mackie, Jeremy Renner and Scarlett Johansson know their characters inside out. Interesting is watching the growth of each character and the subtleties each actor brings to play. Notable is Johansson’s performance as she imbues an ambiguity within Natasha that is so authentic, we see conflict on her face and in hesitant tentative movements. Mackie easily picks up the mantle of having some of the lighter dialogue which we might normally expect from Downey. Mackie brings more of a humorous touch as opposed to biting sarcasm which works extremely well within the story construct here. However, Downey gives one of his finest dramatic scenes in the franchise thanks to a revelation that will blow your mind. This go-round we get to discover more about Bucky and as a result, we see more of Sebastian Stan and what he brings to the table. Stan has a brooding questioning intensity that is riveting as we, like Cap, must always wonder “which Bucky are we seeing”. Stan does a delicate dance vacillating between his personalities. Similarly, Elizabeth Olsen demonstrates what a fine dramatic actress she is becoming as Wanda constantly questions herself. Olsen plays the inquisitive self-examination beautifully, particularly opposite Paul Bettany’s Vision as we wonder just what’s up with those two. Bettany also adds a questioning pragmatism to Vision, who is still learning the ropes as a new “being”. As Black Panther, Chadwick Boseman makes a more than impressive entrance into the MCU and without giving any spoilers, creates more than enough interest and excitement for what’s to come for Black Panther. Although we’ve already seen and love Paul Rudd as Ant-Man, it doesn’t take away from the joy of seeing his comedic antics and timing of dialogue delivery as he mixes it up with the Avengers, tossing in tongue-in-cheek one-liners that are especially effective when expressing his childlike glee at meeting each and every one of them. And speaking of childlike glee, look no further than the first perfectly cast Spider-Man with Tom Holland. Scene-stealing, wide-eyed, eager, Holland is everything you hope to see in a young super hero testing the waters with his super hero gimmick. Watching Holland and Downey at their initial meeting is hilarious as you see the 17-year old Downey come out in full force as he taunts Holland and the two go back and forth like on a playground. As with Rudd’s Ant-Man, the Russos and scribes Markus and McFeely, also infuse Spider-Man with his own giddy glee at meeting the Avengers. Again, a very human touch. Nice to see Emily VanCamp’s Sharon Carter expanded here and to see VanCamp embrace the performance with a freedom that is welcoming, but also with nuance similar to that of Johansson. Daniel Bruhl is perfection as Zemo. With a baby face and performance texture that speaks anything but “villain”, it falls to subtlety and dialogue delivery to inform the character, a talent which Bruhl turns on and off with ease. He fascinates. And be on the lookout for a very fun trip down memory lane as Maria Tomei reteams with her 1994 “Only You” co-star Robert Downey Jr. as Spider-Man’s Aunt Mae meets Tony Stark. The action is unparalleled not only in its incorporation as part of the “scripted dialogue”, but in its execution. Switching up lensing styles from intimate handheld to crane, dolly, widescreen, we are immersed in each moment while feeling the stakes of each battle thanks to the meld of story and action. As described to me by Joe Russo, “[A]ction is very important to us. These movies are about action. The characters express themselves through action. Action has to have storytelling to enforce it. . .You’ll get tired of an action sequence if it’s not either defining a character or moving the story forward in some way and it takes an incredible amount of effort.” Crediting Kevin Feige and the writers “who can work with us and keep us honest in terms of the storytelling” as well as the cast “who are also the caretakers of the characters in a way that we never could do”, melding story and action is “by far and away the hardest thing to do on a film.” Reflecting on the filmmaking process, Russo notes, “The easiest thing to do on a film is when you have a Soderbergh level cast like this to put down the dramatic scenes on camera, especially with actors of this caliber who have been playing these parts for this long. Those are some of the easiest things we do. So the hardest thing we do is executing the action.” And as comes as no surprise, for Russo, the toughest sequence in the film was the airport sequence. “It’s filled with a lot of moving parts, a lot of different characters. You want to move each character forward, you want to make sure you’re not leaving anybody behind. I think we went well into the post process, still reshaping and rethinking and reconfiguring that sequence to make sure that it had its maximum storytelling thrust to it.” There is a conviction of purpose that infuses every aspect of CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR. Be it within the characters or the script or the lensing, confidence in purpose abounds at every turn. As sure as Tony Stark is in his beliefs and as certain as Steve Rogers is in his, there is never a wavering in the investment of showing both sides of the coin and the overall package. The bar has been set. The battles lines drawn. Be it Team Cap or Team Iron Man, CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR is better than “Star Wars: The Force Awakens”, the best of the MCU, and dare I say it, the best movie of the year."
"Oct 27, 2019",NEGATIVE," Not only does the film juggle a dozen major superheroes pretty seamlessly, but it somehow manages to tell a cohesive story while not making the film feel too stuffed or overcomplicated. After a NYC screening of ""Civil War"" ended Monday evening, the man on my right declared that this was the movie ""BvS"" director Zack Snyder thought he made. Now, that's not easy for me to say. I love Batman. And while I did not detest Warner Bros.’ big budget ""Batman v Superman"" movie as much as most critics, I couldn’t shake the feeling that ""Civil War"" was the movie Warner Bros. wanted to make.  The superheroes deal with the fallout of their previous big action flick (""Man of Steel""/""Avengers: Age of Ultron""). After one more mishap, the government gets involved to enforce superhero regulation. As a result, the superheroes are pit against each other for the entire movie only to learn in the third act that a madman mastermind orchestrated everything with the intention of the heroes tearing each other apart. ""Batman v Superman"" was about playing catch up to Marvel’s big Cinematic Universe. In doing so, a lot was thrown into the film. Some things worked, like Ben Affleck’s Batman. Many others — Doomsday, the insertion of extraneous superheroes for future films, and that random bathtub scene with a nude Lois Lane — didn't. ""Civil War"" did everything ""BvS"" tried to do in a big superhero film pretty effortlessly, and while catering to a larger rotating cast of characters. When you put a group of beloved superheroes on a large stage together, you shouldn’t just have them fighting each other for the sake of fighting. As a viewer, you want to see characters who don’t know each other meet for the first time. What would it be like if Spider-Man met Iron Man? How would Ant-Man get along with Hawkeye? ""Civil War"" answers those questions and more. Where ""BvS"" failed to deliver fun, witty dialogue between its trinity of heroes in costume, ""Civil War"" succeeds ten-fold. Paul Rudd’s Ant-Man fanboys over meeting Captain America (Chris Evans), Ant-Man messes with Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), and Spider-Man (Tom Holland) comments on the logic of Captain’s shield. Falcon and Bucky Barnes/The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) also have a fun love-hate relationship. At one point, the two are seated in a hilariously tiny Beetle. They look hilarious in it. When Bucky asks Falcon if he can move his seat up, without looking at him, Falcon adamantly says no. That received the biggest laugh at my screening. ""Civil War"" is about more than just superheroes going to battle and it’s not all fun and games. It becomes a question of whether superheroes should be granted unlimited freedom to act without government supervision. When Captain America’s former best friend Bucky is wanted for a crime he didn’t commit, he sides with him against a majority of the Avengers. The question for him becomes how far do you go for a friend? What are you willing to risk for something that you believe in — your freedom? Your reputation? The Avengers really don’t want to go to battle because the people on each of the two sides see each other as an extended family of sorts. They care about each other, whether they’ll admit it or not. That’s evident when Steve Rogers asks Tony Stark about his uncertain relationship with Pepper Potts and when Black Widow and Hawkeye are facing off. The two friends don't try to kill one another. They don’t even give it their all, and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) calls Hawkeye out on that. Where the film really pays off is with its big action sequences. Though we’ve seen a majority of them teased in trailers and television spots, they are some of the best of any Marvel movie. Pretty much every review talks about the big airport scene teased in the film’s trailers. That was hands-down the most satisfying scene of any Marvel movie I’ve ever watched. Others have said this, but I would watch that scene on loop several times over and it would still not be enough. I’m not even going to say anything more about it because it should just be experienced in theaters. And that’s not the only large fight sequence to get excited about. There are multiple superhero team ups and takedowns throughout the film for fans to enjoy, including a showdown between Iron Man, Captain America, and The Winter Soldier. Chadwick Boseman’s Black Panther is a commanding presence any time he's on screen as the prince of the fictional African nation of Wakanda. He’ll be getting his own standalone movie in 2018. And once again, Vision (Paul Bettany) is a wonderful comedic relief. For whatever reason, his AI wears a few sweaters in the film. Whoever thought to put clothes on the AI, bravo. It’s so distractingly delightful. The overall scene stealer is Tom Holland’s Spider-Man. The film wastes no time trying to tell the webslinger’s backstory, he’s just inserted into the fray, and it works. After five Spider-Man films since 2002, if you don’t know his origin story by now (bitten by a radioactive spider, gets spider-like abilities) then you’ve probably been living under a rock. But unlike the previous men in the role (Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield), Peter Parker — who’s a teen when he gets his powers in the comics — is finally being played by, you guessed it, a teen. And he refreshingly acts like a young kid with superpowers would. Unlike the other heroes, he’s overly chatty in fight sequences. His rapport with Downey Jr.’s Tony Stark on screen is the kicker: Stark refers to him as Spider-ling and Spider-Boy while inquiring about his hot Aunt May (Marisa Tomei). I would watch an entire movie with those two together. (Good news. We’ll get to see them together again in a new Spider-Man.) A close second is Robert Downey Jr. If this wasn't a Captain America movie, it could easily be an Iron Man movie with Stark's snarky quips and one liners. However, beneath the billionaire's haughty ego, ""Civil War"" reveals a vulnerable layer of emotional depth to Stark's character you probably weren't expecting to receive in a big ensemble picture. ""Civil War"" isn’t the best superhero movie ever or Marvel’s best movie yet, as many critics have said. It’s up there, but I think Joss Whedon’s ""The Avengers"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" are better. The film starts off a bit slow, wading us through the UN’s plan to get all of the ""enhanced"" humans to sign some paperwork approved by 117 countries to relinquish their rights as free Avengers. Up until the hour mark you’re watching Tony Stark chase down Steve Rogers, trying to convince him to sign said papers. Thrilling stuff. If you’ve watched the trailers, you’re just waiting around to see the heroes join sides with Captain America or Iron Man. Once you get past the one hour mark, it’s all action-packed smooth sailing. One of the other complaints I have about the film is the main villain. While the character himself is a longstanding Avengers comic villain, in the film, he doesn’t appear to be much more than a mere mortal. If you’re a casual viewer, you may leave the film going, ""That guy was able to pull one over on the Avengers?"" If a superpowerless man is able to turn the Avengers against themselves, I fear what an alien like Thanos (who has been hinted since 2012’s ""The Avengers"") can do to the team. It’s not looking so good.  The film itself has too much location jumping as well. There are over half a dozen location changes across the film which seems a bit unnecessary. It’s not a subtle transition either thanks to the giant lettering that crowds the screen any time the film swaps venues. It was rather distracting and took you out of the film for a few seconds every time. ""Civil War"" may not be a perfect film, but it’s a grand illustration of what makes Marvel’s superhero movies so successful — they’re fun, relatable, and easily accessible for general audiences who have never picked up a comic book. As the other studios try to play catch-up with Marvel’s cinematic universe on the big screen, they should take note."
"Oct 21, 2019",POSITIVE," Is this the best Marvel movie yet? We think it ranks up as one of the top even though it’s the longest one yet at just under 2 and half hours! This one’s about something everyone can relate to. What if you had to take sides against family members, or better yet, against your best friends. And what if those turned out to be super heroes with powers that could really mess you up? Who’s side would you choose in a superhero Civil War? Captain America or Iron Man? The story picks up the narrative from the last encounter in Captain America: The Winter Soldier with Bucky Barnes, played by Sebastian Stan. The issue is if and when super heroes need government oversight and supervision? That is the core issue The Avengers face in this film in order to save the world in their previous missions in multiple films where innocent people died when they got caught in the mayhem. Now the U.S. government (Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross play by William Hurt) pushes for the Anti-Hero Registration Act to reign in the Avengers and require permission to carry out missions. Chris Evans as Captain America is loaded for bear and ready to rumble. Iron Man, played by the sharp tongued Robert Downey Jr., is reluctant to go in guns blazing. Directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo who also directed Captain America: The Winter Soldier, said they worked on the script for a whole year to get every detail. It’s paid off. There are a lot of threads going on at once, but the characters each get their moments. Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans describe the dynamic between Iron Man/Tony Stark and Captain America/Steve Rogers as a marriage: It’s like they love each other, but they describe it as explosive. They have the same goal but different ways to get there. Downey, Jr. calls Civil War the smart, sexy, Marvel idea of having a rift. He says you want to see them have some friction but not be torn apart so it affects all members of the “team.” That’s when the conflict causes the rest of the Avengers to take sides. Captain America/Steve Rogers played by Chris Evans, doesn’t trust government to know what’s right vs. what’s politically expedient. Iron Man, played by Robert Downey, Jr., is racked with guilt that his actions have ended in the death of children and wants oversight. The Avengers must choose who to follow and the rift escalates into an epic super hero war between Team Iron Man is Black Panther/T’Challa (Chadwick Boseman), Vision (Paul Bettany), Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson), War Machine/Lt. James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) and Spiderman/Peter Parker as a child (Tom Holland). Team Captain America’s Bucky Barnes/Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), Falcon/Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie), Sharon Carter (Emily VanCamp, Scarlett Witch/Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen), Hawkeye/Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner, and Ant Man/Scott Lang (Paul Rudd). Chris Evans as Captain America, has a lot more going on in this film. Evans said he had a blast doing as many stunts as he could. He got pumped up and beaten up, too, for this action packed melée. Co-director Joe Russo said that “the most powerful shot of the film” was Evans, as Steve Rogers, stopping a helicopter from taking off with his bare hands. The shot was even featured in the first teaser trailer for the film. Russo said Chris Evans worked very hard in the gym to physically embody the character because they wanted to test the limit’s of Steve’s physical strength. About the shot itself he noted, “On set we had Chris straining against a crane holding the helicopter to get this fantastic shot of his muscles bulging and you can feel the energy and determination as he tries to stop it.” Yes you can. But it isn’t the only high point of the movie. Anthony Mackie says he was glad his character got a little more color in this film. He loved having big extended wings flying, and little drones he could deploy. But he seemed most thrilled with the little red wing trim on his chest on the suit. He thought he looked pretty cool with his wardrobe update. He also gets to do more. Tom Holland plays Spider Man with childlike awe with wisecracks and sarcasm. He’s just turning 20 which makes him right in his character, Peter Parker’s, real age bracket. He’s an actor, but more importantly for this role he’s a dancer (he appeared in Billy Elliot,the Musical). He’s already coming back as Spidey in Next year’s Spider Man: Homecoming. Holland says he’s always been a fan. Two years ago he even went to a fancy dress party dressed as Spider Man. The Directors had the finalists for this role do separate screen tests with Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. to see if the chemistry worked with the superhero honchos. And he won. He does a great job and adds humor in just the right places. So does Paul Rudd as Antman. He’s got a rye sense of humor anyway and his character lightens it up a bit when he shrinks into action. Scarlett Johansson does a great job being tough, with her moves in the opening fight scenes. But the way it was shot and edited, we found disturbing. It was jumpy and fake looking, more like a video game than a real fight on the screen. Fortunately, that technique did not appear again in subsequent fight scenes. It’s hard to get all the characters involved without making it confusing, but Directors  Russo and Russo did their homework and a pretty good job. Robert Downey Jr. says working with them was like a creative dance open to input to and from the actors and the both Russos. There were a few people who needed clarification after seeing the film, but Marvel aficionados seemed happy to want to go and see this one again, and again. There is a lot of detail that will be picked up in the coming movies. There are a reported 7 coming through 2019. So you better see this one because it’s sets the table for a fine Marvel Feast."
"Oct 21, 2019",POSITIVE," Captain America Civil War opens too wide release this weekend. Have we finally reached superhero saturation or will civil War directors the Russo Brothers keep audiences Crazy and clamoring for more? Cinema Siren has the answer for you! Let me start with not so much a warning, as a tease. CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR is not really a Captain America movie, It’s an Avengers movie standing behind a starred shield. While Cap is the central figure, he is so only by small margin. It’s a story comic book fans know and love, and its interpretation for the screen has been much anticipated. As the name implies, the central storyline of CIVIL WAR, is that our favorite costumed characters, once friends, are now at odds. Being asked to allow oversight by the powers-that-be, has lead to a rift. Captain America leads one side, and Iron Man leads the other. They enlist a whopping 10 other superheroes to their teams. Colossal clashes ensue. There are battles. Who is on what team and why? Does the idea of two major comic book creations tussling while politicians cry for more control sound somewhat familiar? Indeed, in that way, Captain America: Civil War shares more than just a passing similarity to Batman v Superman. So what? Any comic book fan knows there are many shared themes and stories. With that in mind, why can’t Marvel and DC coexist, and even, dare I say, intermingle in the hearts of fans? That being said, Captain America: Civil War benefits greatly and keeps their audiences in thrall leveraging the basic Marvel trait shared by most of its characters: a snarky sense of humor. Or perhaps we should say, a stark-y one. There is no shortage of darkness, death, and destruction in this film, but comedic touches offer welcome shifts in mood. In that, directors Anthony and Joe Russo create a nearly perfect balance. Kudos, also, to the screenwriters who somehow divvy up just the right amount of screen time to heroes we know, such as Cap, Iron Man, and Black Widow, those we want to know better, like War Machine, Vision, Scarlet Witch, and Ant-Man, and those we meet for the first time. With cheers often erupting when onscreen, Black Panther, as played by Chadwick Boseman and Spider-Man, ably embodied by Tom Holland nearly steal the entire film, and both beg for their own features. There are some strong, surprising character arcs, especially for Steve Rogers, which is as it should be. Chris Evans has made the character so his own it’s hard to imagine any other actor donning his shield. Downey Jr. himself is quite a standout in the film. We learn a great deal about Stark’s backstory and the personal demons that plague him, and as usual the actor is up to the challenge. With this many characters and aspects to story, it’s possibly inevitable that things get a bit unnecessarily convoluted, especially with regards to the villain’s and even several of the heroes’ motivations. These are forgivable trifles in the face of such entertainment and spectacle. CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR has thrown down the gauntlet for any other would-be blockbuster released in 2016. I pity any film, regardless of genre, opening in the next four weeks. It would be easy to nitpick about confusing plot lines and an over abundance of characters. That would mean unfairly discrediting the colossal job of successfully integrating so many superheroes while maintaining distinct personalities and points of view. Ultimately Captain America Civil War is fun & exciting, and will make even more fans, if that’s even possible, for the Avengers franchise."

"Aug 29, 2019",POSITIVE," The Russo brothers Joe and Anthony did such a killer job on Winter Soldier that Marvel not only gave them Civil War, but also gave them the nod for the next Avengers: Infinity War - Part 1 & 2. In the vein of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice but a master-class smack-down on how to do it properly, Captain America: Civil War pits superhero against superhero upping the ante ten-fold by making it plural and making it the Avengers. More super-power, more fire-power, but most importantly, more brain-power makes this not just a far superior superhero move, but a far superior movie full stop. So, simply put and spoiler-free, here we have Captain America on a mission to do the right thing by his old mate Bucky, except this time, not everyone agrees. Well mostly Iron Man doesn’t agree, and Tony Stark is used to getting his own way. While I know you’re one click away from knowing each and everyone of them, what they do, who plays them, when they’re next in their own movie and what their favourite colour is, let me remind you how much more fun movies are the less you know about them. As usual with the Russo Brothers, the fight and action scenes both intimate hand-to-hand and all-in ground and air brawls are outstanding, in IMAX 3D especially they are stunningly immersive and glorious to watch. But tying all the action together is a tight, cohesive, superbly told story, infused with comedy and heart, a story which allowed each of the characters to play their part without ever overshadowing the ensemble.  Two viewings in, there is plenty of time for Civil War to take on Winter Soldier as my favourite Marvel ever -- it’s already a close contest."
"Jul 9, 2019",POSITIVE," At the end of the first Iron Man, when Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) popped up to mention “The Avengers Initiative,” it launched what can only be described as the most massive collective nerdgasm in this or any quantum parallel reality. Since then, there have been minor nerdquake aftershocks (seeing the team together for the first time, hearing Captain America [Chris Evans] first bark out orders, the insane side-scrolling action shot in Age of Ultron). But twice during Captain America: Civil War, I thought the audience was going to have the first recorded joyous nerdshart. We’ll get to them, just wait for it. Unlike Batman v. Superman: I Told You That Was Going to Suck, which was allegedly a sequel to Man of Steel but was really two hours of hilariously overwrought dude brooding, Civil War is honestly a sequel to Captain America: Winter Soldier. Hell, it harkens all the way back to the first solo Captain America movie in a meaningful way. Cap is looking for The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), who everyone sees as a terrorist menace who needs to be put down, except Cap, who wants his friend back. This leads into a bigger divide when government agents decide that superheroes need more supervision. Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr) agrees, admitting that even he deserved oversight that would have possibly prevented the deaths of thousands when he accidentally invented Ultron. When The Winter Soldier, under brainwashed duress, is involved in another act of mass terror, the battle lines get drawn explicitly. Team Cap boasts Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), The Winter Soldier, Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and the Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen). Team Iron Man is War Machine (Don Cheadle), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Vision (Paul Bettany) and, most nerdshartly, Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Spider-man (Tom Holland). Then everybody fights and, for anyone who has ever before loved a comic book, we see the face of God. To say that Boseman and Holland “reinvigorated” the franchise is a horrifyingly irresponsible understatement. The Rock was once called “franchise Viagra,” injected as an actor into sequels to give some more pep. Boseman and Holland are like giving Viagra some Viagra. From squee-inducing moments like watching Spidey web up Captain America to hilarious asides like Iron Man macking on Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) to the Black Panther shrugging off .50 caliber bullets fired from a helicopter and being treated as, inarguably, the most important supporting character in terms of plot and consequence, everything works. Everything. This is the true culmination of the grand Marvel experiment. It’s not over, as the ending still leaves wounds and unanswered questions. But two major missing elements (Spider-man and a superpowered person of color) helped finished the mythical mosaic they’ve been slowly, artfully and playfully crafting for a decade. It’s perfectly acceptable to not like Captain America: Civil War. It simply means you care not for this particular genre, because in any way I can think to analyze, it represents its zenith."
"May 10, 2019",POSITIVE,The action and the introduction of some pivotal new characters are enough to satisfy most expectations.
"May 6, 2019",POSITIVE," While in LA last month, I got to be one of the first people to see Captain America: Civil War – almost a month before it hit theaters (which is today!). To say I was blown away is an understatement. Most of you know how big of a Marvel fan I am, so I have been looking forward to this film for a long time. I knew going in that it most likely would vary from the comic books, which is a good thing because I like to be surprised (and Joe Russo, one of the Directors, agrees with me), but I was surprised by just how much. It was like watching a whole new story and I loved the way they did it. Captain America: Civil War is full of action, drama, and even some romance. I always promise no spoilers so I won’t give anything away but I will say that this is my favorite Marvel movie yet. Yes, it even trumps Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 as my all-time favorite. The tension between Captain America and Iron Man is done perfectly. It is a story about politics and each of them is doing what they truly feel deep down is the right thing to do. In the comic books, I am one thousand percent #TeamIronMan, but with the movie version, I honestly cannot choose. They both make some very valid points and I just don’t know which way is the best answer. I love every character in this film but the addition of Tom Holland as Spider-Man was brilliant. He is incredible as Peter Parker! He has the humor, the youth, and the excitement. I loved watching him on the big screen as one of the most iconic superheroes out there. Some of you guys have asked me if Stan Lee makes another cameo in this film, I won’t say anything, but has he ever missed a Marvel movie before? The battle scenes in this film are amazing but I will be honest, it is strange to watch some of my favorite heroes fighting each other and not a common villain. Even though I knew this was coming, it was intense to watch. The airport scene is probably my favorite of the whole movie. This is one REALLY cool thing that happens that I cannot talk about because I don’t want to ruin it for you guys – but watch Ant-Man closely. I may have shed a tear or two during the movie as well. It is truly full of emotion – there is a huge reveal at the end that had me sad and mad for one of my favorite characters. You really do not want to miss this movie! As with all Marvel movies, there are some post-credit scenes. I got to see one – and there is a second one as well! So I plan to go see Captain America: Civil War for a second time this weekend for many reasons, but one is to see that second scene! To help celebrate the release of Captain America: Civil War, DisneyStore.com has lots of personalization items. I could have spent hours looking through them all – but I finally settled on a Black Widow shirt and a Scarlet Witch shirt with my daughters’ names on the back. Those are two pretty strong and pretty amazing women from the film, and I want my girls to have great role models. The process was easy, I could have put their names anywhere on the shirts (and I could change color and size of the lettering as well as color of the shirt too!) and decided to put them on the back. We are eagerly awaiting them and I cannot wait for my daughters to represent the women of Civil War and show off their awesome shirts thanks to Disney Store! Check out the personalization shop here! Marvel’s “Captain America: Civil War” finds Steve Rogers leading the newly formed team of Avengers in their continued efforts to safeguard humanity. But after another incident involving the Avengers results in collateral damage, political pressure mounts to install a system of accountability, headed by a governing body to oversee and direct the team. The new status quo fractures the Avengers, resulting in two camps—one led by Steve Rogers and his desire for the Avengers to remain free to defend humanity without government interference, and the other following Tony Stark’s surprising decision to support government oversight and accountability.

"Apr 19, 2019",POSITIVE,"It is, at its heart, about a very personal clash between friends and I think that's what sets Civil War apart in the Marvel Cinematic Universe canon."
"Apr 12, 2019",POSITIVE,Earthy and visceral.
"Apr 3, 2019",POSITIVE," Civil War assembles the Avengers for an all-out all-star battle. With newcomers Black Panther and Spider-Man offering show-stealing highlights, appetites are left whetted for the future, rather than teased for the upcoming meal. The film pulls many emotional punches, holding back for the sake of those same upcoming films, and the intellectual battle is increasingly shaky, with Captain America at his least heroic yet. The pace can’t keep its gallop and the fights can’t keep their wallop, but as a convergence and dispersion of all which has come before Civil War is a resounding victory. Civil War is A-grade filmmaking, as confident as it is competent, and a shiny stone in Marvel’s gauntlet. The series’ future is safe in the Russo brothers’ hands. Moonlighting as a reviewer and editor, I'm more at home with recent films than golden oldies and enjoy appreciating the technical achievements as much as the escapism of the movies. Happy to try any film once, if only for fifteen minutes.
I also volunteer with MediCinema - a charity which every film fan should look into if they don't already know about."
"Mar 11, 2019",POSITIVE," The buzz over the latest Marvel blockbuster has been through the roof. It’s already made over $200 mil internationally before it even opened here in the US, so no doubt it will wipe out any competition here this weekend. I have to say that despite my increasing superhero fatigue, I was still looking forward to this one mostly because I love the first two Captain America films, and I have faith in the Russo brothers’ direction. Like Zack Snyder with Batman V Superman, Anthony & Joe Russo had the tricky task of not only continuing the thread of the Avenger story, pulling off a large ensemble cast AND help launch/introduce individual standalone films (Black Panther, Spider-man). Suffice to say the Russos did a much, much better job than Snyder in delivering an entertaining Summer blockbuster that’s actually has depth and thought-provoking ideas. Interesting that The Avengers and Superman share a similar predicament in their effort to safeguard humanity, and how the DC and Marvel tentpole movies are dealing with the issue of accountability. The ‘Civil War’ in the title stems from an ideological conflict about what should be done in that issue of accountability and collateral damage, and whether a governing body (in this case the UN) should oversee them. Now, the fact that the perceived common enemy happens to be Steve Rogers’ (Chris Evans) BFF Bucky a.k.a. The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), it’s easy to see which side the Cap is on. The events in The Winter Soldier has undoubtedly made Cap wary of big government and how a centralized power could be manipulative and corrupt. So it makes sense that he won’t be so easily persuaded to sign something like The Sokovia Accords that’d essentially put the Avengers under UN control. Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow: Just because it’s the path of least resistance doesn’t mean it’s the wrong path. Staying together is more important than how we stay together. …
Whilst the motive behind Captain firmly believing in self-regulation is more clear cut, I’m not as convinced why Tony Stark would support it with little resistance. A cameo by Alfre Woodard briefly reveals the burden of guilt on Tony’s part as the Stark companies supplies most of the weaponry (including Captain himself who was created in the lab of his dad Howard), but still I’d think he’d be more apprehensive about government interference in the Avengers. I have to say that the film has a pretty slow start. I understand they’d have to establish the conflict and a reason for all the fighting, but it went on a bit too long for my liking and frankly, it all feels a bit tedious. Thankfully, things do pick up as soon as an incident happens at the UN meeting and before you know it, Captain becomes a hunted man wanted by the government along with Bucky. It’s there that we meet new Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU)’s member Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and he certainly looks the part. This is perhaps one of the most diverse cast in a Marvel film aside from the X-Men franchise. I think the fact that the same writers, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, are involved in the Captain America trilogy so far makes the film flow nicely and has a cohesive storyline. They also did a decent job showing the events in previous films to viewers who might not be familiar with the Avengers story, i.e. the battle in the fictional Eastern European country Sokovia in Avenger: Age of Ultron that caused massive collateral damage. Marvel fans would especially enjoy the references and inside jokes, especially during the actual civil war battle involving a dozen MCU superheroes. This is also the first time we see the new Spider-man (Tom Holland) as part of MCU and he’s definitely a highlight. Spidey is supposed to be a wisecrackin’ teenager and Holland’s captured that. All his comments as he’s fighting the other heroes, like referencing Empire Strikes Back and saluting Cap before he fights him, are a hoot. The intro to the appropriately-aged character is full of good humor as he’s fanboying over Iron Man, who somehow still has time to flirt with aunt May (Marisa Tomei, Robert Downey Jr’s co-star in the rom-com Only You) despite a brief 36-hour deadline to arrest Cap. There’s a lot of fanboy-ing going on in this movie that’s so hilarious. My fave part is when Ant-Man (the immensely affable Paul Rudd) meets Cap which got one of the biggest laughs in the theater. Captain America: Civil War is commendable for having the right balance of story, character, emotion, humor AND high-octane action. The fight scenes are well-choreographed that you can actually see the action despite the sheer number of people fighting. It wasn’t so bombastic that it’s headache-inducing. The story never feels cartoonish even with SO many characters involved and the battles feel sprightly and fun without being frivolous or silly. When one character is injured, we feel the emotion of fellow team members and the sense of solidarity is definitely there. The Captain America trilogy benefits from the strong base of Steve/Bucky relationship established in the first film. I totally believe why Cap would go to such length to protect his best friend and stand by his side regardless of what he’s done, and I think Bucky would’ve done the same if the situation were reversed. I love Evans and Stan even more as they become more at ease in their respective roles, and Anthony Mackie is always so charming and fun as Falcon. I also have to mention how I appreciate Scarlett Johansson‘s Black Widow more and more, and the fact that she’s undeniably torn between the two sides is a testament to her intriguing character arc. The key in making a huge ensemble cast work is they have to have a reason for us to care for the characters. It’s getting immensely tricky here but I think keeping the focus on just a small group helps. The final battle between Cap, Iron Man & Winter Soldier is not only cool to watch but it also carries a certain emotional weight because there’s something personal that affects the three of them. It’s perhaps one of the most compelling dramatic moments from RDJ that I’ve seen in all the Iron Man & Avengers movies so far. That said, I don’t think this film is perfect and I don’t think it’s the greatest MCU film so far, as many critics have said. I’ve mentioned about the rather sluggish start, but there are also moments that don’t really work. Daniel Brühl is a perfectly capable actor but he barely makes a dent here amongst an ocean of characters, though I think the character’s motive is a pretty decent one. The romance between Cap and Sharon Carter also feels so obligatory and the lack of chemistry between Evans and Emily VanCamp doesn’t help. Oh how I miss Hayley Atwell‘s Agent Carter who’s such a strong female character who doesn’t need any superpowers to make a difference. I also find the music unmemorable as I barely remember any of it, which is odd given I LOVE what Henry Jackman did with The Winter Soldier. All in all, it’s a VERY good film that ties all three Captain American movies superbly well and would rank amongst the best film trilogies. After this, I’m even more confident in the Russo brothers’ directing talent and MCU is definitely in capable hands if they continue to make Marvel movies. I love the end credits of the first two Captain America movies and they did an excellent job here as well. In terms of replay-ability value, this one ranks third after The Winter Soldier and The First Avenger, both of which I actually just re-watched last night and I still enjoyed them immensely! I saw the film earlier today as I scored the last ticket for the morning show and I had fun as did the audience I watched it with.  Ant-Man, Black Panther, and Spider-Man.  They were a blast.  I think they hit paydirt with Boseman as Black Panther as he really became the character and I’m glad he’s going to get his own film.  Tom Holland for me now, is the best Peter Parker/Spider-Man.  He gets it right.  He is very funny but also kinda nerdy and he’s so impossible to dislike. There’s a lot of other things in the film I like such as Natasha being torn as it is obvious how close she is with Steve and was there for him during that moment where he is filled with loss.  I also enjoyed Elizabeth Olsen’s performance as Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch as someone who is trying to find her footing but also has some guilt where that little she has with Rogers I thought was a nice touch where I think Steve sees her as a little sister of sorts and can comfort her.  It was a lot better than I thought it would be while I also found myself laughing a lot.  Including the moments between Falcon and Bucky as I could watch those 2 banter at each other.  Here’s my review BTW. Hi Steven! I’ll check out your review latre today. Yes I think Boseman and Holland were great additions to MCU, I love how regal Boseman was and how nerdy Holland was, which was appropriate for the character. Yes I really like Natasha being torn, I think that her scene w/ Bucky, Cap & Black Panther was one of the highlights of the film as well. I really love the trio of Bucky, Cap and Falcon! Saw it last night and loved it! I didn’t mind the slow build up in the first half, reminded me of the older Bond films, in fact this one feels even more like a espionage film with all those different locations. I’m going to see it again next week at the IMAX theater, so far it’s a toss up between this one and The Winter Soldier as the best film in the Marvel universe. I’m surprised that not too many people mention Black Panther as one of the highlights, seems like Spider-Man and Ant-Man are getting more love but to me Black Panther got my attention and looking forward to his solo film. I love the climatic battle between the three characters too, I thought for sure they’ll team up and fight those other winter soldiers and a super villain will show up. Glad they didn’t pull a Batman vs. Superman trick and kept the focus on the conflicts between Iron Man and Capt. Hi Ted, I thought you had seen it at IMAX already. I don’t know yet if I’d have time to see it again. I still think The Winter Soldier has more of the suspense of an espionage film and frankly I’m not crazy about the way they introduced the different locations in CW w/ those huge fonts, it’s like they’re screaming at you or something. I like both Black Panther and Spider-Man, though the latter is a lot more fun to watch I guess because he’s inherently funny. Yes I think keeping the focus on just Iron Man & Capt (w/ Bucky in the middle) is wise, because ultimately it’s THEIR battle, the rest are their allies. No, I saw it at the Icon Atmos theater Friday night, mostly because of the reserved VIP seats. You can reserve seats at the IMAX theater now but I know it’s going to be packed and didn’t want to sit next to a lot of people. I usually go to a matinee showing at the IMAX theater because it’s not that busy during the day. Nice! I know you’re not into superhero movies Jordan, but the Captain America films are so good and even the second film felt more like espionage films than a straight superhero movie. Oh you have seen that one? Glad to hear it Jordan! This one is by the same duo directors and has a similar espionage feel to it, but it does have a boatload more superheroes. That’s why I still prefer Winter Soldier to this third one. Hmmm, its raining like all hell, massive winds…. and the cinema around the corner is of course playing it. I might go see it just to get away from the wind rattling everything in my house!! And cos it is by the same directors, that is what has me interested. So often franchises are directed by a different guy each time around. Oh man that sounds nasty! I remember those torrential rains back when I still live in Jakarta. Hey, watching ‘Civil War’ sounds like a perfect way to escape from nasty weather. Yes I think it’s always a good idea to have the same director direct an entire franchise, that’s why the Nolan Dark Knight trilogy is so good. That said, I did like the first Captain America film and its decidedly retro look and feel. I haven’t seen the first one, only Winter Soldier and the first Avengers movie (which I didn’t like at all), so I don’t think I’ll get lost. And I must admit that there were parts of Winter Soldier that I liked a lot. What I really hate though is the almost obligatory city being smashed to bits using CGI in the final act. Even Deadpool had that. Ahah, special powers! Too funny. Well I only suggest this one to you as you like Winter Soldier. I’d think you’d be curious what happens to well, the Winter Soldier himself aka Bucky. I like the first Captain America and no city was blown to bits in that one 😉 I agree it’s irritating when they do that, I know you’d absolutely hate Man of Steel and Dawn of Justice because the destruction is even more atrocious.  Hey Ruth, great review as always – I agree with a lot of what you say about Civil War.  I’d rate it as one of the best of the Marvel films, it does get off to a slowish start but I’m just glad in the end a decent balance between story, character and action was achieved. Black Panther was certainly a highlight as was Spidey (although I did miss Andrew Garfield a little but Tom Holland did a great job) and I had the same thoughts about Henry Jackman’s score. Like you I loved the Winter Soldier soundtrack but there weren’t any standout musical elements in CW. He..he.. nice to see your name commenting on my Captain America review, for obvious reasons 😉 This one is definitely one of the best MCU films but I still think The Winter Soldier as my fave. I just rewatched the first two this weekend actually. I don’t miss the previous Spidey actors, though by no means am I clamoring to see the new Spidey movies. I do think Holland fits the role of a teenage Peter Parker very well, funny they went w/ another Brit again for the role. This one’s going to be interesting to watch once the BluRay comes along and people get to really pull the film apart: I think the film plays better to a large cinema audience than it does at home alone, with Peter Parker’s introduction scene coming out of nowhere and bringing the film to a complete halt. That said, I did enjoy this one A LOT and can’t wait to delve deeper into it. I thought the Russo’s did an amazing job considering all the balls they had in the air with this project (I don’t envy their task ahead in Infinity War, that’s for sure) and the film balanced comic-geek action with subtle character direction, something sadly lacking from the bombast of Batman V Superman (A film I *did* enjoy despite it’s flaws).  Best bit for me? The moment of comprehension between Panther and **** on the ice tundra toward the end of the film, where T’Challa comes to understand that his revenge would only ever be a hollow victory. A great, quiet, wonderful character beat between two characters both diametrically opposed and uniquely similar, and it summed up the entire film in a single scene, for me. Hi Rodney! Interesting perspective about Spidey intro. I don’t think it brought the film to a halt, though there was a slight pause in the film as the entire cast was looking at him. But I think he’s a fun addition to the Avengers. Yes very true the Russos had so much juggling act to do w/ this one and Infinity War, I hope it’ll be eons better than Age of Ultron. Ah yes, that scene w/ Black Panther & Bruhl’s character is a good one. The quiet moment still had as much power as the bombastic one, and that’s a testament to the great acting and direction. I don’t have superhero fatigue but am getting pretty close to Marvel fatigue. Until Civil War, which was a blast almost from start to finish. I think I preferred the Winter Soldier but not by much. I agree with you that Iron Man’s motivations were a little unclear and, from everything I know about the characters, I feel like Iron Man should have been fighting against the Accord and Captain America should have been towing the company line. I actually have more of a DC fatigue than Marvel because Dawn of Justice made me even less interested in seeing all those individual movies like The Flash, Aquaman, etc. The only one I’m still excited about is Wonder Woman, for obvious reasons. Yeah, I thought the reverse POV of the two characters might throw off some people, but I think w/ Cap, the events in Winter Soldier w/ Hydra infiltrating SHIELD made him distrustful of big government, so it makes sense. Oh, I still have hope for DC. Batman and Superman have been well-cast and I’m hoping the Flash and Aquaman stand-alone films will be good since Zach Snyder won’t be making them. Great review! I loved this film so much, I’m glad you pointed out the lack of chemistry between VanCamp and Evans because that entire relationship was the low point for me. Bruhl was underused, but I didn’t mind because the conflict wasn’t really about him. He was just the puppeteer, and I would’ve be surprised if he returned for Infinity Wars. Hi Brittani! Glad to hear you love this too. I never liked VanCamp even from Winter Soldier. I think the fact that Peggy had just died made it weird that Cap was kissing her so soon. I think Bruhl’s bound to be underused considering there are just WAY too many characters already, but I think he still did a good job. I LOVE the Cap movies! It’s my second fave superhero trilogy now after Nolan’s Dark Knight. I never would’ve predicted that given that initially I wasn’t even excited for a Captain America movie! I really enjoyed this one. I don’t want to say it’s the best MCU movie because I just saw it, but I am having a hard time thinking of a better one. For my money there are only 3 other contenders for that crown: The Avengers, The Winter Soldier, and Guardians of the Galaxy. I think our divergence on this can be traced to the start. I didn’t find it tedious at all, but I did on The Winter Soldier. Glad we agree that it is excellent, overall. I don’t know if it’s the best MCU though it’s right up there. I’m glad you love Winter Soldier too, Dell, that’ll be in my top 3 Marvel movies for sure! Oh really? That’s too bad. I LOVE the Captain America movies, even though initially I didn’t even care for the character as I don’t read the comics. But the trilogy is now my favorite. Give it a shot, who knows you might end up liking it too! So you’re saying you haven’t even seen The First Avenger? I actually re-watched the first two movies after I saw ‘Civil War’ and still love both of them. The Winter Soldier still tops it for me though, but only by a small margin. Nah, I’ve seen all the Avengers film, Age of Ultron…I’ve just missed a few here and there. Not sure if I’d get what was going on, because I was really confused in Age of Ultron.  I don’t like Ultron either, too much going on jumbled together. That’s why I like the Cap movies as the story is more focused, and I love the Cap/Bucky friendship that drives the conflict. Hello Zoë! Oh I still prefer the first two Cap movies to ‘Civil War,’ I think the fact that there are less characters in those made me like it more. I didn’t care for the last Avengers either, but the first one is ok, perhaps there’s that novelty factor as we’d just seen all of those Marvel superheroes in one movie for the first time. Oh will do! But even before reading it I’m totally ok if you rip it to shreds man, I’ll still be reading your blog 😉 Btw, I did review an indie movie last Friday that I think you would enjoy, in fact I can’t wait to rewatch it again! Film is in my blood. LOVE movies of all genres, from Jane Austen to James Bond. Official blogger for the Twin Cities Film Fest (TCFF). I’ve written and produced my first short film » HEARTS WANT in 2017 and currently working on developing the full story as a feature film."
"Mar 2, 2019",POSITIVE,"So whose side am I on? #TeamCap or #TeamIronMan? Um, #TeamScarletWitch, OBVS. I was super stoked to see both her and Black Widow get as much screen time as they did."
"Feb 21, 2019",NEUTRAL," In large part, what made Joe and Andrew Russo’s Captain America: The Winter Soldier such a successful and somewhat transcendent superhero movie was that its going concern wasn’t a global or even galactic catastrophe, but a personal one. The friendship between Brooklyn bros Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) and James Buchanan “Bucky” Barnes (Sebastian Stan) threatened to fall apart over the course of the film’s explosive events, though, in the end, their lifelong bond endured. “I’m with you to the end of the line,” Captain Rogers says to his brainwashed, killing-machine friend at the close of Winter Soldier in a chilling, melodramatic declaration of brotherly love. Their bond is once again the beating heart of the story in the Russos’ follow-up, Captain America: Civil War, and it’s the key ingredient that makes Marvel Studios’ latest offering their best yet. Unlike last year’s Avengers: Age of Ultron, Civil War is an ensemble superhero movie whose heroes don’t get lost in all the ass-kicking commotion. Sure, there’s more than enough ass-kicking to satisfy even the most rabid MCU fan (more on that later), but the impressive thing is that each character has an emotional arc that’s at once affecting and easy to keep track of. Take for example Elizabeth Olsen’s Scarlet Witch. In Age of Ultron, we learned that her parents were killed in a city-leveling act of war; at the outset of Civil War, we see her on the other side of that scenario as we watch her inadvertently kill innocents during an Avengers mission in Nigeria. The wicked irony of the situation leaves her in an awful state of mind, but she finds solace in the arms of her otherworldly android teammate Vision (Paul Bettany), who’s feeling romantic butterflies in his semi-synthetic belly for the first time. You’ll find simple, affecting side stories like this running throughout the movie, but the going concern is the moral divide between Steve Rogers and Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.). Following the destructive events in Nigeria, the governments of the world decide it’s time for the Avengers to answer to a higher power, stripping them of the liberty to choose when and where to act. Tony, tormented by guilt (the lives lost in Nigeria, New York and Sokovia as a result of the Avengers’ gigantic battles hang over his head like the sword of Damocles), is in favor of the proposal; Steve still feels the world is safest in the Avengers’ unshackled hands. Some of the heroes vote with Tony, like Vision, his best buddy, War Machine (Don Cheadle), and the painfully conflicted Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson). Falcon (Anthony Mackie) goes into hiding with his Captain, and they finally track down Bucky, the ever-elusive Winter Soldier, who’s deemed public enemy number one when he’s framed for recent deadly terrorist attacks. When Steve uncovers that the person responsible for the attacks is a man named Zemo (Daniel Bruhl), he gathers fresh recruits to help him stop the mad bomber, including Scarlet Witch, Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). Tony’s counter move is to recruit two new faces to the MCU: The Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and a bright, super-powered teenager from the Bronx named Peter Parker (Tom Holland). Yes, Spider-Man’s MCU debut is as amazing (no pun intended) as anyone could have hoped. The ensuing clash between team Stark and team Rogers (taking place in an evacuated Leipzig/Halle airport) is the most gloriously nerdy thing I’ve ever seen. It’s so fun I wanted to burst, with the Russos giving each of the heroes an incredibly cool moment or two to flex their powers in strange and inventive ways. What really puts things over the top is the dialogue, which showcases each character’s colorful personality in an economic, wildly entertaining way. Spider-Man is fascinated by Bucky’s metal arm (Holland is terrific), Ant-Man is still getting used to the abilities he gained in his solo movie (he even breaks out a new trick), and Black Widow and Hawkeye discuss how bizarre it is to be fighting each other as they pull their punches.  The airport showdown (shot in glorious IMAX) is hard to top, but the climactic one-on-one battle between Iron Man and Captain America (with poor Bucky caught in the middle) raises the stakes to new levels of tear-jerking high drama. The unexpected star of the show here is RDJ, who gives not just his best performance as Stark, but one of the best performances of his career. Civil War is as much his movie as it is Evans’, and the emotional rollercoaster he takes us on is unpredictable and utterly heartbreaking. Civil War is the best thing Marvel Studios has produced. Not only does it work well as the third act of the ballad of Steve and Bucky, but it sets up the future of the MCU brilliantly. I can’t wait to see how the odd mentor/pupil relationship between Tony and young Peter Parker develops in next year’s Spider-Man: Homecoming, and the romance between Scarlet Witch and Vision is so strange and delightful that it may be one of the main reason’s people will shell out even more dough when we arrive at Avengers: Infinity War (or whatever they’re calling it these days). Then there’s Black Panther, whose forthcoming solo movie will mark the first minority-led (and directed) entry for Marvel studios. Somehow, eight years in, the future of the ever-expanding MCU looks brighter than ever."
"Feb 12, 2019",NEGATIVE," Marvel Studios sigue adelante con su Universo Cinematográfico y ahora nos presenta Capitán América: Civil War, una película que han dicho es buenísima, excelente, soberbia y magnífica. Muchas veces es mejor formarse una opinión propia a dejarse influir por esto. Esperaba mucho más de esta película y es que las cintas de Marvel ya se están convirtiendo en lo mismo. La mayoría son historias infantiles y aquí vemos a superhéroes comportándose como niños. Esto lo digo porque Iron Man/Tony Stark, un personaje que pareciera haber crecido durante la primera película de Avengers y después con Iron Man 3, aquí al parecer retrocedió hasta convertirse en un niño chillón y berrinchudo. Toda la trama gira en torno a una misión que sale mal en cierta parte de África, hay gente muerta y etc, etc, y 172 países deciden ponerle un «hasta aquí» a los Avengers por medio de los «Tratados de Sokovia.» Estos básicamente establecen que los Avengers estarán regulados por las Naciones Unidas y sólo podrán actuar cuando ellos dicen, haciendo cachitos el propósito de ser superhéroes. Tony Stark se pone de parte de esta petición porque… «motivos.» Realmente sólo lo acepta para que la trama siga adelante, pues la razón expuesta allí es sumamente ligera, débil y sin sentido. Aunque igual y propone una pregunta seria, ¿cuál es realmente el bien común? ¿Por una sola persona deberán de permitir que el mal triunfe? El único personaje que siempre ha sido consistente en el Universo Marvel es El Capitán América y tal vez por eso es mi superhéroe favorito de esta saga de cintas. Es el único que realmente es virtuoso y con una visión real del mundo, pues sabe que los gobiernos y las agendas de estos siempre van a cambiar y puede llegar el punto en el que no les convenga que existan los Avengers. Eso desata la escisión de los Avengers. Dos puntos de vista encontrados, uno respaldado por el niño consentido, rico y llorón representado por Tony Stark y otro representado por un verdadero héroe, Steve Rogers. Pero… Resulta que hay un villano que está maquinando una serie de tácticas para perjudicar todo esto. Ese es el toque de genialidad de la película, aunque los motivos del personaje sean muy vacíos y sólo sirvan para sustentar que las dos facciones de Avengers luchen entre si. La temática de Capitán América: Civil War gira en torno a la Venganza. El problema real es que en ningún momento se muestran las consecuencias de ejecutarla y eso es lo que mengua al personaje de Black Panther. Su único motivo dentro del filme es estar enojado y decir que se va a vengar. Ya cuando está por hacerlo, simplemente dice… Nah, mejor no. Me queda claro que Marvel está jugando a la segura con todas estas películas y no vamos a ver nunca algo de relevancia. Por lo menos espero que el segundo estreno de este año que es Doctor Strange, intente modificar y transformar el Universo Marvel en algo mágico, porqué si sigue así… La verdad es que ya me está aburriendo. De hecho para mi el punto más interesante de la cinta fue la aparición de Ant-Man, realmente le dio un respiro a la cinta. El nuevo Spider-Man es… patético. Escuchar la voz de un chamaquito y las bromas tontas que dice es insoportable. La nueva tía May es básicamente una zorra… Seguro le encantará a muchas personas. Si te ha gustado todo lo que saca Marvel, definitivamente tienes que ver Capitán América: Civil War. Si esperas que los personajes hayan evolucionado y ahora veas una trama compleja, oscura y llena de lecciones que van más allá de «ser bueno es bueno,» definitivamente mejor espera a verla en formato casero."
"Feb 3, 2019",POSITIVE," So I’m going to watch Avengers: Infinity War tomorrow (or today, when this review goes up!) but I didn’t really have the time to watch a lot of MCU films leading up to it… in fact I just squeezed this one in, but still! Let’s have a look at Civil War, the film that could be argued as the real Avengers 3, though I feel that’s unfair given the focus is still very much on Captain America rather than the ensemble of heroes around him. It’s also the film that introduces us to both the MCU’s Spider-Man and Black Panther, the latter of whom’s solo film would turn out to be more successful than the former, which no one would have guessed a few years ago! So let’s dive in! It’s scenes like this that make me appreciate how far the MCU has come… I mean Ant-Man and Scarlet Witch are in the same scene and both are just as legitimate a character as Cap. Crazy, but great, times. Helmut Zemo (Daniel Bruhl) – Zemo’s wife, child and father were killed in the Sokovia incident. Since then he has been blinded by thoughts of vengeance against the so-called heroes he deems solely responsible. Scott Lang / Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) – Lang is a thief who believes he can become a hero now he has the power of Hank Pym’s suit and particles… well, it’s time to put that to the test! Before we get the more obvious, action-oriented bit, I want to praise the job this film does balancing the cast and giving the large cast so much to do. Captain America is still very much himself, sticking to his principles and his allies, and Tony Stark is still very much arrogant, but also afraid and racked with guilt over things he’s done and once again he’s taking command and throwing what he can at the problem to make it go away. This is why their break up works. Bucky is somewhere in between his old self and the Winter Soldier, but by the end of the film he’s back to being like an old ally to Cap again, which makes it all the more heartbreaking when his past comes back to haunt him once again right at the end. Just when everyone found common ground Tony finds out Bucky killed his parents and then that’s it, all bets are off. The harsh words and brutal fight between Cap and Iron Man at the end of the film is great and dramatic, and the very end when Tony demands Steve leave the shield behind because “my father made that for you” is a proper hit in the gut, and really makes you believe that there friendship is irreversibly damaged. Then there’s the fact that while doing all this the film also introduces both Black Panther and Spider-Man to the MCU, handily skipping the origin stories for their respective solo films, and still by the time the big airport fight scene happens you feel they’re just as part of the cast as the characters who have been around since film 1. Tom Holland just owns the role from scene one, and Boseman’s Black Panther and his slip to hatred and vengeance, followed by his redemption, is a great story arc. That’s a true credit to both the writing and the acting that all that happens in the middle of a Captain America vs. Iron Man film, and it still fits. To top it all off you have some great scenes with Black Widow being torn as to which side to pick, you have some really pleasant scenes between Vision and Scarlet Witch, and even some of the other side characters like Falcon, War Machine and Ant-Man have at least a few funny or dramatic scenes each. It’s no wonder the Russos were chosen to juggle the Infinity War cast, they clearly have the knack. So now let’s get to the obvious: the aforementioned airport fight. That must have been a pain in the arse to plan and film, but hats off to them, because it’s quite the amazing show. Some funny moments (mostly from Spider-Man, Tom Holland just nails the funny mid-battle quips the character is known for straight away!), there some dramatic moments, but mostly there is just great hero-on-hero action. Ant-Man may steal the show for me though, not just for the scene when he enlarges himself (oo-er?) but I still laughed out loud in this rewatch when he gets Cap to enlarge a fuel truck he had shrank and tossed, only to wince when it explodes and say “Oh I thought that was a water truck… sorry.” That being said some of the other fight scenes are right up there. Cap and Winter Soldier escaping the swat team has some really well shot fight scenes, both using Cap’s shield and Bucky’s metal arm. Likewise the car chase straight after involving Black Panther is pulse-pounding, and Winter Soldier’s later escape from capture, that sees him out-martial-art-ing (that’s not a correct phrase, but whatever) a bunch of characters in some short but brutal fight scenes are all really good fun to watch. I also like the bit of continuity as to why Wakanda is suddenly in the spotlight. Vibranium stolen from them was used to create Ultron’s super-hard body, so feeling responsible they started to send out humanitarian missions, one of which happened to get caught up in the Crossbones explosion, leading to Wakanda spearheading the want to put heroes under control and take part in a global conference about it. It works well, and makes the fact that they were a non-event up until now make perfect sense. MCU films often have the problem of a poor villain, but Civil War doesn’t really have this problem as you can kind of argue that Iron Man is the lead villain. That being said, he and Cap are manipulated into fighting by Zemo, so really he is the lead antagonist, and while he doesn’t suffer from the same problems as a lot of the other bad guys, he’s not perfect. I mean, he’s nothing like the comics Zemo, but I don’t think anyone was expecting him to walk around with a purple balaclava stuck on his face due to “Adhesive X”, so I didn’t mind that. In fact I like the fact he was a broken man, his entire family wiped out, but he knew full well he couldn’t actually take the Avengers in any kind of fight so instead used his intelligence to get them to take each other out instead. So why is he in “The Bad” section then? His plan makes no sense. It relies far to heavily on coincidence to actually be planned. Think about it, if Iron Man hadn’t gone to the prison to visit Falcon and managed to convince him to tell him where Cap and Bucky were, he wouldn’t have been there to see the video of his parents’ death and turn on them. I know the film is called Civil War and all that, but if he had just locked Cap and Bucky (and coincidentally Iron Man when he turned up) in a room and unleashed the five or six other super-powered Winter Soldiers on them it would have been a more realistic plan, if not a bit more clichéd. Captain America: Civil War is jam-packed full of action and great character moments, dialogue and debuts, yet still manages to tell a story focused on Captain America, on what makes him tick and his loyalty to his friends. With one plothole that doesn’t really derail the film, it’s hard not to just applaud it for being able to juggle so much and still make it a satisfying film. Top stuff."
"Feb 2, 2019",POSITIVE," Team Cap — Ant-Man (Paul Rudd, from left), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), Captain America (Chris Evans) and the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) — face off against Team Iron Man in the new Marvel film, “Captain America: Civil War.” Amanda Greever is the editorial production manager of The Daily Times.

"Jan 15, 2019",POSITIVE," This installment sees the Avengers facing pressure to be policed by a United Nation task force in light of an incident that results in collateral damage.  As Marvel Comic entries go, “Captain America: Civil War” falls somewhere in the middle of the pack. Given the track record of success, that isn’t exactly a bad thing – with “Civil War” providing what fans have come to expect, while also delving into some darker territory. This installment sees the Avengers facing pressure to be policed by a United Nation task force in light of an incident that results in collateral damage.  Captain America/Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) wants the Avengers to remain free to defend without government assistance, while Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) believes it is time that the Avengers are put in check. This leads to conflict between the two, with fellow Avengers taking sides. Things escalate further when a friend from Rogers’ past emerges as the key suspect in the latest terrorist attack, with Rogers determined to clear his friend’s name. Following along the same lines as “Batman v Superman,” “Civil War” provides an interesting starting point – debating the pros and cons of what these superheroes do and if their actions that result in destructions of cities, and some casualties, are really worth it. “Civil War” seems even more invested in this premise than “Batman v Superman,” making this one of the darker Marvel films in the recent franchise. I found the tone refreshing, although some may be put off by all the chattiness and debate in a movie that is nearly two-and-a-half hours long. That’s not to say there isn’t action as well, culminating in the sequence most fans anticipated – the throw down between a dozen Avengers. It’s a sequence that delivers a fun excursion that keeps the proceedings from getting too dark and heavy. Then there is the introduction into the Disney Marvel world of Spider-Man (Tom Holland), which breathes more life and fun into the franchise. Post credits tease future adventures for the web slinger, which judging by his appearance here is something I am looking forward to as well. “Captain America: Civil War” may not be quite up to the same level as the previous “Captain America: The Winter Soldier,” but it is still a satisfying entry into a universe that continues to expand. Comedy Central’s Jordan Peele and Keegan-Michael Key make a pretty good transition from small screen to big screen in this comedy that is a bit uneven at times, but when it fires it’s as funny and smart as anything in recent memory. Peele and Key play Rell and Clarence, cousins who set out to recover Rell’s kitten after he is kidnapped. While rescuing the cat, they are mistaken for ruthless killers and soon find themselves right in the middle of a gang war. I’ve never seen the duo’s sketch comedy show, so I can’t compare this film to what fans have come to expect. As an outsider however, I can say that I found their chemistry quite enjoyable – and their humor worked pretty well in a feature film. Peele co-wrote the screenplay, which plays with a lot of absurd ideas (one being how this kitten can basically make even the most hardened criminal turn to putty). There is some really smart social commentary at times with the script taking some very nice chances at getting laughs in uncomfortable places. Not every joke sticks however, with some bits not as inspired as the rest. For every misfire though, there is something pretty brilliant (my favorite involving Clarence imagining himself in the middle of the iconic George Michael music video “Faith” during a drug-induced haze). I may not have laughed at everything in “Keanu,” but I laughed enough to truly enjoy myself. “Keanu” is rated R for violence, language throughout, drug use and sexuality/nudity and is now playing at the Regal Bowling Green Stadium 10 and Highland Cinemas in Glasgow."
"Jan 9, 2019",POSITIVE," One of the biggest problems with superhero team-up movies is making sure that they don’t feel like a paint-by-numbers action kaboom where the only benefit is familiar characters. And the main way to make sure that doesn’t happen is to make said familiar characters emotionally invested in the current conflict’s outcome, beyond the whole we-must-win-the-day schtick. What I’m saying is, this movie should really be titled Captain America: HELP WE ARE ALL FULL OF FEELINGS. And that’s a very good thing. It’s frankly astounding that any film can contain so many separate, distinct character arcs, and still come out clean. That said, Civil War doesn’t quite feel like a single story, more a series of vignettes interspersed with some very imaginative action sequences. That’s not to say that the film lacks cohesion, only that any film with this many main characters usually ends up with a slight Love Actually vibe. (I just compared a Marvel movie to Love Actually. Apparently, anything is possible in this bizarre universe we live in.) For those who are familiar with the comics, the narrative of the movie might come as something of a surprise. Rather than a Registration Act that requires superheroes to give up their secret identities (something of a redundancy in the MCU when so many of them don’t bother), the government regulation that our heroes are asked to consider is at the behest of the United Nations, who would like control of when and how the Avengers are deployed. Tony thinks this is a good idea, Steve does not. Then Peggy Carter passes away, and her niece Sharon shares a quote from her aunt at the funeral—one that advises a young Sharon to compromise until she cannot, and then stand firm and make the world bend to her. Needless to say, Steve takes that advice to heart. Joss Whedon had initially said that he wanted the second Avengers film to be a deeply personal affair, and many comics fans assumed that he was going to tackle the Civil War arc as a result. Instead, we got Age of Ultron, which was enjoyable in some aspects, a bit of a mess in others, and not anywhere near as personal as we might have expected. Now we have Captain America: Civil War, a film in which every single character decision is deeply personal, deeply emotional. What’s impressive about the undertaking is how everyone’s points of view are entertained, and while there might be certain characters you agree with overall, no one is depicted as entirely unsympathetic or even entirely wrong. It’s an inevitable step between a team full of vastly opposing personalities, but a painful one. At the core of this fight are Captain America and Iron Man, and deciding whose “team” you’re on is a far woollier choice than audiences might have expected. It’s easy to blame Tony Stark for these proceedings because Tony is egotistical and arrogant, even when he means well, and that makes him appear at fault more often than not. But the film is good at showing the places where Steve Rogers is uniquely unbendable, places where he could compromise and chooses not to, places where his righteousness is less appealing. The truth of the matter is that Steve doesn’t want the Avengers under UN control because Steve Rogers doesn’t trust anyone. In response to idea of these Sokovia Accords, he feels obligated to point out that every member, every country has their own agenda. Which is a fair point, but fails to include the fact that all people generally do, himself included. Captain America doesn’t really trust the will of the people—he thinks it’s far safer for the Avengers to use their own judgment on what missions they take. This is in keeping with Steve’s development in the MCU, particularly as it pertains to Winter Soldier; when he tried to put his trust in the system, it turned out that Hydra was behind that system all along. On the other side of this we have Tony Stark, who, despite being overly-insistent that all problems are his problems, is mainly desperate to keep his friends safe. That is his primary motivation throughout the entire process, a motivation that makes more sense when we learn that his relationship with Pepper Potts hasn’t been working out. (On the one hand, I’m hardly surprised given his recent activities, on the other hand NO YOU TAKE IT BACK.) These are the only people that Tony Stark has in the whole world, but he doesn’t know how to get that across. Or rather, he chooses not to get that across because most of his personal relationships end in abnegation, death, or, you know, attempted murder (thanks, Obadiah!). To his credit, these are problems that he is clearly trying to work through at the outset; we discover that Tony has developed an immersive virtual reality therapy app of sorts, one that allows people to reach into their memories and relive traumatic events with better outcomes to receive closure. He shows an entire room of students his final memory of his parents, and manages to tell his father that he loves him before Howard and Maria drive to their deaths. Both Tony and Steve have viable reasons for thinking that they’re doing the right thing. Both of them make serious errors in judgment as a result: Tony puts Wanda under house arrest, and Steve causes a fair share of collateral damage in effort to help Bucky escape capture. Both of them wish they could compromise their way out of this, but both of them have wildly different ideas about what compromise should entail. And then Bucky is hijacked, and Steve is useless for negotiations from that point forward—particularly once Bucky tells him that their current enemy Col. Helmut Zemo (Daniel Brühl) seems to be after the other five Winter Soldiers programmed by Hydra. Steve Rogers’s fight with Hydra has been a fascinating sticking point for the character throughout these films. Because they turned out to be the power behind S.H.I.E.L.D., the protective organization that Howard Stark and Peggy Carter built, and also behind Bucky’s brainwashing into the Winter Soldier, Captain America’s stake in dismantling Hydra is personal beyond his role in fighting them during WWII. Bucky is most personal of all these offenses, Steve’s only living link to his past once Peggy is gone, his best friend throughout the majority of his life. Which makes it all the more interesting that even Bucky calls Steve on his devotion by the end of the film, positing that he’s not worth so much trouble. Of course, from a personal standpoint, Bucky is… but his comment could almost be read an in indictment of Steve’s unwillingness to take pause and think where his best friend is concerned. From the springboard of Tony and Steve, we come to the other Avengers, who all have different stakes in this fight. Sam Wilson has been on board with helping Cap find his pal since day one, but having the Winter Soldier in the back of their getaway car turns out to be even less enjoyable than he imagined. (The prickly camaraderie that develops between Bucky and Sam is easily one of the highlights of the film.) Rhodey is on Tony’s side due less to their long friendship than to his respect for chain of command, every inch the respectable soldier—let’s be honest, regulation is everything he’s been asking for from Tony since Iron Man 2. Vision believes there is a correlation in the escalation of threats to the multitude of super peoples, and believes that oversight could only help. Hawkeye backs Steve because he’s never been Tony’s biggest fan in the first place, and nothing defines Clint Barton so well as being a perpetual underdog. Ant-Man joins Cap because he’s just jazzed to be there. (Also, Hank Pym isn’t exactly a fan of the Stark family.) Black Widow plays her cards close as always, but the truth is easy to discern in the few words she chooses to say: The Avengers have become her family. All she really wants is for that family to stay whole, even if it means being regulated. But once she realizes that Steve won’t be won over, she backs off, giving up on the hope that the conflict will be resolved easily. The person in this film who feels most done wrong by is Wanda Maximoff, on both a real-world level and a storytelling level. She is badly treated once the conflict is underway because of her near-unlimited and dangerous powers, a treatment made worse for the fact that Vision—the one supervising her house arrest—appears to have a crush on her. On the one hand, Vision is young by existence standards, making it easy to read his attentions as boyish and harmless. On the other hand, it’s discomfiting that Wanda should be held at bay by someone harboring such feelings, and these attentions make Vision seem manipulative and controlling at the very least. She gets the last word, telling him that she cannot control the fear she instills in others, only her own fear. But it doesn’t change the fact that the movie seems at a loss for what to do with Wanda’s power, and that alone feels circumspect in a universe harboring figures like Thor and the Hulk. In the midst of these characters that we know, we are gifted two new faces—T’Challa of Wakanda, and Peter Parker of Queens. Black Panther’s arrival to the MCU is a long time coming, and Chadwick Boseman plays him with incredible poise and grace. We get all of two minutes’ introduction to him and his father and the position of Wakanda in this world, and that’s really all we need to get invested (though we obviously want much more). Because T’Challa believes that Bucky is responsible for his father’s death, it seems as though we’re in for a standard revenge plot. Yet it is Black Panther alone who is able to put aside his all-consuming desire for vengeance, and step away before it is too late. It is a perfect introductory arc, in keeping with what comics fans know of T’Challa, a man known for his intelligence and consideration. It’s going to be hard to wait for that solo film now. Our surprise package comes in the form of a brand new Spider-Man, which confused a fair share of viewers leading up to the film’s release, seeing as he was being played by Andrew Garfield only two years ago. But Tom Holland’s take on Parker is finally as young as Spider-Man was at his inception, a teenager being played by an actual teenager. (For the record, Peter is supposed to be fifteen years old, and Holland was seventeen when he was cast.) What’s more, this is the first version of Spider-Man who appears to come from a visibly lower class bracket; he lives in an old, crowded building in Queens, his room is cramped and awkwardly shaped, and nothing that he owns looks new. Holland’s awkwardness lends Peter an authenticity that audiences have never seen on screen; Spider-Man’s one-liners are more a product of nervousness than true wit. And Tony’s first meeting with the wonder kid makes it abundantly clear that they have a future as mentor and apprentice—not only is Tony the right guy to upgrade Peter’s equipment, but they have something key in common: they both chose to become superheroes due to an overpowering sense of guilt. (Peter tells Tony than when someone with his kind of powers chooses not to use them, people get hurt, an obvious reference to the death of Uncle Ben.) The Avengers-on-Avengers remix battle is one of the most entertaining fight sequences that a Marvel movie has ever produced, and that’s mostly down to a sharp balance of levity and pain. This has a lot to do with the fact that very few of these people are personally angry with each other, and a few of them have no emotional investment in the fight whatsoever. Ant-Man merely does what’s asked of him, with no particular upset toward anyone who knocks him down a peg. Spider-Man is going on Tony’s orders, and only aims to capture, never to wound. Hawkeye and Widow are basically play-fighting, to the point where Wanda tosses Natasha out of the way because Clint was “pulling his punches.” For all the real fear bound up in this fight, there’s an equal amount of love that simply can’t be quashed. That all comes to a close when Cap and Bucky get away on the Avenger’s jet, with War Machine and Falcon in pursuit. Tony orders Vision to take down Falcon, but he’s distracted by Wanda’s injuries and misses, hitting Rhodey instead and sending him into a free fall. Watching him hit the ground as Iron Man and Falcon struggle to reach him is sickening, and while Rhodey survives the fall, his immobilizing injuries make him the true casualty of this war. Ever the soldier, he later tells Tony that he stands by the choices that he made, that he has always known the risks of combat and continued to do his job. It’s an absolution of sorts, but not one that Tony Stark is likely to take to heart. The final act comes when Tony receives the information he needs to confirm Cap’s story, proof that Bucky was not responsible for the UN bombing that killed T’Challa’s father. But the extra information that Steve and Bucky were going on proves to be a red herring; Zemo, an oddly silent villain through the tale’s proceedings, has killed off the remaining Winter Soldiers, and offers up something else instead—footage of a mission taken on by the Winter Soldier in 1991. Footage of James Buchanan Barnes murdering Tony’s parents. And when Tony asks the most important question of all—whether or not Steve knew Bucky had done this—Steve Rogers is not able to give his usually noble answer. Instead, he has to admit that he protected his friend, and has known all along. All superhero villains tend to be more interesting when they have a real personal connection to the people they are trying to destroy. It’s the reason why Ronan and Ultron are ultimately less engaging than Loki and The Mandarin. In Zemo, we have someone who is not acting out of a desire for power or glory, but a man who simply wants to ruin the Avengers’ lives for ruining his. And in his strange wisdom, he knows precisely how to do it. He knows exactly what buttons to push. He knows that Tony Stark will want to kill Bucky Barnes for murdering his mother (not his parents, not his father, his mother), and he knows that Steve Rogers will never allow that to happen. And while Tony’s revelation is immediate and horrific, it is Steve that we’re to watch. Because the movie isn’t called Iron Man: Civil War, is it? It’s not even called Avengers: Civil War. It’s got Captain America’s name on it because this movie is ultimately here to teach us something about him. What we have—as we always did—is a beautifully unique rendition of a character who would have been easy to paint in a stale, dull hue. This version of Captain America postulates that the true way to be “the greatest” American is to be an individualist, albeit a truly empathetic one. Steve Rogers really isn’t much of a team player in a universal sense; he’s not a “good little soldier”; he’s only a good leader when backed by a crew that is well-suited to his particular way of doing things. He’s anti-establishment at a fundamental level, which is a refreshing thing to reinforce in a hero whose origins are bound up in nationalism. So he fights to rescue his best friend—who deserves a second chance—at the expense of every other relationship he has forged, because it’s the right thing to do. When Tony tells Steve that he doesn’t deserve the Captain America shield, Steve chooses to discard it, and this seems to work on two levels; first off, Tony has conflated the image of Captain America with the man Steve Rogers (which is to be expected, given how Howard built the man up to his son as a figure to emulate); secondly, Steve has no difficulty casting aside the symbol that is Captain America, particularly in that moment, if it means saving Bucky’s life. And this is central to everything that makes Steve the man who can wear that uniform in the first place—as the saying goes, no one who is capable of getting themselves elected president should be allowed to do the job. And by the end of the film, Steve pointedly understands that as well. The letter he leaves Tony is half apology, half self-realization. He acknowledges that withholding information on the death of Tony’s parents was a selfish move on his part. He acknowledges that he has always been a man apart from others, and that in this capacity, the Avengers belong more to Tony than they ever have to him. But he also acknowledges that he cannot walk away from Tony Stark, or their friends. That he cannot leave the role of Captain America, he can only pause his portrayal of it. So he gathers their team and tells Tony that they will wait for his call. Emmet Asher-Perrin had so much excess adrenaline after watching that movie, she probably could have stopped a moving car, too.

"Dec 8, 2018",POSITIVE," Last month, I was severely disappointed with the meeting of two comic-book titans on the screen. Batman v. Superman shot big, but missed.  With film trailers pointing to a rich philosophical divide between Bruce & Clark, culminating in what could have been the Battle Royale of all things geekdom, instead, the film was a mess, one failing at the heavy task of “world-building” multiple franchises for Warner Bros. while trying to build a coherent narrative, worthy of the timeless heroes.  I don’t want to make this review a comparison piece, because I’m sure you’ll find many of those on the internet, formally written as articles or scribbled on random comment threads.  However, this instinct to bring up BvS is no accident, nor is it unfair to draw a comparison, as at one time, both films were set to open the same day.  I’m glad they didn’t, because the space of time between their releases has given me time to realize all the things that could have gone wrong with Captain America: Civil War, and I’m glad to say that it looks like it escaped such things. WOW! What a fantastic film! Overall, the two movies deal with similar themes: a philosophical impasse between two heroes, each being manipulated by circumstances, agendas, and gut-feelings.  It’s potentially powerful material, and with the vast histories of the DC & Marvel universes, even though both films were almost explicitly marketed as “adaptations” of popular story arcs (DC Comics‘ The Dark Knight Returns & Marvel‘s Civil War), each film plotted its own course.  I believe it was the wisest course for both.  Still, as I alluded too, ‘BvS’ crumbled under too many plotlines, unconventional takes on long-established characters, and the burden of establishing so many new films stemming from it.  Civil War does not. I should say this early on: Civil War is not Avengers 2.5, but it is.  At the heart of this film, we find Cap & Bucky (even though, arguably, it made a better Avengers film than Avengers: Age of Ultron).  We know his guilt over Bucky’s “death” in Captain America: The First Avenger, almost stopped him from being the hero, and guilt over what Bucky had become in Captain America: The Winter Soldier warred on him as well.  Still, in this film, we see one friend who won’t give up on another, even when all goes against them.  The war between loyalties, yes, is stretched between all the heroes featured in the film, but at the center, we see Cap choose his belief in Bucky, even over Tony Stark.  I would be remiss to say that our Golden Boy doesn’t keep his shine throughout the film.  I felt a real palpable shift in my own allegiance of who was “right” in the film, when all is known in the end.  My takeaway from it all, in the effort to avoid spoilers, is that relationships are messy, and when there is a competition for loyalties, someone will lose out, even (and especially when) we do our best to not hurt them, and it will have a rippling effect throughout our lives. Just like Avengers: Age of Ultron, we get another jet-setting adventure.  I lost count of how many times a city or country was plastered across the screen, signalling a transition in location, but we go all over here.  Still, I didn’t ever feel lost.  The plot moved along at a pace that never slogged, and even after a 147-minute runtime, I wasn’t looking for it to end.  Crowd-pleasing isn’t always said as a compliment in all circles, but here, I can share that the theater I was in cheered, laughed, and awed throughout.  There are some great surprises for general audiences within this film, but nothing that comic-buff couldn’t see coming. While I could go into a lengthy dissection of all characters and their loyalties, I’ll try to be brief in what needs to be said.  Someone who won’t get mentioned much in many reviews, but who brought the goods was William Hurt, returning as Thaddeus Ross, now Secretary of State.  Seeing him without the Hulk and nary much mention of him at all was a little strange, but I’ve always respected Hurt as an actor, and he didn’t disappoint here, acting as the face of the catalyst for dealing with the heroes’ recurring collateral damage through the Sokovia Accords, a global response initiative aimed at keeping the heroes on call and in check by the world governments.  This legislation is brought about alongside news of a terrorist incident implicating Bucky Barnes, also known as the former Soviet assassin, The Winter Soldier. All of this together unsettles Captain America and stirs him to resist, and several fall in line behind him for various reasons. Through the preceding Marvel films, we have seen these heroes witness a corrupted S.H.I.E.L.D. organization, and they feel reason to defy the directives, if on nothing else but the idea of precedence alone.  On the other side, we see Iron Man, who feels guilt for the damage he and others have caused.  Falling in line among others behind him, we have two new heroes: Black Panther & Spider-Man.  Black Panther, played by Chadwick Boseman, was probably my favorite aspect of the film: his power, presence, and sense of duty were incredible.  From his story arc, we get a powerful lesson on seeking justice before vengeance, merciful in ways but just as resolute.  Retaliation can often bring other hurts into our own lives, and seeing his story spoke the most powerful lesson in the film to me. Spider-Man, on the other hand, was just pure glee.  He’s absolutely incredible to see alongside all the others we’ve known in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and his adolescent nature, brought out wonderfully by Tom Holland, made him feel unique, as he played with the adults.  I can’t wait to see more from both characters moving forward. Civil War never felt beholden to “world building” of establishing the many films that will be following; however, it did feel richly constructed upon the many films made prior, which is more than great.  One could argue that much of the movie-going public is spending time engrossed in multi-season storylines via streaming on Netflix and Amazon Prime, so relying upon what came before isn’t the problem it could have been in years past with other properties.  Don’t expect hand-holding as an audience here.  You’ll go from scenes featuring a multi-colored, floating android to a man who can change his size at will.  It’s now expected you saw all the films that preceded, and if you did, I believe you’ll be witnessing something special in the entertainment landscape: serialized blockbusters, where characters can drop in and out of narratives with little thought against it by the audience.  I’m excited for all that is possible now in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and this film just proves the quality hasn’t quit yet."
"Nov 19, 2018",POSITIVE,"Overall, Civil War is the most adult and realized film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and it comes highly recommended."
"Nov 14, 2018",POSITIVE," I am slowly trying to calm myself after watching this movie. (inserts standing ovation and Shia LeBouf clap) Marvel shocked us all when they announced a special fan screening of Captain America:Civil War three weeks prior to the movie coming out. Normally most studios only show high profile screenings a few days before the movie launches. I have to say this is probably one of the best films in the Marvel Universe if not the best one yet which makes sense as to why they decided to screen the movie so early. CA:CW is also trending high on Rotten Tomatoes with a 100% score pre release (Now 92%). This movie gives you more of what you were missing from Avengers: Age of Ultron in the sequel to the last Captain America: Winter Soldier. In CA:CW we are starting to see the destruction the Avengers have left behind in their plan to keep the world safe. Though their intentions are good many innocent people have died from the many battles of the Avengers. In this movie, you see the toil this has taken on characters like Wanda Maximoff, Tony Stark, and Bucky Barnes to name a few. This movie has a different feel from the others since despite the amazing action sequences (we will talk about this later) it really relied on the characters to showcase their amazing acting capabilities. You see a reversal of characters between Stark and Rogers. Stark who is atoning for the wrong his weapons and his role in the Avengers has made to Rogers who is taking a stand for what he truly believes in and allowing himself to break the law and stand against the United Nations. We also see Bucky who is not the evil Winter Soldier we saw in the first Captain America movie to now a tortured sole who is remembering all of the terrible acts he has committed. We finally see the once tight knit Avengers take sides in who they believe is right. Should they stand with Iron Man who believes that they should be in check by the United Nations or Captain America who feels that the United Nations serves their own agenda which might not align with saving the world for the right reasons. This puts many of the Avengers on opposing sides which leads to an epic showdown of our beloved heroes at an airport. One of the great things about CA:CW is that they truly paired each opposing hero up very well which led to a realistic and glorious fight sequence. In addition to our normal heroes we are introduced to two exciting new additions into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Black Panther and Spider-Man. I believe that these two characters truly stole the show. Chadwick Boseman did a superb job as portraying Black Panther and does not disappoint in his action scenes. The 19 year old newcomer Tom Holland left the audience in laughter and excitement as he did a great job of holding his own in the movie and keeping Marvel fans excited for the new Spider-Man returning home to Marvel. With a great storyline and amazing special effects and actions scenes many fans will forget about the bad taste Batman vs Superman left in their mouths and will be excited for the new installments of Marvel movies to come. DC Comics should be worried because Civil War has definitely set the bar high and comic book fans across the world will not be disappointed."
"Nov 9, 2018",POSITIVE," Well another super-sized Marvel Comics super-hero saga hits the big screen with the selected saviour Captain America taking the top billing on the marquee. Thus, the pulsating popcorn pleaser ‘Captain America: Civil War’ arrives on the scene to giddy audiences that have been loyal and fixated on the successful spring of mighty Marvel heroes that have been paraded to viewers throughout the last few years. Thankfully, ‘Captain America: Civil War’ carries on the tradition of spry super-hero-studded spectacles that have been glorious and adventurous from the stable of Marvel-based movies guaranteed to win over the enthusiastic hearts of avid comicbook fanboys everywhere. Joyously overstuffed and convincingly extensive with a super-team armed with crime-fighting excess, ‘Civil War’ seizes the moment to introduce a noteworthy twist: two factions of rescuing super-powers engaging in some explosive in-house fighting led by two of Marvel Comics main standouts in Chris Evans’s Captain America and Robert Downey Jr.’s Iron Man. Co-directors Anthony Russo and Rene Russo were instinctively crafty to link the overly successful ‘Iron Man’ film franchise to the ‘Captain America: Civil War’ inner circle to ensure an even more treasured toxic atmosphere. Super-hero fans will get a thrill of witnessing the extra add-ons concerning other dynamic titans to join the action-packed festivities involving Team Captain America versus Team Iron Man. True, ‘Civil War’ has its share of flaws but that does not take away from this heroes-in-crisis flick demonstrating its ambitious overtones. So what has caused the bad blood among the great and grand good guys known for protecting the world from evil dominance and destruction? Essentially, the theme of collateral damage, the involvement regarding civilian-related deaths and injuries plus the world-wide backlash has created a controversy pitted against The Avengers. Specifically, Captain America (aka Steve Rogers) and Scarlet Witch/Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen)  are responsible for the boisterous battle that caused such negative sensation resulting in political turmoil. Avengers head honcho Iron Man (aka Tony Stark) is dealing with his own personal regrets in the ill-advised creation of the unpredictable Ultron. The political authority want to hold Iron Man, second-in-command Captain America and the rest of the Avengers accountable for the global devastation that have taking its toll when trying to oversee the potential harm wreaking havoc on humanity. Leading the charge in putting a watchful eye on the labeled reckless Avengers is Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) that suggests the super-group be monitored by the United Nations. Naturally friction develops between the super-heroes that either agree with Ross’s UN restriction policies or disagree with being placed under a microscope that threatens to handcuff their free-wheeling heroic duties. All these contrasting beliefs eventually turn into epic back-and-forth confrontations where the raging Avengers are at odds with each other. For Stark/Iron Man’s stance, he is willing to toe the line and ultimately agree that his crew needs to tone down their tenacious tactics as crime-stoppers. Iron Man’s consciousness, particularly in the case of a disillusioned mother (Alfre Woodward) making him feel guilt-ridden over her son’s death during an intense Battle of Sokovia, is probably the main factor behind his decision to have his team reigned in a bit from the political watchdogs. Siding with Iron Man’s viewpoint are the likes of Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Vision (Paul Bettany) and War Machine (Don Cheadle). As for Rogers/Captain America, he is not too thrilled being put in check by the intrusive governmental pencil-pushers that want to scrutinise the team’s every move. Standing with Captain America firmly are Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and the aforementioned Scarlet Witch. On top of Captain America’s current Avengers-oriented strife in his contentious mingling with Iron Man and his ardent backers, he now finds himself trying to defend his old buddy-turned-wanted man Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) who is accused of killing civilians. Iron Man believes in Winter Soldier’s innocence and goes so far as to help him escape. Yes…Winter Soldier does come with more baggage attached to him, mainly in the form of the menacing Zemo (Daniel Bruhl). The Russos and screenwriters Christopher Marckus and Stephen McFeely (all attached to the previous ‘Captain America: Winter Soldier’) provide the eyeful visual effects that predictably stimulate and effectively add to the overload of frenzied frolicking  in this boisterous blockbuster. Certainly the deepened angst among this bombastic bunch works far more solidly than what was displayed in the stiffened and problematic ‘Batman v Superman’. The notion that the entire globe and its leaders are weary of all the collective chaos at the hands of the Avengers trying to save their hides is a bit ridiculous. Besides, why are not the foes of the Avengers put on the hot coals for the societal ruination? It seems rather counter-productive to chastise the noble super-powers offering the safety of mankind yet the detractors not being grateful for the services that the Avengers bring to the table. It is somewhat convoluted to think that the global community are sour on our heralded heroes or that the heat generated within the walls will completely destroy the Avengers and their colourful, capable colleagues. The movie’s aptly entitled ‘Civil War’ does invite more punch to the proceedings especially when a who’s who of super-hero showstoppers join the feisty fray at hand. The noted inclusion of defiant do-gooders are packed with the likes of Spider-Man (Tom Holland), the retired returnee Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), and nifty newcomer Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman). No doubt ‘Captain America: Civil War’ is the impish and energising launch pad for upcoming Marvel-induced movies waiting to make their future distinctive arrival on the big screen. Although Evans’ steady and charismatic Captain America more than holds his own as the solo act billed in the film’s title, one cannot overlook Downey’s compelling Iron Man as the reliable source that lifts the profile of Evans’s masked wonder. This is indeed a collaborative big score for the glorified costumed cast but special kudos are reserved for Stan’s killing culprit as well as Boseman’s African president assuming the slick and resourceful Black Panther. Yeah, ‘Captain America: Civil War’ is true to its frenetic form as revved up entertainment preparing moviegoers for the upcoming summertime sizzle at the box office.

"Nov 1, 2018",POSITIVE,"Armed with the confidence that can only come from an unprecedented record of sustained success that's without comparison in this genre, Civil War emerges as as the strongest offering yet from Marvel Studios."
"Nov 1, 2018",POSITIVE," With Batman v Superman proving unsatisfactory to many audience members craving to see their favourite heroes beat the crap out of each other, all eyes are now on Marvel Studios to see if they can accomplish what DC fumbled. But the two films have more than just duelling super-egos in common: both are crammed with characters from across their respective universes, both are establishing groundwork for the immediate future, both take inspiration from classic stories from the source material, and both are really, really long. But whilst Dawn of Justice strained under the weight of its ambitions, barely making it to the finish line in one piece, Captain America: Civil War balances all of its moving parts effortlessly to craft what could easily be the MCU’s grandest adventure yet. Those expecting a beat-for-beat adaptation of Mark Millar’s original Civil War storyline are going to be disappointed, but given the state of the Marvel Universe right now and the company’s lack of key comic book characters that was never going to happen. Instead, the film lifts key elements whilst mostly telling its own story, and in the process has turned what was originally just an excuse to force heroes into conflict into a legitimately gripping war of ethics. Whilst this is still Cap’s story and his views are generally portrayed as the correct ones, the film does a good job of justifying the other point-of-view; nobody feels drastically out of character like some did in the comics. The story has a grand scope as it hops around the world and brings in so many characters old and new, but unlike the competition it never feels disorienting or poorly developed. Even with its many disparate parts, every piece is under control and everything important is kept in the foreground. It’s this kind of thoughtful design that makes the film’s epic runtime breeze by, and even though certain characters do have smaller parts they never feel short-changed. There is never a moment where a scene was cut too short or moment was left to drag; everything is in perfect order. It is, however, not without fault. The film does blow its wad in the scale department a little too early, following what’s easily the most fantastic fight sequence in superhero movie history with an admittedly more emotional but less impressive final battle, and the film’s big third-act reveal feels a little too telegraphed and is mainly just there to reinforce conflict. But the film does have a strong open ending, leaving the universe in an uncertain state of flux much like The Winter Soldier did, but again it never feels like they’re forcefully teasing future movies. Every other character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe makes an appearance in this movie, so covering everyone is just going to be redundant. Long story short, every returning player is as good as ever and all are given just the right amount of screen time to shine. The tempestuous relationship between Chris Evans’ Cap and Robert Downey Jr’s Iron Man takes centre stage here, and what began in The Avengers as playful bickering has evolved into a true conflict of ideals. But even within all their clashing, they never forget that they’re usually allies and they both understand and even somewhat respect the other’s point of view; again, their motivations never feel skewed just to force hostility. But within all of that are also great little character moments for the other recurring characters; it’s great to see the Ant-Man geek out over meeting The Avengers, Falcon and Winter Solider exchange barbs about leg room in a car, or the burgeoning relationship between Vision and Scarlet Witch. It’s also fun to see William Hurt return as “Thunderbolt” Ross, finally connecting The Incredible Hulk back into the overarching story in a meaningful way (now we just need Abomination and Leader to become relevant again). But even with all that, audiences are sure to be talking all about the movie’s fantastic introductions to Black Panther and Spider-Man. Chadwick Boseman makes for an excellent Panther, balancing the character’s honour and pride with a lust for vengeance, turning what could have easily been yet another piece of Marvel cross-promotion into a key piece of the film’s thematic conflict. Tom Holland’s performance as the third cinematic web slinger finally embraces the character’s potential on screen, creating a Spider-Man that is optimistic and the butt of many jokes but one who can still stand toe-to-toe with these powerhouses of the universe. Holland’s screen time may be brief and it could be argued his story is superfluous to the plot, but everything about his scenes is executed flawlessly and I can’t wait to see him take centre stage in his own movie next summer. If there is a weak link in the cast, it’s Daniel Bruhl as the villainous mastermind Zemo. Bruhl puts in a strong performance as the character, but the film doesn’t do a great job of explaining his motives, giving only the vaguest of hints before dumping it all on us right before the end. He’s like a living embodiment of forced conflict; everything he does accomplishes nothing but getting characters to the point of hostility. That all results in some absolutely amazing fights, but it’s still an obvious ploy nonetheless. On a spectacle level, Civil War blows all of the other MCU movies out of the water. Every action sequence in this movie is absolutely on-point and, given that the second unit directors are the guys who brought you John Wick, that should be no surprise. It really feels like the filmmakers explored every possible way these characters could utilize their powers in combat and took advantage of that, creating for some truly outstanding mash-ups that are as imaginatively conceived as they are choreographed. The camerawork and editing is fast and frenetic, but never in a way that obscures the action. Instead, it amplifies the intensity of the conflict, making every blow impactful and awe-inspiring. The visual effects aren’t always completely convincing, but because of how light and fantastical the film looks it manages to get away with it. What they lack in believability they more than make up for in ingenuity, crafting incredible moments that could have only been accomplished digitally. Captain America: Civil War delivers on all its promises to be a fantastic ride and then some, proving that complex superhero movies packed with story threads and characters can be made if done with care. It improves on its source material by making the conflict feel more natural and with better parallels to real-world issues, rather than falling prey to petty squabbles that go against previous character development. It’s a near flawless piece of blockbuster entertainment, one that probably won’t convert anyone uninterested in the franchise so far, but for all us True Believers invested in this universe it’s an absolute treat. All I can now ask is this: how the hell is Infinity War going to top it?"
"Nov 1, 2018",POSITIVE," Awhile back, HIGHLANDER: THE SERIES show runner David Abramowitz described that enterprise as “a Talmudic discussion with ass-kicking.” That assessment frequently springs to mind while watching CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR. The movie, the latest in Marvel’s cinematic universe (aka the MCU), unfolds with reasonable logic after the events of 2015’s AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON. The world is already troubled by the fact that the Avengers, although they saved more people than they harmed, still racked up substantial civilian casualties when the country of Sekovia became unmoored from the rest of planet Earth. On a mission in Nigeria to stop a terrorist (Frank Grillo) seeking to get his hands on a bio-weapon, Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) and his team accidentally take out a building. The United Nations, including the U.S., think some oversight is in order. That august body wants the Avengers to sign accords that are essentially a contract saying the superheroes will deploy at the behest of the U.N., and only then. Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), who wasn’t in Nigeria, is negotiating his own guilt over Sekovia and, after a lifetime of rebellion, is thinking it might be time to let someone else make the tough choices. Steve, who has been accustomed to siding with the government, sees how this could go terribly wrong. When another tragedy strikes and Steve’s old friend Bucky Barnes/the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) is the key suspect, the only way for Cap to keep his pal alive and find out what’s really going on is for him to go rogue. Tony and some of the other Avengers are afraid Steve will get himself killed, while another set of Avengers agree with the Captain. A few extra superheroes join the fray for good measure. The stakes keep climbing, though one of the high points of CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR is a fight among friends who are simply trying to contain one another rather than do real harm – it’s an intentional hoot that also addresses a multitude of those matchup questions (who’d win if Iron Man fought Captain America, etc., etc.). Still, that whole who-is-going-to-wind-up-versus-whom issue requires some obvious labor; we can see the wheels turning with a little too much effort to get some of the challengers into position. What will be intriguing to some and annoying to others is that the movie is genuinely interested in its topic. CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR is something like a fantasy version of EYE IN THE SKY, with people who have real power debating issues that are the fantasy equivalent of drone strikes – who should get to call them and when, if ever, and under what circumstances are they justifiable? Do the agents of force know their own strength and are they the best judges of when to use it? Unfortunately for those of us who are invested in the Talmudic discussion (ass-kicking included), the film has to shift some gears to get to the climax it wants, so that the resolution winds up hinging on a different type of moral matter. It seems there might also be more to be made of Steve and Tony winding up not only on different sides from one another, but taking positions counter to their personal norms. Then again, there’s only so much that can be fit into the 146-minute running time. Standouts in the sizable cast are Evans, a thoughtful Downey and a charismatic Chadwick Boseman as an African prince who has his own superhero identity. The action is usually inventive and impressive, though the most startling and awe-inspiring special effect is somehow getting Downey to appear to be in his teens for an extended fantasy flashback sequence. CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR expects a certain amount of familiarity with the Marvel Comics Universe mythos. If someone happens to wander in off the street, they’ll still be able to follow what’s going on, but it helps to come in caring about these people. The movie does wander off-topic just a bit at moments, but for the most part, this is a superhero epic with something real on its mind and the chops to present it well."
"Oct 31, 2018",POSITIVE," It's a long-standing convention in comics to pit superheroes against each other. It's possibly the only thing more exciting than sending a superhero off to battle the latest megalomanical villain bent on world domination. But it can also be a highly problematic narrative device if it's not handled properly. When a hero goes after the bad guy, there tends to be a clear-cut reason why. Save the world, save a friend, save the whales, whatever is most convenient. When heroes square off against each other, though, there better be a damn good reason for it, because there guys are all supposed to be fighting on the same side. That's the heart of Captain America: Civil War, the 13th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and one that not only offers hero-on-hero combat of the best possible kind but also gives a compelling reason why that combat should happen in the first place. Taking place a year after the events of Age Of Ultron, Captain America (Chris Evans) and the Avengers have been brought to task for the collateral damage they've caused in their previous exploits, including an opening set piece in Lagos that results in the side of a populated building being blown to smithereens. The United Nations calls on the Avengers to sign an accord limiting their authority and removing their ability to act unilaterally; they would only act when sanction by an international oversight committee. Cap is against the idea, believing it to be a hindrance to doing what's right instead of what's politically expedient, while Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.) believes it's necessary to prevent more collateral damage. When events involving a person from Cap's past result in more casualties, Cap and his allies go rogue in an effort to find out who's behind things while also trying to evade Tony and his team, who have been ordered to arrest them for going vigilante. That basic plot description, though, doesn't truly begin to plumb the depth of the complex web of emotions and motivations that drive the film and drive allies against each other in the most dramatic of ways. Much like Capitan America: The Winter Soldier was much a political thriller as it was a traditional superhero film, so too is Civil War much more than just a 147-minute men-in-tights slugfest. It's an examination of not only the myth of the superhero, but how or even if a superhero should operate on the same level and under the same rules as non-powered humanity. Boasting the same creative team as the previous two Captain America films — directors Anthony and Joe Russo; screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely — Civil War is an assured, confident conclusion to a trilogy that builds organically upon its established elements.  A large part of what makes the film work so well is the dedication of its players, nearly all of whom seem to fully inhabit their roles. Chris Evans perfectly embodies the Captain's unflinching devotion to the greater good, while Robert Downey, Jr., is still the sarcastic, egocentric flip-side of that same devotion. Both men play the characters as more subdued this time, with Downey, Jr., even bringing new and exciting facets to Stark's character that were only ever previously hinted at. The supporting cast of the film is so large that this almost feels like a third Avengers film, but none of the characters seem extraneous, and each one contributes to the tangled mass of humanity that makes up the film's core conceit. Of the other heroes, it's the women who seem to be doing some of the heaviest lifting. Scarlett Johansson once again beautifully underplays Natasha Romonoff/Black Widow as someone always looking for a new angle and new opportunity.  Even more impressive is Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch, one of the most damaged and vulnerable heroes, but also potentially the most powerful member of the cast. She's the only hero with inherent superpowers that defy basic scientific laws, and because of that, she's more a subject of fear and derision than any of the other Avengers, a fear that she's deeply internalized. (Just don't call her a mutant unless you want to hear from 20th Century Fox's lawyers.) When she comes into her own during the climatic battle, however, it's exciting to behold. After she telekinetically separates a dueling Black Widow and Hakweye (Jeremy Renner), she calmly reprimands Hawkeye with “You're pulling your punches” in a way that's almost terrifying in its complete lack of emotion. Of course, what would a Marvel film be if we didn't introduce a couple new heroes, and thanks to the trailers there aren't any surprises as to who those are. The first is Black Panther, played with savage grace by Chadwick Boseman. One of Marvel's oldest heroes, and one of the few African heroes to grace superhero films, Panther is a potent mix of nobility and primal energy. His calm, almost stoic public identity is a sharp contrast to the furious, no-holds-barred warrior he becomes while in his indestructible super-suit. The other new addition is a little-known hero called Spider-Man, here played by Tom Holland. While Sony has rightly been criticized for rebooting Spider-Man for the third time since 2002 — and for giving us yet another iteration of Peter Parker instead of someone like Miles Morales — at least they hired an actor who fully connects with the giddy, whiz-bang attitude the web-slinger is supposed to have. For the first time, a teen-aged Peter Parker is played by an actual teenager, and Holland perfectly captures both the geeky, egghead side of Peter Parker as well as the “wow! cool!” side of a kid suddenly getting to fight alongside the world's biggest heroes. Characters aside, a film like this largely lives or dies by its action sequences. After all, that's the main hook of the whole thing. It was the be-all and end-all of this year's Batman V. Superman, but while that film seemed intent to lean solely on a couple of growling comic book titans punching each other repeatedly for two-and-a-half joyless hours, the fights in Civil War often come close to pure comic book excitement. (And unlike that film, the screen is full of actual colors and plenty of light.) The team-on-team face-off that makes up the end of the second act is a sprawling, epic smackdown that never feels too long or too confusing and grabs hold of the audience's attention right from the start. All the fights in the film are well-choreographed, and each hero is given a very specific style and move set, from Black Widow's brutal lucha-libre leg holds to Black Panther's wire-fu leaps and spin kicks. If anything else, the mere fact that a fight with this many diverse combatants could be staged at all is impressive in and of itself.  Sadly, when the film steps away from the fights and away from the Team Cap/Team Iron Man conflict driving them, things do tend to slow down significantly. There's an actual villain beyond any of the heroes, but he's thinly-drawn and remarkable shallow, with the actor playing him giving a flat performance that doesn't even try to add any depth. Instead of focusing completely on the pro- and anti-authority sides of the intra-Avengers conflict, the film tries to marry that story to a different plot thread featuring a different threat, and it doesn't always work well. That also means that after the huge, second-act team battle, any fights afterward seem that much more less exciting, no matter how well-staged they are. Likewise, it takes a while to get to the point where the Avengers have no choice but to fight each other, and the first-act lead-up to that is uncharacteristically rough and slightly unfocused, sometimes bouncing from scene to scene with the same jarring transitions that marred Batman V Superman. Once the seeds of the team conflict are planted, the film finds a perfect pace and balance, but the lead-up is certainly a bit of a bumpy ride.  The film's other setback is one it also shares with Batman V Superman in that it can be a tad impenetrable to people outside the comic book fandom. While there aren't quite as many easter eggs or fanservice moments, the film does assume that you've kept up with the Marvel Cinematic Universe since the first Iron Man (although it doesn't really reference anything in any of the Hulk or Thor solo films). While the fight scenes and set-pieces are certainly enjoyable regardless, a lot of the character drama and narrative heart of the film is lost if you aren't invested in the characters. Given the MCU's massive reach and popularity, it may seem like an odd criticism, but it's still warranted at least a little bit. The Scarlet Witch's personal story arc in particular loses a lot of heft if you haven't seen her previous appearances, for instance. Even with these criticisms, it's hard not to be thrilled and captivated by Civil War, a film that continues Marvel's history of not only making exciting, enjoyable films, but also ones that ask deeper questions and explore themes beyond fisticuffs. The heroes in Marvel films are, with perhaps one or two exceptions, real human beings with real human motivations. It's telling that aside from the Captain himself and the Vision (Paul Bettany), the characters are almost never referred to by their code names but by their actual names. When the Avengers try to find their place in the world, it's something many of us can sympathize with because they face recognizable problems, even if they face those problems with extraordinary abilities. A scene where the Captain tries to keep a helicopter from taking off with his bare hands is not only visually captivating because of Chris Evans' straining every bulging muscle in his pumped-up body. It also contains a surprising amount of honestly-won drama and empathy not only built up over the course of the film itself but over years of careful world-bulding and character development. Marvel has proven time and again that it's possible to make a film that's not only as exciting and fantastical as any comic book, but also as down-to-earth and compelling as any character drama, and Civil War is certainly no exception. “Gay Pride was not born out of a need to celebrate not being straight, but our right to exist without prosecution…So maybe instead of wondering why there isn’t a straight pride month or movement, straight people should be thankful they don’t need one.”"
"Sep 5, 2018",POSITIVE,It manages to capture the super hero team as its only ever been done in animated series. It's next to impossible to get this kind of emotional connectedness in a few hours.
"Aug 30, 2018",POSITIVE,This is Marvel Studio's best film to date bar none.
"Aug 27, 2018",POSITIVE," Those of us who have been complaining that the stakes in superhero movies have gotten ridiculously high, that it’s always the end of the world, will be relieved that Captain America: Civil War brings things back down to Earth. There are no aliens, no artificial intelligences, no angry gods or malignant outside forces. Directed by Joe and Anthony Russo, Civil War opens with a gorgeously choreographed set piece that ties off one of several dangling threads from Winter Soldier (2014), the second installment in Marvel’s Captain America franchise. Working gloriously as a team, the Avengers solve the immediate problem but create another: An explosion kills people in a nearby building. Combine that with the grieving mother who confronts Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), and the movie’s point seems clear: All that collateral damage you’ve been complaining about in Age of Ultron and Man of Steel and the like? It has to stop. But should this team control itself or, instead, be placed under outside supervision? Stark, offered an external way to put his arrogance in check, basically says: Yes, please, stop me from hurting anyone else and keep my friends from getting hurt. Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), for reasons also involving his friends, disagrees. The team splits, and they cause a lot more collateral damage fighting about it — you get the picture. Except the oversight argument isn’t really the point. (If it were, there would be some gesture toward a serious argument about the good the Avengers have done.) Civil War nods to its political parallels, but then focuses on the way ego, fear and love drive a person’s choices. The divide between Tony Stark and Steve Rogers turns the movie into a sort of Rorschach test: Do you side with cocky, troubled Stark, who can’t express his emotions but is burning up with PTSD and guilt? Or with Rogers, who doesn’t trust the authorities after what happened in the previous movie that bore his name? Personally, I’m for Team Wanda (Elizabeth Olsen). With Thor and Hulk absent, this reformed baddie is easily the most powerful human on the team, and the movie doesn’t know what to do with her — an unfortunately apt statement on women in the Marvel Cinematic Universe in general (a few good Black Widow moments notwithstanding). Tony puts Wanda under house arrest with Vision (Paul Bettany), whose crush on her makes the entire situation extra creepy; she gets another pep talk from Clint (Jeremy Renner), but mostly she’s there as an object of the disagreement. However accidentally, Wanda killed people in this new, enlightened world, and must do the time for all of them. Civil War is essentially a nasty disagreement among friends that degenerates into a powered-up slap fight. (One of the filmmakers’ best choices is to have the fights collapse along with the arguments; the last blow-up has nothing of the opening sequence’s grace.) At least these superfriends can still crack a joke (I’ve never been more grateful for Anthony Mackie’s light touch) and, for all its seriousness, Civil War sustains a much-needed sense of humor."
"Aug 27, 2018",POSITIVE,Most of the film's pleasures come from dorky pipsqueak Tom Holland taking up the mantle of Spider-Man and joining the fight between Avengers factions.
"Aug 23, 2018",POSITIVE,"With swift pacing, a generally well-rounded story, and fantastic action sequences, ""Civil War"" is not to be missed."
"Aug 22, 2018",POSITIVE," One of my biggest concerns about superhero movies is that the main characters zip around, crashing and bashing bad guys, and leave a trail of collateral damage and decimated cities in their wake. No one seems to address that…until now. In fact, taking responsibility for the casualties is the very essence of Captain America – Civil War, and the humanity in that is what makes this film one of the best Marvel Comic movies yet. Since Steve Rogers/Captain America (chisel-profiled Chris Evans) is a WWII hero, we expect more good old-fashioned values from him and less tech, which makes his clash with Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.) all the more interesting. Here it seems the world powers-that-be are concerned about the heroes taking justice into their own hands without being held accountable for the lives and property lost in the process. So this league of nations has come up with a pact to regulate and oversee the superheroes’ actions. At that point, it becomes all about those Marvels who wish to submit to the pact, versus those who don’t. And if you don’t already know who’s on which side, I’m not going to tell you, because half the fun is seeing how the heroes align. Also great fun is the recruitment of other superheroes from the Marvel universe to bolster each side. Even Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) joins the fray, as does Spiderman (Tom Holland). I can just imagine the legal finagling it took to borrow the webbed wonder from Sony, which owns that particular franchise. Many characters are back from Avengers: Age of Ultron and the previous two Captain America flicks, so if you want to be on top of things, you might want to take a few minutes to quickly review those films. Or at least look up Vision, Winter Soldier and Scarlet Witch. Even if you don’t, you’ll catch on soon enough, and still have a rollicking good time. This is one for the whole family, and even worth the extra investment to see it in IMAX 3D. Yes, you will flinch as Captain America throws his mighty shield. And while you might find some of the scenes a bit stretched out (the film is almost two-and-a-half-hours long), you’ll certainly get your money’s worth.

"Aug 22, 2018",NEUTRAL," The newest superhero movie, ""Batman v Superman"" — um, I mean ""Captain America: Civil War"" — is truly just a duplicate plot with different faces. This begs the question: Are DC (Detective Comics) and Marvel writers actually friends? Do they hang out and pitch ideas to one another? One would think so after seeing both of these rather dull comic book representations. There is, however, a difference with ""Captain America: Civil War"" — the film has a dizzying number of superheroes to keep track of and include in the story line. Clocking in at two hours and 26 monotonous minutes, it seems the end never will be in sight, bombarded by nonstop, nauseating, hand-to-hand combat and 3D special effects. ""Captain America: Civil War"" finds an ethical barrier to crime fighting and protecting the world. As the Avengers band together to ""get the bad guy,"" an errant fireball tossed by Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) kills hundreds of people. Well, it seems that this isn't the first time these crime fighters have killed a few dozen innocent people in their attempts to protect the world from evil-doers. Now, the United Nations feels compelled to put their foot down and reign in this out of control group. Captain America (Chris Evans) wants nothing to do with being told who to kill and who to save, but Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.) sees the logic. The two part ways with their minions scurrying behind them, until the two teams are pitted against one another. (Sound familiar? See ""Batman v Superman"" review.) From the opening scene, there is nonstop action. It's not high-intensity action, though. It's slow-motion, frame-by-frame action that creates a visually disturbing blur of images. The feeling is similar to stop-motion. As you watch the fighting, it sometimes becomes confusing as to who's fighting for whom and why, unless you are an avid fan. Doom and gloom is the dramatic and repetitious story line and, unfortunately, there is very little levity in the dialogue. The writers address the absence of Thor and the Incredible Hulk, giving them an acceptable excuse for not being a part of this film. And for all you Scarlett Johansson fans, you won't be disappointed. As the minutes tick by, it isn't until Ant Man (Paul Rudd) and the new Spider Man (Tom Holland) enter the scene with some snappy dialogue that wakes you up. Overall, the lack of ingenuity makes for a lackluster story in need of major content editing. This film is definitely geared toward the comic book fans. The cinematography, although creating discomfort, gives the feeling of the graphic artwork coming to life. The precision editing creates action and combat scenes that are out of this world. Pairing this with spectacular stunts and meticulous choreography will catapult graphic novel fans into stratospheric happiness. The special effects also are quite mesmerizing as you witness the hyper-lapsing metamorphosis of Iron Man's body armor or a teen Tony Stark, and the zipping and whirring of flying objects. It's no secret that, in general, I am not a comic book film fan, with a few exceptions. Conceding this, my guess is that ""Captain America: Civil War"" will entertain fans of the Marvel Universe. There's plenty of action, many of your favorite heroes, special effects and innumerable fight scenes. Fans, go see it. The rest of us can find better things to do with our time and money."

I have never been a huge fan of superhero flicks, but I was pleasantly proven wrong. The film is actually quite funny (tons of inside jokes for the comic book devotees) charming and heartfelt in many places. The other places, well, mega destruction and over-the-top action rules. Are there tons of characters and subplots? “Game of Thrones” is easier to follow. Captain America leads the newly formed team of Avengers to continue to safeguard the world. But because of the collateral damage the team has caused, problems ensue. The new reality splits this tight knit team ergo the “Civil War.” And even though it’s called “Captain America,” this is really another “Iron Man” movie/”Avengers” film in Marvel clothing. It also introduces the new “Spider Man” just enough to make us want an actual “Spider Man” movie after five installments in this generation. But the directors Anthony and Joe Russo ably weave it all into an appealing, never boring movie escapism experience. The cast is terrific, helped by a quippy script written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. Led by the always reliable and likable Robert Downey Jr, as Iron Man, Chris Evans as Captain America, Scarlett Johannson as Black Widow, Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye, Paul Rudd as Antman, Sebastian Stan as Winter Soldier, Paul Bettany as Vision, Don Cheadle as War Machine, Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther, the substantially talented ensemble all do their characters proud. Standing out of the crowd is the luminous Elizabeth Olsen as the Scarlet Witch, as well as the new Spider Man, the off the charts adorable and funny Tom Holland. The filmmakers also cast the smaller roles wisely, including William Hurt, Martin Freeman, John Slattery, Hope Davis, Marisa Tomei and a menacing Daniel Bruhl. At a running time of 2 hrs. and 26 minutes, I wasn’t bored a second. Yes, Stan Lee makes his requisite appearance, and stick around till after the credits for a clever “Spider Man” peak into the future preview. So do go see it. Marvel movies are way too charming and popcorn fun to resist."
"Jun 13, 2018",POSITIVE," First and foremost lemme talk my shit right now. Lemme talk that shit on Captain America: Civil War. Y’all out here talkin’ ’bout Batman has the best movies. Fuck Bruce Wayne. The silver screen game is Steve Rogers’ right now. The silver screen game is red, white, and blue. Steve Rogers out here giving y’all hits. Giving y’all more cameos than a Wu-Tang album. Y’all bout to give Steve “The Super Soldier Serum” Rogers the respeck on his name. Off the strength, I’ma tell you like it is. Captain America: Civil War is the best comic book adaptation of a major comic book event. I ain’t stutter, Civil War was the comic book event that separated Marvel from the pack and flexed how innovative they still were. The translation from page to big screen is of course different as the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has subtle differences making it an alternative to the Marvel-616 Universe. In Marvel-616, Civil War started when a school was blown up during a fight between teen heroes (New Warriors) and some villains. In the MCU, the event that initiates the divide within the team actually occurs over seas where their help only makes things worse. The United Nations steps in to put The Avengers in check. Bringing an argument based on a real issue — should superheroes be registered agents of the government, thereby being sanctioned and told where to go? Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) believes so adamantly. Captain America (Chris Evans) does not, as governments usually have their own agendas and what they deem as right may not necessarily be the right thing. The crisis overseas is what gets Wakanda involved in this drive towards registration. We are introduced to T’Challa (Chadwick Boseman). This guy is as smooth as T’Challa, man. The homie is confident, smooth, has the expected generic “I’m from a non-specific African country” accent but his demeanor with it so trill. Boseman represents T’Challa perfectly as the man blessed by Bast himself, The Black Panther. I don’t want to spoil how The Winter Soldier (Sebastian) comes into play but just know it makes perfect sense, and is a deviation from the comic book that you won’t mind. It further adds to the Avengers story line. Captain America: Civil War focuses on the approach of superheroes to what’s right and what’s wrong. This movie makes you pick a side because both have very valid points. Chris Evans and RDJ do incredible jobs of representing the friendship between Captain America and Iron Man as well as the frustrations between the two. Steve is a man from the past holding fast to morals and not willing to compromise them when the right thing to do is so blatantly clear. Tony Stark is a futurist that’s always adapting with the time and playing the political game in order to keep things together. You really feel for both of these characters. If you’ve been privy to the movies before hand you feel it even more as it’s been a long road headed toward this divide. Now we got the plot going down, emotions are high. Can we just talk about the action though? My god, I said good Gawd. How many movies is Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) going to have to steal the scene in, fight wise, before Marvel blesses us with a movie of her own? Black Widow is in the streets doing the most yet again, as to be expected. We see a lot of team work between Captain America and Bucky which is a throwback to the last Captain America movie and their friendship, (that’s for all y’all that said it was a weak movie. It was a set up, damn it!). Plus we got Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) taking charge, Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) bringing in the humor and showing us some new tricks. and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) with his much needed cynicism. There also Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) who comes out as the rookie of the year. Over on Stark’s side he brought the heaviest hitter of them all along in War Machine (Don Cheadle), along with The Vision (Paul Bettany), and who am I forgetting? Hmm, oh yeah Spider- God- Damn- Man (Tom Holland). Lemme tell y’all something: Tom Holland is Peter Parker. I don’t think y’all hear me, I said Tom Holland is Peter Parker. The voice, the mannerisms, the jokes, the movement, the reactions, everything. This kid will remind you of the Spider-Man cartoon and he sounds just how you would imagine teen Peter Parker to sound. Spider-Man gets worked in fast but you gotta thank Marvel for introducing him off the strength of his name on some, “Y’all already know who the fuck he is. Let’s get to the webs on webs on webs already.” The way the teams interact with one another and against one another is my favorite part of this film. Anthony Mackie really shines as Sam Wilson the loyal friend and thrower of all the snark. When you see him interact with T’Challa and Winter Soldier, you’re going to instantly be reminded of the friend you have that acts just like Sam Wilson. Now I could tell you how Baron Zemo (Daniel Brühl) plays his role very calculated in this movie but it’s best if I don’t. Brühl does an incredible job of keeping the audience guessing his intentions and displaying his calculated methods. I really have to say again, this is the best comic book adaptation to film in the game. You can complain (I know I would) about things changed but it truly makes sense for this film. Civil War really outdid Captain America: Winter Soldier (but it’s still a strong film). You wonder how they are going to top this one? Aye, man. It’s fucking Marvel cinema baby, you know they’re going to do it justice. I’mma leave y’all with this little hint about the movie. Get comfortable waiting for the post credit scenes, ’cause you gonna get hit with the most delicious two-piece. Marvel just needs to give the Russo brothers a lifetime contract, this movie had so much hype and it exceeded all expectations. Everyone was on they A+ plus game, this movie was epic!!!!"
"Mar 21, 2018",POSITIVE," At the heart of the latest Marvel movie Captain America: Civil War is an amazing shape-shifting ability. It is a film that confronts the consequences of super-heroic intervention, while also providing a popcorn-worthy bang-pow experience. It's impossible to avoid comparing Civil War with the all-too solemn Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice because they explore the same terrain. Is the collateral damage created by these enhanced beings too high a price to pay? Are they the cause or the cure? The United Nations wants the Avengers on a leash. First step, sign the Sokovia Accord, named after the European city that had the misfortune of being the setting of evil Ultron's climactic battle. Since Iron Man's first emergence, the number of disasters has increased. But while Batman talked himself into confronting Superman with logic flimsier than Clark's forelock, the conflict in Civil War is the natural outcome of two characters' back story. Then there`s Chris Evans as Captain America. He began as the literal poster boy for the war effort, but he's witnessed the danger of unchecked authority first-hand (during the events in Captain America: Winter Soldier), hence his reluctance over the United Nations' ultimatum. The only real fumble is Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther. With a forthcoming film directed by Ryan Coogler, there's lot riding on Panther's shoulders. Boseman's version of the African king finds the proud warrior holding his own and then some. With a hint of a South African accent, T'Challa is noble, but frankly dull compared with the rest of the flawed and funny characters.  Part of this credit is due to the dynamic duo of screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, who keep things moving while wedging in more locations than a Bond movie marathon. As well, co-directing brother act Anthony and Joe Russo avoid overwhelming the audience, separating the combatants into a series of fascinating faceoffs — Ant-Man vs. Spider-Man, Hawkeye vs. Black Widow. And as always, between the plasma blasts, a constant backbeat of one-liners. Paul Rudd in particular steals the show as the awestruck Ant-Man, who goes full fanboy in the presence of Captain America. The biggest problem with Civil War is that the various subplots —  the new villain played with finesse by Daniel Bruhl, the fate of the brainwashed Bucky — can't compete with the satisfying smash of comic characters colliding. Which is why perhaps Civil War pits them against each other one too many times. There comes a point when Iron Man tells Cap to stay down, and you kind of wish he'd listen.  While suffering from some of the inevitable signs of blockbuster bloating, Captain America: Civil War is a potent reminder of Marvel's greatest power — the human element beneath the suits of iron and spandex.

"Mar 2, 2018",POSITIVE,"There are a lot of superheroes in this, they found the right amount of time for each superhero. Everyone feels right with the amount of time that they are in this movie...This feels like an Avengers movie. Everyone shines in this."
"Feb 7, 2018",POSITIVE," Eight years ago, the arrival of Iron Man in theaters kick-started both Marvel Studios’ cinematic universe and four years of heated debate regarding the likelihood of Marvel — or any studio, for that matter — pulling off the sort of ambitious, interconnected movie plan the studio had envisioned for its films. In the years (and films) that followed, Marvel not only proved skeptics wrong, but also managed to change the conversation around its films. These days, it’s no longer a question of whether Marvel can pull it off, but how long the studio can keep their wildly successful franchise rolling along. If there’s an answer to be found in Captain America: Civil War, the latest film in the studio’s cinematic universe and the 13th movie overall, it’s that the Marvel movie train isn’t showing any signs of slowing down any time soon. Written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely and directed by brothers Joe and Anthony Russo (the same teams responsible for 2014’s Captain America: The Winter Soldier), Captain America: Civil War has Marvel’s superheroes dealing with the ramifications of their actions throughout all of the previous films and facing the deadly toll that their super-powered battles take on the innocent people around them. The Avengers soon find their loyalties fractured when the world demands that the team answer to government agencies, and the divide grows even greater when a terrorist attack implicates Captain America’s old friend, James “Bucky” Barnes — the former assassin known as The Winter Soldier. It almost seems disingenuous to frame Civil War as part of the Captain America solo franchise. More so than any of the previous films in Marvel’s movie-verse, Civil War is an ensemble piece, jam-packed with just about every costumed character introduced in the studio’s universe so far (with the exception of Chris Hemsworth’s Thor and Mark Ruffalo’s Hulk) and masterfully balancing out their screen time so no one feels neglected. Sure, the philosophical war at the heart of Civil War is primarily waged between Chris Evans’ soldier-turned-superhero, Steve Rogers (a.k.a. Captain America), and Robert Downey Jr.’s playboy industrialist, Tony Stark (Iron Man), but nearly everyone seems to have their own, unique perspective on both what’s at stake and the best way to handle it. To its credit, there’s actually a surprising amount of depth in the supporting characters of Civil War, and what could easily have been a film in which characters get smashed together under weak pretenses (a la Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice) ends up being a remarkably nuanced presentation of some complicated perspectives on personal accountability, collateral damage, and the balance between freedom and security. Both Evans and Downey articulate their  positions well — possibly even better than their characters did in the Civil War comic book series that inspired the film — and most of the supporting characters who ally themselves with one hero or the other offer up some convincing arguments for doing so. Each of the primary “team-up” films in Marvel’s cinematic universe so far have raised the bar when it comes to ensemble action sequences, from the novelty of seeing them interact in The Avengers to the impressive coordination of their efforts in films like The Winter Soldier and last year’s Avengers: Age of Ultron. The same holds true for Civil War, which boasts some of the best, visually thrilling chase- and fight-sequences of any film produced by Marvel so far. Where Age of Ultron upped the ante when it came to the scale of the ensemble sequences and how much cooperative choreography it asked of its hero characters, Civil War takes things to the next level by relying on scenes in which the characters battle each other instead of hordes of digitally created robot villains. Given the characters’ powers, those battles unfold in the air and on the ground (and occasionally at a miniature level), frequently shifting between both environments on the fly (pun totally intended) and transitioning certain match-ups from the background to the foreground as the characters trade off opponents. The end result is a wildly entertaining celebration of both hyper-detailed fight choreography and the creative team’s deep understanding of the characters and the unique ways each character moves and acts. Among the returning cast for the film are the aforementioned Evans and Downey, as well as much of the cast from both Age of Ultron and The Winter Soldier. Paul Rudd’s Ant-Man character, Scott Lang, is also thrown into the mix. While that’s all well and good (and Rudd is particularly good in the role he plays), it’s the newcomers to the franchise that have been generating the lion’s share of buzz leading up to the film’s release — and they more than live up to the hype. In his debut as the new Spider-Man, actor Tom Holland hits all the right notes, and plays off Downey and the rest of the cast well. Tonally, he captures the best parts of former Spider-Man actor Andrew Garfield’s under-appreciated portrayal of the character, offering an endless commentary on everything happening around him and bringing a light-hearted tone to the scenes he appears in. The transition into Marvel’s cinematic universe appears to have been a smooth one for the famous webslinger, and his surprisingly ample amount of screen time should leave fans feeling good about his future at Marvel. There’s also a lot to like about 42 actor Chadwick Boseman’s introduction as Black Panther, the popular African superhero, over the course of Civil War. Although the title of the film suggests that it’s Captain America’s movie, Boseman’s Black Panther and Scarlett Johansson’s spy superhero Natasha Romanoff (a.k.a. Black Widow) seem positioned to be the moral centers of the narrative. Both Johansson and Boseman do a nice job of conveying their respective characters’ uncertainty about the events transpiring around them and the opposing, rigid positions taken by each side’s leader. It’s an interesting — and clever — juxtaposition, with Black Panther offering an outsider’s perspective, while Black Widow is too deeply entrenched to fully commit to either side. It’s a difference that both actors seem well aware of in their performances, and adds another layer to the story being told in the film. As the first installment in “Phase Three” of Marvel’s cinematic universe, Captain America: Civil War does an excellent job of establishing a new status quo for The Avengers and the world they inhabit, and leaves the audience craving more without relying on a cliffhanger. It’s not an easy feat, and the film succeeds where so many other projects envisioned as chapters in a larger, over-arching story fall short. At a time when the failings of Batman V. Superman seem to have opened the door once again to discussion of “superhero fatigue,” Captain America: Civil War offers a strong argument that the best is yet to come in the superhero movie genre. Zack Snyder's Rebel Moon has hit Netflix this week, and people are already making comparisons between it and other works of cinema. Like many other iconic films, this epic space opera draws a lot from director Akira Kurosawa's groundbreaking film, Seven Samurai. This tale follows a village of farmers who seek the help of the titular warriors to stop a swarm of bandits from stealing their crops. Snyder's movie takes this plot and places it within a cosmic setting, depicting a young woman who assembles fighters from across the galaxy to defend her home from the invading Motherworld. Recently, Variety released a bombshell article alleging that Marvel Studios is rethinking its plans for its ongoing Multiverse Saga following the lackluster success of its many films and TV shows. The studio is even supposedly pondering not having Kang the Conqueror be the saga's overarching villain after all since the character's actor, Jonathan Majors, is now on trial for accusations of domestic violence.

"Jan 24, 2018",POSITIVE,The new characters totally live up to their new expectations...probably the best live action Spider-Man I have ever seen.
"Dec 5, 2017",POSITIVE," Directed by Joe Russo & Anthony Russo.
Starring Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Rudd, Jeremy Renner, William Hurt, Emily VanCamp, Tom Holland, Martin Freeman, Chadwick Boseman, Daniel Brühl, Paul Bettany, Marissa Tomei, John Kani, John Slattery, Hope Davis, Frank Grillo, and Stan Lee. Captain America: Civil War isn’t perfect and may have an overstuffed narrative, but your satisfaction detector is beyond busted if you aren’t having fun with this supersized latest entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe by the time the opposing teams of Captain America and Iron Man race towards each other full speed at an airfield hangar with the sole intention of kicking each other’s asses. That’s the exact moment you can pinpoint that this movie is everything a superhero blockbuster should be and more. This movie right here is the perfect example of why everyone from young children to teenagers to adults and even old people willingly choose to spend hot summer days inside of a dark room with images being projected onto a screen. Captain America: Civil War is the ultimate Hollywood blockbuster. Taking a dozen superheroes and giving them all highlighted moments in bombastic creative action sequences isn’t the only reason I am gushing over what Anthony and Joe Russo have brought to the table (this is their follow-up to 2014’s highly excellent Captain America: The Winter Soldier), but how the teams are established and the fact that everyone has a pretty good reason for choosing whichever side they prefer. Elizabeth Olsen returns playing Scarlet Witch, and even with limited screen time she has an arc written that sees her character going somewhere. It’s a testament to their talent that the Russo Brothers went in with a clear plan of how to juggle a whopping amount of beloved heroes and heroines. The movie is chaos, but it’s controlled chaos. It is the new characters that steal Captain America: Civil War though, specifically speaking Tom Holland’s fresh rendition of Spider-Man (not only is the actor actually a teenager this time around, but Holland also excels at delivering quips mid-fight and generally being amusing while also showcasing the kid’s typical awkward personality) and Chadwick Boseman’s Black Panther, who essentially plays both sides in the growing conflict for his own personal reasons. Most importantly, the crucial reason that these characters are considered a massive success is that people will be salivating for their upcoming solo movies by the time the Civil War credits roll. Both have fully intriguing personalities to explore, while also being responsible for some of the most memorable pieces of action found within the whole movie. Not to say that Captain America: Civil War is a major success because of one scene, but it’s hard to imagine anyone not wanting to revisit that airfield spectacle; it is like someone taking your inner child’s affection for superheroes battling each other and realizing it on screen with utter perfection. Going into Captain America: Civil War, the consensus seemed to be that because the central focus of the movie would be spent exploring the conflict of Captain America and Iron Man unable to come to an agreement on how the government should oversee their actions (with some Winter Soldier drama for good measure), all of the secondary characters would be wasted afterthoughts not necessarily adding much to the plot. This is still true to some degree, but nowhere near as bad as some may have anticipated. When it comes down to it, Captain America: Civil War will be remembered for being a movie that really doesn’t solve much, but rather is just one big excuse to create as many superhero dream battles as possible. That’s not to say the movie isn’t well written (because it is and I will get to that), but that the pure satisfaction that comes from seeing a hilariously awesome sequence such as Ant-Man shrinking himself to tinker around inside Iron Man’s suit are moments that comic book and movie fans alike have dreamed of at the very inception of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. There is a villain outside of Captain America and Iron Man (I suppose that technically the one you disagree with could be viewed as an antagonist), but I actually think the less said about him is to the benefit of anyone reading this review. He knows how to pull the strings of both Captain America and Iron Man turning them against each other, but his motives are surprisingly compelling, making him more than your generic disposable Marvel villain that is hell-bent on taking over the world, (because apparently the villain 101 guidebook says that’s what you’re supposed to do). There are red herrings and much more going on then what initially appears on the surface, with Daniel Bruhl obviously being a fantastic actor, managing to make a despicable human being somewhat empathetic in a strange way. The only real problems with Captain America: Civil War come from the first hour, occasionally getting lost transitioning from scene to scene. Without spoiling too much, there’s a funeral scene towards the beginning that just kind of happens very quickly, not really leaving a lasting impression due to how sudden it arises. It’s the kind of plot point that feels like it should be explored in a more self-contained Captain America flick, not something that is essentially Avengers 2.5. The same also applies for Captain America basically getting a new girlfriend. The movie is called Captain America: Civil War, and Captain America might be the most poorly written thing about it; how is that for irony? Random plot points aside, it’s at least understandable why both Captain America and Iron Man take up the stances they choose to vehemently fight for; the core of the narrative is well written enough to the point where neither superhero is necessarily wrong. If anything, you will probably flip-flop whose side you are on a few times throughout the movie. And for everyone that can’t take a position, they still get to chew on some very interesting themes exploring the consequences of every action and whatever the reaction may be. It’s really a movie about cause and effect, but with lots and lots of explosions and people in suits using their own unique abilities to smack each other around. As a quick side note, no one character fights the same, ensuring that all of the battles feel refreshing. A lot could have went wrong with Captain America: Civil War (some actually did considering the first hour is a bit shaky, with the actual ending leaving something to be desired), but once the teams are assembled the movie falls into a groove. The action quickly becomes the most impressive we have seen in a film from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, while also trekking down some unpredictable emotional beats that fill out the extravaganza as the total blockbuster package. If we can continue to get movies as good as Captain America: Civil War, comic book adaptations are not a bubble about to burst; we’re entering a golden age where everything is firing on all cylinders."
"Nov 16, 2017",POSITIVE," With Captain America: Civil War, the Marvel mini-series that had huge ramifications across the universe finally comes to the big screen. However, it’s not quite the same as the original comic book series given that Fox owns the rights to X-Men and Fantastic Four. That said, it’s still a really awesome film. Just as in the comics, Steve Rogers’ Captain America (Chris Evans) is pitted against Tony Stark’s Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.).  Cap is backed by Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie), Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen).  Tony is joined by Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson), War Machine (Don Cheadle), Vision (Paul Bettany), and Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) following Tony Stark (Tom Holland).  Stark also has one Peter Parker up his sleeve as Spider-Man finally joins the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The Stamford incident in the comics is replaced by an incident in Lagos.  The Scarlet Witch uses her telekinesis to prevent a bomb from going off.  She ends up killing hundreds of people in the process.  Unfortunately, she was unable to prevent the blast from destroying a building.  This soon leads to the United Nations passing the Sokovia Accords.  The only question is just how many Avengers will sign on and abide by the accords? Meanwhile, at a conference to ratify the accords in Vienna, someone that appears to look like Bucky Barnes lets off a bomb that kills Wakandan king T’Chaka. His son, T’Challa (Boseman), vows to kill the person responsible. Unfortunately for him, it’s the wrong person as Bucky was framed by Helmet Zero (Daniel Brühl), who used to work for Sokovian intelligence.  Some Sokovians don’t forget what happened some time prior when the Avengers faced off against Ultron. What we know during the end of the movie: Cap breaks his team out of the Raft prison and mails a phone to Tony Stark, delivered by the great Stan Lee.  Black Widow is in hiding.  Bucky goes into stasis at a facility in Wakanda.  James Rhodes is paralyzed but Tony provides him with braces that allow him to walk again.  Thor and Hulk are not in the movie as the next Thor movie is said to be taking place around the same time and mostly in the cosmos. That being said, the events of this movie will impact the Marvel Cinematic Universe for years to come. There are a lot of players in Captain America: Civil War but it never really feels like it’s too crowded. It’s just crowded enough to be an enjoyable film.

"Nov 5, 2017",POSITIVE," Well, kids. With the release of CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR, we’re officially soaking in the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s “Phase Three” – and boy do directors Joe and Anthony Russo open the third block of superhero films in a killer, kick-ass fashion. Just like their previous film, CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE WINTER SOLDIER, the brothers give ethical conflicts just as much pathos as the calibrated action. While it’s immensely entertaining and has a biting sense of humor to boot, the film feels more like an AVENGERS series film than a stand-alone Cap pic. The spoiler-free plot: Our favorite band of tight-knit heroes is divided over the “Sokovia Accords,” a peace treaty/ government action that puts the Avengers under the command of all nations. Half the squad sides with Iron Man/ Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) in begrudgingly accepting the new checks on their considerable power. #TeamIronMan includes James Rhodes/ War Machine (Don Cheadle), Vision (Paul Bettany) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). The other half, led by Captain America/ Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), is determined to retain the group’s independence. Those #TeamCap dissenters include Sam Wilson/ Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Wanda Maximoff/ Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Clint Barton/ Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). The latter group is forced to go rogue to combat an emerging threat brought on by Cap’s bestie Bucky Barnes/ The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) and a mysterious baddie (Daniel Brühl). It’s sort of funny that CIVIL WAR is the second film this year about the fallout caused by the collateral damage from superhero battles (after BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE). The Marvel entry is far better, but still. It’s almost as if DC and Marvel both read the same nerd-blogger ‘think piece’ and decided to address said moral/ ethical conundrums. However, this is a conceit forged from the comics. The ship, er, helicarrier has been headed in that direction the entire time. 






Unlike the prior AVENGERS film we saw last Summer, new characters and their backgrounds are worked in far more effortlessly than ULTRON’s ham-handed, kitchen sink approach. There are no tangential storylines or overarching lore (like those stupid infinity stones) clumsily shoe-horned into the narrative. That’s not to say there’s not a lot going on. There is, and it can be a wee bit difficult to track it all. We get to take our time with (meow!) T’Challa/ Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Peter Parker/ Spider-Man’s (Tom Holland) introductions. Panther’s arc got me revved up to see what his stand-alone film will entail. This Spider-Man is guaranteed to wash out the bad taste in your mouth from THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN series. Baddie Bruhl proves to be a formidable foe. Even in a smaller role, Crossbones (Frank Grillo) impresses. Plus it’s wonderful to see another strong female character further develop her own voice – in this case, Sharon Carter (Emily Van Camp). Perhaps the best, most memorable part of the film comes late in the second act – and it’s where the movie really takes flight. Marvel superfan or not, I dare you not to have a slap-happy look on your face during the abandoned airport sequence where all the superheroes, whose dividing line is literally scorched into the Earth (earning an “oh, honey” for non-subtlety), face off against each other. It’s the best use of well-established characters blending with the new crew and it’s freaking awesome. The Russos capture the mounting action, character development and humor in a coherent way particularly well here. Otherwise, the chase through the marketplace looks like BOURNE generic shakey-cam, as does the hyper-cranked quality in the almost Hitchcockian-inspired, parkour-infused “reverse RAID” sequence with Cap in Bucky’s Bucharest hovel. It might be too soon to tell, but I think Marvel’s third phase has already corrected itself on using death and reincarnation as dramatic devices. It seems to break the rules to make up new ones – and I’m more than okay with a little shake-up of their formula."
"Oct 24, 2017",NEUTRAL," Two years ago, Anthony and Joe Russo were responsible for what – for my money – is one of the best superhero films ever made.  Captain America: The Winter Soldier was a five-star delight from beginning to end, with a clever script, a neat line in repartee and a near-perfect mix of old-fashioned stunt work and seamless-looking CGI. Captain America: Civil War is very much a sequel to Winter Soldier but, regrettably, too long, tryingly complicated and it takes the best part of 75 minutes before it breaks into anything resembling comic exuberance. Apparently, she and Tony Stark – aka Iron Man – are currently on a break, a fact that reduces the potential for sexual undercurrents by about 90 per cent, despite the presence of both Scarlett Johansson – back as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow – and Emily VanCamp. After a heavy hint that the Winter Soldier is still alive, we catch up with Chris Evans as Steve Rogers, the once cryogenically suspended Captain America, plus a hefty slice of the Avengers’ gang, as they battle a terrorist attack on a bio-research lab in Lagos. Of course – after a lengthy and moderately spectacular battle – they prevail, but in the process are accidentally responsible for a great many innocent deaths.  Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross – played with sinister relish by William Hurt – believes the Avengers have gone from being guardians of the world to vigilantes. He wants them under the control of the UN, which becomes a lot more complicated after a special session of the UN, in Vienna, is devastated by a huge explosion. CCTV captures a grainy picture of the man responsible. Yes, it seems the Winter Soldier – who those paying attention will know was once Rogers’ former wartime buddy, Bucky Barnes, until Hydra got their deadly hands on him – really is alive. That being that the Avengers disagree on whether they should be under UN control. Iron Man – perhaps aware of what a mess he made of things in Avengers: Age Of Ultron – thinks they should. Which is why it’s such a relief when Stark jets off to Queens to find a teenage Peter Parker (Spider-Man graces an Avengers film for the first time, oh the excitement) and the Captain recruits arguably the silliest character in the Marvel universe, the pint-sized Ant-Man (Paul Rudd).  Captain America was created in 1940 by artists Joe Simon and Jack Kirby, who wanted to encourage the US to enter WW2, He was portrayed punching Hitler on the cover of the first issue.  At last, some real comic-book fun; at last some real spectacle… until, at least, it all gets a bit super-sized and silly at an airport. One of the slightly unfair problems Civil War faces is that the Russos raised the bar so high last time that whatever follows had to disappoint.  Most of the vital humour arrives dangerously late, courtesy of the over-delayed arrival of Spidey (nicely underplayed by young Brit Tom Holland) and Ant-Man, while, in the absence of the lovely Pepper, efforts to introduce some hints of romantic and sexual tension are hampered by the fact that Johansson seems to have run out of superheroes with whom to flirt. Let’s hope the next round of Avengers films – the Infinity Wars movies are due out in 2018 and 2019 – are better than this. Son Of Saul (15) ★★★★★, which won the 2016 Oscar for Best Film in a Foreign Language, will be one of the most powerful and harrowing films you’ll see all year. Set amid the horrors of Auschwitz in 1944 and directed by the Hungarian film-maker Laszlo Nemes, it’s the story of Saul, a Hungarian Jew forced to become a member of the so-called Sonderkommando.  Its members, prisoners themselves, were forced to work for their Nazi captors for a few short months, herding new arrivals to the gas chambers, stripping them of their belongings, valuables and jewellery, and dragging away ‘the pieces’, as the dead bodies are known, before being executed themselves. Saul, who witnesses the killing, has already decided that the boy is his son – rightly or wrongly; it’s never made clear – and determines that his body will be buried according to Jewish tradition.  However, Saul, played here with an unflagging intensity by Geza Rohrig,  will not be swayed, regardless of the cost to himself or, indeed, to his doomed fellow prisoners. From the moment Saul stumbles out of a blurry background into what feels like the sharpest focus you’ve ever seen, the appalling horrors of the concentration camp are either just out of focus or just out of shot.  The multi-layered sound design by Tamas Zanyi is outstanding, too – at times, powerfully bringing to life atrocities that we can’t see; at others adding to the atmosphere of horror. Demolition (15) ★★ is a strange film about grief directed by Jean-Marc Vallée, director of Dallas Buyers Club, and starring Jake Gyllenhaal as Davis, a New York investment banker grieving for his wife who died in a car crash.  DIY SOS presenter Nick Knowles is the unexpected force behind Golden Years (12A) ★, a would-be Ealing-style comedy about an elderly Bristol couple (Bernard Hill and Virginia McKenna) who, when faced with mounting pension problems, decide to take up bank robbery and prove surprisingly successful at it. It’s a lovely idea but the execution falls short on every count, hampered by some strange casting (Hill is only 71, while McKenna is 84), some seriously misfiring comedy and a screenplay – co-written by Knowles – that suggests, on this evidence, that he should stick to the day job."
"Oct 16, 2017",POSITIVE," 
SPOILER FREE

Captain America: Civil War is good. It’s very, very good. Great, even. Easily the best Marvel movie (so far), and, in my book, the best superhero movie to date. Themes of responsibility, causality, guilt, and consequences play out in a story that also contains breathtaking, awesome action. It’s like directors Joe and Anthony Russo saw the bonkers comic book action at the end of Avengers: Age of Ultron and went, Oh yeah, well look at THIS! There’s genuine tragedy, heartbreaking confrontations, and sharp humor, often side-by-side in the same scene, and yet it all feels perfectly balanced. There’s a lot going on in Civil War, but incredibly, it never feels like too much.

After a mistake in the field on the part of Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen, sporting a VASTLY improved Eastern European accent) leaves yet more innocent civilians dead, world governments decide to crack down on the Avengers. The central debate revolves around the Sokovia Accords, a sort of Geneva Conventions for superhero engagement in the world. Written by Captain America franchise scribes Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, what Civil War does—incredibly, amazingly—is set up an argument that has no clear right answer. The Accords look good on paper, but there’s also no denying some of the people involved—particularly Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt), the actual bad guy from The Incredible Hulk—may not be the kind of person you want holding the Avengers’ leash.

And this becomes the rift that becomes a break that becomes a f*cking catastrophe between Tony Stark (RDJ) and Steve Rogers (Chris Evans). Stark, driven by guilt, insists the Avengers need boundaries. Rogers, who has seen governments fail their people again and again, doesn’t trust anyone else to control them. Vision talks of causality, Hawkeye condemns consequences. Natasha Romanov thinks it’s better to compromise than challenge. The Avengers are a house divided.

Enter Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), the Winter Soldier. When Bucky is accused of committing a devastating bombing, Rogers chucks everything he’s built with the Avengers in the present day to save his best friend from the past. What keeps Civil War grounded is Bucky, who becomes a lightning rod for all the conflict brewing within the Avengers. Any time the story starts to feel too big, it swings back around to Bucky and the thorny relationship between him, Rogers, and Stark. It keeps a human face on the abstract philosophies of the debate. 
Evans gives a career-best performance, capturing the moment when Rogers’ moral fortitude turns into sheer stubbornness, and RDJ hasn’t been this good as Tony Stark since the first Iron Man—this is a darker, more driven Stark than we’ve ever seen. And Stan, tasked with grounding the whole movie, shines. It would have been so easy to play post-brainwashing Bucky as a psycho nutcase, but Stan plays him with a resignation that suggests a man worn down to nothing more than base survival instincts. Bucky isn’t interested in conflict, but he is incapable of going down without a fight. 
And of course, Civil War is, on top of everything else, our introduction to T’Challa, the Black Panther, and our new cinematic Spider-Man. As T’Challa, Chadwick Boseman is simply outstanding. He is totally believable as a prince and politician, and equally convincing as the ass-kicking Black Panther. And Tom Holland is adorable as teenaged Peter Parker, and has an instantaneous rapport with RDJ which bodes well for next year’s Spider-Man relaunch. The other Avengers are all given moments to shine as well—Paul Rudd will be a new fan favorite after a scene-stealing turn as Ant-Man—but it always comes back to Evans, RDJ, and Stan.

The secret weapon, though, is Daniel Brühl as the villain, Helmut Zemo. This is the best villain Marvel has crafted yet—yes, even better than Loki. Zemo is not a physical threat, but he is clever, relentless, and has absolutely nothing to lose. He’s a chess master with follow-through, and it’s yet another accomplishment of the film that his motivation is clear and even sympathetic. Civil War is complicated, with no easy answers, so much so that even the villain comes off as something of a victim.

The filmmaking is top-notch as well. The Russos prove that Captain America: The Winter Soldier was not a fluke—they have complete command of their camera and dead-on instincts for action and character. Good luck picking a favorite fight, because every action scene is incredible. (The second unit directors—the guys charged with filming the action—are David Leitch and Chad Stahelski, the directors of John Wick. If that doesn’t mean anything to you, stop wasting your life and watch John Wick.) The mid-movie superhero showdown is the centerpiece, but there are two stellar melee fights with Bucky Barnes, one of which includes a thrilling chase sequence, and the final confrontation between Stark and Rogers is just brutal. It really feels like they might kill each other.

We’re left to debate who is right. Or maybe, who is less wrong. In the end, I think T’Challa is the only one talking any kind of sense. Captain America: Civil War gives us a superhero fight with no clear winner—at best it’s a Pyrrhic victory for whichever side you favor. Jeremy Renner’s Hawkeye has an outstanding little monologue toward the end, taking Stark to task. In a movie filled with great dialogue, it’s a spectacular exchange. It’s also the death knell of the Avengers as we’ve known them. They’ll never be the same.

"Sep 20, 2017",POSITIVE," After last year's bloated and dull Avengers: Age Of Ultron along with the fun but unessential Ant-Man, one could be forgiven for thinking the wheels were close to falling off the Marvel wagon. Well, Anthony and Joe Russo, the same guys that made 2014's Captain America: Winter Soldier one of the smartest superhero flicks are back – and they have improved on the formula. In this, the United Nations want to take over the Avengers. Too many innocent people have died in the course of them saving the day. Tony Stark aka Iron Man is all for having accountability, Steve Rogers aka Captain America sees it as a leash. The issue breaks up the band. A bit of a no-brainer to say this is better than Batman V Superman: Dawn of Yawn, but the plots are cut from similar cloth –​ aside from having two big name heroes duke it out. That is writ big here. You defeat the bad guy but did you really save the day if a building fell on top of a crowd? Not that anyone was hoping for this to fail (outside of the DC Comics crew) but considering how many characters are involved, the huge fights, plus the need to introduce Black Panther and Spider-Man, this romps along. The only character that is an odd is Paul Bettany's Vision. The bright red guy in green may work in comics - or could work with Guardians Of The Galaxy - but here? Hey Marvel, are you totally committed to the idea of Bumbly Cumberpatch's Dr Strange? It feels like an unnecessary diversion after Civil War. Really, 2017's Spider-Man film cannot arrive soon enough. If you thought he's just a cameo here, think again. You get a lot of web for your buck, plus a very smart workaround to avoid yet another origin story. Welcome, Tom Holland - possibly already the best cinema Spider-Man yet. And we have to wait until 2018 for Black Panther? Chadwick Boseman is so definite in the role, you'd think it's his third sequel. That we have to wait that long for his first solo adventure just feels mean. This could be the most serious of all Marvel's films to date. Yet - and this is where Zack Snyder may want to pay attention - it isn't without humour. Despite this being the film where the cost of heroics in ordinary lives is brought to bear on our heroes, it remembers that they are human too. It's also interesting that the fear factor here is not that it's the end of the world. To quote every mother when the kids are playing up:  If they don't behave, someone's going to get hurt. This must be a rare case of the men serving as eye-candy more than the women. And there's no more a humbling sight for the average bloke than Chris Evans in his basic grey T-shirt. There are some highly gratuitous scenes of the gun show on display, with some very blatant flexing going on in a struggle with a helicopter. Then again, if you've got them, flaunt them. But for every other guy, you may hear the dumbbells calling... Sure, choose #TeamCap or #TeamIronMan... We are firmly #TeamRusso. So far, out of 13 movies, they are the only directors that are two for two. Jon Favreau stumbled and stepped out after Iron Man 2. Joss Whedon - the king of the ensemble - fell at the hands of Ultron (and studio heads, according to him). Only the Russo brothers have knocked it out of the park twice. This is the film with everything. Great then that they are back in 2018 for Avengers Infinity War - though given how grounded Civil War is, it will be interesting to see how they manage with more fantastical fare."
"Sep 12, 2017",POSITIVE,"From start to finish, Captain America: Civil War reminds us that there is a capable soldier and a remarkable human behind the mask and shield."
"Aug 25, 2017",NEGATIVE,"Actually, instead of Captain America: Civil War, a more appropriate title might be Captain America: Cap and Iron Man Get Their Iddy-Biddy Feewings Hurt."
"Aug 17, 2017",POSITIVE,Emotionally satisfying in a way that most other MCU movies can only dream of being.
"Aug 14, 2017",POSITIVE,"""Captain America: Civil War"" is a movie about faith - in each other, in leaders, in an ethos - in a universe that is becoming increasingly secular."
"Aug 3, 2017",POSITIVE," So says Iron Man (aka Tony Stark) in ""Captain America: Civil War,"" perhaps one of the most politically nuanced films ever released as a tentpole in a blockbuster franchise. This is a movie with a distinct social message, one that merits detailed analysis, but in order for that to happen I'll need to give away key plot points from the film. As a result, major spoilers follow this paragraph. Back to Stark: ""Captain America: Civil War"" tells the story of an international agreement known as the Sokovia Accords that requires superheroes to register with the government and operate only ""when"" and ""if"" a United Nations panel deems it necessary. Captain America (aka Steve Rogers) immediately opposes this on the grounds that it violates their civil liberties, while Iron Man supports it because he believes that (as another character puts it) ""victory at the expense of the innocent is no victory at all."" Because superheroes often cause significant loss of life and property, the argument for accountability makes a great deal of sense — indeed, it's practically self-evident. Yet by the end of ""Captain America: Civil War,"" the plot has decisively sided with Captain America and forced Iron Man to come around to his position … in this writer's opinion, incorrectly so. This isn't to say that ""Captain America: Civil War"" is a bad film. Very much to the contrary, it is one of the best movies to ever come out of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, balancing engaging action set pieces and witty dialogue with intelligent character studies and ethical debates. Due to its political content and numerous superhero characters, it invites comparison to ""Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice,"" particularly when the latter discussed how ""in a democracy good is a conversation, not a unilateral decision."" Unlike ""BvS,"" however, the new ""Captain America"" is well-written and a lot of fun, which makes it much easier to recommend to casual moviegoing audiences. It also does a commendable job of giving Iron Man's point of view a fair shake. At one point, the android Vision (who sides with Iron Man) rebuts Captain America by pointing out that ""our very strength invites challenge. Challenge incites conflict. And conflict... breeds catastrophe. Supervision is not something to be dismissed out of hand."" What's more, there is an unavoidable democratic logic to the Sokovia Accords, which is based on the premise that superheroes must be held to the same legal standards as non-superpowered human beings. There are unsettling real-world implications to arguing that ""super"" people should be allowed to change the world as they see fit without being accountable for the harm caused by their actions, even if said harm is unintentional (such as when we see Scarlet Witch accidentally blow up a building in Nigeria). When Captain America insists that ""I know we're not perfect, but the safest hands are still our own,"" he actually flies in the face of the spirit of democracy, subordinating the will of the people to a belief in his own superior virtue. Nevertheless, the movie winds up siding with him, and not only because his name is in the title. Obviously the superhero genre itself can't exist if its characters are forced to report to the government like glorified police officers, so there are practical reasons for the Marvel movies to maintain a comparatively anarchic universe. On a more profound level, though, ""Captain America: Civil War"" is the product of a culture that has been given excellent reasons to distrust state authority. Once the government gains power over superheroes, it quickly deprives them of their civil liberties, denying the arrested superheroes legal counsel, interning Scarlet Witch without trial, and ordering the assassination of a character (the Winter Soldier) whose innocence would save his life if only his civil liberties were being respected. Even when the government acts justly — such as when we see it imprison Falcon, Hawkeye, Ant Man and Scarlet Witch, all of whom are undoubtedly guilty of breaking the law -- it's still discomfiting to see this in action. We know these characters, we like them, and we recognize their good intentions, so it's painful to see them treated like criminals instead of heroes. Nevertheless, if they existed in the real world, they would be criminals, so when Iron Man switches his views after seeing them incarcerated, the change of heart seems short-sighted rather than noble. It's understandable why he would feel sympathy for his friends, of course, but by opposing government oversight simply because he feels badly for them, he forgets that just because he knows them and the audience (in a sense) knows them doesn't mean that the billions of denizens in the Marvel Cinematic Universe know them on the same personal level. They are, and remain, unelected and unaccountable — and thanks to Iron Man's assistance in helping them escape at the end, remain that way. It's worth noting that, when I saw this movie with my friends, two of us wound up getting involved in a heated debate on its political message immediately after the screening. One of them firmly sided with Captain America and the other had a decidedly mixed view on the film's political subtext, but both had deep reservations about the amount of power exercised by the state in this film. My theory is that, because our generation has seen our government violate individual liberties on a regular basis (from the war on drugs and NSA spying to law enforcement persecution of racial minorities), there is an instinctive distrust of state authority that is entirely reasonable. When my friends Adam and Jorge identify with Captain America's rhetoric on individual rights being the foundation of true justice, they're applying lessons that we have far too often seen be disregarded with terrible consequences. It is entirely possible for intelligent and well-intentioned individuals to see the world the way that Captain America does here. The regrettable thing about ""Captain America: Civil War"" is that, instead of allowing Iron Man to remain resolute in his convictions as well, it forces him to give way so that the plot can move forward. While our world doesn't have superhumans, it has many individuals who wield disproportionate power over the rest of us because of unearned privileges — wealth, or being part of an empowered racial or gender group, for example. If we are going to create a free and just world, these concentrations of social and economic power need to be confronted and remedied, and just as a Captain America must exist to remind us that their individual rights matter too, so too is an Iron Man required to remind us that the freedom of the whole is infringed when the few can make themselves unaccountable to the rest. If ""Captain America: Civil War"" had been a truly insightful movie, it would have aimed to strike a balance between both of these perspectives. By ultimately siding with Captain America over Iron Man, it implicitly delegitimizes a valid and important perspective. Matthew Rozsa is a staff writer at Salon.

"Jun 26, 2017",POSITIVE," As any Marvel’s Avengers appreciator can tell you, a staple focus of each story is on team dynamics. What does it take for a group of people with different agendas and backgrounds to effectively work together for good? How does a team find common ground, and account for each others’ strengths and weaknesses? As anyone who’s lived in Christian community (or worked in social justice) knows, these ideas come up as much in everyday life as they do when taking down a supervillain. But what Marvel hasn’t looked at is the other side of intentional community — what happens when a team can’t work. The latest Marvel release, Captain America: Civil War, digs into these important questions: What does it take to break up a team? And what does the fallout look like? Civil War ’s conflict begins when Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.), a.k.a Iron Man, puts his support behind The Sokovia Accords, a document created in response to the destruction at the end of Avengers: Age of Ultron. The accords would place the Avengers under the jurisdiction of the United Nations, putting them in combat only when the U.N. deems it necessary. The Avengers who sign on will continue as part of the team. The ones who don’t will be forced into retirement. Predictably, some of the Avengers agree with Stark, believing the team’s actions shouldn’t be allowed to go unchecked. Others believe that this compromise is the only way they’ll be able to continue doing meaningful work. But a few, particularly Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), a.k.a Captain America, refuse to sign, believing the best way to do their job is by putting faith in each other, not institutions. Matters get complicated when a bomb goes off at the official signing of the accords, killing several people. Blame for the incident falls on Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), Cap’s former best friend, who’s recovering from his stint as the brainwashed human weapon, Winter Soldier. Already on Stark’s bad side, Captain America and his allies battle with Stark and the other Avengers to protect Bucky, who they believe is innocent. Fortunately, Civil War is not the same painful, nihilistic slog that this spring’s other superhero smackdown, Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice was. Unlike Zack Snyder’s debacle, Civil War directors Joe and Anthony Russo understand how to successfully portray the difference of beliefs that lead to the film’s big fight. We know why Iron Man and Captain America each feel the way they do — and, crucially, the film never positions either of them as clearly right or wrong. Of course, Civil War is also really fun. It includes incredible action sequences, and its stars have natural chemistry. The addition of two new heroes to the ranks (Chadwick Boseman’s great Black Panther and Tom Holland’s adorably dorky Spider-Man) is exciting, as is the return of Paul Rudd as the smart-mouthed, scrappy Ant-Man. But it’s the balance of conflict at its core, and the film’s willingness to expose and explore the deep-rooted feelings of its characters that makes Captain America: Civil War such a success. Just like us, Earth’s Mightiest Heroes disagree and get their feelings hurt sometimes. But, like any relationship worth saving, we know they’ll be reconciled. Whether you’re battling mass incarceration or alien invaders, fighting for the common good also means caring about the people fighting by your side. We value your feedback on the articles we post.

"Jun 1, 2017",POSITIVE," More so than any other superhero movie, Captain America: Civil War prosecutes the very men and women we're supposed to be grateful for. It demands that these heroes take a look at the devastation they've caused around the world, face their guilt and admit that their existence may be more problematic for humanity than beneficial. The movie is not a celebration of the superhero squad, but a condemnation. If The Avengers was our introduction to what the team could do to protect their home from otherworldly threats, Civil War is the chilling reminder of the devastation and calamity that also comes with it. In many ways, Civil War is Marvel's darkest and heaviest movie to date, but that's part of what makes it the studio's best. After close to a decade of watching these heroes come into their own, flying around Earth and transporting themselves to different universes, Civil War is the first truly human movie about a team of superhuman individuals. While Civil War does present an actual villain for the team to take down, the biggest battle in the movie is with each other over the level of freedom they have. It's not a question of physically taking that political freedom away, but a moral dilemma over whether they've abused their privileges and whether or not it's time to admit that they might be causing more harm than good to the very population they swore to protect. To be a superhero, things must be sacrificed. Personal relationships, a chance at a normal life or even just being able to take a vacation. Existing as an extraordinary being means giving up the ordinary aspects of life that many of us take for granted. The tradeoff for living an isolating and burden-filled life that comes with being a superhero is the protection and survival of the place they call home. When they're faced with the reality of the consequences of their actions, however, they begin to question everything they thought they knew. It's that internal struggle that eventually leads to the grand battle between themselves where the movie finds its heart. Despite the heaviness of the movie, however, the trademark humor and banter between the characters is still very much present throughout the film. Their obvious love for each other, as a family of misfits bound together by their superhuman abilities, just adds to the heartbreaking dissolution of their trust and kinship with each other. Captain America: Civil War is, without question, the best movie to come out of Marvel Studios in the past eight years, and it's hard to see how they'll top it going forward. Quasi-based on the 2006 Marvel Comics crossover event of the same name, there's a couple of different story arcs happening in Civil War. There's the continuation of Bucky Barnes' (also known as the Winter Solider) complicated relationship with former best friend, Steve Rogers aka Captain America. There's a new threat being posed to the Avengers, and in turn, the rest of humanity by an unknown villain. But the biggest storyline by far is the battle between Captain America and Iron Man over whether or not to sign the Sokovia Accord. Similar to the Superhuman Registration Act in Mark Millar's comic, the Sokovia Accord is a legally binding contract that would force the various superheroes around the world to operate as a branch of the United Nations. Instead of being able to fly into any country they like, attempting to take out dangerous men and women, they would need proper clearance from the U.N. as a ways of respecting and honoring the rules of sovereign states. On one side of the debate over whether to sign the Accord or not is Tony Stark (Iron Man), who after a particularly emotional conversation, argues that having a third-party voice give their take on a dangerous situation could be beneficial. It's a thought echoed by Vision (Paul Bettany), who preaches that in order to gain the respect and trust of normal people, they must work with the agencies that those people have elected. On the other side is Rogers, who stubbornly refuses to sign the Accord. In his opinion, having their freedom taken away from them would lead to other sections of their lives being compromised, like their right to privacy. In his opinion, signing the Accord is fundamentally wrong and, considering the tangled web his best friend Bucky is caught up in, he and Tony realize they can't agree on what the best option is for the future of their team. Civil War feels like a political thriller, full of espionage, backstabbing and above all else, rigid drama. Anthony and Joe Russo, the directors behind the film, know how to make something as dull as a team meeting over whether they should sign a contract immensely fascinating and emotionally draining. Every time these team members interact with each other, there's an enormous amount of emotion behind their conversations. While the action hasn't been sacrificed — there is an amazing chase scene that particularly stands out — it's clear that the Russo brothers don't need to rely on it. The movie marks Peter Parker's debut in the Cinematic Universe, and while the character has begun to feel played out, Tom Holland's portrayal may be the best version yet. Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield attempted to play a young, nerdy Peter Parker and while they weren't terrible in the roles, there was something inauthentic about their portrayals. Holland, on the other hand, looks and sounds like a teenager. The actor, who's 19 in real life, looks like he's in his freshman year of high school, and there's a sensitive side to his take on the character that Maguire and Garfield never fully captured. Even more importantly, however, is how great his chemistry is with Robert Downey Jr. Iron Man is the superhero that Parker most resonates with, and as a result, the two of them have the most interaction in the movie. It was crucial that the two were able to pull off the mentorship vibe that Marvel is obviously going for and they surpass all expectation. Holland's Peter Parker feels like the Spider-Man iteration that we've all been waiting for. Instead, the Russo brothers, who understand how to properly use an ensemble cast as big as the one in Civl War, use the action sequences sparingly. It's clear the focus is on the moral dilemma and ethical drama that's been brewing since the last Captain America movie, Winter Soldier, and on the growing distrust Rogers has for the government. The Captain America series has always felt like the maturest of all the Marvel properties, and Civil War is the defining moment of that maturity. As Marvel starts a new phase in its Cinematic Universe, there's a shift in tone from the films that started it all in 2008. As its fans have grown, so has the studio, and after spending nearly a decade getting to know these characters, Civil War is the near perfect result of what can be accomplished if you can create a universe that people deeply invest themselves in. This movie couldn't have worked before now, because there wasn't enough reason to care that Tony Stark and Steve Rogers were going to fight over this type of issue. We know these characters now, however, and their grievances with each other, watching them beat each other to a bloody pulp, is overwhelmingly afflicting. The Russo brothers understand how important the family dynamic is to this storyline, and they not only manage to portray that in this film, but use just enough personal banter on top of the intense drama to remind us that regardless of past arguments they've always been a strong unit. As a result, everything that happens between the superhero collective becomes more devastating. Despite all the heaviness surrounding the movie, those looking for a classic Marvel experience won't be disappointed. Especially if you're banking on seeing some pretty incredible fight choreography. It's hard to talk about just how fantastic the fight scenes in Civil War are (compared to some of the bigger parts of the Avengers movies) without giving too much away, so I'll try to remain as vague as possible for those who don't want to know too much about it. The fight scenes in Civil War are broken down into a couple of different sections. There's introductory fights (new character dislikes another character and the two fight), personal fights (Bucky taking on Steve or Tony taking on Steve, for example) and then there are the blockbuster stylized fights, which is essentially the team battles. Each type of fight has its own quirk, but you're never bored by what you're seeing on screen. Sometimes, fight choreography can get repetitive and monotonous. There's only so many ways you can punch someone in the face, after all! But the Russo brothers inject their own personality into each scene, and the fights switch from rapidly placed punches and kicks to slowed down, meticulous blows. In many ways, each sequence feels tailored made for each character, and it's an element of the movie that I particularly enjoyed. Fans of Millar's original series will also be happy to know that there are panels from the comic that make it into the film, specifically during the fight scenes. While Civil War doesn't follow Millar's book directly, there are certainly similar themes and events that present themselves throughout the movie and it's clear that the Russo brothers dug deep to find ways to honor his story as best as they could. Bettany, Downey Jr., Paul Rudd (Ant-Man), Tom Holland (Spider-Man) and Anthony Mackie (Falcon) steal the show in that regard and provide the perfect amount of comic relief for a movie this tense. The cathartic moments that appear in the movie, although few and far between considering just how much is happening, usually revolves around these characters and because of that, they are utterly crucial. The use of comedy as a major incentive to love these characters has always worked for Marvel and I was concerned going into Civil War that the comedic aspects would be sacrificed in order to tackle all the story arcs that had to be included. It's definitely there, though, and despite the movie dealing with pretty serious issues, the guilt of its characters and the questionable future ahead, it remains a fun watch. This was the Avengers movie that we were all waiting on. This feels like the ultimate ensemble superhero movie and I'm worried that the more they try to pack into two-and-a-half hours, the less we'll get out of it. If Marvel can find a way to replicate this exact formula and use it for the rest of their big flagship films, though, it's a universe I'll never get tired of. I went into Civil War expecting a run-of-the-mill Marvel movie. I left feeling more excited about the countless possibilities the studio has going forward, and that's something I didn't think I would get back after The Avengers."
"May 10, 2017",POSITIVE," I have had my feet firmly planted in “Team Cap” ever since I heard that there would be a Civil War film. The Captain America films have, by far and away, been my favourite superhero movies of recent times. They are wordy, tense, noir-like and … let’s be honest … they have Chris Evans bursting out of every t-shirt he owns. (Hey, I’m only human.) So the premise of Civil War is simple: choose a side. Team Cap or Team Iron Man. With a couple of disasters notched up, the Avengers are under intense political scrutiny. The US government wants the assembled team of Avengers to sign a bill stating that they will ultimately become accountable for their own actions. This causes division within the team. Captain America (Chris Evans) believes superheroes should remain free to defend humanity without government interference. Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) sharply disagrees and supports oversight. As the debate escalates into a proper feud, the rest of the superheroes must decide where their loyalties lie. Directors the Russo brothers - the team behind Captain America: The Winter Soldier - have proved something almighty with their last two cinematic offerings. Superhero movies do not need to be dumbed down. They do not need to be action heavy to be entertaining. They can be quick-witted and dialogue heavy without feeling drawn out or glib. That’s not to say there isn’t plenty of action in this latest Marvel instalment. There is, of course, one almighty battle sequence between the two sides. But even that is peppered with one-liners, moments of confusion and some of deep thought. After all, these two sides don’t really want to be fighting each other. The undoubted star of the show is the arrival of Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman). In his suit, he prowls and leaps like his namesake and truly is a phenomenal foe for Team Cap. His back story - an African prince and superhero - is an integral part to not only this film, but his own eventual solo outing, pencilled in for 2018. In case you missed it, Spiderman is also in this film. Yes, Marvel have reclaimed him from the death-by-100-terrible-films Sony were inflicting upon him. He’s back, and he’s Team Iron Man. The interesting thing about Spiderman in this film is it’s the first time he’s ever appeared on screen exactly how he is in the graphic novels. Peter Parker (Tom Holland) is a young boy (as in, still in high school) not a twenty-something newspaper photographer. And with that age adjustment comes some genuinely funny moments. He bounds through the fight sequence, absolutely thrilled to meet everyone, and not exactly sure how to control his own Spidey-suit. There is also great humour from Ant Man’s appearance and some quirky back and forths between the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) and Falcon (Anthony Mackie). Of course, Robert Downey Jr has his usual eye-rolls and sarcasm drenched delivery. Ultimately, this is a Captain America film and is therefore definitely more dialogue driven than a bog-standard blockbuster. The one sticking point for me is the character of Baron Zemo. When it was announced that Daniel Bruhl would be playing this character in the film, Twitter exploded. Everyone was buzzing with the news that this truly stellar actor would be joining the franchise. Except … he hasn’t, really. The villain of the piece is entirely throwaway. Even the various Avengers barely bat an eyelid at the mention of his name. Without his actions, the characters would probably have developed in exactly the same way. Which, sadly, means there was ultimately very little point to his character. However, this is one of the best films Marvel have produced. It sets Spiderman up beautifully for a series of films that the character deserves. It also leaves a lot of options for where the rest of the Avengers may be headed. I would happily go and see this again."
"Apr 19, 2017",POSITIVE," Llevamos ya algunos años únicos para los amantes de los cómics. El regreso del amor por la cultura geek nunca ha estado tan efervescente como ahora: tenemos una buena cantidad de películas de ciencia ficción que esperar, la gente se intriga de nuevo por los viajes tripulados a Marte, comprobamos la existencia de ondas gravitacionales, hemos tomado fotos inauditas de planetas enanos y se están haciendo una cantidad pasmosa de adaptaciones de cómics. Las locuras espaciales de la ciencia están emparejándose con nuestro apetito por universos imaginados en el calor colorido de las páginas de historietas. Y este alcance ya lo vimos con Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice: la pelea eterna entre la seriedad propositiva de DC y el desparpajo juvenil de Marvel ha invadido otros medios, pasando del papel a las pantallas de streaming, la televisión y las producciones masivas de Hollywood. Si algo nos enseñó la convulsa y polémica cinta de Zack Snyder fue, justamente, que en Warner Bros. están desesperados por lograr la fórmula que ha estado cultivando pacientemente Marvel. Como dije en mi reseña de The Avengers: Age of Ultron, el universo cinemático de la casa de Stan Lee está completamente construido al punto de llegar a una complejidad inaudita: conocemos una cantidad increíble de personajes de cómic encarnados para la pantalla, relacionamos seres dibujados con series y películas, podemos ver dos horas y media de acción completamente alocada sin que esto represente un riesgo sorpresivo para la corta atención de los espectadores domingueros. El mundo de Marvel está perfectamente instalado después de sus dos primeras fases. Y lo que se estrena aquí no es nada más un cierre a la saga propia del Capitán América sino el comienzo, con fuerza, de una tercera etapa que nos llevará a las peleas más incomprensiblemente cósmicas entre el universo cuántico, los delirios místicos de lo oculto y las guerras infinitas contra un titán enamorado de la muerte. Así que esta cinta es sumamente importante para la construcción del Universo Cinemático Marvel (MCU) y, aceptando el reto impuesto, los hermanos Russo nos han entregado el final digno de una saga y el principio esperanzador de un universo complejo que, a pesar de su larguísima historia en papel y sus 13 películas en pantalla, no deja de sorprendernos. Cuando supimos que el título del final de la saga de Capitán América sería Civil War, más de un fanático se quedó pasmado. ¿Cómo era posible poner un arco tan complejo y masivo en una sola cinta? Digo, por más que hicieran una película de nueve horas, sería imposible considerar todas las sub-tramas apasionantes de una serie que revolucionó el universo Marvel en el siglo XXI. Lo que no consideramos en ese momento inicial de sorpresa es que ya no es necesario hacerle honor exacto a los cómics en los que se basan estas películas. Si en un principio la fidelidad al cómic o, al menos, el respeto a los parámetros esenciales que dieron vida a los personajes, era primordial, después de ocho años en que Marvel saca una cinta cada seis meses, los distanciamientos entre el universo de papel y el de la pantalla grande comienzan a ser considerables. Es un poco como la teoría de la mariposa narrativa que tomó prestada George R. R. Martin del matemático Edward Lorenz: el aleteo de una mariposa en un lado del mundo puede producir un huracán en el otro. Así, si al principio de las adaptaciones de Game of Thrones se cambiaron algunos detalles mínimos de las novelas, después de cinco temporadas, estos detalles se convirtieron en diferencias irreconciliables. ¿Y cómo no pensar en la misma parábola para el universo Marvel? ¿Cómo podrían tener cabida todos los elementos esenciales del arco de Civil War en el MCU? De entrada, los X-Men y los Cuatro Fantásticos están fuera de la jugada por asuntos legales con Fox. Y esto no es poca cosa. En este universo no pasaron los eventos de House of M, no hubo M Day, Wolverine no anda de loco matando gente, Ororo no está casada con Black Panther y el apuesto Ben no está por ahí haciéndole sombra a la ausencia imponente del gran Hulk. Aquí tampoco figuran años de historia en los que se incluyen el matrimonio de Jessica Jones con Luke Cage, el de Peter Parker con Mary Jane, la muerte de Gwen Stacy y la sonrisa enloquecida de Norman Osborn; aquí no existen aún las personalidades intrigantes de Cloak y Dagger, ni Tigra, ni la Zona Negativa; aquí no figura la ciencia del Dr. Richards, ni la de Dr. Doom, ni la de un Hank Pym eternamente joven; aquí no encontramos a jóvenes Avengers, ni a otros héroes canadienses, ni los complejísimos problemas de diplomacia galáctica con los Inhumans. Así que la adaptación de Civil War tenía que ser algo muy distante de una reelaboración fiel que parecía francamente imposible. Y también ya es necesario preguntarnos, ¿por qué no sería legítima una adaptación libre de un universo que es imposible trasladar, por su magnitud y temporalidad alocada, a un medio como el del cine? Respondiendo a esta pregunta con una inusitada muestra de respeto y congruencia, los guionistas de Captain America: Civil War dejaron algunos elementos esenciales de la historia original para transformarla en un evento decisivo, a su escala, en el universo fílmico de Marvel. Christopher Markus y Stephen McFeely, que iniciaron su prometedora carrera hace una década dándole nueva vida a la polémica figura de uno de los actores más intrigantes de la historia de Hollywood (The Life and Dead of Peter Sellers), se han dedicado ahora a la difícil tarea de adaptar cómics. Y en ellos recae la responsabilidad de que la saga individual de Captain America sea una de las más interesantes en el amplísimo proyecto cinematográfico de la casa de Stan Lee. Porque, desde Winter Soldier, se sentaron las bases para relacionar Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D con el MCU, se instaló la relación esencial de los Avengers con la siempre misteriosa figura de Nick Fury y se propuso una trama que jugaba muy bien con viejos traumas de Guerra Fría, las paranoias del espionaje gubernamental y los recuerdos de un héroe americano que, alguna vez, tuvo un sidekick adolescente esencial para el mundo de los cómics: Bucky Barnes. Los guionistas de Captain America: Civil War dejaron algunos elementos esenciales de la historia original para transformarla en un evento decisivo, a su escala, en el universo fílmico de Marvel. Los guionistas de Captain America: Civil War dejaron algunos elementos esenciales de la historia original para transformarla en un evento decisivo, a su escala, en el universo fílmico de Marvel. En esta cinta, la adaptación funciona con un cambio de escala: en vez de proponer una catástrofe inicial (la explosión en Stamford) para dar cabida a una reforma política puramente estadounidense (la Superhuman Registration Act) que afecta a un amplísimo universo de superhéroes (ansiosos de proteger sus identidades secretas), todo se relaciona con las anteriores catástrofes humanas que han causado las intervenciones de los Avengers en el universo fílmico (desde la batalla de Nueva York, hasta la destrucción de los helicarriers en Washington y la más reciente explosión de Lagos).  En este contexto entonces, la ley no trata de desenmascarar, registrar y volver jurídicamente responsables a los superhéroes en el territorio norteamericano, sino que se convierte en una iniciativa de la ONU para controlar, específicamente, a los Avengers. Y esto, francamente, tiene sentido: ¿por qué querrían proteger su identidad, en este universo, Steve Rogers –probablemente el héroe más famosos de la historia–, Tony Stark –el multimillonario de ostentosa vida pública–, Vision –que está encima de estas cuestiones–, Wanda Maximoff, Natasha Romanoff, Sam Wilson, Rodes o Clint Barton, cuyas identidades son más que conocidas? Así, el Superhuman Regsitration Act se convierte, más bien, en una medida mundial para restringir los movimientos específicos de los héroes que ya conocimos en las dos cintas anteriores. Este cambio de escala permite que la trama se centre en dilemas muchísimo más personales como, justamente, la relación entre Iron Man y Capitán America. Las cuestiones políticas se diluyen continuando únicamente en el trasfondo de espionaje y Guerra Fría que acarrea, como lastre eterno, el Soldado del Invierno; las relaciones entre personajes se tensan sin necesidad de ampliar el universo y los problemas de relación con el gobierno estadounidense e transforman en una diplomacia planetaria mucho más acorde a la inmediata guerra cósmica que se avecina. Todo esto funciona perfectamente como continuación de Winter Soldier y Age of Ultron, y, además, permite una introducción orgánica de dos personajes importantísimos que resultan maravillosos en pantalla: Black Panther y el nuevo Spider-Man –que, con Tom Holland, me parece la conjunción perfecta de carisma y timidez ñoña que nunca lograron Tobey Maguire ni Andrew Garfield–. Así, centrándose en intereses muy distintos a los del cómic, esta película no intenta abarcar algo más allá de sus posibilidades, no cae en la trampa de solemnizar demasiado sus pretensiones –como sí lo hizo Dawn of Justice– ni de exaltar, como principio, problemas políticos que situarían la cinta, fuera de la natural locura de Marvel en el cine, en un realismo mal emplazado. No, en esta película, los ideales se convierten en razones personales evitando explayarse en un recurso de reflexión política innecesaria. El afán de libertad a toda costa del Capitán América se convierte en recuerdo nostálgico por el único superviviente de una época para siempre perdida; la necedad reformista de Iron Man se basa en la culpa, claro, pero también en una nueva sed de venganza por el asesinato de sus padres; la integración de Spider-Man aparece, en una nueva temporalidad, como el rescate inesperado de un joven con talento torpe y trauma de ausencia paterna; los fríos cálculos de Reed Richards se trasladan a la mente conflictuada entre lógica y amor de Vision; y las demás relaciones se entretejen en la pura lealtad de Rhodes o Wilson y la sorpresa simpática de Scott Lang –que nos mostró aquí, maravillosamente, las posibilidades de un Giant-Man tan increíble como inesperado–. Todo esto funciona perfectamente como continuación de Winter Soldier y Age of Ultron, y, además, permite una introducción orgánica de dos personajes importantísimos que resultan maravillosos en pantalla: Black Panther y el nuevo Spider-Man. Todo esto funciona perfectamente como continuación de Winter Soldier y Age of Ultron, y, además, permite una introducción orgánica de dos personajes importantísimos que resultan maravillosos en pantalla: Black Panther y el nuevo Spider-Man. La dirección segura de los hermanos Russo y el guión sólido de Markus y McFeely permiten que todos estos elementos se trasladen sin exabruptos a la pantalla grande. Aquí se aprovechan todos los recursos narrativos legados por las otras cintas, se entretejen nuevas tramas y se relaciona el mundo de los cómics al de la pantalla con la esencia irrevocable de la guerra civil. Porque, en un momento, pensé que la película sería un completo fiasco y que tendríamos otro terrible caso de “te llamabas Martha”. Si Iron Man, descubriendo la trampa de Zemo –o, más bien, cayendo en ella–, hubiera llegado al complejo de Siberia para enfrentar, junto al Capitán y Bucky a un enemigo común, la cinta hubiera creado conflicto y reconciliación a lo rápido, sin fundamentos y dejándonos un sabor completamente soso (te hablan Snyder). Pero, en vez de esto, la cinta se arriesga a mantener el conflicto de la guerra civil más allá de sus dos horas y medias hacia el futuro de la franquicia. Porque así tenía que ser: los problemas de Stark con Rogers no terminan en el número siete de Civil War sino que se extienden, como ondas en un vaso de agua, mucho más allá de donde se derramó la primera gota. Porque, en efecto, en ese último diálogo entre el personaje de Martin Freeman (The Hobbit) y un excelso Daniel Brühl (Inglorious Basterds), se confirma que los planes de Zemo en realidad no fallaron: el imperio que siempre quiso derrumbar, usando más la astucia que la fuerza –como lo hace frecuentemente su contraparte de los cómics–, era el de la unión entre los superhéroes. Tal vez Rogers no mató a Stark, pero la separación se vuelve infranqueable: no hay reconciliación posible y la mitad de los Avengers se convierten, con el rescate carcelario, en fugitivos buscados por la policía internacional. Así, la completa falta de resolución al final de la cinta muestra bien los logros de una adaptación que entendió muy bien la serie original y que la transformó para cuadrarla dentro de los parámetros de su universo. Y estos parámetros funcionan a la perfección en el diálogo con películas pasadas… Y con guerras futuras. Age of Ultron, además de ser la despedida grandilocuente de Whedon, fue una introducción a las guerras cósmicas del futuro: ahí están presentes, todo el tiempo, las gemas del infinito, Thanos se asoma insidioso y el asunto acaba dando la sensación de que el plan del tiránico titán lleva un rato cocinándose (con Loki, Ronan y el coleccionista en medio). Toda la idea de esa película es que, a pesar de no tener una invasión alienígena en puerta, las cosas nunca podrán ser iguales para la Tierra: hay gemas del infinito en nuestro planeta, el vínculo con otros planos del universo está establecido, Thor ya nos visitó –enamorándose de paso de Natalie Portman–, Loki nos tiene en la mira y Peter Quill sigue buscando un origen que nos acerca a las insidiosas disputas de un vasto universo.  La destrucción de Ultron, con Vision representando una fuerza de vida frente a los designios escondidos de Thanos –que son un impulso de muerte–, introdujo al MCU a la escala cósmica del universo Marvel que se espera, en todo esplendor para el regreso, justamente, de los Russo en el 2018 con Infinity Wars – Part I. Así, si la anterior película de Avengers dispone la trama cósmica del universo Marvel, Captain America: Civil War responde con la importancia de las relaciones humanas, de la intimidad de los superhéroes, del diálogo más allá de la acción, de la imposibilidad de comunicación, de la división de afectos, de la política humana y de los sentimientos más básicamente nuestros como la venganza, la ira, la culpa y el ego detrás de todo. Esta película cambia entonces, como dijimos, la escala cósmica por la escala íntima: es por eso también que no hubiera tenido ningún sentido ver aquí a Thor o a Hulk. Y digo, ninguno de los dos aparece en verdad en los cómics de Civil War (si no es por el extraño Thor tecnológico que mata a Goliath en un asunto similar a la caída de Rodney Rhodes con el rayo de Vision). Pero estos dos personajes hubieran cambiado el balance por fuerza (Hulk) y potencia divina (Thor) alejando la trama de los héroes humanos que vemos aquí. Digo, lo más sobrenatural en la increíble escena central del aeropuerto son los poderes de Spider-Man que se minimizan rápido por la inexperiencia del muchacho. Esta película cambia entonces, como dijimos, la escala cósmica por la escala íntima: es por eso también que no hubiera tenido ningún sentido ver aquí a Thor o a Hulk. Esta película cambia entonces, como dijimos, la escala cósmica por la escala íntima: es por eso también que no hubiera tenido ningún sentido ver aquí a Thor o a Hulk. Y sí, si observan detenidamente el plan de Marvel para la tercera fase de su universo fílmico podemos ver cómo se sitúan todas sus cintas en esta misma dinámica: a cada cinta de locura cósmica le seguirá una película de temática terrestre para nivelar el delirio. Así, Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) irá después de Guardians of the Galaxy 2 (2017), Black Panther (2018) después de Thor: Ragnarok (2017) y Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018) después de la primera parte de Infinity Wars (2018). Todo esto perfectamente calculado para encontrar un equilibrio saludable entre los problemas que nos rebasan completamente y los conflictos internos de unos personajes que sentimos cada vez más cercanos. Es por eso que esta cinta se centra tanto en temas políticos –sin tampoco pretender mucho– y en los traumas íntimos de sus dos personajes principales. La cinta nos presenta otro lado de Tony Stark con un sorprendentemente joven Downey Jr. arrepintiéndose de no haber sido más cariñoso con sus padres antes de la tragedia que les privó la vida. En una conferencia de MIT, el hombre de hierro se muestra vulnerable, admite su impulso de creatividad como una forma de reconstruir lo que está para siempre perdido, siente la ausencia de Pepper Pots y se nos revela, finalmente, como lo que fue en la serie de Civil War: una persona esencialmente solitaria, corroída por la culpa y con tendencias autodestructivas. La confrontación, frente al elevador, con una madre dolida que le tira en cara el haber asesinado a su hijo, es la gota que derrama un vaso saturado de traumas. La cinta no tenía que decirnos nada más de un personaje que lleva construyéndose en pantalla desde hace ocho años y sin embargo lo hace para volver aún más irreconciliables las diferencias con el Capitán América. Por su parte, ésta es la continuación perfecta a la nostalgia de Steve Rogers en Winter Soldier. Recordemos nada más cómo se paseaba por el Smithsonian en una exposición sobre sí mismo para recordar a los que se fueron y para encontrar, en su lecho de muerte, a Peggy Carter. Ahora lo vemos reaccionando embrutecido a la mención que hace Crossbones de Bucky para pasar inmediatamente al funeral de la última persona que quedaba en vida de su vieja época. Esto hace el vínculo con Barnes muchísimo más estrecho y vuelve completamente orgánica la separación final e inminente entre Stark y Rogers: uno está sumido en la culpa y el recuerdo latente de sus padres muertos, el otro en la nostalgia de un tiempo perdido y el cariño hacia la única persona que, un siglo después, sigue compartiendo con él todas sus vivencias. El Soldado del Invierno se convierte así en el pivote lógico de la enemistad que causa la guerra civil entre los Avengers y toda la trama política del cómic se vuelve un problema íntimo, sentimental, a la escala muy terrestre de sus debidas proporciones cinemáticas. El Soldado del Invierno se convierte así en el pivote lógico de la enemistad que causa la guerra civil entre los Avengers y toda la trama política del cómic se vuelve un problema íntimo, sentimental, a la escala muy terrestre de sus debidas proporciones cinemáticas. El Soldado del Invierno se convierte así en el pivote lógico de la enemistad que causa la guerra civil entre los Avengers y toda la trama política del cómic se vuelve un problema íntimo, sentimental, a la escala muy terrestre de sus debidas proporciones cinemáticas. El plan de Zemo aparece entonces como algo genial: al hablar al hotel para pedir su último desayuno impulsa a que el gobierno alemán encuentre al psicólogo asesinado y al disfraz que lo hizo pasar por Barnes: sólo así logra que Iron Man se confronte con la visión –por cierto bastante cruda– de Bucky matando a golpes a sus padres. No hay ningún azar extraño en la enemistad, no se juega la locura imperfecta de un plan macabro (como el de Luthor en Dawn of Justice) y no se vislumbra una posibilidad de reconciliación (como el nombre de Martha en la cinta de DC). Aquí todo cuadra para encontrar, como al final de la serie de cómics, al Capitán América en prisión, sólo que ahora está salvando al grupo que lo apoyó e iniciando verdaderamente la separación definitiva de los Avengers. En este esquema, como en los cómics, la guerra civil no es algo que se resuelve sino un continuo poderoso que marcará definitivamente el MCU para las futuras cintas. Y sólo un titán obsesionado con la muerte podrá, potencialmente, reconciliar lo que se rompió en la verdadera intimidad frágil de los hombres más poderosos del mundo. Por extraño que parezca, ya no hay mucha diferencia entre una película de Avengers y una trama, en apariencia individual, como la saga de Captain America. El universo fílmico de Marvel ha logrado tal consistencia en su entrelazamiento de películas que ya los títulos de personajes tan centrales como Steve Rogers o Tony Stark se abren, de forma orgánica, para convertirse en películas de ensamble con una complejísima amalgama de personajes. La cuestión aquí parece ser, más bien, elegir quién se puede quedar fuera para no volver aún más convulso el encuentro de superhéroes. Y, aun así, entre tantos personajes conocidos y la ausencia de algunos grandes ejes de la trama original, los guionistas de esta sólida cinta se permitieron introducir de forma orgánica la presencia de dos grandes héroes como Spider-Man y Black Panther. Esta inclusión muestra bien la habilidad y paciencia de Marvel para la adaptación: a pesar de llevar ocho años mostrándonos a superhéroes en pantalla, todavía tienen la capacidad de maravillarnos y sorprender. Porque el rey T’Challa sigue rodeado de misterio, porque esta nueva encarnación genial de Spider-Man sigue guardando sus promesas. En la escena central del aeropuerto se nota el amor de los Russo por los cómics: la secuencia se construye como una enorme doble plana central, llena de color y simetría. Y ese amor se siente también en el cuidado de la adaptación en el guión, en el desarrollo siempre sorprendente de personajes conocidos, en el uso discreto y bien puntuado de villanos como Zemo, en la forma orgánica de relacionar un universo complejo en otro medio exigente. Lo que está haciendo el MCU nunca antes se había hecho; lograrlo además mostrando paciencia, gusto y cariño es simplemente encomiable. Civil War cambió la enorme escala de los cómics, sus tramas políticas y su inabarcable abanico de personajes por una trama íntima que enfrenta a los grandes héroes de este universo desde sus traumas más añejos. El resultado es orgánico, sorpresivo, coherente y logrado. Las eternas peleas de Age of Ultron se balancean aquí con largos pasajes de diálogo que no cansan, las consecuencias cósmicas a las que se enfrentan los Avengers se convierten en insuperables conflictos internos y las promesas de la tercera fase de un universo vastísimo se instalan con todas las potencialidades de un proyecto realizado con tino, paciencia e inigualable soltura. Marvel ya dejó atrás la conquista, lo que ahora vemos es la confianza de un imperio.  Elenco: Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Tom Holland, Don Cheadle, Paul Rudd, Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Chadwick Boseman, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Bettany, Jeremy Renner, John Hurt, Daniel Brühl."
"Apr 12, 2017",POSITIVE,Captain America: Civil War proves that Marvel knows how to lay down a stunning foundation in order to detail an epic saga.
"Mar 23, 2017",POSITIVE," Coming out a month after the miserable bomb that was Batman V Superman has only helped to make Marvel's latest entry into the Avengers franchise look like a damn classic in comparison. Captain America: Civil War isn't as instantly likeable as the first Avengers movie was, but it's certainly a better night at the movies than watching Batman and Superman fight a battle in a bleak and murky hellscape. And have no doubt: this is more of an Avengers movie than it is a Captain America one, with almost all of the Avengers returning, (minus big hitters Hulk and Thor), and with the addition of a few new members, including Spider-Man (Tom Holland) and the Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), to the team. Well, actually, teams, as the central conflict pits the superheroes against each other. The world has finally gotten a little fed up with the collective collateral damage inflicted by the Avengers every time they save the world. And after innocent lives are lost one again, during the film's opening battle, Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt and his amazing wig) and the U.N. decide to force the Avengers to sign an accord that would, depending on how you look at it, either completely limit their ability to act or put some much needed governance on their growing power. Somewhat ironically, the renegade Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is for the signing of the accord, while Captain America (Chris Evans), is against it. In both cases, their reasoning is pretty selfish. Stark thinks stepping away from the Avenging biz will result in the return of his beloved, Pepper Potts (who does not make an appearance in the movie), while Cap wants the freedom to help save his friend Bucky, aka the Winter Soldier, (Sebastian Stan), who he's convinced has been wrongfully accused of a terrorist act. As battle lines are drawn, it comes down to a ""civil war,"" with the Avengers either joining team Iron Man or team Captain, and it's this literal fight between them all that is the highlight of the movie. Once again I couldn't help but compare it to Batman Vs. Superman, and its fight scenes, which were dark, depressing, and ugly. Here we have a huge battle in broad daylight, on a relatively uncluttered airfield, fittingly devoid of people. (After all, more innocent deaths are the last thing they need). But, more importantly, the battle is fun. Seeing Spider-Man fight Captain America is fun. Watching Iron Man fight-in-flight with Falcon is fun. Watching Hawkeye shoot arrows at...well, ok watching Hawkeye is never fun. But the scene as a whole is still wildly entertaining, culminating in a literal giant surprise. While there is a villain in the story, it's not the usual invading alien hordes or omnipotent superbeing; It's just a dude with a grudge. The Avengers have a lot of death to answer to, but in a clever way, the movie also manages to indict us, the audience, for getting off on the massive destruction seen in all those previous films. We should be ashamed of ourselves!"
"Mar 7, 2017",POSITIVE," Both the films are similar on so many levels, yet cannot be more different from each other as a whole. While the DC movie was a sad reminder that superhero films can be a dull, depressing and a horrible disappointment, Captain America Civil WarÂ is a bright, energetic and often hilarious celebration of the genre, and a reassurance that superheroes, despite their over-saturation in cinema screens, can still be fun. Directed by the Russo brothers who also made the previous Captain America movie, Civil War is a sassy demonstration of Marvel being at the very top of their game. This is pretty much Avengers 2.5 because almost everyone is in attendance, and is way better than Age of Ultron and also more fun that the first Avengers film in some ways. If youâve been following the Marvel movies over the past few years you donât need the plot to be explained to you. Iron Man (Downey Jr) and Captain America (Evans) have a disagreement â while the former wants the Avengers to be regulated by a higher authority, the latter doesnât believe in that because their mission is to simply save people and not indulge in bureaucracy. But hereâs the thing â unlike in Batman vs Superman, the conflict here is actually believable. There is some genuine debate between Iron Man and Captain America on the issue at hand, and a fairly credible escalation of events that leads to a full on battle between the two. Most other Marvel films are basically the same movie, but this one is so different because it is bold enough to tread into bolder and intelligent themes. The audience is presented with the interesting fact that the Avengers should be answerable to someone, and they should take responsibility for their actions. All the pretty explosions you have been seeing are not just for show, but they affect people in the movie universe. Houses are destroyed and people are killed. There needs to be someone to watch the Watchmen. Yes, the problem that Iron Man and Captain America have could be sorted if one of them simply told the other some vital information (that someone is manipulating events), but itâs easy to forget this contrivance when the pyrotechnics on screen are so damn good. Seriously, Civil War has some of the most amazing action sequences ever put on screen. Thereâs an insane scene at an airport that will leave your tongues wagging and dribble dropping on the floor. The Russos continue to incorporate the awesome âtag teamâ fight choreography where one superhero initiates his move on the bad guy, and another superhero finishes off the baddie with his own move. The best part of all this is that all the action takes place in broad daylight, making the stuff happening on screen coherent. Whatâs more, the movie has a whole bunch of laugh out loud moments. A moment where Captain scores a date and two of his friends nod in appreciation gets the whole theater roaring in laughter. After watching the hilariously subversive Deadpool, I was convinced that I could never again take a straightforward superhero movie seriously. Captain AmericaÂ Civil War undid my thought process just two months later. The biggest takeaway from this film was that Black Panther looks sleek as hell, and one just canât wait for the next slew of Marvel superhero films like Doctor Strange. So itâs not a question of whether you should see this movie, itâs of which the biggest cinema screen in your city is and when the earliest show is."
"Feb 22, 2017",POSITIVE," Superhero films are seemingly a dime a dozen lately. Though only the beginning of May, we have already seen the release of Deadpool, Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice, and the current film Captain America: Civil War, with many more to come before the end of the year. How to distinguish a film, then, in such an overcrowded world? The Russo Brothers, who also directed the exceptional Winter Soldier, have somehow managed to do just that. With some incredibly innovative action, some deeper, thought-provoking themes, and a plethora of dynamic characters, both old and new, Captain America: Civil War is among the very best of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.The Buildup and ConfrontationCaptain America: Civil War is the next in the continuing series of the Avengers. Now, after several city-wide destructions, the Avengers are under intense scrutiny by the government, who will no longer tolerate their mostly supervision-free organization. The resulting clause, called the Sokovia Accords, would require the full permission of a governing body before they could intervene in any future worldwide incidents. Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), still feeling guilty after his creation of the villainous Ultron, is completely in support of the Accords, while Captain America (Chris Evans) is suspicious of the government’s agenda, preferring for the Avengers to remain an independent organization.source: Walt Disney Studios Motion PicturesSuch conflicting points of view can seemingly only end in a fight, yet it’s still not quite enough. Since this is a Captain America movie, it only makes sense for the conflict to mainly focus on his decisions, which here are influenced by his past. Here, the conflict comes in the form of Bucky Barnes aka the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), who is a wanted fugitive for his war crimes, though Cap still supports him due to their history and also because Bucky had been brainwashed while committing those crimes.The Russo Brothers really spent a great deal of effort to make the story of Civil War believable. Though they had plenty of assistance from past films, even as far back as the first Avengers, where Captain America and Iron Man were always at odds, they still needed to show some real depth to the story in order to make a film where two principal and likable superheroes fight one another. The buildup from friend to enemy is slow but steady, and by the conclusion their confrontation even becomes potentially one of the darker aspects of the entire Marvel universe.Characters, New and OldIt’s not just Captain America and Iron Man who are fighting here, either. There are several superheroes who align with one or the other, depending on their personal point of view. On Iron Man’s side is Black Widow (Scarlet Johannson), Vision (Paul Bettany), War Machine (Don Cheadle), and newcomers Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Spider-Man (Tom Holland). And on Cap’s side are the Winter Soldier, in addition to Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen). Such a numerous amount of superheroes could easily seem excessive, yet the Russo Brothers manage to seamlessly weave their interactions, and often in the least invasive way possible.Once again, such an aspect is helped by past films, which had already introduced nearly every character present, with the exception of Black Panther and Spider-Man. Yet, they needed to also move the arcs of existing characters in a way that was credible. A character such as Ant-Man joining the Captain America side makes sense due to his past life as a criminal, while Black Panther’s alliance with Iron Man is reasonable due to his life as the son of a King. I had seen an interview with the Russo Brothers about this film, in which they conceived of the story by running through the script with each character, making sure that their arc from start to finish was engaging and never at odds with their previous motives. The writers of Batman v. Superman, with its throwaway, unlikable characters, would have benefited from the same strategy.source: Walt Disney Studios Motion PicturesAs mentioned, Civil War is not only a Captain America film, but also a place to introduce further stories down the line. The characters of Black Panther and Spider-Man were added to the story as a way to establish them before getting their own solo films (Black Panther is coming in February 2018, while Spider-Man: Homecoming premieres next summer). Such an addition might have made Civil War seem to be just another entry in a continuing franchise (which is often one of the more criticized aspects of Avengers: Age of Ultron), yet here they tackle the introductions with just the right amount of screen-time.Chadwick Boseman brings a confident, strong screen presence as Black Panther, both with and without the costume, and despite only being introduced in this film, he becomes one of the film’s most memorable characters (also, his costume is just too darn cool). His screen-time is limited, but the Russo Brothers present just enough character development shrouded in mystery to make us interested in his upcoming film.I was also really looking forward to seeing Spider-Man, who has long been my favorite comic character. Yet, despite two separate film series, he has never been properly presented on the big screen. Tobey Maguire was decent as the nerdy Peter Parker, but he was often stale and bland as the legendary superhero, while Andrew Garfield was just the opposite, playing Spider-Man well but a poor Peter Parker due to his suave manner. How perfect, then, to finally see Tom Holland, whose interpretation was a hybrid of these two aspects. As a younger incarnation of Spider-Man, he is juvenile, spunky, and clearly intelligent. He is often the film’s comic relief, which is necessary in a movie that sometimes gets almost too dark to handle.Dark, Noirish ToneThe Marvel films are sometimes criticized for being too lighthearted, with few dark themes out of fear of alienating a younger audience. It was surprising to me, then, when greeted with the intensified action sequences of Civil War, with an emphasis on the final battle between Iron Man versus Captain America and the Winter Soldier. Though the airport scene is the film’s climactic highlight, this one dares to go even further into previously unseen territory.Even here, though, in a scene that could seem overly stressful due to the fiery emotions of the characters, the Russo Brothers know when to hold back just enough to keep the film levelheaded. An example is when Captain America quotes the line: “I can do this all day,” a repeated quote that was part of his repertoire as far back as the first Captain America film. Little callback aspects like this are really what help to distinguish Civil War from the many superhero films out there, which could easily have dwarfed it if not done precisely right.source: Walt Disney Studios Motion PicturesHelmut Zemo (Daniel Brühl), the film’s primary villain, though motivated by an easily predictable motive, also manages to further embellish the film with a deeper tone. Brühl, who seems particularly well-suited for playing the bad guy, is very much Marvel’s version of Lex Luthor. Though he is not a fighter on his own, he is instead intent on simply setting plans in motion, and then sitting back as the world comes apart before him.Zemo is one of the stronger Marvel villains, which makes the further addition of the character Crossbones (Frank Grillo) dull in comparison. A followup to his character in The Winter Soldier, Crossbones is all but wasted by the conclusion of the film, really lending little to no impact on its events. In a film with mostly fleshed-out characters, the character of Crossbones is unfortunately one of its more forgettable aspects.Intense, Beautifully Choreographed ActionAt the end of the day, though, Captain America: Civil War is a superhero film, and as such there are numerous acts of adrenaline-pumping action. There are four main battle sequences in the film, starting with the initial battle with the Avengers and ending with the aforementioned Iron Man versus Captain America and Winter Soldier fight. The airport scene, though, is likely to be the one that people will think back on fondly. In a scene that seems to stretch on for a great deal of time, yet thankfully never wears out its welcome, it features nearly every character from each side in its fight.source: Walt Disney Studios Motion PicturesThe tone here, thankfully, is dialed down lighter than the rest. After all, many of these characters are actually friends in person, and as such they are not trying to kill one another. Some highlights here include the boyish attitude of Spider-Man, the claw-slashing attacks of Black Panther, Scarlet Witch’s strengthened abilities, and, without dropping any spoilers, a huge moment for the character Ant-Man. It is pure, absolute, unbridled entertainment, which made me feel like a kid again watching cartoons on Saturday mornings. The Russo Brothers really understood the childlike wonderment of superheroes, and they capture that in a scene that is rarely rivaled in the genre.ConclusionCaptain America: Civil War is easily amongst the very best in a mostly exceptional line of superhero films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. With deeper themes and a darker tone, it also manages to imbue some of the more wildly entertaining action scenes that I have yet to see in a comic book movie. Though the many characters may seem overwhelming, and some of them appear wasted by the conclusion, it mostly consists of an impressive array of both new and old, and also contains quite possibly the best on-screen adaptation of the character Spider-Man.In a year already piling up with superheroes, Captain America: Civil War is the most memorable thus far. It manages to not only be a perfect conclusion for the Captain America series, but it also sets up films and stories in a way that makes me even more excited for the future of this franchise.[highlighted_p boxed=”false” center=”false”]Have you seen Captain America: Civil War?

Such an addition might have made Civil War seem to be just another entry in a continuing franchise (which is often one of the more criticized aspects of Avengers: Age of Ultron), yet here they tackle the introductions with just the right amount of screen-time.Chadwick Boseman brings a confident, strong screen presence as Black Panther, both with and without the costume, and despite only being introduced in this film, he becomes one of the film’s most memorable characters (also, his costume is just too darn cool). His screen-time is limited, but the Russo Brothers present just enough character development shrouded in mystery to make us interested in his upcoming film.I was also really looking forward to seeing Spider-Man, who has long been my favorite comic character. Yet, despite two separate film series, he has never been properly presented on the big screen. Tobey Maguire was decent as the nerdy Peter Parker, but he was often stale and bland as the legendary superhero, while Andrew Garfield was just the opposite, playing Spider-Man well but a poor Peter Parker due to his suave manner. How perfect, then, to finally see Tom Holland, whose interpretation was a hybrid of these two aspects. As a younger incarnation of Spider-Man, he is juvenile, spunky, and clearly intelligent. He is often the film’s comic relief, which is necessary in a movie that sometimes gets almost too dark to handle.Dark, Noirish ToneThe Marvel films are sometimes criticized for being too lighthearted, with few dark themes out of fear of alienating a younger audience. It was surprising to me, then, when greeted with the intensified action sequences of Civil War, with an emphasis on the final battle between Iron Man versus Captain America and the Winter Soldier. Though the airport scene is the film’s climactic highlight, this one dares to go even further into previously unseen territory.Even here, though, in a scene that could seem overly stressful due to the fiery emotions of the characters, the Russo Brothers know when to hold back just enough to keep the film levelheaded. An example is when Captain America quotes the line: “I can do this all day,” a repeated quote that was part of his repertoire as far back as the first Captain America film. Little callback aspects like this are really what help to distinguish Civil War from the many superhero films out there, which could easily have dwarfed it if not done precisely right.source: Walt Disney Studios Motion PicturesHelmut Zemo (Daniel Brühl), the film’s primary villain, though motivated by an easily predictable motive, also manages to further embellish the film with a deeper tone. Brühl, who seems particularly well-suited for playing the bad guy, is very much Marvel’s version of Lex Luthor. Though he is not a fighter on his own, he is instead intent on simply setting plans in motion, and then sitting back as the world comes apart before him.Zemo is one of the stronger Marvel villains, which makes the further addition of the character Crossbones (Frank Grillo) dull in comparison. A followup to his character in The Winter Soldier, Crossbones is all but wasted by the conclusion of the film, really lending little to no impact on its events. In a film with mostly fleshed-out characters, the character of Crossbones is unfortunately one of its more forgettable aspects.Intense, Beautifully Choreographed ActionAt the end of the day, though, Captain America: Civil War is a superhero film, and as such there are numerous acts of adrenaline-pumping action. There are four main battle sequences in the film, starting with the initial battle with the Avengers and ending with the aforementioned Iron Man versus Captain America and Winter Soldier fight. The airport scene, though, is likely to be the one that people will think back on fondly. In a scene that seems to stretch on for a great deal of time, yet thankfully never wears out its welcome, it features nearly every character from each side in its fight.source: Walt Disney Studios Motion PicturesThe tone here, thankfully, is dialed down lighter than the rest. After all, many of these characters are actually friends in person, and as such they are not trying to kill one another. Some highlights here include the boyish attitude of Spider-Man, the claw-slashing attacks of Black Panther, Scarlet Witch’s strengthened abilities, and, without dropping any spoilers, a huge moment for the character Ant-Man. It is pure, absolute, unbridled entertainment, which made me feel like a kid again watching cartoons on Saturday mornings. The Russo Brothers really understood the childlike wonderment of superheroes, and they capture that in a scene that is rarely rivaled in the genre.ConclusionCaptain America: Civil War is easily amongst the very best in a mostly exceptional line of superhero films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. With deeper themes and a darker tone, it also manages to imbue some of the more wildly entertaining action scenes that I have yet to see in a comic book movie. Though the many characters may seem overwhelming, and some of them appear wasted by the conclusion, it mostly consists of an impressive array of both new and old, and also contains quite possibly the best on-screen adaptation of the character Spider-Man.In a year already piling up with superheroes, Captain America: Civil War is the most memorable thus far. It manages to not only be a perfect conclusion for the Captain America series, but it also sets up films and stories in a way that makes me even more excited for the future of this franchise.[highlighted_p boxed=”false” center=”false”]Have you seen Captain America: Civil War?

The Russo Brothers really spent a great deal of effort to make the story of Civil War believable. Though they had plenty of assistance from past films, even as far back as the first Avengers, where Captain America and Iron Man were always at odds, they still needed to show some real depth to the story in order to make a film where two principal and likable superheroes fight one another. The buildup from friend to enemy is slow but steady, and by the conclusion their confrontation even becomes potentially one of the darker aspects of the entire Marvel universe.Characters, New and OldIt’s not just Captain America and Iron Man who are fighting here, either. There are several superheroes who align with one or the other, depending on their personal point of view. On Iron Man’s side is Black Widow (Scarlet Johannson), Vision (Paul Bettany), War Machine (Don Cheadle), and newcomers Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Spider-Man (Tom Holland). And on Cap’s side are the Winter Soldier, in addition to Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen). Such a numerous amount of superheroes could easily seem excessive, yet the Russo Brothers manage to seamlessly weave their interactions, and often in the least invasive way possible.Once again, such an aspect is helped by past films, which had already introduced nearly every character present, with the exception of Black Panther and Spider-Man. Yet, they needed to also move the arcs of existing characters in a way that was credible. A character such as Ant-Man joining the Captain America side makes sense due to his past life as a criminal, while Black Panther’s alliance with Iron Man is reasonable due to his life as the son of a King. I had seen an interview with the Russo Brothers about this film, in which they conceived of the story by running through the script with each character, making sure that their arc from start to finish was engaging and never at odds with their previous motives.

Zemo is one of the stronger Marvel villains, which makes the further addition of the character Crossbones (Frank Grillo) dull in comparison. A followup to his character in The Winter Soldier, Crossbones is all but wasted by the conclusion of the film, really lending little to no impact on its events. In a film with mostly fleshed-out characters, the character of Crossbones is unfortunately one of its more forgettable aspects. At the end of the day, though, Captain America: Civil War is a superhero film, and as such there are numerous acts of adrenaline-pumping action. There are four main battle sequences in the film, starting with the initial battle with the Avengers and ending with the aforementioned Iron Man versus Captain America and Winter Soldier fight.

"Feb 16, 2017",POSITIVE,"Captain America: Civil War turns The Avengers inside out, forcing conflict between the characters while managing to stage big action set pieces and even bigger jokes."
"Feb 13, 2017",POSITIVE," In  2014 Captain America: The Winter Soldier was released and changed the game for Marvel films. Anthony and Joe Russo directed a film that felt different from any of its predecessors. Gone were the superhero cliches, evil super villains and played out story lines. Instead the Russo Brothers chose to create an espionage thriller dealing with current event issues with a backdrop of an incredibly compelling relationship between the hero and the villain. What resulted was perhaps the most complete and refreshing entry into the Marvel collection and an overwhelming response for the Russo Brothers. They were asked to direct the next two Avengers films and also revisit the world of Captain America with the latest entry into the franchise; Captain America: Civil War.  Captain America Civil War is completely different from any other comic book movie. The storyline of the film is something far greater than good vs evil. Both deal with very serious moral issues that are not black and white and there is no clear wrong or right side.  Winter Soldier dealt with the use of unlimited power. The main question that film raised was if the government had the potential to prevent any terrorist attack or threat to our safety should we allow that? Or would the access to that power become a threat to all of our well being? In Civil War the question that the Russo Brothers film brings up is how much power should the Avengers be trusted with? Should they have complete unlimited power? And does their power to protect us instead become a threat to all of us? Civil War works so well because of an incredible script and solid, imaginative direction, but it would be nothing without its cast. The stellar writing of this film allow the actors to be people with emotions instead of walking, talking costumes with superpowers. The incredible additions to the cast shows the credibility of the script. Adding amazing talents of new and old such as William Hurt, Martin Freeman, Daniel Bruhl and the fantastic Chadwick Boseman. There also is the clever and incredibly hilarious addition of Spider-Man played by Tom Holland.  It is hard to think of anything this film does wrong. But there is one thing this film does better than any film I can ever remember.  
The line between good and evil is usually something so clearly drawn out in any film one goes to see. There is typically right and wrong and the audience usually has a shared interest and a clear nudge in who and what to root for. In Civil War that is completely thrown out. The Marvel franchise has done such a beautiful job in creating so many characters we know and love; they make us cheer, they make us laugh and they can make us truly care for them. In perhaps the greatest scene in any Marvel film ever these characters square off against each other in a battle for what both sides believe is right and good.  It is an incredible test of emotions for the viewer. These are all people we love who are attacking the other people we love. It is hard to imagine a similar moment in film where this was handled so eloquently and so well. Zack Snyder could have learned so much from every frame of this film. Captain America: Civil War is the best comic book film since The Dark Knight. This is due to the filmmakers choosing not to just make a great superhero movie, but instead make a great film that blurs the line of what the world expects from them. While The Dark Knight was an incredibly heavy film that felt more like a Scorsese gangster classic with a man dressed as a bat, Civil War feels like a genre clash of all that is good. It has moments that are very dark, but it is so quick to follow up with fun surprises, huge laughs and thrilling action sequences. It’s nearly a perfect comic book film.  The Russo Brothers are continuing to raise the bar for the Avengers, Marvel and themselves. It was hard to expect a better film than Winter Soldier and they somehow pulled it off. Over the next three years they will direct both additions to the Avengers franchise with Infinity War Part I and Part II. Have they set the bar too high? Perhaps, but if there was any two people to trust with taking the Marvel franchise to an even higher high, it is. Anthony and Joe Russo."
"Jan 1, 2017",POSITIVE,The good news about Civil War is that those willing to bone up on the backstory will find characters they actually care about enough to root for.
"Dec 31, 2016",POSITIVE,Captain America: Civil War is without a doubt my new favorite superhero movie.
"Dec 30, 2016",POSITIVE,"When the big battle between two feuding factions of the Avengers finally happens, it's a doozy."
"Dec 17, 2016",NEGATIVE," The simple task of a blockbuster director is to behave like a bargain-basement drug dealer, supplying his convulsing, frothing patient with the steady narcotic drip-drip. All he needs to do is make sure the good stuff is coming through at sufficient a rate so everyone dutifully zombies their way back into the cinema when it is time for the next dose. Never mind if his stuff is cut with unbelievable dross, if the acting is terrible, the costumes are hideous, if the wigs are preposterous and the codpieces are disappointingly flat, loyal fans will still come back to be expertly fleeced — and screw everyone who hasn’t watched the last umpteen films and has no idea what’s going on."
"Dec 13, 2016",POSITIVE," Steve Rogers aka Captain America (Chris Evans) has a secret: his best friend Bucky Barnes aka The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) has managed to break his programming that keeps him an obedient soldier, but he doesn’t trust anyone and chooses to be left alone. On the eve of the signing of the Superhero Registration Act aka the Sokovia Accords (named for the country Age of Ultron targeted), Cap and Tony Stark aka Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.) are at odds over the implications, mainly that politicians would decide who should and shouldn’t be helped. They’re both right in their own way, but when Bucky being fingered in a terrorist attack is offered as proof of needing such UN legislation, Rogers decides to confront Bucky himself and before he can be apprehended by Iron Man — that is, if the Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) doesn’t kill the winter Soldier first in an act of revenge. Most of the current Marvel Cinematic Universe squares off in a throw-down over principles and secrets as lines are drawn and friendships are tested, but who will pay the ultimate price for their convictions? Captain America: The Winter Soldier directors, the Russo brothers, twisted the MCU formula with a cold war spy thriller take on the superhero; with Civil War, they dare not only to pit our heroes against one another but challenge them in the worst possible way. Sure, comic book fans love to argue who can whip who in a fight, but the trailers suggest there’s no way Civil War can end in anything but a downer. While it’s pretty clear no one important dies in the MCU, it sure looks like neither Steve nor Tony have any intention of backing down; it’s also probably a good thing Hulk and Thor managed to steer clear of this. Hold onto your privates, generals…

While the big set piece is the super-brawl that ends the second act, the third act is exactly what we expected: hard to watch in the most dramatic way possible. If you’re the kind of viewer who wonders why name actors are picked for these parts instead of just any up-and-coming thespian, these are those moments. For a genius-billionaire-playboy-philanthropist, Robert Downey Jr. knows how to bring “the haunted,” painting Tony Stark as someone who never wanted the responsibility that goes with the limelight — heavy is the head that wears the crown. In full contrast to the get-it-done-now and grieve later attitude of Steve Rogers, this is exactly what we asked for since he and Tony squared off in The Avengers… but it is also not what we wanted — and that’s a good thing. There are consequences for actions, and nothing here is black or white. Before the world went spiraling out of control, however, we are treated to some amazing moments as superheroes meet one another for the first time, including the Sony-sanctioned debut of Spider-Man in the MCU (due for his own feature film Homecoming next summer). The airport battle is a comic book double-sized issue full of combat goodness (and much easier to follow than the Age of Ultron finale free-for-all), including all the fan-boy reluctance of beating up fellow admired heroes and plenty of great one-liners. The scene is what it is, but it isn’t all fun and games; unlike DC where characters only appear to have one emotion at a time, complexity is the order of the day, and you never know who’ll do what until it happens. Those invested in these characters may feel the need to scream at the screen a time or two; yeah, it does that. It’s interesting that, while this film was being made simultaneously as Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice, there’s a sense of Civil War being the right way to do this, a bullet list of what can work and what shouldn’t be done when heroes collide — it’s like they knew! This isn’t the kind of movie you buy to watch over and over again; it’s the kind you know which scenes are you favorites to skip to and for watching all the making-of features to remind yourself “It’s just a movie.” Kudos to the Russos for bringing the heat, but let’s not do this downer thing again for a while, okay?"
"Dec 2, 2016",POSITIVE,"[While] the Russo brothers in the directors chair show a fairly deft hand at balancing a dozen characters and keeping the action exciting, elsewhere there's a bit of flailing."
"Nov 17, 2016",POSITIVE," The high point of Captain America: Civil War is an extended action sequence roughly 90 minutes into the 150-minute epic, wherein 12 superheroes in the Marvel Cinematic Universe go head-to-head in an evacuated airfield in Leipzig. On one side, there’s Iron Man, War Machine, Black Widow, Vision, Spider-Man, and Black Panther; on the other, there’s Captain America, The Falcon, Hawkeye, Ant-Man, Scarlet Witch, and Bucky Barnes, AKA the Winter Soldier. The fight is over two core issues—whether or not the governments of the world should regulate the Avengers and how they’re utilized in disaster situations, and whether Bucky Barnes should be turned over to the authorities for his past crimes. (That, in essence, is the dual conflict of the film, with Iron Man on the side of the government, and Captain America opposing, mostly for personal reasons.) But all that matters is that a dozen heroes duke it out for about 15 minutes, and do so in spectacular fashion. On a base, fundamental level, this scene should not work. There’s never a distinct sense that any of these characters are driven by bloodlust—even the newly introduced Black Panther, played by Chadwick Boseman, who ostensibly wants revenge on Bucky for his father’s death without ever seeming terribly bloodthirsty—or that they intend to put anyone in the ground by the end of the tussle. Basically, the fight scene is a large-scale version of that time when you were a kid and you bashed all of your superhero figures together for the hell of it. This is Marvel at its best: bright, fast-paced, energetic, inventive, and above all else, fun. (One day, DC might figure out that last part of the equation.) The newer characters—Spider-Man, Black Panther, and even Ant-Man, played once again by a I’m-just-so-happy-to-be-here Paul Rudd—stand out most of all, with the latter getting a (literally) big chance to shine in the final moments. The sequence is propulsive and thrilling, far more so than the rest of Captain America: Civil War, for one very notable and obvious reason: it was shot with IMAX 2D cameras, unlike everything else in the film. That no doubt explains why this sequence is presented with a sense of basic clarity and coherency, while the other fights—an early battle in Lagos or even the climactic tête-à-tête in Siberia—are filmed as if the men behind the camera had drunk one too many Red Bulls before heading into work. At best, we can say that directors Anthony and Joe Russo (who directed Captain America: The Winter Soldier and will soon helm the two-part Avengers: Infinity War saga) were inspired by other recent action films in staging their fights. At worst, they have no capability or interest in filming cleanly composed action sequences when not restricted by technology. The truth, of course, can be found in neither of these polar opposites. Captain America: Civil War is the latest in a long, long, long line of action movies that lean too hard on shaky-cam-heavy battles. All such scenes are intended to make the audience feel as if they’re right there, next to whoever’s in the middle of the brawl, getting punched and kicked around. The camera shakes to replicate a character darting an ducking through a crowded marketplace, or being punched in the stomach, or dodging a kick to the face, and so on and so on. These films all owe an unpayable debt to none other than The Bourne Supremacy, the 2004 sequel to The Bourne Identity, directed by Paul Greengrass. Greengrass brought his jittery documentary-style filmmaking straight from socially conscious films like Bloody Sunday to two of the Bourne films, as well as Captain Phillips, United 93, and Green Zone. In the decade-plus since The Bourne Supremacy, so many filmmakers have adopted Greengrass’ style, less because it fits a story and more because it sufficiently caught audiences’ attention and studio heads felt it should be replicated ad hominem. Captain America: Civil War may be inspired by the shaky-cam style in its action sequences, but all it does is suggest that staging a clear version of the various fights would show all the CG seams. It’s not just thrilling to see Iron Man and Captain America go head-to-head in Leipzig because we like the characters and enjoy seeing them fractured and against each other; it’s thrilling to see them go head-to-head because we can actually see them fighting each other. Marvel movies have specific issues that hold them back from being great, and Civil War’s not much different: the films feel less like their own things and more like previews for the next things (which will, of course, function as previews for the next next things), and the villains are always less impressive and charismatic than the good guys striving to stop them. (Daniel Brühl is fine as the vengeful Zemo, but his storyline feels weirdly grafted onto the battle amongst heroes.) But the shaky-cam problem is one that doesn’t have to occur in these movies. We can say that Marvel movies leaning into anticipation culture is a problem imposed by higher desires for branding and franchising. Shaky-camera action sequences are a self-imposed problem. It’s not as if it’s impossible to make a modern action movie with a clear mise-en-scene and camerawork that isn’t obnoxiously, laughably jittery and hand-held. (Watching B-roll footage of Civil War emphasizes that the Russos, or maybe Marvel in general, might want to buy a Steadicam or three for the future Avengers movies. Please.) Think of the deservedly well-loved John Wick, with Keanu Reeves as an impossibly badass hitman lured out of retirement to avenge the death of his dog. That film, with a sequel coming next year, was celebrated as much for its intense violence as for its direct, unfussy staging. A great irony of that film’s slick, clean, and smoothly shot action sequences is that its two directors, David Leitch and Chad Stahelski, worked as second unit directors on—yes, really—Captain America: Civil War. One can only wonder if they were hampered by a desire by the directors or Marvel honcho Kevin Feige to shaky-cam up the place, or if maybe they were only in charge of the Leipzig battle. Joe and Anthony Russo do a workmanlike job behind the camera for Captain America: Civil War, which is a perfectly fine brand deposit in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, even as the MCU threatens to balloon to the point where it’s like Mr. Creosote in Monty Python’s The Meaning of Life, with just a wafer-thin mint causing it to explode from within. That the Russos rely on unnecessarily hand-held camerawork is enervating, but it’s not groundbreaking. They are not the first, nor the last, filmmakers to think that Paul Greengrass’ choices in the Bourne movies were not just aesthetically unique to that set of stories, but could be employed anywhere, in any way. And of course, Marvel movies make a ton of money every year; why break what doesn’t appear to need fixing? (Leave aside the reality that we’ll never know how many people regret too late the decision to see this film in 3D or IMAX 3D, the latter of which is the best way to experience the Leipzig battle, and suffer the shaky-cam consequences.) We need to think only of last year’s behemoth success Star Wars: The Force Awakens, which may not lean too hard on hand-to-hand combat, but also didn’t lean too hard on hand-held camerawork. Marvel movies have already separated themselves from DC by not wallowing in the grim and dark; their filmmakers should move even further, and stop wallowing in the visually incomprehensible. Although I haven’t seen Civil War, I found this to be a very good article. You hit on a few of the key points that have led, I think, a number of movie-goers to experience superhero fatigue. Visual incoherence is off-putting, and is often used to cover up CGI limitations or shortcomings, as you point out. Directors shouldn’t compromise the coherence of their films for the sake of style. The perfect, recent antithesis of this is Mad Max:Fury Road. I don’t even need to elaborate on the complexity of the action sequences, it has been ton plenty of times. But for all that is going on, and the quick cutting and changes of perspective, the action remains remarkably easy to follow. That’s how an action movie should look and feel. Viewers shouldn’t feel nauseous. “… it should be replicated ad hominem”? Replicated until it is a logical fallacy, an attack on the person rather than the argument? Perhaps you mean ad infinitum. Or ad nauseum. It seems odd to blame Paul Greengrass on a style that’s been around since the ’60s and became the de facto choice for action cinema in the ’90s. I entered film school in ’95 and by that stage shaky-cam was so pervasive it was a point that split the class in two over whether or not it was a valid aesthetic. (I was, and am, a shaky-cam nay-sayer). cheers marilyn.  i understand that this is simply a post production tactic likely which would make it even more unnecessary.  at any rate, for a ‘real life’ example, i have a camera on my helmet when i go downhill mountain biking at considerable speed and trail variation, and my clips have none of this erratic behavior.  i’d just like to hear some good argument as to why it’s a good style, for any scene or storyline. Hi coupstar, I love that type of camera work that you are describing! It’s great to see what a person on a bicycle, motorbike etc see as they travel down steep slopes etc.
However, for movies & tv series etc it is VERY ANNOYING to say the least!!!!. I’ve seen some movies where the camera swaps from one actor to another, as each person speaks their lines instead of having both actors in the camera view!!. AAAAAAAAAAARGGH! It’s as if the cameraman etc know NOTHING about filming & that they have a child filming the scenes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Totally agree with the premise of the article, and the drawbacks of shaky cam need to be drummed into the head of every director. Can’t help saying that “ad hominem” is a terrible lapse for a writer. Edit that. In general shaky cam is ruining action but fortunately some directors have gone back to old school choreography and stunt work where they want to show everything.

"Nov 14, 2016",POSITIVE," As has been chronicled elsewhere quite extensively, the original Captain America: Civil War storyline, taken from a special run of Marvel comics back in 2006, was only mildly effective. The idea of the original contretemps between formerly friendly heroes was similar: a multi-government registration act for beings of extraordinary powers which would make them subject to international laws and regulations (and, essentially, employees of the state). But the comics series felt the need to turn Tony Stark, aka Iron Man, into a conniving, backstabbing neo-supervillain in order to justify the carnage that ultimately took place (which, it must be noted, concluded with Captain America being assassinated as he walked up the steps of the courthouse to turn himself in). But given time, feedback and scads of money, directors Anthony and Joe Russo, working from a hard-wrought screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, have created a far better crafted and more satisfying battle royale. What the series lacked in scope and coherency has been replaced by a far more consistent and believable storyline, even if the frame remains so filled with characters and side scenes, it hardly feels like the good Captain is the star in his own film. If we don't have something quite as fun and thrilling as The Avengers, we're still a hell of a long way from Zack Snyder's regrettable, murky Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice fiasco. And now we can understand why DC Comics/Warner Bros. was so quick to get their superheroes-at-war film out on screens before Captain America: Civil War hit. The contrast between the two -- Batman v Superman, a joyless, morally dubious, mostly incoherent mess of bleak cityscapes, angry heroes and a convoluted evil plan hatched by a simpering genius; Civil War, a cavalcade of well-presented action, witty asides, emotionally viable heroes wrestling with difficult choices and, well, a convoluted evil plan hatched by a former Russian military commander -- would certainly further doom the former film to even greater humiliation. It's not that Marvel films are without their cliches and poorly conceived narrative arcs; it's just that they at least understand the basis of most superhero comics' enjoyment is fun -- not gloomy foreboding and brutal, mostly senseless murder. Take, for example, Sam Wilson, aka Falcon (Anthony Mackie), a strong support to Captain America, and one of his most reliable friends. As strong and resourceful as he is, he's still not in the same weight class of a hero as Captain America, Iron Man and some other genuinely superpowered types, a point thrust home shortly after he and the Captain (Chris Evans) are arrested, and their uniforms and weapons confiscated. Reading from the list of their impounded possessions, a former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent refers to the Falcon's winged body armor dismissively as a ""bird suit,"" which causes Wilson to groan in frustration. Or take Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), an amusingly self-effacing type, who takes Captain's side against a litany of other heroes and asks for orange slices after he has finally been brought down. Or better yet, take Spider-Man (Tom Holland), a character Marvel only recently managed to reacquire the rights to from Columbia Pictures -- and only after Columbia finally realized their most recent forced reboot didn't really take with audiences. It turns out Marvel knows precisely how to proceed with their single most popular character: Take him back to being a kid, an actual high-school student who has to worry about homework, even as Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is recruiting him to fly to Germany for a showdown with Captain America and his rock-steady crew. Marvel's version of the character is young, callow (he says he has only had his powers for six months), funny and so anxious to please Stark he pleads with the two heroes under his charge to behave themselves so he can make a good impression. The airport showdown comes after a fairly long setup: When Captain America refuses to sign the registration act, he and Falcon depart the Avengers building to try and track down the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), Captain's longtime best friend Bucky, having been turned into an obedient super-assassin for Hydra for the past couple of decades and then gone into reclusion. After a terrorist bomb blast wipes out a massive United Nations meeting, killing the King of Wakanda (John Kani) in the process and setting his son, Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), on vengeance, the Winter Soldier is blamed for the assault, a frame job by the aforementioned Russian, Commander Zemo (Daniel Bruhl). The Winter Soldier becomes the subject of a massive, shoot-to-kill manhunt that Captain America has to try to stop, saving Bucky and going on the lam with him until they can piece together what happened. Seemingly, on the wrong side of the registration act and protecting a fugitive, Captain and his crew, including Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), Ant-Man, Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Falcon and Bucky, are forced to face off against Iron Man, War Machine (Don Cheadle), Vision (Paul Bettany), Black Panther, nominally Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Spider-Man, in a brutal back and forth that definitely leaves a mark. The story continues on (and on; this is yet another superhero film that doesn't feel the need to confine itself to any puny 120-minute time barrier) and more revelations are made, some of which leave the heroes with more than a cursory sort of dispute, but the film takes pains to justify the emotional calibrations of its characters. Even Zemo, in the end, is given something of a purpose for his actions beyond simply wanting evil world domination. Naturally, with so much going on and so many characters in play, not everything can work seamlessly and despite a great number of winning cameos, there are far too many elements left in fractured bits and pieces. A suggestion of deeper feelings between Vision and Scarlet Witch (actually married in the comics) feels kind of short-shrifted, as does Bucky's character, who vacillates between goofy, quippy sidekick and cold-eyed, unstoppable killer without a lot of friction. Other Marvel movies with a bit less of a hurried pace and overstuffed agenda -- oh, let's say Guardians of the Galaxy, for one -- actually are a good deal more satisfying, but you also have to grant points for degree of difficulty to Captain America: Civil War. On that count, the film succeeds far more than it probably should. Unlike other Marvel films, Captain America: Civil War leaves itself very open-ended. There is a sense of more to come, of course, but not the kind of automatic mandate that pushed some of the earlier Marvel films to stuff too much into their closing credits. It's also true that some of the Marvel standbys, including Evans and Downey Jr., seem a bit washed out by the continual grind and pace of these films (Downey has appeared as Stark/Iron Man in six movies). But with intriguing new heroes on the horizon, including the new Spider-Man, Black Panther and Ant-Man, it seems the screens will safely be filled with Marvel heroes for at least another generation or two. Ironic that the same comics industry that was hemorrhaging money and threatening to shut down as recently as two decades ago, has now become the financial mainstay and lifeblood of the major studio system. Like the fictional world in which these heroes inhabit, they might wield entirely too much unchecked power, but there is little sign of anyone or anything standing in their way.

"Oct 24, 2016",POSITIVE," For Captain America: Civil War, Marvel dispensed with one of the most persistent stumbling blocks in the superhero genre: the need for a supervillain. Instead, Captain America (Chris Evans) and Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) lead opposing teams in a struggle that zooms out from personal disputes to international politics, a far more thoughtful conflict than the manufactured rock’em-sock’em showdown of Batman v Superman. The Avengers have spent the past few years wreaking destruction (albeit in the name of saving the world) across the planet, and Civil War is the point where civilian governments decide to rein them in. Loosely based on the Superhero Registration Act of the comics, the Avengers are presented with the Sokovia Accords, an international agreement forcing them to either submit to U.N. oversight or become outlaws. Weighed down by a desire to do the right thing after Age of Ultron, Tony Stark signs up at once. Steve Rogers, who has ample experience with government corruption and mismanagement, does not. More importantly, he needs to track down his amnesiac best friend, Bucky Barnes, before Bucky is arrested or shot by the authorities—a motivation that trumps Cap’s usual dedication to duty. When Marvel confirmed that Captain America 3 would co-star Tony Stark, there was some concern that he’d take over the movie. After all, Robert Downey Jr. is Marvel’s megastar, and the film’s ever-expanding cast list seemed like it was doomed to overpower Captain America’s own arc. So, did Civil War end up feeling more like an Avengers movie than a Cap movie? For better or worse, the answer is yes. Every Marvel filmmaker has to contend with the studio’s drive to expand its universe, which is probably how Civil War wound up including characters like Hawkeye, Spider-Man, and Scarlet Witch. The key difference between this and Age of Ultron is the expertise with which Civil War‘s creators navigated the overlapping needs of franchise and character. We get the epic Civil War story Marvel demanded, but we also get some of the tragic, distressing Bucky Barnes redemption subplot that was foreshadowed during the final scenes of The Winter Soldier. Sebastian Stan‘s performance is heartbreaking enough to make up for his relative lack of screentime, depicting a man who has been irreversibly damaged by trauma and memory loss. There’s a reason why the film’s first trailer began with the Bucky reminiscing about his childhood with Steve Rogers. He is the heart of the story.  Civil War is a career high for the unsung heroes of the MCU, screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. Unlike Joss Whedon or the Russo brothers, Markus and McFeely (writers of all three Captain America movies, Thor: The Dark World, and the upcoming Avengers: Infinity War) rarely seem to get the credit they deserve. Yet here they are, sticking the landing on a movie that could easily have become an overstuffed disaster. Civil War has all the humor of Iron Man, coupled with the intensity of The Winter Soldier, and shows a satisfying depth of understanding for every character—including how they’re perceived by the audience. Ant-Man, for instance, is the butt of a running joke that no one knows or cares who he is: a fair judgment for Paul Rudd‘s likable but ultimately pointless character, whose main job here is to cross-promote his solo franchise. On the more serious side of things, you also get smart little moments like the scene where Tony Stark freaks out at a woman for reaching into her purse. That exchange takes about 30 seconds, but it calls back to Tony’s history of PTSD. It’s also a dark twist on a quirk that Robert Downey Jr. previously played for laughs: Tony’s eccentric dislike of “being handed things.” This kind of detail is lightyears away from Age of Ultron, where quips were scattered through the cast at random, and Black Widow inexplicably fell in love with the Hulk. (That little detail, like Hawkeye’s family, was mostly ignored in Civil War.) Unlike Thor’s mesmerizingly bad subplot in Age of Ultron, Civil War smoothly integrated its crossover characters into the main story. We’re introduced to Black Panther and Spider-Man without any need for clumsy exposition, and each of them represents a unique view into the impact of the Sokovia Accords.  Tom Holland is instantly charming as Peter Parker, dorky and youthful in a way that 20-somethings Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield couldn’t quite manage. His one-liners are as funny as your favorite Spider-Man comic, and his wide-eyed interactions with the other superheroes are a Marvel fan’s dream come true.  The easy coexistence of Spider-Man and Black Panther is a strong reminder of how Marvel’s world-building remains so far ahead of other superhero franchises. In Warner’s DC universe, characters like Jimmy Olsen are drastically altered to fit a dark-and-gritty mold of Batman antiheroism. Meanwhile in the MCU, it feels perfectly reasonable to leap between Peter Parker’s lowkey teen problems (hiding his spider-suit from Aunt May) to the almost Shakespearean moral dilemmas faced by Black Panther. Even among Civil War’s cast of heavy hitters, Chadwick Boseman stands out. As Prince T’Challa of Wakanda, he feels both a decade younger than his real age (39), yet infinitely more mature than middle-aged disaster zones like Tony Stark and Ant-Man. He arguably gets more character development than Captain America himself, whose screentime might have benefited from fewer action scenes and more of the emotional moments Chris Evans played so well in the first two movies.  Two years after The Winter Soldier, it’s interesting to see how the Russo brothers have developed as action movie directors. Working with Markus and McFeely, they’re phenomenally good at maintaining a strong through-line for each character during action sequences. They also double down on the moral impact of violence, with Cap emphasizing non-lethal tactics and Scarlet Witch expressing horror at an explosion so small it would seem like window-dressing in most superhero movies. But in terms of the technical side of shooting an action scene, the Russos haven’t evolved past their work in The Winter Soldier, which was their first major movie after years of directing sitcoms. Especially during close combat scenes, the Russos persist in using shaky camerawork and slowed-frame rates, resulting in a disjointed effect that surely does a disservice to the fight choreography. Although if occasionally dodgy camera technique is your most noticeable flaw as a director, you’re probably doing just fine. Thanks to its unpredictable story and avoidance of bombastic supervillain showdowns, Civil War stands out from Marvel’s fun but formulaic back-catalog. It’s a gripping movie in its own right, and its level of detail invites multiple re-watches—although some fans may feel like they missed out on a truly conclusive ending to the Captain America trilogy. There’s a strong possibility that Chris Evans will leave Marvel after Avengers: Infinity War, so while we did get to see an excellent Civil War adaptation, there’s no guarantee that Steve Rogers and Bucky Barnes will ever get the resolution they deserved. "
"Oct 6, 2016",POSITIVE," It’s got Captain America (Chris Evans) and Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) as team captains picking sides in the hero-vs.-hero fight over government oversight of the self-appointed world policemen. Thor and Hulk are MIA but everyone else, from Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) to Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision (Paul Bettany) to Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and War Machine (Don Cheadle), is caught up in the crisis.  In fact, the film ups the ante on the two official Avengers movies to date. It introduces Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) to the Marvel Comics Universe, invites newcomer Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) to the party, and even reintroduces Spider-Man (Tom Holland) in a scene as wittily self-aware as it is admirably efficient. If anything, the film is in danger of getting swamped by the cornucopia of colorful suits, splashy powers, and clashing characters. They should be handing out programs like in a baseball game. The basic storyline is taken right out of the Marvel Comics. Iron Man, who has long since revealed to the world that Tony Stark is the man in the suit, is sympathetic to a request for all heroes to register with the American government. Captain America, still recovering from Hydra’s infiltration of the highest levels of government and takeover of the most powerful military weapons, isn’t so sure. Refusal to register isn’t an option so half of the world’s greatest heroes are suddenly renegades and the other half are tasked with rounding them up. There’s a villain somewhere behind it all, of course, but ultimately it’s a family feud on an epic scale. The inevitable showdown erupts in an airport scrap where Cap’s rebel supporters and shell-head’s patriot squad collide in an open-air cage match. It’s nirvana for comic book mavens, one zippy, color-blasted action splash page after, accompanied by booming sound effects and word-balloon quips between tarmac-crumbling body blows. Don’t expect anything so neat as closure before the closing credits. This is Phase Three in the new MCU paradigm, the big screen equivalent of a continuing comic book series, and the story is destined to play out over the next few issues. Can you enjoy the film without investing in the larger project? Probably. Joe and Anthony Russo (who directed the earlier Captain America: Winter Soldier, which introduced even more story threads picked up in this film’s dense plot weave) are actually quite adept at this kind of big team juggling. They pick up on the banter and group dynamics that kept Joss Whedon’s Avengers movies from getting lost in the clutter and are careful to keep the plot moving as neatly as possible given the demands of more than a dozen heroes.  But would you want to see it out of context? Probably not. The Marvel Comics movies, at least the big team-up films like this, are all part of a long-running story and this chapter moves the narrative ahead just a little more. It’s the character touches that make it fun: Downey’s Tony Stark flirting with a younger-than-expected Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) while recruiting teenage Peter Parker, a hint of romance between the intense but alienated Scarlet Witch and the thoroughly logical touched-by-magic cyborg Vision, which gets complicated by their conflicting allegiances, and Paul Rudd bringing his Ant-Man impudence and playfulness to the team sport smackdown.

"Sep 20, 2016",POSITIVE," Fun, thrilling, and filled with an emotional and moral  depth, Captain America: Civil War is  a superhero movie which much brains to go with the brawn. You gotta hand it to Marvel Studios. 13 films in and  (under the careful watch of producer Kevin Fiege) they have successfully  adapted an infinite comic book universe into a multi-layered film franchise  with impressive structure and precision. Not all have been homeruns (Iron  Man 3 and Thor: Dark World anyone?) yet when done right, there is hard to  find better genre entertainment today. Captain America:  Civil War is the latest example of this, a highly enjoyable and undeniably  gripping action adventure that lives up the its promise of a superhero royal rumble  and does so in the best possible way, while also delivering so much more. Chris Evans returns as Steve Rogers aka Captain America,  shield throwing leader of superhero team The Avengers. When a mission turns  into disaster (resulting in the death of several civilians), The Avengers are placed under  regulatory control by the U.N.. Â This  leads to a split in philosophy between Rogers who does not trust any government  body to call the shots, and a guilt laden Tony Stark aka Iron Man (Robert  Downey Jr.) who believes a powerful contingent such as The Avengers should be  kept in check. Further complicating things is the re-emergence of might-be-a-bad-guy  Bucky Barnes aka The Winter Soldier, vengeful African Prince TâChalla aka Black  Panther (Chadwick Boseman), and a mysterious terrorist named Zemo (Daniel  Bruhl) who is manipulates our heroes into further conflict. There is indeed a lot to chew in â¦Civil War, yet as directed by Joe and Anthony Russo and scripted  by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (all of whom worked on Captain  America: Winter Soldier), its many ideas, plot-points and characters  are expertly conceived, written and portrayed to make for a roller coaster of a  superhero movie, effectively switching from light too heavy, entertaining too  introspective, and all done to a perfect pace courtesy of editors Jeffrey Ford  and Matthew Schmidt. Themes of loyalty, corruption and that olâ chestnut of  power and responsibility feature throughout and linger afterwards. Yet â¦Civil War is just as potent as popcorn  munching blockbuster entertainment of the highest order, where old favourites  (Scarlet Johanssonâs Russian assassin Black Widow and Jeremy Rennerâs ace  archer Hawkeye), and new additions (Bosemanâs poised by deadly Black Panther  and the mother of all coups in a new Spider-Man portrayed by Tom Holland),  crack wise and punch hard in expertly staged fight scenes that live up to  expectations."
"Aug 11, 2016",POSITIVE," After their battle against Ultron left an entire city floating perilously in midair with untold numbers of civilians killed during the skirmish, the last thing Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) and his Avengers needed was another mission to go south on them. But a confrontation with escaped criminal and Hydra agent Brock Rumlow (Frank Grillo) goes spectacularly wrong, Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen), a.k.a. the Scarlet Witch, unable to contain the explosion from a hidden bomb, the subsequent blast tearing an adjacent building containing untold innocents to pieces. In the wake of this madness, new Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) has negotiated a deal with over a 100 different nations that will create an agency to oversee the Avengers, a plan Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.), Vision (Paul Bettany) and Lieutenant James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) all find themselves agreeing with. Even Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) tentatively thinks this could potentially be a good idea, the former Russian double-agent and assassin starting to believe she and her super-powered compatriots might be doing more harm than good. It will come as no surprise to anyone buying a ticket to see Marvel’s latest superhero extravaganza Captain America: Civil War that Rogers, along with a number of his fellow Avengers, does not think putting an outside agency in charge of what this group of heroes can and cannot do is such a good idea. The MacGuffin that pits superhero against superhero is former WWII vet and Captain America’s best friend Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), the fallen warrior resurrected in secret by Hydra as the Winter Soldier. His mind shattered into pieces, Rogers still feels compelled to protect his former companion, especially after Bucky’s suspected to have murdered the current Wakandan King T’Challa’s (Chadwick Boseman) father T’Chaka (John Kani) during the signing of the accords. As solid as the majority of the twelve films sitting inside the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) up to this point have been, Iron Man 2, The Incredible Hulk and Thor: The Dark World notwithstanding, the big complaint in regards to a number of them is that the studio is rarely content to let them rest as self-contained stories. Additional elements, all of them setting up adventures, films and sequels still yet to come, are inelegantly shoehorned into the proceedings in ways that are notably obnoxious, oftentimes keeping these stories from reaching their full potential. The worst offender on this front was Avengers: Age of Ultron, so much of that feature’s running time devoted to nonsensical subplots involving characters taking mystical baths and big green behemoths disappearing to who-knows-where, all so the ultimate big bad can come calling in a pair of sequels not hitting screens for another couple of years. The weird thing about Civil War, which isn’t so much a direct sequel to Captain America: The Winter Soldier as it is a third Avengers flick, is that it is all prequel, all setup, returning directors Anthony and Joe Russo and series writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely designing a story where nothing really happens other than the placing of building blocks that will allow the events of subsequent MCU entries to take place. It is a movie more or less devoid of a central villain, a mysterious man by the name of Zemo (Daniel Brühl) orchestrating things behind the scenes, but not in a way that’s close to as nefarious or terrible as is the norm for comic book adventures such as this, and that is also a bizarre oddity that potentially could have some viewers scratching their head wondering what is going on. Yet the craziest part of all of this is that, somehow, someway, this actually kind of works, the film relying upon the evolution and emotional maturation of its characters to do all of the heavy lifting for it. Even though the central scenario itself is flimsy, the examination of what actually constitutes heroism, what is an individual’s responsibility to stand up for what is right no matter the cost, those elements are as strong as Captain America’s vibranium shield. This gives things a depth and a heft that the majority of the MCU entries have decidedly lacked, the relationship between Rogers, Stark and Barnes, in particular, put under an intense microscope fan and non-fan alike will likely find intriguing. Not that Markus, McFeely and the Russo brothers skimp on the action front. The filmmakers design a number of exhilarating set pieces, not the least of which is a central throw-down between superheroes set at an empty German airport. Iron Man and Captain America face-off with their respective teams in tow, all going after one another with their full array of powers, each certain their point-of-view as it pertains to the accords the correct one. It’s a spectacular sequence that brings back past heroes like Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner), a.k.a. Hawkeye, and Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), a.k.a. Ant-Man, while also introducing new ones like King T’Challa’s alter ego the Black Panther and everyone’s favorite friendly neighborhood wall-crawler Peter Parker (Tom Holland), his nom de plume known to just about anyone with a pulse, each showcasing their respective abilities to something bordering on perfection. All of this being said, as marvelous as Evans continues to be as the titular character, as invested as Downey might be in the outcome of the proceedings (unlike Avengers: Age of Ultron), as glorious as many of the action sequences are, it’s hard to get past the fact that nothing, practically nothing of overall consequence, ends up happening. Sure, characters are left in a different state of being than they were at the start of the story, but as far as actual narrative mechanics are concerned there’s precious little of import that transpires other than the moving of the pieces across the chessboard so that they’re all in proper placement for when the next incarnation of Spider-Man arrives in 2017 and both a new Avengers entry and Black Panther’s solo outing hit screens in 2018. Captain America: Civil War is fun; it’s too well made, acted and scripted for it to be anything less. But it’s also much ado about nothing, the fact of which is annoying me more and more as time goes by. I still liked the movie, though, and even if it is noticeably weaker than either Captain America: The First Avenger or Captain America: The Winter Soldier it’s still good enough I’m relatively eager to give it a second look sooner rather than later.

"Aug 2, 2016",POSITIVE,"The real key to Captain America: Civil War is its sense of inevitability, and its acceptance that sometimes things change-they change big."
"Jul 14, 2016",POSITIVE," Despite the name on the marquee and the content of the advertising campaign, this is very much a film about Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.). It’s Stark who has an actual character arc, Stark whose choices drive the action, Stark whose origins are examined closely. Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) is relegated to reacting mindlessly in defense of his terrorist buddy, Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), aka The Winter Soldier. Stark is calling the shots. Civil War opens with Captain America leading a squad of Avengers in an attempt to take down Crossbones (Frank Grillo). He’s a one-time Hydra operative last seen in Captain America: The Winter Soldier buried under half a building. A number of civilians are killed in the operation, the latest in a series of mass-casualty events in which the Avengers have been involved: the alien invasion of New York seen in The Avengers; the destruction of Sokovia in Age of Ultron; and the helicarrier battle in The Winter Soldier. His conscience wounded by these events and the scolding he receives from a grieving mother, Stark teams up with Secretary of State Thad ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (William Hurt) to deliver an ultimatum to Rogers and the rest of the team. Either they submit to the Sokovia Accords—which have been signed by over 100 countries and would transfer control of the Avengers to a U.N. panel—or retire. And if they don’t want to retire? They’ll face arrest and prosecution the next time they try to take down a terrorist or alien invasion. Cap balks at the ultimatum, his resolve only hardened after his pal—the renowned international assassin Bucky Barnes—is implicated in a bombing at the official signing of the Accords that results in the death of T’Chaka (John Kani), the King of Wakanda. Cap doesn’t want his brainwashed friend falling into the hands of the authorities or the king’s son, T’Challa (Chadwick Boseman), who also happens to be the Black Panther. So the two, along with the Falcon (Anthony Mackie), go on the run. Iron Man, Vision (Paul Bettany), War Machine (Don Cheadle), and the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) team up with the Black Panther—who has a standalone film hitting theaters in 2018—and a new iteration of Spider-Man (Tom Holland)—who has a standalone film hitting theaters next year that will feature a cameo appearance from Iron Man—to take on Captain America and bring the Winter Soldier to justice. Cap, for his part, has enlisted the services of Ant-Man (Paul Rudd)—he, too, has a standalone film hitting theaters in 2018—in addition to Avengers teammates Falcon, the Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), all of whom will, most likely, show up in the two-part Avengers: Infinity War series hitting theaters in 2018 and 2019. While this is going on, the mysterious Baron Zemo (Daniel Brühl) tracks down a long-hidden, deep-frozen cadre of Russian super soldiers, each of whom is more dangerous and vicious than the Winter Soldier. Is his plan to unleash chaos on the world? Or is it something simpler—and more personal? It’s a testament to directors Anthony and Joe Russo, as well as to screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, that a movie this overstuffed never actually feels overstuffed. It’s one of the few entries in the series to earn its two-and-a-half hour running time (make sure to sit through the credits; there’s even more synergy to be had). The Russos have a keen sense for the geography and physics of superhero combat, as we saw in Winter Soldier when Cap faced off with a squad of goons on a cargo ship and, later, in an elevator. A thrown, circular shield is an odd weapon, one that makes intuitive sense when you can trace the angles its bounces take in a comic book frame, but that also has the very real chance of looking silly in live action. Most impressively, the Russos perfectly mix stakes big and small. The royal rumble between #TeamIronMan and #TeamCap at a German airport is the largest, most inventive battle Marvel has committed to film. But the ultimate stakes are extremely personal for hero and villain alike. Captain America: Civil War is the rare Marvel film that does not climax in an extinction-level event, and it is all the better for that."
"Jul 13, 2016",POSITIVE," I’m one of the few people who, upon hearing about Iron Man/Tony Stark being made a co-lead in Captain America: Civil War, felt more apprehension than elation. It isn’t that I hate Tony Stark or Robert Downey Jr. in the role—although I have grown a little tired of his bad-boy, anti-hero dominance thing—but the Captain America films were my favorite of the Marvel standalone films, and Winter Soldier’s one of my favorite action movies. I think Steve Rogers is a strong enough character to carry a movie, and I like the characters that have surrounded him in the previous films, especially the core connection he has with Bucky Barnes. Adding Tony felt like a threat to a sequel I really looked forward to, and while my worst fears weren’t met—far from it in fact—I have to admit this is a step down (small perhaps) from its predecessor. As an Avengers film, this is one of the best, but as a Captain America film, it falls a little short. It would be unfair to give much away about the new films, except to say Civil War essentially carries on what was set up in both Captain America: Winter Soldier and Age of Ultron. Tony made a massive mistake creating Ultron, and his guilt has caused him to take a diplomatic seat among the Avengers, now led by Steve. Winter Soldier ended with a brainwashed Bucky finally appearing to break away from his mental capture, and Bucky started to find himself again. After , they must submit to a UN-approved set of rules Avengers must follow in order to keep fighting for good. Tony agrees with the UN (and William Hurt’s Secretary of State) that they need oversight, but Steve feels they need to operate outside government control. Like Batman v Superman, the tension is largely over the cost of collateral damage. Can society stand the taking of even one innocent life in the unending fight for peace? And the most interesting split over the ideas are those Avengers with a military background (Steve, Sam, and Rhodey). Rhodey’s belief that they need to answer to someone is met with the response that they don’t want to pass their blame to a larger body—they have to own the cost of those lives they take (even if by accident), but Steve and Sam still seem to feel those lost lives are worth the cost to protect the world as a whole. It’s the surprisingly pragmatic side of an earnest soldier from WWII thrown into the 21st Century that makes Steve Rogers an interesting character in these films. The moral-ethical ideas in those conversations, along with the larger ideas of Vision, logical Natasha, and emotionally raw Wanda that makes the idea of an ideological split so interesting. Tony being in this conversation feels somewhat out of place … as do most of his standalone (showboating) scenes. For example, when Wanda is devastated (and Elizabeth Olson proves how beneficial she is as a part of this ensemble), they immediately cut to Tony (and a really weird use of flashback), and undercut Wanda and Steve’s emotional moment. Again, during that interesting ideological debate, rather than let the debate play out, Tony grandstands and somehow wins the minds of soldiers and agents who apparently never thought about these innocents. The fact is, as good as Downey is as Tony (and this is one of his better outings as Tony), his forced importance as leader (and costar) seems out of place almost immediately. He tends to dominate scenes, and all the scenes when the audience is simply asked to follow him feel like they’re from another Iron Man movie. Part of me feels like Stark should have taken the place of the absent Nick Fury in this film, more elder statesman than rival leader. The movie ultimately feels rushed into the Civil War storyline. Rather than finishing the Winter Solder storyline and allowing the film to lead into Civil War, they are mixed in and get muddled. Why do we need Civil War right now is the big question? Why not let Steve and Tony’s tension build in this film into such an ideological and personal rift it feels like their relationship will be impossible to repair? As it is in this movie, the split and where people fall feels somewhat arbitrary, and based on where people end up in the film, that seems to be the case. I know you might wondering why a two-minute scene bothered me so much. It’s because Tony’s “flashback” is unnecessary and therefore calls attention to itself. If anything, these are films that can shortcut some elements, but preferably by adding more character moments. We get very, very few hangout moments with Steve and Sam (and Bucky), but they are some of the best scenes in the movie. Natasha, after being so great in Winter Soldier, is underused but still rocks (and thank goodness we don’t have a love story from Age of Ultron hanging over our heads). Wanda and Vision flirting is a little awkward, but they have nice chemistry, as do Sharon and Steve (one of the few Marvel love stories I’d be interested in seeing more of). But often times, the film fills time with a lot of action—fortunately a lot of great action. I don’t know who made the demand that most of Marvel’s action sequences be filmed during the day, but I like the decision for no other reason than the fact that I can enjoy the spectacle of the whole thing, and the Russos have turned into some of the best action directors of the decade. I would argue there are at least four action sequences in this film that rival what they did in Winter Soldier: a chase, a hand-to-hand fight, the opening mission, and the closing brawl. As for the big fight in all the trailers? It’s good—really good—it just goes on too long and doesn’t have the visceral or emotional impact of those other fights. The stakes of those fights are felt throughout the film. As fun as the big Civil War fight might be, I never knew if the mission was to kill or incapacitate their rival Avengers. Maybe it’s all the quipping from Spider-Man. Tom Holland is great, and his Spider-Man is a character I can’t wait to see in his own movie, but if this is the fight to end all fights, having EVERYONE throwing around quips undercuts the impact of that scene, which ends up just feeling like something done as fun eye-candy that delights in destruction. It kind of defeats the central collateral damage debate. But the Russos are excellent at staging hand-to-hand fights, using stunt people brilliantly and showcasing their cast’s abilities. I feel like Steve Rogers (and Chris Evans) couldn’t have been paired with a better directing team. The Russos’ signature from Winter Soldier was the fact that they made clean, fun, and thoughtful action movies closer to the best action films of the ’80s and ’90s—before computer technology dominated. Yes, their films don’t shy away from CGI, but the practical effects set their previous film apart. That isn’t as strong here, because they’re naturally required to have so much CGI. The visuals of the more CG heavy characters are a bit off, although unlike many action films, Marvel does manage to create more impact with buildings—they seem to fall with the deep impact of realism the way too few films ever do—but one of the reasons this movie works as well as it does is the conflicts remain insular and personal, rather than suggesting the world is at risk of total destruction (yet again). When the biggest (and most emotional) final fights are just between a few characters we’ve come to know and like over several films, the emotional investment is high. The movie is most definitely fun, and that’s a big reason the problems I have with it don’t stand out as strong as some of the darker, moodier action films we get. A light touch and high energy can keep a film afloat even when it struggles, and I’d like to re-watch this film and see some of what I missed and how the story actually builds and unfolds with the knowledge of the ending. But I’d be lying to say I didn’t find myself a little disappointed by the storytelling here, especially as Marvel begins stage three of its cinematic universe. The rushed and crowded feeling of the film, inability to show patience and really build up the conflict between the Avengers, and  at the end hurts what could have been a suburb sequel to Winter Soldier, even if it is still one of the best Marvel films to date.

"Jul 10, 2016",POSITIVE,"Civil War is the Marvel machine doing things right, but the machine is still designed to make films with all of the corners rounded off and all of the themes simplistic enough for ten-year-olds."
"Jul 1, 2016",POSITIVE,"Recalls last year's extravaganza ""Avengers: Age of Ultron,"" although it's less slick and has a stronger emotional center."
"Jun 13, 2016",POSITIVE," Here’s the plot: Up until now, the Avengers have been operating without supervision and killing a lot of people along the way (although, of course, saving many more), so a joint U.N. task force has been assembled to rein them in. Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), War Machine (Don Cheadle), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Vision (Paul Bettany) are on board with this U.N. leash, while Captain America (Chris Evans), Falcon (Sam Mackie), and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) are not. This divide is deepened when the Cap’s old boyhood-chum-turned-brainwashed-Hydra-soldier Bucky (Sebastian Stan) stands accused of a terrorist act. Cap doesn’t think he did it and is willing to alienate his fellow Avengers to protect him. Meanwhile, the two sides continue to grow in ranks: Cap picks up Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), while Iron Man gets his own secret weapons—Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), whose diplomat father was killed in the terrorist blast, and young Spider-Man (Tom Holland).

"May 30, 2016",POSITIVE,"Marvel, with its comic strip cool, Industrial Light & Magic control of gravity, what may be the largest ensemble of characters in its movie history and visual artistry, has done it again."
"May 20, 2016",POSITIVE," Have we reached peak superhero yet? After spending the winter months watching ""Jessica Jones"" and ""Daredevil"" on Netflix, viewers can now subject themselves to a barrage of comic-book spectacle at their local multiplex. Following last month's clattering, messy ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" comes ""Captain America: Civil War,"" an even more elaborately conceived clash between costumed ubermenschen. As if that wasn't enough, ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" is due for international release in just a few weeks' time — well, everywhere except for Japan, which doesn't get the film until August. On reflection, that might not be such a bad thing. A little of this stuff goes a long way. Sitting through the wearying ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" last year, it wasn't hard to envisage the current crop of superhero franchises reaching a stalemate, where the interests of hardcore fans and casual viewers became impossible to reconcile. You shouldn't need to do homework to enjoy a popcorn flick, but that's what the Marvel cinematic universe — which includes the ""Avengers"" and ""Captain America"" movies — increasingly requires. In a time of both misinformation and too much information, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.By subscribing, you can help us get the story right."
"May 19, 2016",POSITIVE," People talk about the ""body count"" of horror movies, but when it comes to mass destruction, the loss-of-life numbers in slashers generally pale beside recent superhero films. People talk about the ""body count"" of horror movies, but when it comes to mass destruction, the loss-of-life numbers in slashers generally pale beside recent superhero films. People talk about the “body count” of horror movies, but when it comes to mass destruction, the loss-of-life numbers in slashers generally pale beside recent superhero films. That notion was touched on in the madly disjointed Batman v. Superman, in which Ben Affleck’s vengeful Bruce Wayne felt the need to neutralize the son of Krypton following the devastation of his Metropolis battle with General Zod as seen in Man of Steel. It gets more thoughtful consideration in Captain America: Civil War, in which directors Joe and Anthony Russo effectively hit the pause button on the Avengers franchise to address the human cost of “collateral damage,” while still delivering the impressive action we’ve come to expect from the Marvel franchise in general and the Captain America movies in particular. Following the Eastern Europe-razing mayhem seen in The Avengers: Age of Ultron, a guilt-stricken Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) signs on when Secretary of State Thaddeus — formerly “Thunderbolt” — Ross (William Hurt) asks the members of the Avengers to pledge that they will refrain from doing battle unless requested to do so by the United Nations. Super-soldier Captain America (Chris Evans) disagrees, wanting to preserve his American sense of autonomy. When Cap’s buddy-turned-brainwashed assassin Bucky/The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) becomes the target of an international manhunt, the Avengers disassemble with the Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) siding with Cap and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Vision (Paul Bettany) and War Machine (Don Cheadle) choosing Team Iron Man. New recruits for either side include Spider-Man (Tom Holland), Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and African prince Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman). Juggling multiple characters and storylines proved to be exhausting for audiences in Joss Whedon’s Age of Ultron. The Russo brothers manage to maintain their equilibrium, even with the additions of Black Panther and a certain teenage webslinger. Speaking of which: at a time when we were thinking a do-not-resuscitate order was due for the cinematic Spider-Man, Holland may actually compel a change of attitudes to his upcoming reboot-of-a-reboot. Notwithstanding the film’s curious blend of kick-ass action coupled with a sensitive addressing of the cost of all that violence, making you anticipate the next Spider-Man movie may be its most impressive achievement."
"May 18, 2016",NEGATIVE," After the letdown of Avengers: Age of Ultron and the emo antics of Batman v Superman, audiences are increasingly numb to overstuffed superhero ensemble pieces. Captain America: Civil War, though, is proof you can jam pretty much every superhero in your roster into one film and still let individuals shine. In pitting team Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) against Team Cap (Chris Evans) over a suspiciously fascist registration law for ""enhanced humans,"" directors Joe and Anthony Russo could have just put the heroes—familiars like Ant-Man, Black Widow and War Machine, plus newcomers Black Panther and a truly amazing Spider-Man—in a big-ass sandbox and let them duke it out. They do that, and it's spectacular. But there's nothing redundant in the action here, from a Bourne-esque opening chase to close-combat thrills reminiscent of The Raid to a surprisingly subdued and heartfelt finale. The Russos have heard your complaints about universe-building at the expense of story. Civil War is fun. It's smart. It's coherent. And, most importantly, it allows its heart to beat strongly amid the chaos, with character moments and set pieces working in tandem to create perhaps Marvel's best film so far. Your move, DC. Willamette Week’s reporting has concrete impacts that change laws, force action from civic leaders, and drive compromised politicians from public office. Support WW's journalism today."
"May 18, 2016",NEGATIVE,"It's more of the same, of course it has a little more entertainment, but it's the same tendency to repeat what has worked in the past, nothing new. [Full review in Spanish]"
"May 18, 2016",POSITIVE," Playing the noblest American of them all, Chris Evans is easy to underrate. As in previous installments, Captain America: Civil War shows the World War II hero, frozen and revived for our complex times, as a touching and skeptical immortal. Our Captain could also be seen as a symbol of the U.S. government's unilateral actions in foreign affairs. But the Russo brothers' terrific action opus addresses directly what  Batman v. Superman hinted at. It's the most expensive, entertaining movie anyone's made about blowback. A squad of The Avengers are in Lagos, Nigeria, preventing the theft of a vial of ebola-like serum. During the ensuing, epic shootout, the powerful telepath Wanda (a hypnotically pretty Elizabeth Olsen) saves Captain America's life but accidentally kills a dozen bystanders. An international outcry builds on top of the anger at the aftermath of the Balkan catastrophe, seen in Age of Ultron. The Secretary of State (William Hurt) announces an international accord in which the Avengers will be leashed by U.N. restrictions. A weary Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.)—the vincible meat inside the shell of the Invincible Iron Man—urges his fellow heroes to sign. Captain America has his doubts. In between them is Natasha, the Black Widow (Scarlett Johannson, given much more screen time than she had in Ultron). In Vienna for the signing of the accord are representatives of Africa's Wakanda, the only source for the super-powerful ore vibranium. They are King T'chaka (John Kani, unforgettable from Master Harold...And the Boys) and his son T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman). What happens next demonstrates why a king and his heir should never travel together. A terrorist attack is seemingly carried out by the Winter Soldier, formerly known as Cap's wartime buddy Bucky (Sebastian Stan). Pressured, the Avengers crack. In hiding, watching the fissures, is the mysterious Zemo (Daniel Bruhl). It's a long, rich movie, neither too jokey nor too ponderous. Stark's own self-satisfied bluster doesn't hide his sorrows. His right-hand woman Pepper has left him. He has troubles that he's willing to spill in public. At MIT he demonstrates his newest invention. It's a holodeck-like therapy machine, in which a simulacrum of the young Stark copes with his WASP-y parents (John Slattery and Hope Davis). This satisfying adventure is rich with the things Marvel comics always did best: critiquing the consequences of power in explosive, four-color form. Even this moralizing can be parodied, though. When Iron Man's armor is infiltrated by Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), and Stark demands to know who goes there, the tiny intruder quips: 'This is your conscience speaking...' Everyone has grown here: Anthony Mackie's Falcon and Don Cheadle's Rhodes are nobody's sidekicks. The action scenes are flawless, including a sequence where Cap wrestles a helicopter like a bulldogger taking down a steer. He and Bucky escape from a SWAT team using the cops' own rappels as if they were trapeze wires. At an air and land battle at a German airport, the crowd of superheroes doesn't seem like excess. It's not like the directors are trying to sell us the toys after we see the movie. It's like they're having a good time playing with them. Recruited by Stark, Spider-Man ends up at the airport fray. The bright young Tom Holland (Billy Elliot) brings delight to the role, missing from the dim, serious recent Spider-Man films. (Stark is dismayed by Peter Parker's enthusiasm; there's a witty moment where he tries to figure out whether or not he ought to pat the kid on the shoulder.) Boseman is terrific as an avenger in both senses. Clad in a vibranium suit of armor with retractable claws, his Black Panther is more than worthy of a spin-off. The touches of romance, visible in the high humidity of Johannson's glances, are as involving as the battles. You get to travel a bit—Berlin's Spree River, the Lagos marketplace, stormy seas, icy dungeons and a stopover in Cleveland. Going for escapism, a crowd is given something to ponder. The question of what to do with 'unlimited power and no supervision' isn't just The Avengers' problem, it's America's."
"May 18, 2016",POSITIVE,"Like guest star Ant-Man in his new Giant-Man identity, this somewhat ungainly Marvel sequel almost collapses under its own weight."
"May 18, 2016",POSITIVE," I was never a fan of Captain America. Nor was I enthused by the prospect of a movie series based around him, despite a decent origin story film in 2011. A boy scout military kid who is unshakeably good and literally brandishes the American flag as armour? Give me strength, or give me a flawed hero... just not blond American patriotism over three films.
Rarely have I been so happy to be so wrong. In Captain America: Civil War, the intelligent plotting, thoughtful character development and blockbuster action of the past two instalments comes to a thrilling apex. Acting as both sequel to Captain America: The Winter Solider and Avengers: Age Of Ultron, Civil War sees the Avengers under scrutiny for the collateral damage they inflict during their terror-fighting missions.
Facing the prospect of being controlled by the United Nations, the Avengers experience a violent ideological split, with Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Vision (Paul Bettany), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and War Machine (Don Cheadle) welcoming the oversight, while Captain America (Chris Evans), Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Falcon (Anthony Mackie) resist becoming puppets for governmental agendas.
Writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely and directors Anthony and Joe Russo perfectly capture not only the characters’ personalities but how they relate to each other. Underlying each phenomenal and thrilling action sequence and epic battle is an intricately crafted web of loyalties and betrayals.
With brilliantly layered performances from the entire cast and a truly epic showdown, Civil War is simply magnificent. Captain America: Fuck Yeah."
"May 17, 2016",POSITIVE," This is the 13th superhero film in eight years set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, that fantastical screen realm where comic books are converted into bountiful currency. That's an awful lot of square-jawed heroes (a heroine, Captain Marvel, isn't due until 2019), ground-shaking battles and self-satisfied wisecracks from Robert Downey jnr's billionaire in a battle suit, Tony Stark/Iron Man. But just as this tangle of franchises has started to stagnate, thanks to the slightness of last year's Avengers: Age of Ultron and that Thor sequel no-one can remember anything about, Anthony and Joe Russo's first-rate feature provides invigorating action and genuine contemplation. Assembled to protect the Earth from extraordinary threats, the Avengers are now heroes to some and vigilantes to others. When a mission in Nigeria goes wrong with the loss of civilian lives, the US Secretary of State, Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt), has a new definition: ""dangerous"". The era of operating without oversight is over, he announces,  agreeing that a United Nations panel must control the group. The arc of the Captain America movies (2011's The First Avenger and 2014's The Winter Soldier, with Chris Evans as Steve Rogers, the scientifically enhanced American World War II soldier thrust into the present day) has been that of patriotic obedience versus individual discretion. Primed to stop the Nazis, Captain America has come to realise that in this fictionalised modern age of terror, the world is rarely black and white, and that all organisations are corruptible, whatever their beliefs. Moments from the Avengers' previous films are seen again, as if shot on smartphones by sheltering bystanders, and that reminder of ordinary witnesses soon extends to the survivors of mass destruction. ""Who's going to avenge my son?"" a grieving mother asks Stark, who has hung up his Iron Man suit to play the philanthropist, and his guilt compels him to vehemently support the controls that Captain America refuses to accept. The idea of responsibility for the all-powerful was also present in March's calamitous Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, only to be shunted aside. But here the philosophical stakes linger, and once the debate turns to confrontation between comrades, there's an air of regret. Even a new villain, expertly played by the German actor Daniel Bruhl, is more maudlin than megalomaniac. With the fuse lit by Captain America's refusal to abandon his friend turned brainwashed foe, Bucky Barnes/Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), the eventual confrontation is a geek's dream, with forces evenly split like undercards at a title fight: Iron Man, Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and War Machine (Don Cheadle), among others, take on Captain America, Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Falcon (Anthony Mackie) respectively. If you've ever wanted to witness a nerd spontaneously combust with uncontrolled excitement, then the superhero dust-up at Leipzig Airport is your best chance. The open spaces provide room for multiple thrilling, intercut tussles, which make great use of contrasting scale and droll banter. But it's a sometimes bumpy path there, and while Thor and the Hulk are absent, there are always new Marvel spin-offs to be primed. In the case of the formidable T'Challa/Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), it's deftly integrated into the storyline. But to bring the new Peter Parker/Spider-Man (Tom Holland) into proceedings requires a Tony Stark diversion to New York that is amusing but not exactly essential. All this plotting, which can become baffling, detracts from the real historic weight of the Captain America movies. The ghosts of 20th-century ideology hang over Steve Rogers and Bucky Barnes, and the film knows that the past's transgressions can never be escaped. ""Reframe the future,"" Tony Stark tells a hall full of students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, but by the film's end he's reminding Captain America that it was his late father who made the shield he's being hit with. The Russos' direction is more assured than in The Winter Soldier, and while most of the performances are solidly familiar, Elizabeth Olsen makes the uncertainty of Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch compelling. The one thing no-one can provide is a finale. Captain America: Civil War is satisfying but ultimately inconclusive. No matter what transpires, the end is never quite in sight."
"May 17, 2016",POSITIVE," There is a civil war brewing and it’s not between critics and fans, and it’s not between DC and Marvel. Captain America: Civil War blurs the line between stand alone character feature and unified cross-character movie, a line that allowed individual films to sparkle without having to completely rely on all that came before them. When Iron Man debuted eight years ago, it was done as the first in a series of preludes to a combined feature that would include Iron Man, Thor, Hulk and Captain America. As each film unfolded introducing these characters, we always had a simple end game in mind, but they each stood silently as character studies exploring what made these characters tick. Captain America: Civil War is the first in the series that has pulled in a vast number of these separate characters into a single film that wasn’t titled The Avengers. Captain Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) is the most iconic of the franchise’s character and after Captain America: The First Avenger and Captain America: The Winter Soldier, it became clear that his honorable and noble convictions were the result if not just a sense of patriotism, but a sense of when the greater good applied. What he also has that many of his compatriots tends to lack is faith in his fellow human beings. He doesn’t look for the worst in everyone, he looks for the best and tries to bring it out of them. Evans’ performance in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) continues to elevate the material in ways that showcase why this series has managed to endure over the last eight years. Those qualities are still on display in Civil War, but with so many narrative threads converging in one film, it’s not hard to see why the film feels less like a stand alone adventure and more like a stop-gap measure between The Avengers: Age of Ultron and The Avengers: Infinity War. That’s also one of the issues with two of the new threads that have been inserted in this film. Without Hulk and Thor, it became important to bring in two other characters that have their own individual features coming out soon. One of these characters was expertly woven into the plot, the other was shoehorned in for dramatic, but narratively suspect, purposes. Chadwick Boseman has done a lot of dramatic work in recent years and has been talked up twice as a possible Oscar contender. His films limped to the Oscar nomination contest and he was ultimately left off, but although his performance in this film is modestly lightweight, the genuine charisma and conviction he gives fits seamlessly with the rest of the superb cast of the MCU. His character, T’Challa, also known as Black Panther, was quite effectively introduced in the film. It may have been one narrative thread too far, but at least his inclusion doesn’t feel desperate. That’s what makes the introduction of the newest incarnation of Spider-Man (Tom Holland) so frustrating. After a successful original trilogy starring Tobey Maguire and a hit-and-miss reboot with Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker, Sony has rebooted the character once again, this time after signing an agreement with Disney to give both companies access to the character. It was a bold move, but forcing him into this film’s narrative felt not just clunky but almost insulting. I like Holland as an actor and his wise-cracking is well suited to the use made of it in the film, but the entire inclusion here was so hamfisted and unnecessary that it unbalances an entire section of the film. Whether Holland will ultimately work out as the webslinging superhero will have to wait until his own stand alone film comes out, but right now, I’m worried that the forced inclusion here might mute his potential elsewhere. Regardless of who they introduce, this is still a movie titled Captain America and while there’s a Civil War going on between members of the Avengers, we should be focused on Steve Rogers. The backbone of the story is his, even with all these elements. The problem is that it doesn’t feel much like his story. Whereas The First Avenger and The Winter Soldier had almost laser-like focus on Rogers and his assorted compatriots, this film tries so hard to insert in so many different plot threads to seed future films that it really is little more than an alternatively-titled Avengers sequel. That’s disappointing considering The Winter Soldier, as a stand alone film, was the franchise’s best to date. To that end, they at least introduced one of the strongest villains the franchise has so far seen. Perhaps it’s because he’s not the world conquering type that has to date characterized the previous efforts. Zemo (Daniel Bruhl) is a calculating antagonist whose plans are several steps ahead of the warring heroes. He recognizes that his plans require a great deal of careful consideration and redundancies that keep the conflict going indefinitely. How he accomplishes this is probably the most striking element of the film. Bruhl is perfectly cast as the coldly manipulative Zemo and were the story more focused on his machinations rather than setting up a lengthy, pointless airport scuffle, it might have been a more successful effort. As the universe of characters continues to expand dramatically over the years, either older characters will need to be retired or each movie will be so bloated with hints to the next that we’ll be stuck trying to figure out whether we’re watching a single film or an interconnected longform television program. That disjointed collectivism makes for frustrating viewing, especially if you like to keep your individual character films separated from your joint efforts. Unfortunately, Captain America: Civil War is not one of those films. There isn’t a lot to discuss about the film in the spoiler department. Most of the twists and turns are there for the betterment of the project. However, those two stinger segments at the end of the film are disappointing. When the first one appeared at the end of Iron Man, we were introduced to a clever way of setting up future films. They didn’t always reveal details about the upcoming features, but they became an important part of driving the connective tissues forward. The two at the end of Avengers: Captain America: Civil War move in the opposite direction of those prior post-credits revelations. Pushing the viewers to separate movies that will better establish the two new characters that were introduced in this film might be a wise investment were they the next films set to be released. What we didn’t get was a teaser for the upcoming Doctor Strange movie later this year or next May’s Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 or even the fall’s Thor: Ragnarok. Matter of fact, of the four Marvel films releasing next year, these two stingers target one of those pictures, a film that’s not even produced by Disney: Spider-Man: Homecoming. That’s right. Sony’s reboot of Spider-Man now has the unified blessing of Disney/Marvel and has gotten a teaser at the very end of this film. Were the shoehorning in of Peter Parker here not worrisome enough, the rather corny credits capper should be. That leaves the other stinger pointed at the February 2018 release of Black Panther. I can see more need of a push for that film, but with Doctor Strange the next film out of the gate, one would think it would have gotten some kind of push. It got bupkis. Those original post-credits segments may not have been pointing to the immediate next film, but they at least set up the introduction of how all these disparate characters would come together, now it seems like they are intended to drive them all apart. Perhaps the title Civil War was a fairly apt description after all."
"May 16, 2016",POSITIVE,"Very entertaining, and a far tighter production than much of Marvel's recent output."
"May 15, 2016",POSITIVE," As we go deeper into the Marvel cinematic mythology, each film has more work to do: It has to tell its own story, service a growing roster of characters, fitting into the overall mythology, and also taking some time to set up whatever comes next. Captain America: Civil War isn’t the best overall Marvel film—I’d rank it behind the first Iron Man and Avengers and about even with Captain America: The Winter Soldier—but it does the best job balancing those obligations. It also boasts the most entertaining sustained action sequence in Marvel history. Civil War is nominally a Captain America film, and largely follows a plot that continues the two earlier standalone Cap films, mostly focused on the titular superhero’s decades-spanning friendship/rivalry with Bucky Barnes/The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan.) The plot focuses on the question of whether or not the Winter Soldier is still a brainwashed super-soldier responsible for terrorist attacks around the world. And also, because civilian casualties all of a sudden matter greatly in superhero movies, there’s fallout from the Eastern European blowout that closed out last year's second Avengers movie. So there’s a UN plan, pushed by the U.S. secretary of state (William Hurt), to put the Avengers under U.N. supervision. Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.) is on board, but Captain America objects. This leads into the “civil war” storyline that entails the Avengers splitting into warring factions, with Iron Man and Cap as leaders, which will last for several more movies. This means there are 12 separate superheroes that figure into the narrative, and that’s even with the Hulk and Thor sitting this one out—Iron Man’s faction includes Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Vision (Paul Bettany), War Machine (Don Cheadle) and Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman); Cap is backed by Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olson), Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner,) with Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) playing a comic relief role. Also, on top of various non-superpowered characters, the film has to introduce characters soon to have their own movies: Black Panther, as well as… Spider-Man (Tom Holland), now in the Marvel fold following a recent Disney/Sony corporate deal. There’s also a separate villain, a German baddie played by Daniel Bruhl, who has similar motivations as Lex Luthor in Dawn of Justice, albeit ones presented in a much more straightforward and less convoluted manner. The film juggles all of this expertly, and screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely deserve credit for keeping it all straight, as do directors Joe and Anthony Russo. It all leads up to an absolutely amazing action sequence, an extended brawl set outside a German airport, which is like a better version of the third act of the first Avengers movie. Not only is the scene shot beautifully, but it also finds inventive uses for all of the superheroes’ powers, and even their relationships with each other. The film’s other major triumph is the return of Spider-Man, which represents the first good cinematic treatment of Spidey since Sam Raimi’s second film back in 2004. All of the Spider-Man stuff is pure gold—starting with the casting of the 19-year-old Holland, who actually plays Peter Parker as a kid. Sure, the casting of Marisa Tomei as the normally elderly Aunt May is ridiculous, but at least the movie has fun with it. It’s enough to get excited about next year’s standalone Spidey film. Civil War isn’t perfect. It gets off to a slow start, and I’m not certain that the Cap/Winter Soldier story needed to be spread over three movies instead of one. The action sequences, especially in the first half, are inexplicably shot in shaky-cam; I really thought filmmakers were over that by now. As usual, there’s no reason to see this movie in 3D, and it’s a too long at two and a half hours. As for that other movie this year about warring superheroes, in which one is motivated by the death of his parents: It’s better than Batman v. Superman by every conceivable measure. There’s actually sunlight, and there’s no overarching sense of bleakness and nihilism. Most importantly, the people in charge of this film know the characters, what’s appealing and significant about them, and how to structure a story featuring a whole bunch of them. "
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"A good, disposable piece of FX-driven entertainment, even if it comes with the obligatory one-act storyline, lack of originality and 30-minute over-run."
"May 13, 2016",NEUTRAL," When the U.N. cracks down on the “renegade” superheroes of the Avengers, one faction, led by Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), agrees that oversight is in order, while Captain America (Chris Evans) and others distrust government and stand up for individual super-freedom. Thus the stage is set for a showdown, with all the CGI mayhem $250 million can buy. Writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeeley and directors Anthony and Joe Russo make a cheerful show of it, giving their gee-whiz comic book audience all they could wish for—and more. But that’s the problem—it’s still just 90 minutes worth of story stretched out to two-and-a-half hours. Still, lovers of the Marvel universe can never get too much, while the rest of us grumble about the Bach we could be listening to, the Tolstoy we could be reading. J.L. When are the geniuses in Hollywood going to learn that no movie based on a video game has ever made a dime at the box office?"
"May 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,It's this levity that makes the much-touted battle royale between Team Cap and Team Iron Man so much fun.
"May 12, 2016",POSITIVE," I wish I could tell you that Captain America: Civil War is so good that it will make you forget the horror that was Batman v Superman: Dawn of Bursting Diseased Cinematic Pustules. Alas, nothing is good enough to clear that cloud out of one’s brain anytime soon. Captain America: Civil War is very good, though—a nice blast of superhero fun that finds a diplomatic way to include many Marvel favorites, even introducing a few characters to the modern Marvel Cinematic Universe, without feeling crowded or rushed. This is one well-oiled Marvel machine. Front and center, there’s Steve Rogers (former Human Torch Chris Evans), a.k.a. Captain America, still having bro issues when it comes to the Winter Soldier, Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan). Cap wants to back up his former best friend, but the guy committed some pretty shady acts while brainwashed, some of them very hard to defend. Captain America has to make some hard choices. Meanwhile, Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) thought Age of Ultron sucked for more than the obvious reasons. On top of being kind of boring, it left death and destruction in its wake, as did the far more exciting original The Avengers. World leaders want to put the Avengers in check, using them as a sort of alternative to nuclear weapons. Tony Stark, a.k.a. Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr., still owning it) suffering a crisis of conscience, agrees to the proposed accord. Rogers thinks it’s bullshit and won’t sign. This works as a fine setup for an eventual battle between Iron Man and Captain America, where both sides have compelling reasons to fight. It’s actually hard to pick a side in this movie, making the confrontation all the more fun. The Avengers get split up between Iron Man and Captain America. Stark has Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), War Machine (Don Cheadle), Vision (an excellent Paul Bettany), and new recruits Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and, yep, Spider-Man (Tom Holland, looking like he could be the best Spidey yet) in his ranks. Rogers goes into battle with the Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Bucky, and new recruit Ant-Man (a funny Paul Rudd) bringing up the ranks. It’s no easy task, but directors Anthony and Joe Russo, along with their screenwriters, juggle a lot of characters and spin a lot of plates entertainingly. No single character hogs the screen for too long, everybody gets a nice stake in the movie, and the newbies are introduced in wholly satisfying ways. Spider-Man manages to get his setup in a solid scene with Stark and Aunt May (Marisa Tomei … hooray!). It’s a relatively quick scene but, hey, it’s Spider-Man. He doesn’t need a long setup. Just introduce him and let him start shooting webs and wisecracks. Conspicuously missing are Hulk and Thor. Something had to be left for the next Thor movie, so those two get to take a break. While Age of Ultron felt like nothing but a bunch of scenes setting up the next chapter, Civil War works as a standalone action movie. There are no clear plans for Captain America and Bucky in The Avengers saga going forward. They’re great characters, but it’s safe to say that there are plenty of great characters in the MCU. Captain America: Civil War gets things back on track after the weak Age of Ultron, and gets us excited for next year’s Spider-Man Homecoming. Oh, and until I’m not that guy sitting by myself through the credits, I’ll just keep saying it: Stay through the damn credits until that blue ratings thing shows at the end. It’s a Marvel movie! There are two further scenes to see. Talks are underway for a Jungle Book 2 already. Perhaps a main plot point could be Mowgli finding some new shorts or a bathing suit. Midnight Special has elements of Duel, E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind with the mystery and wonder of the best episodes of The Twilight Zone."
"May 12, 2016",NEGATIVE,"The fact that Civil War ponders the importance of those who've died in conflicts doesn't add complexity to the film, it just fills it with hipocrisy. [Full review in Spanish]"

"May 12, 2016",NEGATIVE,"Captain America and Iron Man almost represent the schism that now divides American voters, politicians, and pundits. I say ""almost,"" because the film...doesn't inspire reflection upon the dire seriousness of our current ideological civil war."

Rated PG-13 for extended sequences of violence, action and mayhem.
Running time: 146 minutes.
Three and a half stars out of four. With “Captain America: Civil War,” directors Anthony and Joe Russo have found the tricky balance that eluded the ordinarily reliable Joss Whedon with last year’s “Avengers: Age of Ultron.” They’ve made a movie that’s both self-referential and self-reverential, thrilling and heady, packed with giant set pieces and sly pop-culture quips in equal measure. Yes, there’s probably too much going on here: too many characters, too many subplots, too many gears keeping the behemoth Marvel Cinematic Universe grinding ever forward toward world domination. And at nearly two and a half hours, it’s a long sit — although Nicolas, at age 6 1/2, was thoroughly engaged the whole time. (Then again, he’s inordinately Marvel-savvy. Your mileage may differ.). But “Civil War” remains entertaining throughout, even as it turns introspective. The Russos, who also directed Chris Evans & Co. in the excellent “Captain America: The Winter Soldier” from 2014, have reteamed with the writers of that movie, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. Like “The Winter Soldier,” “Civil War” is relevant and resonant without becoming heavy-handed or self-serious the way, oh, say, “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice” did. It’s got some intelligent, important matters on its mind but also finds a way to deliver in terms of  summer thrills. Now, I don’t want to divulge too much in terms of plot. I’d like to avoid spoilers for both of the people on the planet who haven’t seen “Civil War” yet. (For a spoiler-tastic review of the film, please enjoy our What the Flick?! discussion.) But I do want to touch on the main things the movie gets so right, as well as the few it gets not quite right. An inadvertent deadly attack on an office building in Lagos, Nigeria — the result of the Avengers trying to do the right thing, as usual — prompts the U.S. government to question whether these superheroes should be allowed to continue functioning autonomously. A quick montage of the massive urban destruction that has occurred in the past few Marvel movies makes an awfully persuasive case: Yes, they’re using their powers for the greater good in all these instances, but the collateral damage is undeniable. The fact that a Marvel movie dares to question the big, shiny spectacle that is its bread and butter — and acknowledge that untold thousands die in the name of entertainment — seems rather novel. At the same time, “Civil War” approaches this topic in brisk, smart fashion rather than languishing in perpetually rainy, philosophical doldrums the way Zack Snyder’s “BvS” did earlier this year. As the Avengers and their newfound allies take sides on the issue of whether to sign a treaty agreeing to international oversight or continue with their current strategy of world-saving, no matter the cost, it’s fascinating to see who falls where. It doesn’t shake out the way you might expect; there’s a bit of role reversal here. The typically brash, billionaire industrialist Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), better known as Iron Man, is surprisingly conservative when it comes to the group’s use of power. He’s seen some things and thinks General Thaddeus “Thunderbolt” Ross (William Hurt) has a point in seeking oversight and accountability. Meanwhile, Evans’ Steve Rogers — the earnest do-gooder, Captain America — takes an if-not-now-when, if-not-us-who approach. He wants to maintain the status quo and refuses to sign. As Steve’s old childhood friend-turned-enemy Bucky (Sebastian Stan) returns from obscurity to unleash his full potential as the reprogrammed killing machine The Winter Soldier, the Avengers must side with either Iron Man or Captain America as the latest and greatest threat to world peace looms ever larger. We’re talking about a lot of people here, folks — so many that you may lose track of who’s on which team in the midst of major battles. Maybe that’s the point, though — the futility of war and whatnot. All I know is, the next day, Nicolas and I had a hard time recalling who was Team Cap and who was Team Iron Man. (Luckily, the ubiquitous billboards throughout Los Angeles helped jog our memories.) There’s also the revelation of a deep secret that provides a surprisingly emotional underpinning to the ideological feud between Iron Man and Captain America. It arrives during a moment of beautiful dramatic in snowy Siberia, and it’s the film’s most gorgeous, memorable image (the work of cinematographer Trent Opaloch, who also shot “The Winter Soldier”). And that’s about all I want to say about that. As for the performances — because yes, they do matter, even in a blockbuster about comic-book heroes — an enormous cast gets even bigger with the addition of characters from Marvel movies past and future. Everyone gets a brief moment to shine but it’s often tantalizing and perhaps not enough. Besides Evans and Downey — who seem to feel these characters in the very fiber of their being by now — there’s also Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye, Anthony Mackie as Falcon, Paul Rudd as Ant-Man, Elizabeth Olsen as Scarlet Witch and Paul Bettany as Vision. The tremendously versatile Chadwick Boseman, who’s already played Jackie Robinson (“42”) and James Brown (“Get On Up”) in just the past few years, provides excitement both physically and emotionally as newcomer Black Panther — and he’ll get his own movie, directed by Ryan Coogler, in 2018. But the best part of “Civil War” for me was the reintroduction of Peter Parker/Spider-Man. It is THE highlight of the movie. Tom Holland finds just the perfect tone as the webslinger, whom we’ve seen in countless other incarnations. Tobey Maguire was quippy and Andrew Garfield was angry and both played this iconic role with varying degrees of success. Holland gets the boyish giddiness of having superpowers; his joy is infectious, and his banter with Downey positively crackles. And unlike the Black Panther movie, you only have to wait until next year for “Spider-Man: Homecoming.” Because regardless of how good any of these movies are individually, they’re all just cogs in the massive Marvel machinery. Umm. Miss Lemire? Your review seems positive but it’s still showing rotten on Rotten Tomatoes. Is there a mistake here or am I just confused?  Just saw it and surprised how much I enjoyed it. You’re right, loved the comedy – In the midst of battle Black Widow asks Hawk: “We are still friends, aren’t we?” “Of course,” he replies. Yet they’re on opposite teams. Hahaha.  As you said, the movie was a tad long. Even while I enjoyed the action, had to go the restroom but scared I’d miss an important plot point I, like many other folks in the theater, waited. We missed the credits as many made a mad dash for the toilet. Without spoiling any of the major plot points I have one major issue with this movie – Being that Captain America is a man of the uniform who follows authority, wouldn’t he be on the political side that Iron Man took. And being a sort of anarchist who doesn’t follow authority wouldn’t Iron Man be on the opposite side of the political position he takes as we saw from previous Iron Man films. Apart from that it was a awesome fun summer movie. Stark is now the guy that wants to make everyone safe and will use any means to make it happen.  Safety is the priority, no matter the cost. Steve is the guy that doesn’t trust anyone.  He wants to keep the world safe, but not at the cost of his or anyone else’s freedom. Their positions have changed over time.  There has been a role-reversal, in many ways.  I think it easy to see why a guy that jumped from 1940 to 2011 might be horrified about how for technology has come.  The world we live in where there is almost no expectation of privacy has been gradual for us.  For his character, it was instantaneous. Nah.  Tony Stark has been coming to this realization that there needs to be some sort of check in place for a while now.  Especially after he was sort of responsible for Ultron existing in the first place. As for Cap, he doesn’t blindly follow authority.  He is a champion of freedom and democracy above anything else.  Being a patriot doesn’t mean doing what your government tells you.  It’s the people who have the power, not the government.  We need leaders and decision makers in the political arena, but the moment those decisions infringe on our rights is the moment we must take action. Of course there will always be room for argument over what those rights are exactly, but it seems obvious Cap believes yet another government agency demanding private information and submission to their will is not something we would benefit from even if the end goal is a noble one. Well said my brother 🙂 If you keep texting like this I might have to press Follow on your Twitter account (If you have one) Articulate & Insightful. “Being a patriot doesn’t mean doing what your government tells you to.” Damn! I like that. Might have to put it on a t-shirt. Regarding “Cap’s” views on government, I would most DEFINITELY, be on his side!!!
I agree w/ not allowing our government today, to have so much access to all  citizens privacy!!!!! No one should have that much access on anyone!!!; unless it’s matters of national security!!!! High ALERT
THREAT!!!!! i.e….anything that’s criminal and/or a threat to society.???? From what was done to those Avengers who dared to question the totalitarian rulings … it was clear that the UN resolutions were not lawful … just Ordnungs. It’s easier to buy if you read the book. Essentially, Iron Man, who has evolved from reckless, womanizing alcoholic to taking Nick Fury’s top spot in SHIELD, sees himself as a sort of patriarch for the hero community: He knows what’s best for them. Cap, on the other hand, loves his country and the freedoms it provides–freedoms which include autonomy from government interference wherever possible-not for him-he’s a soldier, but for his fellow superhumans whose only vow of service is to the innocents they have sworn to protect. Thanks for a great in depth review, I thought ‘Civil War’ was just superb. The thing with movies is there are different genres and there is always something for everyone in movies. This is not just a comic book film, but an action film that has heart, emotion, humor, great action sequences and visuals. Like ‘Winter Soldier’ it’s darker than other MCU films and more complex, but it still doesn’t forget to be fun. I think Black Panther and Spider-Man we’re outstanding in their MCU debuts and their strong performances should leave many movie goers excited about their upcoming solo films. I think a lot of credit goes to the Russos and the writers for giving us a thoughtful CBM and not just some run of the mill market machine. So agree with you, Fred, about Black Panther and SpiderMan. When Black Pather reveals his identity I gasped. Never even considered him as the culprit. And all those great toys he came with . . . wow. Then we see him with an entourage and know he’s got bucks to support his enterprise. SpiderMan, on the other hand, we’re meeting as the boy wonder. Still in high school. Still under his Aunty’s thumb. Tom Hollander’s awkward and bumbling characterization charmed. Civil war is a great marvel movie with terrific action. The liepzig airport avengers action blitzkrieg is a thing of beauty; action nirvana spun with intricate webbing, served up with a giant helping of comic book retrograde pastiche. However I find villain baron Zemo’s scenes boring and a stretch of willing suspension of disbelief. After the airport action extravanga, I was looking for an even more rousing epic action finale; the smallness of the finale and slow burn of it left me disappointed. Movie was in fine feckle and soaring up until the rather tame finale. Excellent except for Zemo who is not as commandeering and action savvy as his nefarious comic roots counterpart. Hi Christy Lemire. That’s really a great thought of yours towards the movie. I had also watched it many times and still don’t mind to watch it again. I am a big fan of Avengers since it first came at 2012. Since then the progress they have made on the following movies are remarkable. As being a fan of the Avengers I had a great expectations from the movie CIVIL WAR too and I must say it does meet the expectations. The story of the movie is really attention grabbing. I totally agree on your description of the plots and the subplots. And I do like the way they come up with the concept of Peter Parker (Spider Man). But they only thing that I don’t like is, his role throughout the movie. He was just introduced for a certain purpose. While there was a conflict between the avengers of the Captain America side and the Iron Man side, Spider Man was plotted as a major character. After that he was lost. I think if they had extended his role a little bit more then it would be something more to watch.
When I saw the trailer, I was like wow! Spider Man. But, later on after watching the movie I realized that it was just for certain time. That was the only this I find which could have been improvised. Else then that everything is just amazing. I love this movie. And I am waiting for its next series. I was a huge DC fan and back in 2008 couldn’t care less on what Marvel was doing. Then, IronMan happened and the rest is history. Both Winter Soldier and Civil War are a poem to fans of these comics. Well done, well executed, fun to watch, fan to think about. Love Civil War!"

"May 10, 2016",POSITIVE,The Russo Brothers created and exciting film with one of the best action scenes in the whole MCU. [Full review in Spanish]
"May 10, 2016",POSITIVE," is at all functional points to the considerable achievement of directors Anthony and Joe Russo. An armored personnel carrier passing as a movie, it's two-and-a-half hours long, well into double digits in costumed characters, about twice that in name actors, deep into nine figures in budget and sure to hit 10 figures in box-office grosses. I'm shocked it didn't take six directors just to hammer it into shape. Breaking it down by the numbers does it no justice, of course. The inevitable comparison to be made here is to ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,"" which lacked the intangibles that make similarly overstuffed ""Avengers"" movies so enjoyable: heart, tension, comedy, big ideas. Although ""Civil War"" is a whole lotta movie, and not quite among the top-tier chapters of the mega-franchise, those elements remain intact, keeping the narrative glued together, like a substance with the tensile strength of, oh, I dunno, maybe the webbing of a certain arachnoid superhero. One of the film's most memorable scenes is a speech by Avenger newcomer Vision (Paul Bettany), a highly intelligent synthetic being who's as much warrior as philosopher. A discussion of the Avengers' role as Earth's defenders has him pondering the inevitability of catastrophe as a result of their powerful presence: their mere existence provokes powerful challengers to rise. Later, in a moment thankfully much lighter in tone, Iron Man alter ego Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) visits squeaky-voiced teen Peter Parker-slash-Spider-Man (Tom Holland), and the kid parrots the Vision's speech in simpler terms, referencing his own well-known theory about great power and great responsibility. Tony raises an eyebrow when he makes the connection, and so do we. Of course, such high-minded blah blah isn't really the point of ""Civil War."" The film exists to stage a much-hyped dozen-hero battle on a tarmac big and wide enough to accommodate everything from Ant-Man's (Paul Rudd) microscopic bedlam to run-of-the-mill fisticuffs to extra-large explosion-studded high-flying highfalutin destructive bombastic mayhem. It's a rather entertaining ruckus, differentiating itself from this year's other colossal confrontation, Batman vs. Superman, by being satisfying, well-directed and set during the unforgiving daylight hours, when there's direct lighting, lots of color and no visual murk to hide seams in the visual effects. The Russos stage the lengthy and complex sequence with the skill of technicians rather than artists - there's no real room for virtuoso filmmaking when the goal is to pay due diligence to multiple characters and their variety of enhanced skills. The filmmakers aim for clarity and hit the bullseye. And more importantly, they'll satisfy a core audience of fan-types that can be, shall we say, high-maintenance. Pleasurable as the Russos' accomplishments are, ""Civil War"" doesn't quite live up to their previous effort, 2014's ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier."" That film popped from its opening salvo, when they pulled the camera back and let its title hero show what he can do with his hands, feet and shield as he infiltrated a boat full of bad guys. So ""Civil War"" is mostly par for the course for most movies set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe: solid on all fronts. But being the 13th film in said series, a familiarity in tone and style tamps down any exhilaration we might feel. This probably won't change much in the near future either, as ""Civil War"" is the first in ""Phase Three"" of the franchise, which will conclude nine movies from now with the second of two planned ""Avengers: Infinity War"" films, both to be helmed by the Russos. I know I'm only looking three years into the future of Marvel Studios, but I feel like I'm deep-sighing into infinity as the franchise teeters on the precipice of overkill, cultivating another civil war, between my giddy inner 12-year-old and my increasingly weary adult self. The primary conflict between Captain America/Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) and Iron Man stems from the former's fundamental purity of character and the latter's relatively world-weary cynicism. They both feel the guilt of collateral damage in past conflicts: fresh off the stage of an MIT lecture, Stark is confronted by the mother of a young man killed in the brouhaha at the end of 2015's ""Avengers: Age of Ultron."" In the first act of ""Civil War,"" Cap's slight hesitation during an urban battle against Crossbones (Frank Grillo) implicates him and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) in civilian deaths. Guilt hangs over the Avengers' compound, and so does the desire of the United Nations, which wants to rein in the supergroup for accountability's sake. They would be under the management of U.S. Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt), who wears a pushbroom mustache rendering him potentially untrustworthy. Stark wants to sign the agreement as an act of necessary compromise. Cap doesn't, finding it too restrictive, limiting their freedom to operate in a sphere without political wrangling. Meanwhile, Cap's old World War II buddy Bucky, now the metal-armed sort-of bad guy and brainwashee Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), is the alleged perp in a high-profile bombing. Cap thinks he can bring him in peacefully, but Iron Man and Sec. Ross think otherwise. A rift grows among the Avengers, forcing Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and the rest - save for Thor and Hulk, who are AWOL - to take sides, and recruit newbies such as Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), a charismatic figure who plays a significant role here, and comic-relief drop-ins Spider-Man and Ant-Man. Also meanwhile, a man named Helmut Zemo (Daniel Bruhl) roots around the margins of the narrative, hoping to ally himself with Winter Soldier. ""Stark's arrogance and Cap's righteousness end up being remarkably similar, and neither of them is right or wrong,"" is a sentence I wrote last year in my ""Age of Ultron"" review, and it's applicable to ""Civil War,"" which essentially expands upon that notion of moral uncertainty. That type of real-world ideological struggle gives the new film a reasonably thick thematic padding for the heroes to fall on when they get knocked on their cans in a fight. The Avengers are playing a high-stakes game, as dangerous as any, and even when the conflicts get goofy and intergalactic, there's enough relatively plausible subject matter present to create some significant dramatic heft, a tangible sense of consequence. Such is the growing success of this franchise; it's increasingly about things of a subjective nature - guilt and rage, liberty and subjugation - without devaluing it as an entertainment product. It's all fun and games until someone gets hurt. John Serba is film critic and entertainment reporter for MLive.com and other Advance affiliates. Read all his film reviews from 2016 here.

"May 9, 2016",POSITIVE," It is May, so that can only mean one thing: pretty flowers. Oh, yeah, it also means Marvel is here to completely dominate the box office with superhero mayhem. To their credit, Marvel does it better than anyone and they have arrived just in time to remind us of that fact while we cinematic nerds are just washing the taste of the clunky “Batman v. Superman” out of our mouths. “Captain America: Civil War” is the third Marvel movie to feature Chris Evans as the all-American superhero. Captain America has turned in the highest level of consistency among Marvel’s mini, stand-alone franchises. What hinders “Civil War” as opposed to Captain America’s previous two adventures is it suffers from the bloat of universe building. “Captain America: The First Avenger” and “Captain America: The Winter Solder” were (relatively) lean, little movies that focused on a tight plot and didn’t really require any knowledge of the other 40,000 Marvel movies. “Civil War” invites too many people to the party and is a little too beholden to other once-and-future movies to match the excellence of its predecessors. But still, even when Marvel labors a little under its own weight, it’s still a heck of a ride and some of the most fun you can have at the movie theater. The premise is an interesting one, with superheroes coming under scrutiny for all of the death and destruction that follows in their wake, even when they manage to save the day. The governments of the world want all of the superheroes to register and act only with approval of the United Nations. Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), carrying around a healthy amount of guilt for creating Ultron in “Avengers 2,” thinks this is a good idea. Cap thinks surrendering his liberty to the whims and agendas of politicians is not something he can abide, especially when his deeply-misunderstood-childhood-buddy-turned-brainwashed-assassin Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) shows back up as public enemy No. 1. Familiar faces start to take sides as Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Iron Man’s buddy War Machine (Don Cheadle) agree with Tony’s prudent approach, while Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) want to keep their independence. Even the new (and very solid) additions to the Avengers, the synthetic hero Vision (Paul Bettany), #TeamIronMan, and the telekinetic Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), #TeamCaptain, square off. Also along for his first team-up is Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), who sides with Captain America, just thankful to be chosen by anybody, and winds up nearly stealing the show. While the superhero family feud is the focal point of the story, two peripheral characters are also introduced with much hopeful intrigue for the future. Young African prince T’Challa and his alter-ego Black Panther (played by Chadwick Boseman) finds himself joining Iron Man’s team on a quest for vengeance, but will helm his own movie in 2018. And then there is Tom Holland who plays a nerdy, talkative high schooler named Peter Parker. The kid has a knack for clinging to walls and swinging from building to building with some homemade spider webs. Now that Spider-Man is back under the Marvel umbrella, the character that has been booted and rebooted all over the 21st century somehow feels fresh and new again. I’m actually looking forward to a new Spider-Man movie. Never thought I’d say that again. Anyway, brothers Anthony and Joe Russo, who directed “Winter Soldier,” do a good job of making all the moving pieces come together in a way that makes sense both intellectually and emotionally. That’s no easy feat. “Captain America: Civil War” lives up to the hype, although it would have been fun to see it exceed it. They still have the magic tough, but Marvel will have their work cut out for themselves if they want to keep dominating the month of May into the future."
"May 9, 2016",NEUTRAL," 
	Let's hear three cheers for the Avengers, an elite circle of superheroes who do their best to make the world a better place: Captain America (Chris Evans), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), War Machine (Don Cheadle), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Vision (Paul Bettany), and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen).
 
	When all the dust and debris clears from the many crashed cars and exploding buildings, this latest film in the rowdy franchise is a morality play. What is the main theme in the Marvel scheme of things? It is that not even superheroes who set out to save the world from evil-doers can be exempt from the toll of collateral damage that happens on account of their heroic efforts.
 
	After a couple of incidents when many civilians were killed, the nations of the world decide to take action. The U.S. Secretary of State (William Hurt) informs the Avengers that the Sokovia Accords will place them under the power of the United Nations and a group of overseers who will monitor their activities and decide when they are needed or not.
 
	Iron Man, feeling guilty about the civilian deaths he has caused, decides to go along with this new plan as do War Machine and Vision. Captain America cannot wrap his mind around this authoritarian and limiting plan of accountability. When a violent attack occurs in Vienna, he and several others who side with him decide to take on the challenge of stopping the vengeful villain (Daniel Bruhl) who with the assistance of the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), a metal-armed killing machine, has come up with a plan to get rid of the Avengers.
 
Captain America: Civil War has far too many tedious hand-to-hand fighting sequences but it does raise a good point. How often do we think about the unintended victims in these big action dramas? (When we lived in New York City, we would often turn to each other during such films and say, ""Well, there goes the neighborhood again."") This one also throws in some funny sequences with the comic antics of a youthful Spider Man (Tom Holland) who wins the admiration of Iron Man by his clever tricks in a big battle scene. As usual, the acting of Robert Downey Jr. is far superior to everyone else.
"
"May 9, 2016",POSITIVE," The civil war of the title is waged among the Avengers themselves, who find themselves ideologically divided when 117 nations sign the Sokovia Accords, named for the fictional Eastern European nation that was obliterated during the Avengers’ battle with Ultron. The Accords place the Avengers under the control of a U.N. panel, which is seen as a necessary corrective for the superheroes’ unbridled power and tendency toward collateral damage—a familiar conceit that we’ve seen everywhere from Watchmen (2009), to The Incredibles (2004), to the recent Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016). Billionaire industrialist Tony Stark, aka Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) is in favor the accords, a complete reversal of his previous tendency toward anti-authoritarianism that is born out of the guilt he feels about accidentally unleashing Ultron on the world (unfortunately, Stark’s guilt complex is one of the more undercooked aspects of the film). On the opposite side is genetically enhanced super-soldier Steve Rogers, aka Captain America (Chris Evans), who chafes at the idea of an international body telling the Avengers what they can and can’t do. Interestingly, this pushes Captain America even further from the established order he is sworn to uphold than he was in The Winter Soldier, as he effectively becomes a criminal by the midway point of the film. Cap’s criminalization is centered primarily around his protection of Bucky Barnes, aka the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), who was once his best friend but was physically enhanced and brainwashed by the Soviets to be a ruthless assassin. Captain America is convinced that Bucky should be considered innocent of his crimes because he was psychologically conditioned to commit them against his will, even though he remains a potential threat because he is still susceptible to commands from those who know how to get into his gray matter and he is accused of setting off a bomb during the ratification of the Sokovia Accords in Vienna. The tensions are also being inflamed by a new villain, Zemo, (Daniel Brühl), who has vengeance on his mind and sees that the best way to attain it is to turn the Avengers against each other. And this is precisely what happens, as Captain America’s actions split the Avengers right down the middle, with various characters siding with either Iron Man or Captain America. Stark counts among his supports War Machine (Don Cheadle); Vision (Paul Bettany), the superhuman entity he created to replace Ultron; Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), an African king whose father was killed by the bomb supposedly set off by Bucky; Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), whose history of playing both sides suggests that she may not stay entirely loyal to one side or the other; and Spider-Man (Tom Holland), who Iron Man recruits into the fray even though he is a teenage geek still figuring out his superpowers (Holland’s take on the character suggests good things for the next Spider-Man reboot). Siding with Cap are Bucky Barnes; Falcon (Anthony Mackie); Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), who comes out of self-imposed retirement; wise-cracking Ant-Man (Paul Rudd); and troubled psychokinetic Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), who Iron Man tries and fails to keep out of the fray by putting her under Vision’s protection. This squaring off of superheroes promises plenty of pyrotechnics, most of which go off at Germany’s Leipzig/Halle Airport, where the super-smackdown commences with full rage (the two sides literally bum rush each other from opposite sides of a runway). And, while directors Anthony and Joe Russo (who also helmed The Winter Soldier) find plenty of clever and entertaining match-ups to exploit, the fun of watching superheroes pummel each other can only last so long, especially when there is so much cheating regarding their very different abilities and physiques (why, for example, can Hawkeye and Black Widow, who are thoroughly human and unprotected by armor, withstand as much physical abuse as supercharged Captain America or armored Iron Man?). Like The Winter Soldier, there are a few more action sequences than there need to be and the ones we get go on too long; it feels like the Russos were determined to make sure everyone got their money’s worth, even though the real entertainment factor is in watching the various personalities clash. Granted, they’ve been clashing since the gang first got together in The Avengers (2012), but at least then they were ostensibly fighting for the same cause. Driven apart by competing ideologies, the superheroes reveal even more of both their flaws and their virtues. Captain America’s determination to stand for what he sees is right is admirable, even though it is potentially dangerous, whereas Iron Man’s willingness to subject himself to outside control demonstrates a relaxing of his famed ego, albeit only because he is driven his guilt. Until now, Captain America and Iron Man have always had a humorously antagonistic relationship, with the former’s red-white-and-blue purity conflicting with the latter’s narcissistic vulgarity, so watching them truly at odds with each other packs a punch. There is a real sense of gravitas underlying the film’s central conflict, which isn’t too hard to graft onto our currently fractious political climate. Moreso than The Winter Soldier, Civil War is quite intent on critiquing the idea of the government as the best repository of power, although the viewpoint espoused by Captain America—that it should be wielded without constraint by individuals with the best intentions (read: superheroes)—is scary in its own right because it opens the door for fascists and demagogues. The Winter Soldier himself is perhaps the best example of what happens when superheroes are controlled by authoritarian bodies, which is why his preservation is so key to Cap’s ideological struggle. Bucky must be redeemed somehow by returning his individual agency. In the right/left struggle of superheroic politics, Civil War is probably best seen as truly libertarian, pushing individual morality as superior to the collective. Of course, reading too much allegory into the action poses its own dangers, both in terms of symbolic overreaching and bleeding out the fun, and if Civil War works politically, it is as a broad metaphor for the nature of government, power, and that ever elusive concept of freedom that sounds so pure, but really requires endless compromise to attain.

"May 9, 2016",NEGATIVE," Timorous, paunchy, and pale, with a sad mustache and a pair of rimless glasses, David (Colin Farrell) checks into a rural hotel. He expects to remain for forty-five days, and, like the other guests—all of whom, male and female, are unattached—he must use the time to procure a suitable mate. Anyone who flunks that task will suffer an unusual penalty. As the hotel manager (Olivia Colman) says to David, “The fact that you’ll turn into an animal if you fail to fall in love with someone during your stay here is not something that should upset you or get you down. Just think, as an animal you’ll have a second chance to find a companion.” She advises him that, if transfigured, he should limit his choice of sweetheart to the same species. “A wolf and a penguin could never live together, nor could a camel and a hippopotamus,” she says. After a moment, she adds, “That would be absurd.” As if everything else she has mentioned is utterly normal. Only a film with a tenacious grasp of absurdity would allow such talk, and “The Lobster,” the first English-language feature by the Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos, fits the bill. Tranquil in manner yet brisk in momentum, it lays out the foreground of the story without pausing to fill in the backdrop; clue by clue, we have to work it out for ourselves. The underlying tenet of society, we come to understand, is that people are forbidden to be single. Parts of the film are set in a city, where we see that principle in action. A woman on her own in a mall is stopped by security guards, who demand, politely but firmly, to know the whereabouts of her husband; she explains that he is away on a business trip. Another solo shopper is asked to produce his “certificate,” in order to prove that he has a spouse. David is a wretched case. (The casting of Farrell, who played Alexander the Great for Oliver Stone, is a subtle joke in itself.) His wife has recently left him, and so he is sent to the hotel; no one must be alone for long. With him he takes a Border collie—a loyal pal, and no wonder, for it is in fact his brother, who presumably tried and failed to find a partner of his own. (Most such failures, according to the manager, elect to become dogs. “That is why the world is full of dogs,” she says.) One pleasure of “The Lobster,” all the more striking for going unremarked, is the array of passing creatures: a flamingo stalks by, providing a splash of pink amid the earth tones of the landscape; and an Irish guest with long blond hair appears outside the hotel, after an unsuccessful stay, as a Shetland pony. So strong is the conceit behind “The Lobster” that only gradually do you realize how much plot is being packed in. Things begin to stir as David and the other residents, armed with tranquillizer guns, are forced to go hunting. The prey is not beasts but loners: single folk who have gone rogue in the woods and need to be culled. (The chase is shot in slow motion, to extraordinary effect.) Loners willingly follow their own code of conduct, which is every bit as severe as that which prevails at the hotel. They may fraternize, or dance without touching, but that is all: two of them wear surgical dressings on their lips, having been caught in an embrace and punished with something called “the red kiss.” David now absconds to join the loners, and falls in love with one of them (Rachel Weisz). The irony could not be more acrid: our hero, unable to lose his heart at the hotel, then loses it in the one place where the loss is considered a crime. Only in the city, where David and the woman evade suspicion by pretending to be a couple, do we see them share a writhing smooch, and even then they are told not to overdo it. Wherever you go, Lanthimos implies, the laws entrap you. That is a serious charge, and, for all the pranks that he plays on our assumptions, Lanthimos is full of grave intent. No art, for a filmmaker as for a novelist, is finer or harder than that of keeping a straight face as you hold the world up to scorn. Swift managed it, and so did Buñuel, but few current directors, apart from Lanthimos and Todd Solondz, make the effort. What is more, there’s nothing paltry or cheap about the targets that Lanthimos picks. “Dogtooth” (2009), his breakout movie, sought to dismantle the family unit; “Alps” (2011) took on death, no less, and the culture of grief, with characters being hired to impersonate the deceased for the sake of the mourners; and now we have “The Lobster,” which snaps at love. You could easily claim that the film confines its ridicule to the Tinderized—to those who are offered such elaborate assistance in the speed and the precision of their wooing that they are left with no excuse for being alone. The script, by Lanthimos and Efthymis Filippou, certainly sports with the notion of the perfect match. At the hotel, everyone owns up to a defining flaw. Robert (John C. Reilly) has a lisp, for example, and John (Ben Whishaw) has a limp. So desperate is John to stay human that, having met a woman who gets nosebleeds, he keeps banging his own schnozzle to draw blood, and thus to dupe her into accepting him as her equal. As for David, he is moved to discover that the woman in the woods, like him, is nearsighted. Why should they not peer into the future together? All this is neatly done, and Whishaw, in particular, is frighteningly dry, yet “The Lobster” is more than a satire on the dating game. It digs deeper, needling at the status of our most tender emotions. Even when David and his fellow-myopic are revealed to be kindred spirits, that kinship affords them little joy. Not once do they seem happy, and I fear that Lanthimos regards romantic bliss, like domestic harmony, as yet another illusion to be pricked. Hence the stern voice-over supplied by Weisz, sounding like a school principal. Hence, too, the soundtrack—mostly jagged snatches of string music by Beethoven, Shostakovich, Schnittke, and others, scraping away any patches of contentment. One image, of four loners walking down a country road, clad in suits, recalls the similar strollers who crop up in Buñuel’s “Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie” (1972), yet Lanthimos lacks the master’s blithe awareness that, in the matter of tone, the savage can cohabit with the suave. Although few films this year will make the kind of impression that “The Lobster” does, it remains grim fare, spiky and unconsoling, and, where there are laughs, they die at the back of the throat. To anyone planning to see this movie on a date: good luck. How do you define the Avengers? Two phrases from “Captain America: Civil War” offer alternative answers. One is “a lot of superpeople.” The other is “a group of U.S.-based enhanced individuals,” which for one heavenly moment suggests that, since we last met Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.) and his merry mates, they have put on weight. Imagine a wobbly Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and a lumbering Falcon (Anthony Mackie), with Captain America (Chris Evans), the incredible chunk, bringing up the rear. Alas, the whole gang is in good shape, although they are having issues with their bonding. The big news, delivered by the Secretary of State (William Hurt), is that Avenging, hitherto a privately run concern, will now be controlled by the U.N. under the “Sokovia Accords,” named for the location of a previous adventure. (Why do made-up countries always sound like somewhere ruled by Groucho Marx?) Iron Man likes the idea, whereas Captain America hates it. You could parse their clash as a grownup debate on the politics of governance, but it’s really not. It’s an excuse for the two of them to duke it out on a German airfield, each with a bunch of friends at his behest. Even Spider-Man (Tom Holland) and Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) get roped in, with mixed results. Both are nicely played, and they leaven the mood (a tiny Rudd gets to hop inside Downey’s metal costume, like a flea), yet their very presence smacks of desperation. The motto of the directors, Anthony and Joe Russo, appears to be: If you can make it happen, do it. Don’t hold back.

"May 8, 2016",POSITIVE," The latest Marvel movie hits theaters nationwide today but have critics tired of this ongoing franchise? We’ve looked over the Captain America: Civil War reviews and we’ve found a mix of both views. This latest installment focuses on the growing animosity between Robert Downey Jr.’s Iron Man and Chris Evan’s Captain America and the film co-stars Paul Rudd, dosage  Tom Holland and Scarlett Johansson. In the meantime though, check out a few of the must-read Captain America: Civil War reviews below (and make sure you check out our own review here). Kurt Loder, Reason.com: “Civil War is just another stop on Marvel’s march toward world super-flick domination, and stand-alone movies featuring Spider-Man, Thor, Ant-Man and Black Panther are already in the pipeline. Exhausted skeptics might wonder where it all will end.” Check out the full review here. Joe Morgenstern, Wall Street Journal: “Marvel’s new “Captain America” is anything but bleak—what’s so audacious about the film, and so pleasing, is its quicksilver mix of hardcore action and bright comedy.” Check out the full review here. Leonard Maltin, IndieWire.com: “Bigger isn’t always better, and this film is bursting at the seams…But I found it more frustrating than entertaining.”Check out the full review here. Matt Zoller Seitz, RogerEbert.com: “[T]he Russos’ deft switching between slapstick and melodrama, the surprising outcomes of key storylines, and the strength of the central performances go a long way towards overcoming nitpicks.” Check out the full review here. Nell Minow Beliefnet.com: “I don’t want to give away too much, so I’ll just say the action is everything you’d hope, with superhero-on-superhero collisions beyond the dreams of fanboy heaven.” Check out the full review here. Josh Larsen, LarsenonFilm.com: “The fact that a film this big is even asking such questions — and offering a variety of perspectives in place of propaganda — makes it an especially significant piece of popular culture.” Check out the full review here. Brian Lowry, CNN.com: “Simply put, when it comes to juggling multiple superheroes in a single movie, Marvel’s latest comes close to setting the standard.” Check out the full review here. Richard Roeper, Chicago Sun Times: “Forget the calendar and the spring cold. “Captain America: Civil War” is a classic example of what the big-ticket summer movie experience is all about.”Check out the full review here. Brian Truitt, USAToday.com: “Under the direction of Winter Soldier’s Anthony and Joe Russo, Civil War is the most epic Avengers movie so far, even though it’s not an Avengers movie.” Check out the full review here. Ann Hornaday, WashingtonPost.com: “As enjoyable as it is, “Civil War” often teeters on the brink of sheer overkill. As viewers approach the film’s second hour, they could be forgiven for wondering just how much more carnage, chaos and character-establishing they can take.” Check out the full review here.

In many superhero movies (see Man of Steel, sovaldi The Avengers or The Avengers: Age of Ultron), try
  there’s a climactic action-packed sequence where the heroes vanquish the villains, cities get ripped apart and then the heroes go back to their normal lives as if nothing had happened. Just another day for them. Instead of averting that difficult subject as superhero movies have often done in the past, Captain America: Civil War magnifies it and offers a thoughtful debate about the consequences of such destruction. This third chapter in the Captain America series begins with more mayhem and destruction and a simple mistake made by one of the heroes leads to tragedy. Shortly thereafter, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) — a hero who dared to take off his mask and reveal his true identity to the masses — comes face to face with another revelation: many innocent people have died in the wake of such mayhem. Miriam (Alfre Woodard), a mother who lost her son during an Avengers battle, confronts Stark. “You think you fight for us,” she says, “You just fight for yourself.” Such scenes set the stage for a civil war that pits the repentant Stark against the idealistic Captain America (Chris Evans). More specifically, Stark wants to agree to a UN mandate that would put the Avengers under the supervision of a special committee. Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), War Machine (Don Cheadle) and the Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) agree while Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and the Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) argue that the group shouldn’t have to consult a committee to save the world. The screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely takes its time setting the stage for the showdown to come. It allows these characters an opportunity to debate the UN resolution and voice their own distinctive opinions. As the title character, Captain America leads the battle against bureaucracy noting that “If we sign this, we’re surrendering our right to choose.” In addition to the thoughtful plot, there’s also a renewed sense of excitement here as Spider-Man joins the team. Tom Holland, who did such amazing work in The Impossible, only has a few scenes here but he makes the most of his screen time by reminding viewers of this franchise’s continued excitement. “This was awesome,” Spidey shouts after a climactic battle sequence. It sure was. Although some of the first action sequences aren’t that spectacular, the latter ones are truly superb with the Russo brothers crafting an intense but intricate fight sequence that finds some of these grand superheroes fighting against each other. It’s a truly impressing scene where the intense action is matched with the great comedy that has been such a hallmark of this series. A late airport sequence shows a large scale battle that is only later matched by a climactic personal battle between Iron Man and Captain America. Unlike Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, which discussed some of the consequences of massive destruction only to feature a large-scale special effects-laden climax, this movie follows through on its message. The final battle is small in scope but emotionally-driven and thrilling. Daniel Bruhl does a solid job here as Zemo, a villain who has suffered the consequences of the Avenger’s actions but this film is about much more one destructive man. It’s about big ideas and that’s what makes this movie stand out."

"May 7, 2016",POSITIVE," 
The 
		casualty count and collateral damage wrought in the years since Tony 
		Stark first outed himself as Iron Man is high.  Enough havoc hath been 
		wrought to unite the terrified global populace, who are looking for 
		someone to save the world from its very saviours.  After the Avengers 
		adventures across New York City, Lagos and Eastern Europe saw 
		devastation on a massive scale, the worlds less powerful, but far more 
		multitudinous non-super-powered humans demand some control and 
		accountability over those outside that category.  To that end, the 
		United Nations has handed down a take-it-or-else proposal to muzzle the 
		heroes and make them answerable to the organisation, who will decide 
		when and where the Avengers will be deployed in times of crisis.  The 
		feelings and discoveries of the recent past puts the team at opposite 
		poles as to whether to sign the agreement.  Their lack of unity could 
		not come at a worse time as their super-powered bickering plays right 
		into the hands of a new foe with a personal axe to grind against Earth's 
		Mightiest Heroes. After 
		yet another mission against a bad guy causes destruction, this time in 
		the wealthy African nation of Wakanda, news clips of the previous 
		Avengers, Captain America and Iron Man films remind us how very 
		dangerous it is to simply be in the general proximity of these 
		self-regulating super beings.  The culpability question has been dangled 
		since the first Iron Man film in 2008, but with black ops organisation 
		S.H.I.E.L.D and its Machiavellian, yet honourable Nick Fury acting as 
		the Avengers monitor of a sort, the heroes had at least some kind of 
		check and outward conscience.  When it was revealed in Captain America: 
		The Winter Soldier, that S.H.I.E.L.D was absolutely riddled with 
		corruption by enemy organisation, Hydra, who Steve Rogers had been 
		fighting when he took his 70-year iceberg nap, the ultimate soldiers 
		faith in the Powers That Be was shattered.  Handing the keys of the 
		powerful weapon known as the Avengers to yet another organisation of a 
		bunch of men and women with their own agendas, quite logically, rubs Cap 
		the wrong way.  On 
		Starks side are his BFF, War Machine, who never saw a military order he 
		didnt obey, Black Widow, and Starks own creation, Vision.  There are a 
		couple of new recruits; including the Black Panther, alter-ego of 
		TChalla, the noble prince of Wakanda.  TChalla witnessed his father 
		killed by someone he is convinced was the Winter Soldier, or Caps best 
		bud, Bucky Barnes (Still struggling a bit with the whole brainwashed 
		assassin thing), and theres also this skinny kid from Queens. On 
		Captain Americas Cant Nobody Hold Us Down squad are Scarlet Witch, the 
		not-quite-retired Hawkeye, and a guy from the West Coast with the power 
		to get really small sometimes.  The mastermind behind the heroes 
		strife fans the flames and uses the characters pasts and their very 
		friendship as weapons in his plot to eliminate the Avengers completely. The 
		big question posed in Captain America: Civil War is Team Cap or Team 
		Stark?  I vote Team Magneto.  Yeah, I know its another franchise, but 
		Erik Lehnsherrs logic is sound:  They are superior beings, why should 
		they bow to the wills of those weaker and fearful of them?  The most 
		nagging of several problems I had with the premise of the film is that 
		all is poised to blame the Avengers solely for all the disasters that 
		have befallen earth.  While its true that Ultron was Tony Starks baby, 
		one of the television clips from the first Avengers movie shows the 
		giant metal alien whale careening across Grand Central Station, escorted 
		by hundreds of warriors from another friggin galaxy.  All luv to our 
		men and women in blue, but did the people of the world expect the NYPD 
		to deal with that?  Sad as it mayve been for those who lost loved ones, 
		Im guessing the body count wouldve been substantially higher had there 
		either been no Avengers, or had they waited until a UN council approved 
		their actions and set the parameters of combat against the alien 
		threat.  Everybody knows bureaucracy works quickly, right?  Its not the 
		Avengers fault the world has gone insane.  No one in this film seems to 
		be considering the lives saved versus the lives lost.  The 
		other thing no one is mentioning loudly enough is the whole revelation 
		of what a dirty deal the trusted S.H.I.E.L.D turned out to be, or how 
		Hydra truly had its tentacles so deeply into everything.  Why should the 
		heroes consider giving yet another faceless entity control over their 
		lead, when theyve seen the only people they can trust is each other?  
		Its hard to fathom that after being so utterly fooled by those he was 
		meant to trust, Tony Stark is so riddled with guilt over The Avengers 
		actions that the rebellious, canny zillionaire is so happy to hand over 
		the reins.  To 
		give leverage to Team Starks position, the apparent terrorism of the 
		fugitive Winter Soldier is thrown in as a plot point, in which everybody 
		- armed with completely questionable evidence - is ready to begin a 
		worldwide manhunt to capture Caps old pal, which of course Mr. Brooklyn 
		1943 cant let happen.  Steve Rogers protection of Bucky Barnes against 
		Starks insistence of handing him over to the authorities, is another 
		nail in the coffin of their friendship.  That nail is dug in even deeper 
		when a revelation of Buckys actual misdeeds while brainwashed come to 
		light.  Still, it feels like so much couldve been worked out through 
		talking (Like maybe Cap telling his friends Bucky didnt do it?), 
		but then that wouldnt have made for a very exciting superhero movie, 
		would it?  And 
		after the first half (and despite it being under the Captain America 
		mantle), that is exactly what it becomes, but sadly, we have to wait 
		for it.  The opening hour of Civil War is unexpectedly dour and snoozy, 
		ladling on thick the heroes global disapproval and super 
		self-recrimination.  The highlight/lowlight of public flagellation was 
		the eye-rollingly cliché aforementioned speech delivered with 
		Oscar-worthy gravitas by Viola Davis, as the lady who blames the Avengers 
		for the loss of her son.  Yes, 
		Im going to talk Spidey.  Hes in the trailer, so no shock to fans.  
		This is the youngest interpretation of Peter Parker weve seen on film, 
		and the first sight of this small kid who cant be more than 15 (Which 
		was apparently Peteys actual age when he got bit - I reckoned he was 
		more like 16-17.), is a little bit jarring after decades of grown 
		men playing the teen from Queens.  The scene between the poor but 
		super-powered kid and the genius rich guy bantering and negotiating his 
		place in Team Stark is worth the price of admission alone.  Spideys 
		first deployment during the big showdown is a joy to behold: Holland 
		captures the kids starstruck awe at fighting alongside and against the 
		heroes hes idolised, while showing himself as a tough and resourceful 
		warrior, spitting out whipsmart wisecracks the whole time. (Disneys 
		self-homage of the webslinger describing this really old movie that 
		turns out to be The Empire Strikes Back is forgivable, but unless Vader 
		is making an appearance in the MCU, lets keep a lid on that corporate 
		cuteness, shall we, Mickey?)  Watching Hollands performance, I 
		couldnt help but think this is the Spider-Man, and more so the Peter 
		Parker that director Marc Webb in his awful recent series tried and 
		failed to give us.  In 
		other franchise improvement news; with several Avengers missing, the 
		Falcon (Having a great show of his amped-up wings and drone 
		capabilities) calls in Ant-Man to bolster Team Caps numbers.  Once 
		again, the results are moments with the character that are sharper, 
		wittier and more exciting than anything from Ant-Mans lacklustre 
		cinematic introduction last year. 
		Theres a flip side to the casting coin: Elizabeth Olsons got the right 
		iron spine as the Scarlet Witch, but always looks as if shes going to 
		cry at any moment.  I am also not a fan of her hexing move, which just 
		looks like shes wiggling her fingers around, waiting for the CGI fill 
		in.  I regret to say that I just dont buy Paul Bettany - who I normally 
		adore in everything - as Vision.  His vocal personification as JARVIS, 
		Tony Starks AI assistant was fine, but that voice, and even more 
		unfortunately, that small-shouldered, unimposing frame (Even in the 
		padded super suit) embodying this omniscient creature with the 
		powers of a god, just made me think of a tweedy English butler wearing a 
		lot of body paint.  Vision was so unremarkable and seemingly unburdened 
		by his otherness, that a critical scene where he realises hes 
		beginning to have feelings for Wanda pretty much slips by.  After 
		a slow start, and yes, a kind of silly premise, the fun and excitement 
		of Captain America: Civil War carries the day.  It sets up great 
		expectations for new chapters in the Marvel movie franchise, and after 
		this epic fracturing of their Avengers friendship, I cant wait to find 
		out where they go from here. "
"May 7, 2016",POSITIVE," Way back in 2012, I was genuinely astonished by the cinematic juggling act that Joss Whedon accomplished in The Avengers. Six heroes pulled from widely different walks of super-life: Who could believe he’d manage to integrate them all into a coherent story? These days, that challenge looks rudimentary. A year ago, Whedon’s The Avengers: Age of Ultron found space to squeeze in three more heroes and a brand-new super-villain, along with another half-dozen characters from the ever-expanding Marvel universe. And now, in Captain America: Civil War—which serves in many respects as a third Avengers movie—we have fully a dozen heroes divvied up into two competing super-teams. At this rate, pretty soon Marvel Studios honcho Kevin Feige will have to rent out a stadium just to accommodate his lycra-clad swarms. Directed by the brothers Joe and Anthony Russo, Civil War is technically a follow-up to their superlative Captain America: Winter Soldier from 2014. But given the ongoing interweavings of the Marvel Cinematic Universe—this movie also integrates last year’s Ant-Man, and serves as a setup for future films with Black Panther and a newly introduced Spider-Man (thank you, Sony!)—such details are becoming incidental. In any case, here, as in Winter Soldier, the Russos have achieved an uncommon balance of plot and action, humor and drama, all of it once again deeply grounded in character. Flash forward to present-day Lagos, where an Avengers squad made up of Captain America (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Falcon (Anthony Mackie), and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) is foiling the theft of a biological weapon. (Blink for a moment, and you’ll miss a brief appearance by Brock Rumlow, a.k.a. Crossbones, as the head thief.) Civilians are injured in the process, however, which leads to the requisite handwringing back at Avengers HQ. “People died,” explains Cap. “It’s on me.” The litany of accumulating havoc is quickly itemized: New York (The Avengers), Washington, D.C. (Winter Soldier), the fictional Eastern European nation of Sokovia (Age of Ultron), and now Lagos—everywhere the Avengers seek to do good, they wind up leaving a trail of destruction. Given this record, the U.S. Secretary of State, Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt, and yes, he does appear to be this Thaddeus Ross), proposes that the Avengers submit to United Nations oversight. Cap immediately balks at the idea, having learned firsthand in Winter Soldier that taking orders from a global security entity can turn out rather badly. But somewhat more surprisingly, Tony Stark (a.k.a. Iron Man, a.k.a. Robert Downey Jr.) thinks that this submission to a higher authority is a good idea. So does his pal James “Rhodey” Rhodes (a.k.a. War Machine, a.k.a. Don Cheadle)—though his comment, “This is the United Nations we’re talking about,” suggests he’s not terribly familiar with the organization’s overall record of efficacy. (Do you really want Vladimir Putin to have veto authority over the Avengers?) And so the lines are drawn: Stark, Rhodey, Black Widow, and the Vision (Paul Bettany) on the side of UN oversight; and Cap, Falcon, and Scarlet Witch against. The former group will eventually add a Wakandan prince in Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and a Queens teenager in Spider-Man (Tom Holland); the latter group will bring in Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Cap’s pal Bucky—by now wanted by law enforcement for a new act of Winter Soldier terrorism—and Ant-Man (Paul Rudd). Need a scorecard yet? If not, you surely will by the time the movie introduces additional characters played by Daniel Brühl, Alfre Woodard, Martin Freeman, Hope Davis, and Marisa Tomei (who may be the least spinster-y version of Peter Parker’s Aunt May ever committed to screen). The ensuing plot—which I’m not fool enough to even attempt to summarize— hopscotches the globe with the mileage-accruing abandon of a Bond flick: Cleveland, London, Vienna, Bucharest, Berlin, each locale announced with towering onscreen type. The heroes duel among themselves now and again, notably in a bravura chase scene with Cap in pursuit of Black Panther, who is himself in pursuit of Bucky. These skirmishes culminate in a titanic six-on-six battle royale between the vying super-squads. The sequence is a stunner, choreographed with wit and verve and featuring the notable introduction of a super-power we had not witnessed before (though one that Marvel aficionados may guess). Key to the scene is that every participant has individual abilities and personality: For once, there are no expendably faceless masses of Chitauri or Ultron-bots or evil S.H.I.E.L.D. agents cluttering things up. Better still is the fact that the Russos (working from a script by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, who also wrote Winter Soldier) stage this mega-battle well before the movie’s conclusion, thus shrewdly allowing themselves a more intimate finale. If there has been a flaw to date in the Marvel films—and superhero movies more broadly—it’s been the need for a Big Finish: an alien invasion, dueling helicarriers, a city launched into the sky. Instead, the Russos bring things back down to a more personal scale, primarily featuring Cap, Bucky, and Iron Man. (It’s worth noting here that as brilliant a gamble as Downey Jr. has long shown himself as the flamboyant Tony Stark, Evans has proven equally crucial for Marvel as the moral-universe-centering Cap.) The picture’s non-Armageddon ending is an especially nice touch given that the initial plot was premised on misgivings about the collateral damage typically associated with super-squabbles. This being Marvel—as opposed to, ahem, DC—the movie is sprinkled with liberal doses of humor: the cyborg Vision attempting, without much success, to cook his first paprikash (“In my defense, I’ve never actually eaten anything before”); a nice callback (“I can do this all day”) to the first Captain America movie; a sly Tony Stark reference to The Manchurian Candidate; a likable moment of outer-borough bonding by fellow New Yorkers Cap and Spidey. Yet for all the action and wit on display, there are mournful undercurrents to Civil War, much as there were to Winter Soldier before it. While the Russos’ prior outing very consciously referenced the paranoid espionage cinema of the 1970s—Three Days of the Condor, The Parallax View, Marathon Man, etc.—Civil War reaches back further still, with echoes of noir throughout, of long-held secrets and past sins that cannot be undone. The result is a movie that, while perhaps not quite reaching the Marvel high points of The Avengers and Winter Soldier, nonetheless belongs in their immediate company. Are there a few too many ingredients crammed into the recipe? No question. But unlike the Vision’s paprikash, the completed dish is nonetheless delicious."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Dull, overlong, exhausting and mildly entertaining without rising to the heights of the first Captain America's palpable thrills, suspense and intrigue"
"May 7, 2016",NEGATIVE,"Cap has not just saved the world, he's saved a comic book universe from complacency by boldly raising the ante on all who dare follow this wonderful, magnificent entertainment."
"May 7, 2016",POSITIVE," It’s Cap vs. Iron Man – and a few others -- in the MCU’s epic new chapter. Read our review of Captain America: Civil War!  The Marvel Cinematic Universe consists of roughly two types of films: most are standalone adventures based around one of the MCU’s central heroes, while every year or two comes an event picture – usually with Avengers in the title – that brings multiple heroes together in a story that ends up (in theory anyway) changing the shape of the MCU and having ramifications that echo through all succeeding films.  The Captain America movies, by virtue of the fact that Steve Rogers is the cornerstone of the Marvel universe both in the comics and on screen, have been a combination of the two. Captain America: Civil War continues that tradition and, frankly, almost perfects it: more than any other Marvel film to date, Civil War juggles a number of different storytelling and character responsibilities successfully, resulting in an epic tale that feels incredibly intimate and puts the loyalties and ethics of the Avengers and others of their ilk to the test. Like many previous Marvel movies, Civil War is only loosely based on the comic book arc of the same name, but it captures the intent and tone of the central struggle while adapting it to the ongoing canon of Marvel’s screen counterparts. Civil War opens with the current Avengers team – Cap, Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Sam Wilson/Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) – tracking down Brock Rumlow/Crossbones (Frank Grillo) in Lagos. In the wake of this, as well as the Avengers’ successful but destructive bouts with Loki, HYDRA and Ultron in New York, Washington and Sokovia respectively, the world’s governments have had enough of superheroes acting unilaterally. And so the team is presented with the Sokovia Accords, a seemingly reasonable but subtly invasive agreement that “enhanced humans” must be kept under close supervision. Cap isn’t feeling it, and neither are several of his teammates; he’s shocked, however, when a guilt-ridden Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) gets behind it. This sets the stage for a widening and dangerous rift between the heroes, complicated further by the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), a.k.a Bucky Barnes, one-time friend of Captain America and now programmed killing machine. As Cap desperately tries to find Bucky in the hope of saving and redeeming him, another interested party, Wakandan leader T’Challa (Chadwick Boseman) gets involved in the pursuit, while a shadowy figure orchestrates some of the proceedings for his own agenda. This all builds to a confrontation between our heroes that no one wants but everyone seems helpless to stop, with Tony bringing a surprise player in the shape of a young New York-based crime fighter known as Spider-Man (Tom Holland). Just reading that back, it’s one hell of a complicated plot, but full credit must go to directors Anthony and Joe Russo and screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely for keeping the action clear, focused and mostly easy to follow (except for a wobble or two in the third act). Civil War is Marvel’s longest movie yet, at just under two and a half hours, but it never drags and it never feels overstuffed, a fate which has befallen earlier Marvel features like Iron Man 2 and Avengers: Age of Ultron. The introductions of both Peter Parker/Spider-Man and T’Challa/Black Panther – Marvel’s most iconic hero and one of its most important, respectively – are especially handled with care. T’Challa has a major role to play in the film, while Spidey’s screen time is more limited, yet neither feels jimmied into the story the way, say, Black Widow did in Iron Man 2. There’s no way to discuss Captain America: Civil War without also bringing up Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Warner Bros.’ attempt at booting up the DC Extended Universe all in one go. Both films feature similar ideas (collateral damage caused by superheroes) and similar attempts to both introduce and carry a large cast of characters. But while BvS shoved everything but the Hall of Justice sink into its story and pushed characters we neither knew well or cared much about through a series of increasingly contrived motions, Civil War takes people we have come to know and love over the course of 12 previous movies and sets them against each other in such a way that we feel the futility and pain of what they’re doing to each other. The clash between Batman and Superman felt like two assholes trying to kill each other for no good reason; when Cap and Iron Man go at it here, we’re watching the collapse of a years-long and often turbulent partnership that neither really wants to happen, and it’s tragic. The genius of this movie too is that while the standard impulse is to go bigger, usually resulting in a climax involving buildings falling and so forth, Captain America: Civil War doesn’t fall into that trap (the less said about BvS’s mess of an ending, the better). Following a much-hyped and massive superhero blowout battle, the Russos and Markus/McFeely know better than to top that. The third act of Civil War makes things smaller and more personal, but the emotional stakes are higher. The only problem is a lack of clarity about some of the machinations that get the players into position – the only time that the story feels like it’s clanking a bit – and a somewhat disappointing revelation involving one of said players. Other than that, Civil War should easily take its place among the top rank of MCU movies. The cast all bring their A-games, and the screenplay gives everyone something to do. No one ends up in the same place they started. Chris Evans once again embodies Cap to perfection, while Downey ups his emotional involvement this time out and presents Tony as truly torn over his choices. As for the new members, Boseman is a knockout as T’Challa and seems completely comfortable and confident in both the character and the (excellent) suit. You can’t take your eyes off him whenever he’s onscreen. And then there’s Spider-Man: Holland is the youngest iteration yet, finally giving the character the teen charm that Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield – through no fault of their own – could not provide, and his arrival here bodes well for the character’s future. His webwork – slinging and swinging – is also perhaps the best it’s ever looked on screen, with Marvel taking extra care to get it right. Speaking of which, that final battle scene is a comic fan’s dream come true, a battle royale lifted right out of 50-plus years of Marvel comics that is truly a jaw-dropping high point for the MCU and its creative teams. The action that comes before it doesn’t slouch either: the opening Crossbones sequence is a stunner, as is the highway underpass chase involving the Panther, Bucky, Cap and others. The Russos still occasionally shake the camera too much, but their style of action and violence continues to hit hard and feels both real and bruising, adding another level of pain to the film’s central conflict. That’s really what makes Captain America: Civil War – and so many of the MCU films – so powerful: we feel the pain of these characters even as we watch them perform extraordinary feats. This is no band of morose, gloomy, reluctant good guys, by the way – there’s plenty of humor in the movie as well – but that doesn’t mean they don’t have doubts or get hurt even as they perform their duties without question or hesitation. These are real characters, not empty action figures, and they’re the reason the MCU has gone from success to success while other superhero franchises have stumbled or stalled. There are some large-scale changes and challenges coming to the MCU, but it’s always been personal for these people, and it will hopefully continue to be. P.S. At the press screening, we were afforded a look at one bonus sequence midway through the credits. But I understand that you should, of course, stay through the very end."
"May 7, 2016",POSITIVE," CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR asks the cinematic question “What would happen if we took a whole passel of superheroes from the Marvel Comic universe and tossed them together into one film?”  But wait, what if we pitted them against one another over a fundamental difference of opinion about ethics, and then added a dash (or more) of guilt and anguish over accountability when it comes to the massive collateral damage incurred when saving the world? What would we get?  In this case, a rip-snorting action adventure with a clever plot that appeals to both the fan-boy and fan-girl, as well as an intelligent consideration of the uses and responsibilities of power. Indeed, if there is a flaw, it’s that at times it plays like two different films, the mood shifting for swaths of time from pratfalls and punchlines, to gritty suspense. Yet the shifts never become an insurmountably contradictory jumble, which is a neat trick in and of itself. Captain America (Chris Evans) has his name in the title, but the film is an ensemble piece featuring many of the Avengers we’ve come to know and love, including Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr), Natasha Romanoff/ Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Sam Wilson/Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), Vision (Paul Bettany), and James Rhodes/War Machine (Don Cheadle) all facing the aftermath of their exploits in Sokovia from AGE OF ULTRON.  The price of saving the world that time was collapsed buildings and civilian deaths. Their latest mission, the one in Lagos that starts the film with a bang, also incurs property damage and civilian deaths on a lesser scale, but the pattern of destruction is such that the world has become nervous about these enhanced beings operating with no supervision. Hence the Sokovia Accords, drawn up by 117 very uneasy countries and administered through the United Nations. Hence, too, the rift among the Avengers, some who don’t want to ask permission to act, and others who see signing the Accords as a way to earn back the world’s trust, and also coping with their sense of guilt. Lacking the empirical evidence to convince each other who is right, Captain America retires from the public arena, taking Falcon with him. Cap’s old pal from World War II, The Winter Soldier, aka Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), aka the silver-armed puppet of subliminal programming, begins to wreak havoc. Rather than let the authorities kill him, Cap and Falcon take matters into their own hands, setting up the eponymous Civil War, and introducing us to an intriguingly amoral rogue agent without portfolio (Daniel Brühl), and his stalwart mirror-image, T’Challa / Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), who does the wrong things for what he is convinced are the right reasons. Thus amid the special effects extravaganza, issues of loyalty, duty, rigid ideologies, and the thirst for vengeance become the driving force for everything that ensues. The assorted mayhem of big explosions, epic chases, and various vehicles crashing with flaming abandon is window dressing for the real fireworks. That would be the inner conflicts that leave psychic wounds far more damaging than mere lacerations, bruises and broken bones. Downey gives another emotionally compelling performance, grounding, as do the others’ performances, the hyperbolic fantasy elements into something palpably human. A scene with Stark being confronted by the mother (a devastating Alfre Woodard) of a dead son killed in Sokovia is as shattering to us as it is to Stark thanks to Downey’s ability to convey his character’s own vulnerability beneath the swagger and the barbed quips and bon mots. There’s also an unexpected sweetness to the budding relationship between the android Vision and guilt-scarred Scarlet Witch, as he tries to lift her spirits with home cooking and a discourse on the pitfalls of the amygdala. CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR has the courtesy to bring up the missing Avengers (Hulk and Thor) and to do it in such a way that it becomes a minor but satisfying plot point. Ditto the absence of Tony’s true love, Pepper Potts. Sure, we miss (most) of them, but this is such a slick and smart flick, it’s not a problem.  Rife with plot twists, surprise guest superheroes, and superb pacing that leaves us breathless, but never winded, it’s also more than just exceptionally good looking, charismatic people killing time between action sequences. It fearlessly and lucidly addresses complicated social issues and makes them an integral part of the whiz-bang action."
"May 7, 2016",POSITIVE," Responding to public protests after an alarming amount of casualties…a.k.a. collateral damage…caused by their derring-do, Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) proposes the Sokovia Accords, which would limit the vigilantes’ autonomy under international law. Captain America/Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) opposes this threat to their independence, joined by his buddy Falcon (Anthony Mackie), plus Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen). Somewhat surprisingly, Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) accedes to Ross’ proposal, along with Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), War Machine (Don Cheadle), Vision (Paul Bettany) and a newcomer, African Prince T’Challa (Chadwich Boseman)…a.k.a. Black Panther, who will get his own feature film. The star of their team turns out to be Stark’s youngest recruit, an eager-to-please, adolescent Spider-Man (newcomer Tom Holland) from Queens, who dazzles with an “Empire Strikes Back” maneuver during a climactic clash at an airport. And if you didn’t see “Captain America: First Avenger” & “Winter Soldier,” you won’t appreciate the pivotal backstory between Steve Rogers and his W.W.II buddy James “Bucky” Barnes (Sebastian Stan). Laboriously scripted by Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely and directed by Anthony & Joe Russo (“Captain America: The Winter Soldier”), it’s obviously a sobering commentary on repercussions from the carnage accidentally inflicted by the U.S. in the Middle East. But it’s repetitive, crammed with far too much of everything, including cameos by Alfre Woodard, Hope Davis, Marisa Tomei and cartoonist Stan Lee. Absentees include Thor and the Hulk. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, “Captain America: Civil War” is an over-stuffed 7. It’s a superhero slog as the Marvel Cinematic Universe marches on."
"May 7, 2016",NEUTRAL," Remember “all-dressed” potato chips? They were the fairy tale ending for MSG: A starchy vehicle for every brand of artificial flavoring cooked up in the lab: barbeque, salt, vinegar, ketchup, dill pickle, cheddar… whatever. They were designed to please every taste bud, every sinful salty-greasy hankering, but in the end, they just tasted like sodium and chemicals – a salt bomb guaranteed to turn your mouth into the Atacama while dyeing your fingers a deep orange. The central problem was a surfeit of competition for your tastebud’s attention: Bombarded by every kind of scientifically designed flavor crystal, there’s too much going on to really process, resulting in a generic salt fix. Captain America: Civil War is the movie equivalent of the all-dressed potato chip: A junk food classic that can’t be denied, but can never truly satisfy our desire for something original. Returning Captain America writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely reteam with directors Anthony and Joe Russo to throw every beloved and familiar flavor in the bag, beginning with Steve Rogers – aka Captain America. Perhaps the most emotionally engaging of all the superheroes in the Avengers stable, Captain America was a beanpole weakling who was transformed into a super-fighter by the U.S. military. His origin story, Captain America (The First Avenger, 2011), remains one of the best superhero movies in the comic book canon because it not only gave us a relatable character who transformed in every way imaginable, it had the ability to focus. This Captain America suffers from bad case of attention deficit disorder, scrambling around from one plotline to the next in a rabid bid to entertain the masses while keeping the fanboys flipping through their Comicon Codex, ensuring the laws of the Marvel universe remain intact. And maybe the fanboys are part of the problem. Maybe studios are so eager to please the card-carrying fanbase for their franchise movies, they’re reluctant to switch it up – or even create a new running gag for each character. Captain America: Civil War reunites most of the past players and introduces a few new faces, including yet another Spider-Man (played by Tom Holland) and some cat named Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman). It would take another five hundred words to explain the plot and the reasons why Spidey and Black Panther appear, but as the title suggests, this is a movie where the war is fought from within. The Avengers are put under the supervision of the United Nations to prevent any abuse of their superpowers, but not everyone in spandex and silicon can agree to the terms. Ironically, the normally rebellious Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) is the one who feels they should fall into line and obey the elected officials, while the typically loyal Boy Scout they call Captain America feels they should remain autonomous. The remaining Avengers pick sides, and while this could have been a gusher of dramatic material that chiseled out the political metaphors of patriotism-v-statelessness, obedience-v-free will, superpowers versus banal human evil, nothing comes of it except massive battle sequences that are close to impossible to follow, and fail to feed any suspense. At this point, even the particular nature of each superhero’s power feels blurry, with Captain America capable of something close to flight and everyone else proving bulletproof. The fight scenes have no suspense, and even the reappearance of Bucky, the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) who was once Cap’s best friend, feels forced and entirely without feeling. The best line belongs to Vision (Paul Bettany), who points out his own limited understanding of the whole chaotic situation when he points to the gem in his skull and says something like “I have no idea what this does.” At that point, the godlike cyborg becomes the most relatable character in the movie because we’re in a similar position: a jewel of a comic book franchise is lodged in our brains, but we’re starting to question its purpose. is this s prediction of what is to come south of our border? Civil War? They all have guns and there are extremists on foot. Are we ready here? We may not all have spandex suits and cannot all fly? but we may well be in for a bad time south of our border with extremists. Doofus Donald and his boorish behaviour. No policies just yelling insults and mistruths. How low can America sink. DOOFUS DONALD…. DOOFUS DONALD….. WITH THE ORANGE PUGLY FACE. So glad somebody realizes how unoriginal and flat this movie is. It’s just like you described – though I myself call it “A plastic, tinsel and light barage of color with no depth beyond one single solitary idea : people get sad when someone they love dies (specifically – and in order : A mysterious woman in the hallway, Steve Rogers / Captain America, T’Chala / Black Panther, Baron Zemo, and Tony Stark / Iron Man). “. The action is nauseating. I mean seriously nauseating. I watched it in 3d which was a terrible mistake (and I LOVE 3d movies). The post film stereo  conversion was so choppy that I had to take my glasses off multiple times during the movie just to get a sense of what was going on. Only by around the 1:45:00 mark was my brain finally adjusting to the chaos my eyes were seeing in the action sequences. All-in-all I know my kids will love it (but I’m taking them to the 2D version, dammit.) because it’s everything THEY want – mindless, shimmering, thoughtless, weightless pseudo conflict with an oh-so-common Marvel Brand “happy ending”. I’m so sick of this sh*t. When an article is wildly off base, lacking any substantiation for their larger assertions and arguments. The film is actually solid in its potrayal of the costs if being a hero, a mature topic yet to be actually displayed or fleshed out. And this film actually does it quite well, in an emotional and mature way. We also witness and experience acting that is top level, with character moments that exceed the heights of previous films in the superhero genre. What this critic fails to do is to penetrate the surface of the film, and instead gives us a shallow and pedantic review whose sole qualm is that nothing is original. Well, that could be said of all genres of film, since many films copy tropes or themes. What a film should do, first is have a novel approach. Secondly, it should entertain and amuse. And if it’s an adaptation, it must have a reveranse or be faithful to the source material. And the film handles all these elements masterfully, with precision and accuracy. If this review was worth a piss, it would actually be objective and unbiased. As a film this is no Godfather, in our modern era of film, it is far more adept at presenting an action/sci fi flick that has depth and meaning. Yes, I agree with you. The movie felt confusing and lacked focus. The first captain America movie was a true gem. I found the third to be the weakest of them so far. With all due respect sir, I could not disagree more with your assessment of this movie. I will go ahead and out myself as a card-carrying comic book fanboy. Having said that, I disagree with your comment that this film suffers from too much fan service. If you examine the original source material, you would find that the Russo Brothers departed significantly from the plot points of the original comic in many ways that do not detract from the film and even improved upon the original story. With respect to your second point that the movie has too many plot lines, I must also respectfully disagree. Not sure if you and I were watching the same movie, but the movie I saw was following a very basic plot, a conflict of ideologies.  Iron Man is arguing the point that power must be held in check, where is Captain America is arguing that some moral choices must be made outside of hierarchical structures of government. I’ll grant you there are several characters in this movie, but each of them furthers the plot by representing the different points of view on this conflict. Lastly, I would challenge your assertion that this movie is unoriginal. In an age where superhero beat-em up movies with the cliched good versus evil plot are plentiful, I think it’s rather unique to see a movie that addresses a true moral dilemma, one that is so relevant in an age where we are constantly having to evaluate the price of our security. But of course that’s just one man’s opinion.. Would mind answering two questions?   Could it be that this genre of film is just not your cup of tea?  If so, no problem.  You like what you like and no one can fault you for that.  I’m curious if you have liked any of the recent superhero films.  Thanks. It’s because I love comic book movies that this was such a disappointment. Check out my review of Deadpool. FOUR STARS… because it was well-written, focused on character development and didn’t condense everything into a tagline. wow you spent the first 100 words of your review talking about an all-dressed potato chip, something no one remembers. Is that the best comparison you could come up with? It’s like we didn’t watch the same film. Or perhaps, as you seem to suggest, there is simply too much going on. But only for you. The average moviegoer is perfectly capable of parsing the chaotic action, because the Russo Brothers have done an excellent job of making each clash both intelligible and emotionally impactful. Even the most chaotic seqence, the airport fight, does not devolve into meaningless action. Again, it seems that we have watched different films. That, or you are simply a lazy moviegoer. Ok then, let’s see what you think is better than Marvel’s latest offering, just to put it in perspective: Sex Tape (17% RT) you gave that a 3.5; Freebirds (18% RT) you gave that 3.5 as well; The Host (8% RT) you gave 3 to; as you did Hitman: Agent 47(8% RT); Rock the Kasbah (8% RT)  & The Day the Earth Stood Still (21% RT). The Host, Sex Tape? clearly you’re wrong and won’t admit it – stop going to movies you don’t like just so you can give them a shitty review – or to painfully squeeze one of your poorly thought out analogies (Your ‘All-Dressed Chips’ is a short, ugly, red-headed stepson to  George Kostanza’s ‘Jerkstore’). You spent more words explaining your tortured potato chip analogy than putting together a coherent argument to support your opinion. In your pre-determined zeal to hate this movie, it appears that you missed the smart subplot and political commentary. This newest Marvel addition does, in fact, “mix it up.” When is the last time a blockbuster movie so deftly delineated the exact issues that have plagued U.S. foreign policy going back at least as far as WWII? It’s not the best movie of the year- not even the best Marvel movie. But CA:CW at least had more substance than your review. You know, when you find yourself in such a small minority, even among your own peers, perhaps you simply have it wrong.  While you’re certainly entitled to your opinion, you might want to try to remain at least factually correct.  In what way does the movie scramble “around from one plotline to the next” as you put it?  This was one of the most focused of the Marvel stories to date, focusing solely on the plotline of supervision and accountability vs. freedom.  Really, the only subplot was directly tied into the primary one as the impetus which brought about the conflict in the first place. Oh my! What a terrible critic of criticism you are! And so rude! C U Next Tuesday…Michelle. Wow… that doesn’t even feel good. You must be very unhappy. “C U Next Tuesday… Michelle” The hell? You dumb or some shit? I’m just saying, you’re a horrible reviewer who uses terrible analogies. Potato chips? Really? Oh! My. You are so so unhappy. PS. Now I see the problem. I should have explained what potato chips are. They are a snack food made from potatoes, deep fried in oil, and covered in things that have been scientifically designed to make you want more. And I love them. This review would be appropriate if this was Batman vs Superman– that was a case of ADD. Hard to take you seriously when you think the first movie of this series was the best one, when the 2nd one, winter soldier was the superior movie. The first movie had the overused cliches and usual tropes of cinema that you attribute to Civil War Most of the Marvel movies have succeeded because the audience is able to connect emotionally with the characters. Hard to take you seriously when you have nothing to support your argument except your inability to follow the plot points of the movie. Civil War is a culmination of the internal conflict and tensions developed from the other movies in the Marvel universe movies. If you havent seen the relevant movies since the release of the first Captain America, its understandable that you’d be lost. Seriously, you trash comic book fans, trash the introductions of new characters, make fun of the fictional characters for being fictional, and come up with the stupidest analogy for the film. What business do you have critiquing this movie if you’re already against it from the start. All I can say is good job, you got me clicking to this garbage review, but it will be the last one that’s for sure. I happen to personally disagree with the low score you assigned, but you have a ton of really well constructed points. Just can’t understand Hit Man getting a better score than Civil War. The Marvell fan boys use the same arguments the dc fan boys did for BvS. Literally. “You don’t understand the film,” “don’t review what you don’t like,” “it’s a conspiracy.” Seriously thick group shift happening here. I like movies that are good – I wish BvS was good, but it simply wasn’t (28%RT); I liked what Nolan did, hated what Snyder has done – conversely, CA:CW  is at 90% on RT & yet Monk gave it the exact same rating of 2.5/5. Did you see either movies OldBob? Please stop trying to sound intelligent by using big words, ’cause you sound like a fucking retard, and this review is the biggest pile of shit I’ve ever seen, you point out no suspense in fights when we all wonder whether War Machine is dead, you say that Bucky was forced and emotionless while he is one of the most dramatic characters in the film who is one of the most fucked up. Captain America isn’t close to flight,and “some cat” is the Black Panther who is one of the Avengers in the original comic books, everyone that is bulletproof is Vision, War Machine, and Iron Man. There was plenty of suspense. This also has some of the worst metaphors and figures of speech I’ve ever read in my life. Also this is not just to make the fan boys happy. Everyone that I know that has seen this movie say it is the best movie they’ve seen in a long time, if you want to go hate on a movie, then go do one on Batman v. Superman which is fucking garbage compared to this movie. And this movie is based on an actual comic you fuck, and it has basically the same plot, and they’re sticking to the original, because it would be fucking terrible if they didn’t. This concludes my reply to your review, now go fuck yourself. I’m thoroughly confused as to how you saw this movie. It hasn’t come out on DVD yet so how could you have seen it in the kitchen? Can I speak to your husband? I’m sure he’d want to hear about this. Katherine – maybe someone who doesn’t like comic book movies shouldn’t review comic book movies ya? Your POV is out of touch with the target audience who overwhelmingly found this latest Marvel addition exceedingly joyful and entertaining. You say this story is unoriginal – how so? The storyline covers new ground as the hero’s split sides which is totally a new approach that we have not seen in Marvel movie versions to date, so totally confused by your view here. It’s almost as if you have no idea what you are talking about at all, just making up words to give a critique which is uninformed and frankly, embarrassing … please stick to movie genre’s you know and can give an honest review of. Lmao! These people defending this mediocre movie is absolutely ludicrous. The fights had no suspense for one; nobody really wanted to hurt anybody, two; half the characters were either talking or cracking forced jokes to make light of a situation that was already light in tone to begin with, three; no major character was gonna die. The Marvel formula is quite insatiable at this point. No real consequences or conclusions to anything. They’ll all be back together, once Infinity Wars rolls around, in some form of unity or another. The big talk about shaking up this universe was just that, talk. Everything felt largely the same after the movie save for more new characters and some people not being friends anymore. That is not exactly earth shattering in my opinion. It just felt like a season finale to a tv show that’ll pick up with its spin off of its spin off of its spin off and people will continually go and watch without the reasoning to see whats really going on. They give you just enough to check off their people pleasing list and leave lesser minded one thinking they have watched some deeply enthralling piece of cinema. Its not. Its just…. ok. Haha defend this mediocre film, fool ‘Civil War’ is over 90% on Rotten Tomatoes and has a 75 score on Meta Critic. It’s far from being a mediocre film among the masses, maybe it is to you but you’re in the minority. The only kind of people who have to defend something is YOU and why you don’t like the film, which you’re entitled to do. It’s just clearly obvious you and I we’re watching a completely different film, as far as i’m concerned ‘Civil War’ is a masterful film in every way. I won’t knock you because you have s….. taste in films and probably wouldn’t know a good one if you we’re slapped in the face with it, but perhaps if you we’re cracked upside your head you would lmao. Some cat named Black Panther? The name is T’Challa who happens to be king/ruler of Wakanda, a brilliant scientist, skilled warrior who’s master several forms of martial arts, skilled strategist, master acrobat and one of the wealthiest and most powerful people in the world. Also Black Panther is the first black super hero from comics created by Stan Lee and the late Jack Kirby in July 1966. Lady do some research before you go throwing stupid ass names out, damn I hate ignorant people and I hate mediocre critics like you even more. @KMOEXPRESS – Oh brother what? Not talking to you and a fair warning, if you don’t want to get burned stay in your place because I got the match and gasoline waiting BROTHER. It’s an expression of exasperation. I should have said “Oh dear.” And yes, I do know who Black Panther is. And I grew up on comics. I love them. And I’ve loved a lot of comic book movies. Just not this one. Please don’t threaten violence. It’s just a movie. I mean no one any harm. I’m sorry if my review offended you. Ps. I loved the new X-Men movie. Of course you did – it’s currently trending at 56% on Rotten Tomatoes, who sums it up like this: Critics Consensus: Overloaded with action in a vain effort to compensate for a lack of genuine excitement, X-Men: Apocalypse is a middling disappointment for the franchise."
"May 7, 2016",POSITIVE,"Above all, it's simply a well-made movie: juggling a staggering number of characters with absolute effortlessness and readily expanding Marvel's collection of heroes without cramming them in."
"May 6, 2016",POSITIVE," Captain America: Civil War is a great superhero blockbuster that lays the groundwork for even bigger and better things to come in Phase 3 of the MCU.  Captain America: Civil War picks up with Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) and the current Avengers team one year after the events of Avengers: Age of Ultron. When a mission in Nigeria goes south, the Avengers are left facing a concerned public that has grown increasingly wary of not only Earth's Mightiest Heroes and the collateral damage they've caused saving the world, but of superheroes and/or super-powered people in general. The Avengers are then approached by former U.S. general-turned Secretary of State Thaddeus 'Thunderbolt' Ross (William Hurt), who reveals that the United Nations have come up with a ""solution"" to this problem: the Sokovia Accords, an agreement that requires the Avengers (and other super-powered individuals) to report to and be monitored by an international governing body.   While certain members of the Avengers (Steve among them) are concerned that conflicting governmental agendas will cause these Accords to impede rather than improve their world-saving efforts, others feel it's a worthwhile compromise - including Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), who supports registration for reasons both practical and personal. However, the Avengers' hand is forced when yet another tragic turn of events occurs and Steve's onetime friend-turned brainwashed HYDRA assassin Bucky 'The Winter Soldier' Barnes (Sebastian Stan) is seemingly responsible. As it becomes clearer that the situation isn't as simple as it first appears, Steve and his closest allies must decide: which side are they truly on?   Although Captain America: Civil War might sound more like Avengers 2.5 than a third Captain America solo movie, in truth the film is closer to being a cross between Iron Man 4 and Captain America 3. Civil War, like the Marvel comic book crossover series (written by Mark Millar and illustrated by Steve McNiven) that it loosely adapts, revolves around superheroes being split over a registration act, with Steven Rogers and Tony Stark leading the opposing sides - so, it's only fitting that Steve and Tony's plot threads take priority here over other characters' storylines. At the same time, Civil War is arguably a better Marvel Cinematic Universe crossover ""event"" than either of the first two Avengers films, when it comes to delivering balanced amounts of standalone plot development, universe-building, and superhero-based spectacle. Civil War thus succeeds at setting the stage for Phase 3 of the MCU to be ""bigger"" and even more fun than Phase 1 and 2 were - even as it leaves room for improvement in upcoming MCU ""event"" movies.   The Civil War narrative is easily the most ambitious story that an MCU film has attempted to tell to date. Civil War screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely - who also wrote the first two Captain America movies - not only tackle very complicated subject matter (the issue of accountability on not just a political level, but also a personal one) but at the same time have to introduce important new characters (more on them later) and carve out room to give the supporting cast enough onscreen development so that they're not just making glorified cameos during this movie. Overall, Civil War does a very good job at carrying out this daunting juggling act - though, in order to do so, it relies on more heavy-handed plot contrivances and less effective story twists/turns compared to those in Captain America: The Winter Soldier before it.   Similar to Winter Solider, Civil War also has trouble delivering a satisfying payoff to the intriguing questions and dilemmas that it presents during its first act; but again like its predecessor, Civil War helps to make up the difference in this respect by serving up compelling character-driven drama/conflict during its third act. Moreover, Civil War features both the smallest-scale and yet emotionally-charged narrative climax out of any MCU installment so far. This is all the more appropriate since, as a whole, Civil War can be summed as part effective superhero action/thriller, but also equal parts, if not more so, engaging dramatic/psychological thriller that features Earth's Mightiest Heroes; though admittedly, while the title might suggest otherwise, Civil War is only really a superhero war movie in a figurative sense.   The Civil War movie doubles as a rich character study for Tony Stark, allowing Robert Downey Jr. the chance to showcase a wide range of emotions in what may be the actor's overall most nuanced and multi-faceted performance as the beloved snarky tech genius yet. By comparison, Steve Rogers' personal arc in Civil War isn't as engaging as the journeys that he's gone on during his previous solo movies - and at times, it almost feels like Steve is getting pushed to the back-seat in his own film, partly because the actual ""ideological conflict"" between Steve and Tony in Civil War is somewhat under-whelming. Chris Evans being more comfortable than ever playing the role of noble Cap, coupled with how Civil War handles Steve's relationship with Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan, who's also solid in his own right), helps make Steve's storyline more impactful - but in the end the MCU version of Civil War is still more interesting as an Iron Man story than a Captain America story.   On the flip side, Markus and McFeely's Civil War screenplay provides several of the supporting characters in the MCU with intriguing - and substantial - subplots; in particular Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision (Paul Bettany), who both get to further explore their powers and limitations alike here, following their debut in Avengers: Age of Ultron. Civil War further benefits from including several fun interactions between the movie's various superhero characters, with the dynamics between Scarlet Witch/Vision and Bucky/Sam Wilson a.k.a. Falcon (Anthony Mackie) among the highlights - while Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow's (Scarlett Johansson) tendency to shift allegiances makes the scenes between her and both Steve/Tony all the more interesting for it. James Rhodes/War Machine (Don Cheadle) has a smaller, but meaningful role to play in the proceedings here by comparison, while Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Scott Lang/Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) are the established MCU players who get the least onscreen development - but Civil War makes up for that by giving these characters some of the best action scenes in the movie.   Speaking of which - with Civil War, directors Anthony and Joe Russo (who also helmed The Winter Soldier) deliver some of the most impressive superhero-based fight scenes and set pieces featured in any Marvel Studios film yet, in terms of both the sheer scale and creativity of the Avenger vs. Avenger battles. The Russos, with assistance from people such as Winter Soldier cinematographer Trent Opaloch as well as second unit directors David Leitch and Chad Stahelski (the longtime stunt coordinators-turned directors of John Wick), serve up several precisely-choreographed action sequences, varying from quick-cutting fisticuffs to exhilarating foot chases and combat situations that make great use of individual superhero's unique abilities. The final result: Civil War's superhero brawls deliver many a moment and ""money shot"" that will thrill both casual moviegoers and hardcore comic book fans, whether the fight in question involves a group brawl or one-on-one (or two-on-one) showdown.   Civil War was also partly filmed with IMAX cameras and the movie in general tends to feel big, visually-speaking, in-between its action sequences and many establishing shots of locations around the globe (as well as the massive title font that's used to identify each individual change in location) - making IMAX the preferable viewing format for Civil War. 3D, however, isn't so much of a necessity; not because 3D detracts from the experience of watching Civil War, but because the movie doesn't make significant use of the stereoscopic format to create either immersive visuals and/or noticeable pop-out imagery.   Boseman, who broke out as an actor with his performances in films like 42 and Get on Up, delivers a strong performance (and even a respectable fictional African accent) in Civil War as T'Challa, a member of Wakanda's royal family whose plot thread is fairly integral to the movie. Spider-Man's story thread, by comparison, feels more shoe-horned in and superfluous, but it's more organic to Civil War's over-arching story than universe-building has been in Marvel films past - and like Boseman, Holland looks to have a promising future ahead of him, with his tenure in the MCU.   There are other faces both familiar (such as Emily VanCamp as ""Sharon"") and new (such as Martin Freeman as Everett Ross) in Civil War, a number of which should continue to play key roles in the MCU hereon out. However, the one most worth discussing in greater depth is Daniel Brühl (Rush) as Helmut Zemo: the shadowy antagonist with a mysterious agenda in Civil War whose true motivation makes him more complex than your average Marvel movie villain. That being said, Zemo admittedly has less personality than a number of two-dimensional Marvel baddies past and (despite being more complicated by comparison) doesn't leave all that strong an impression, for that reason.   Taken as a whole, Civil War is an impressive accomplishment for Marvel Studios and provides further proof that there's far more storytelling potential in the superhero movie genre than many people believed back when the MCU began with Iron Man in 2008. The film doesn't necessarily evolve the established Marvel Studios movie ""brand"" and it has some of the same flaws as MCU movies past; yet, at the same time, Civil War succeeds at being as fun as any MCU film to date while also being more mature than many of them. Captain America: Civil War is a great superhero blockbuster that lays the groundwork for even bigger and better things to come in Phase 3 of the MCU. Seeing as the film's writers and directors alike will also be working on the next two Avengers movies, Phase 3 has a very good shot at fulfilling the promise of Civil War, too.   Captain America: Civil War is now playing in U.S. theaters nationwide. It is 147 minutes long and is Rated PG-13 for extended sequences of violence, action and mayhem.

"May 6, 2016",POSITIVE," Listen to Kevin’s radio review…





As much as “The Avengers” was a turning point for the Marvel Cinematic Universe (and superhero movies in general) back in 2012, it is the third Captain America movie (and the 13th movie in the series overall) that represents a new turning point. Here is where the Marvel Cinematic Universe diversifies, starts to tell more complex stories (beyond the simple blow-up-the-world and stop-the-bad-guy plot) and set the stage for an integrated universe that hinges less upon the name in the title and more about how that character fits into a greater world. Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, who delivered “Captain America: The Winter Soldier,” a film that diverted from the standard popcorn movie and gave audiences a more complex political thriller along the lines of “Three Days of the Condor.” This is their second film, and they didn’t suffer the burnout that Jon Favreau faced after “Iron Man 2” or Joss Whedon faced after “Avengers: Age of Ultron.” And things don’t seem to be slowing down for them, as they are diving into the two movie series for “The Infinity War.” They prove in “Captain America: Civil War” that they are able to handle the more intimate political thriller that we saw in “The Winter Soldier,” but they can also do the big-budget superhero smackdown spectacle that made “The Avengers” so fun. 
One of the most notable changes to the tone of this series is the fact that for the first time, the film directly takes on the question of collateral damage in these films. Because you can’t lay waste to New York, crash massive airships into Washington D.C. and drop an entire city from the sky in Sokovia. There are real people dying off screen in a safe PG-13 way, but finally in “Civil War,” their fates are addressed. At the same time, we see the gray area of being a superhero and why the governments of the world would want some sort of oversight and regulation. The schism that happens within the Avengers is one of ideology, weirdly putting Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) on the side of government regulation when he was fighting against exactly that in “Iron Man 2.” Leading the other charge is Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) who is a patriot but also is leery of too much government control, especially after he saw how Hydra had infiltrated S.H.I.E.L.D. At the center of this battle, symbolizing the split of loyalties, is the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), who is still facing the aftereffects of Hydra brainwashing and the guilt over his past sins. In this sense, “Captain America: Civil War” reaches deeper into the emotional development and – to borrow an analogy from another Disney hit – plays around with the characters mixed feelings at the end of “Inside Out” rather than the clear-cut simple feelings from the beginning of that film. 
Of course, “Captain America: Civil War” does work as an Avengers movie as well, featuring the epic showdown and a change to see the different heroes duke it out. At this time, we are also introduced to the new Spider-Man (Tom Holland), who is triumphantly coming to the Marvel Cinematic Universe following a bit of a rights struggle with Sony. We are also introduced to Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), setting the stage for his own movie and a greater role in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In the end, “Captain America: Civil War” is a powerful film dealing with complex human emotions with roots in revenge and loyalty. Just as “Guardians of the Galaxy” opened this series to greater options on a galactic cinematic level, “Civil War” opens it up to greater potential with a diversified cast, showing no sign that Marvel is even close to being done with its full roll-out plan."
"May 6, 2016",POSITIVE," It’s apropos of Marvel to finally bring in Spider-Man to “Civil War.” Because while it is essential that he be introduced to a brilliant cinematic universe, he is representative of the underlying message behind “Civil War.” With great power comes great responsibility. After spending so many years doing battle with aliens and super powered foes, the Avengers are finally taking a toll on the world, and the government from all sides of the globe is angry at their inherent recklessness. Tony Stark is particularly weary from the constant battles, especially after being confronted by the grieving mother of a young man who died as a bystander during one of the battles the Avengers were a part of. When a string of bombings occur during major political events, “Winter Soldier” aka Bucky Barnes is blamed. When the government reacts with force, Captain America decides to track down his old friend and help him before he’s crucified and turned in to a scapegoat. What’s so incredible about “Civil War,” is that while you may ultimately take a side, the stance Tony Stark and Steve Rogers both take on the issue of power being controlled and by who for what purposes is reasonable. I thought I’d be completely on Captain America’s side, but Stark’s position on the debate of being monitored and registered with governments and having the Avengers being controlled and sectioned like a police force is reasonable. Tony is a man who thinks the government has a point that their immense power–which includes a god and a massive hulking monster–should have limitations and have a steady hand keeping things balanced. After the events of “Winter Soldier,” Steve has seen what control and manipulation can do, and considers it the responsibility of the team to keep themselves regulated and find some way to maintain safety throughout the world while keeping everyone from suffering cruel deaths. The war of ideologies is ultimately what brings the Avengers team as warring sides of superpowers battling with one another. They all believe so strongly in their views that they’re willing to die for it, and it keeps the action emotional and compelling through the very end. The Russo brothers masterfully balance out a slew of fascinating and fantastic Marvel heroes and villains, adding bold new dimensions to comic book characters that may have otherwise translated poorly on to the big screen. The film maintains the awe and spectacle of the Avengers, while also remaining as grounded and technical as possible. The ultimate recruitment of Spider-Man is a wonderful move on Tony’s part. He’s a man who recognizes a prodigy when he sees it, but knows Spider-Man agrees with him, since his motto since day one as the wall crawler has been Great Power requiring Great Responsibility. Even as a powerful and brilliant young man Peter understands his limitations and this peaks Tony’s interest. “Civil War” is a near masterpiece that defies the somewhat bloated narrative. The Russos stack characters, top notch performances, and multiple sub-plots without ever losing momentum, building a perfectly well paced and coherent tale about revenge and the question of absolute power resulting in absolute corruption."
"May 6, 2016",POSITIVE," In my review of the first Avengers movie, I said Joss Whedon’s blockbuster represented “the most complete manifestation of the superhero team aesthetic yet seen on film.” Four years later, we have a new champion in the category of “best team film.” (To be fair, the hero-snuff-film future sequences in X-Men: Days of Future Past were pretty good examples of multi-hero action, as well.) The way in which Captain America: Civil War brings together a dozen or so heroes, sorts them into not one but two teams and then flings them at each other is its own special delight for comic book fans long accustomed to such things on the printed or digital page. And it must be pretty exciting for non-fans, too. The Russo brothers’ second film in the Captain America trilogy, and their last before tackling the upcoming two-part Avengers: Infinity War films, Civil War maintains the same balance of action and significant (if brief) character development/interaction that made Winter Soldier so enjoyable. The fight and chase scenes are frenetic without being confusing, while the comic relief, mostly supplied by our bug-themed heroes, provides a Whedon-flavored lightening of the otherwise dark proceedings. Even more impressive, the film introduces two additional MCU Phase Three stars—one brand new to filmgoers and the other oh-so familiar—and both generate a real sense of “Man, I can’t wait to see his solo film!” All this is achieved without once veering too far from the core plot of the film. As for that plot, Captain America: Civil War continues a controlled headlong rush down the road laid down by the preceding Captain America-themed entries: in the extended aftermath of Ultron’s Slovakia-based attempt at an extinction-level event and the unmasking of Hydra’s presence in S.H.I.E.L.D., Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) and crew figure in yet another high-profile event during which lives are lost. (Paul Bettany’s Vision is absent for reasons we can only assume are plot-related—as in, had he been there, the fight would have been over in 30 seconds.) All the world’s governments want this particular band of enhanced individuals on a leash. A guilty Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) agrees. A wary Steve Rogers doesn’t. Throw in an explosion that costs Wakanda its king and for which Bucky (Sebastian Stan) is a prime suspect, and this particular go-round of “Watch the heroes fight each other” makes more sense than it usually does. (It actually makes more sense than the comic event upon which it’s based, as that material basically just turns Tony Stark, and a few other heroes, into a super-villain for the duration.) As the MCU enters if not maturity, at least its late adolescence, its greatest achievement as embodied in Captain America: Civil War may lie in a continued absence rather than in the presence of something. Watching an MCU film is an act that’s free from unnecessary distractions related to characters and source material. Captain America looks and acts like Captain America. And that’s been true in all five films in which he’s appeared. The same is true for Ant-Man (Paul Rudd)—Scott Lang version—who has appeared now in two films, and even for Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) with just a mid-sized, if important, role in one. Meanwhile, at other studios, the failure to seemingly even understand the core nature and appeal of their characters means every one of their films has moments that cause both fans and new viewers alike to scratch their heads. “Um, why did Superman just let his father die?” “Wow, Batman just totally killed some guys.” “Oh my god, what have they done to Dr. Doom (twice!)/Galactus?!” For many, the distractions build and clutter and puncture both the anticipation for and enjoyment of these films. In addition to everything else it’s done right, Marvel Studios continues to get out of the way of its own characters. Note, these distractions are not the same as traditional plot weaknesses. Lord knows the MCU films in general and Captain America: Civil War in particular has those. But it’s so much easier to ignore how problematic a villain’s master plan might be (“So this all hinged on Iron Man finding out where Cap and Bucky went?”) when one’s enjoyment hasn’t been constantly sapped by what seems like a defiant disrespect for the source material. So many other superhero films start with the nitpicking tipping point already in sight and quickly rush to hit it. (I’m not talking about you, Deadpool. I love you, man.) If one thinks of the each MCU film as a juggling act—and each hero’s origin, “flavor” and power set as its own subset of items that must be kept in motion and in proper relation with each other—then as a series both Avengers films and Captain America: Civil War can be seen as an escalation of the routine that’s as impressive as it is necessary. After all, with each additional hero added, with each additional demand placed on the script in both action and dialogue, Kevin Feige and company are building toward Infinity."
"May 6, 2016",POSITIVE," ¡Sorpresa! En otro momento,  nadie me creía que a la película  Capitán América y el Soldado del Invierno  (2014) yo le había dado cuatro estrellas (de cinco posibles). Hoy se repite: los directores Anthony Russo y Joe Russo regresan y demuestran que aquello no fue casual. Ahora se trata de  Capitán América: Guerra civil  (2016) y dichos directores evidencian idénticas virtudes en el manejo del lenguaje fílmico; por ende, tenemos cine de superhéroes con secuencias de acción bien logradas y bien encadenadas dentro de un relato bien estructurado. Tanto es así que uno siente que los diálogos se estiran de manera inútil: tienden a ser repetitivos e insisten con la información que antes nos han dado. Hay conversaciones de más con personajes que hablan hasta por el hueso de la nuca. ¿De qué va la trama? Tenemos un argumento que pone frente a frente dos juicios ante la vida. Primero, ¿debe hacerse uno a un lado ante la injusticia y que sean las autoridades quienes ejecuten lo suyo? Segundo, ¿se debe asumir el deber ético de ir en defensa del necesitado, como el buen samaritano, sin condiciones? Lo ven, la película plantea un importante dilema. Esa es su riqueza conceptual y es lo que enfrenta a los superhéroes del caso en esta película. También es la moraleja, porque esa es también una disyuntiva para nosotros los humanos comunes y silvestres, día a día. A favor del hacerse a un lado y de burocratizar sus privilegios de superhéroes en manos de políticos, entre otros, está  El Hombre de Hierro . El otro lado de la moneda, el de luchar a favor de quienes lo necesitan sin intromisiones administrativas,  lo lidera el Capitán América. A cada líder lo siguen distintos superhéroes, quienes viven el paroxismo de enfrentarse entre ellos. Este es el mejor momento visual de la película: intensidad de una lucha que no sucede en blanco y negro, porque todos son amigos. Mientras esto ocurre, hay que enfrentarse al mal en  Siberia, proceso durante el cual la película ofrece situaciones novedosas e inquietantes. Hay habilidad narrativa para que  Capitán América: Guerra civil  nunca se disperse y sea, más bien, muy buena suma de situaciones particulares. Dentro de su argumento, el manejo del todo con sus partes es ejemplar. Igual pasa con la conducción de tantos superhéroes: bien diseñada y mejor combinada. La presencia de tantos cocineros no daña el sabor de la sopa: todo lo contrario. Las religiones caminan del politeísmo al monoteísmo; sin embargo, este tipo de cine de acción, pletórico de aventuras y quimeras, se llena de personajes con poderes superiores heterogéneos (¿semidioses?). ¿Cuántos faltan? Los que la imaginación diga. Excepto en secuencias de blablá inútil, el filme mantiene buen ritmo, buen arte actoral y vínculo eficaz entre música e imágenes. Resulta película entretenida, inteligente y generadora de conceptos porque es buen cine dentro de su marco industrial. No es solo para los fans, para nada.

"May 6, 2016",POSITIVE,"The film flows smoothly because of the great physical and verbal gags, but also because of the perfectly constructed fight scenes. [Full review in Spanish]"
"May 6, 2016",POSITIVE,"Exciting and ingeniously conceived, this is Marvel working at the top of its cinematic game."
"May 6, 2016",POSITIVE," Saving the world comes with a great price: collateral damage. It also hurts the invincible superheroes of the world more than super-villains, who will always be defeated in the end.  It is the root of the civil war in the latest Marvel movie, where Captain America’s team locks horns with Ironman and gang. And it works. Anyone who has watched The Avengers knows Captain America, but this is not an Avenger movie. It’s a Captain America movie that follows the narrative laid down by the first two, Captain America: The First Avenger and Captain America: Winter Soldier .  We see Steve Rogers trying to save his old friend, Bucky, whose memories have been erased, from some of the other Avengers who are unforgiving of his crimes.  But in spirit, this movie feels closer to The Avengers (2012). It is a superhero ensemble that is anchored as much as to Ironman (funny, brilliant Robert Downey Jr.) as it is to Captain America (Chris Evans playing clean-cut heroism perfectly).  Civil War forms the cracks from within. Captain America , who was ironically conceived as a propaganda mascot of the American government, now wants The Avengers to take things in their own hands.  On the other hand, Ironman, the one more likely to rebel against the government, wants to play it safe and work with the State. The rest of The Avengers choose a side. The film also keeps the tone light, best demonstrated in the movie’s centrepiece — the epic fight between the two teams that turns out to be very funny. The origin story of Black Panther (a solid turn by Chadwick Boseman) is nicely tucked into the movie. In a small cameo, Ant Man (a hilarious Paul Rudd) wreaks havoc inside Ironman. But it is the new Spiderman (Tom Holland), a fresh-faced school kid and a closet comic book geek with a younger, attractive Aunt May, who is likely to get the biggest cheers. Civil War shows how effective action sequences can be when done well. Right from the opening sequence, there is a crunchy physicality to the action. It’s easy to get carried away, when you have superheroes with distinct set of powers that bamboozle audience with CGI vagueness.   We register the heavy clunk of metal as Captain uses his shield to stop a bullet and when Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) punches a kick, we feel it in the bones. Incidentally, the final showdown has something big in common with Dawn of Justice . Civil War is the lighter, funnier movie of the two.  Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

"May 6, 2016",POSITIVE," Step 1: Buckle in. The ultimate battle of superhero titans is about to take off in Marvel’s Captain America: Civil War and hold onto your seats, folks, because this is one helluva ride – and the best Marvel movie to date. Step 2: Set up. The basic premise revolves the Avengers’ methods of staving off potential global catastrophes. Lead by Steve Rogers aka Captain America (Chris Evans), the small band of superheroes and fighters see the threat and go in to take it out. Problem is, when they do that, collateral damage – both with property and with innocent lives – is inevitable, and governments around the world are not sitting well with it. They want some checks and balances on the Avengers. Usually on the side of the government, Cap sees this as a big problem because any delay in their emergency response could prove to be highly detrimental and a larger loss of life. Instead, it’s Tony Stark aka Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), who sides with the bureaucrats. He says he understands their POV, but there’s an underlying guilt Tony feels because let’s face it, the last catastrophe at the hands of Ultron was Stark’s fault since, you know, he created Ultron. Tony doesn’t trust himself anymore and thinks he might need some higher authority telling him no. Step 3: Pick a side. Thus creates the conflict, which is only heightened when Steve’s BFF Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) shows up again. Bucky is trying very hard to shed his Winter Soldier/assassin reputation by staying in hiding but unfortunately is still under some form of Manchurian Candidate-type mind control, and at some point, Winter Soldier is re-engaged. Steve knows his friend is still in there and isn’t doing these things on his own accord, but the rest of the world doesn’t. Cap wants to get Bucky help to finally “fix” his brain, but in protecting Bucky, Steve and those who follow him – Sam Wilson aka Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Wanda Maximoff aka Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), and Clint Barton aka Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) – become wanted fugitives themselves. They now have to fight against their friends who are following Tony, such as Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Vision (Paul Bettany) and Lt. James Rhodes aka War Machine (Don Cheadle). Little do they know, they are all being manipulated by another, more sinister force, who, of course, should be stopped by the Avengers. But can they do that before the friendship between Cap and Iron Man are irreparably damaged? Step 4: Kudos to the writers. Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely craft an excellent story, one that isn’t too convoluted (sorry, Batman v Superman, they did it right) but also one that allows a bevy of characters to share time onscreen in a seamless way. This is a story we can actually relate to, if you’ve ever had a big blowup with your siblings. Markus and McFeely turn the Avengers into a dysfunctional family of sorts, so when they do argue – and by “argue,” I mean use their superpowers to slam each other through walls — it actually comes more out of love and respect. Tony and Steve don’t want to be in this conflict, but they are also both stubborn and are doing what they think is best. Plus, you really can understand both sides of the conflict, even if you find yourself rooting for a team (Team Cap does have the advantage, come on). Then, just when you think relations seem to be improving, a turn of events really sets Tony off, making the ultimate falling out between Cap and Iron Man even more heartbreaking to watch. Step 5: Enter the new Avengers. The writers also have to introduce new characters into the Civil War mix to feed the Marvel machine, but do it in a way that makes sense to the overall picture. The biggest newbie storyline goes to T’Challa aka Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), a prince from a fictitious African nation who seeks revenge against Bucky for seemingly killing his father. This is what sets up the film’s tentpole battle sequence at the airport between Team Cap and Team Iron Man. Both teams know they need reinforcements, so Falcon brings in Scott Lang aka Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), who has always been anti-establishment, to join Team Cap, while Tony recruits teenager Peter Parker aka Spider-Man (Tom Holland) for Team Iron Man. The airport battle is nothing sort of spectacular, with its power, fabulous action, great humor and shades of grey coloring in what is supposed to be a black or white situation. Step 6: Let them shine. All the actors get a chance to bring more depth to their characters. In the past Avengers movies, Downey seems to overpower the situation with his stellar performance as Tony Stark, but in Civil War, he really isn’t the main focus but rather complements the whole ensemble. And, yes, the title does have Captain America in it, so it is, in essence, Evans’ movie, but everyone has their moment: Downey and Cheadle deepen their friendship; Evans and Emily VanCamp as special agent Sharon Carter share a bond (and maybe a romance?); Johansson and Renner have a nice moment in the airport scene (“We’re still friends, right?” “Depends on how hard you hit me.”); Olsen and Bettany get to play with a possible romance blossoming between Scarlet Witch and Vision (if that’s even possible); Mackie and Stan have fun playing Cap’s BFF rivals; Paul Rudd is freaking hilarious from the moment he appears and is totally us when he geeks out over being with the Avengers (“Hey, I know you,” he says to Scarlet Witch. “You’re great!”); and Boseman is simply kick-ass as Black Panther (and gets us excited about his stand-alone movie). The true stand-out, however – and the one most will talk about – is Holland as Spider-Man. I think they’ve finally nailed that character (and by “they” we mean Marvel… sorry, Sony). Step 7: Call to action! Finally, there has to be a big shout-out to directors Anthony and Joe Russo. Armed with the excellent script, the brothers are able to implement an action-packed, funny and emotional comic-book movie that, up to this point, is the best of them all. The action sequences are crisp and well-defined, and the Russos thankfully avoid falling into the trap of making them too long or too busy. The brothers did that a little bit with Captain America: Winter Solider, so it looks like they’ve studied and improved their techniques. They also make sure there are enough light moments as there are dark ones, which seems to come naturally from the players’ camaraderie; that’s also a good sign the cast had attentive directors. Let’s just say, we are super excited the screenwriting/directing teams will be handling the last of the Avengers movie, the Infinity Wars Part 1 and 2."
"May 6, 2016",POSITIVE," Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), Falcon (Anthony Mackie), War Machine (Don Cheadle), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), Vision (Paul Bettany), Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), Ant-Man (Paul Rudd)… I lost count of the superheroes that switch in and out of their costumes in a film misleadingly headlined by Captain America (Chris Evans). In actuality, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely’s screenplay is a Marvel Hall of Fame with the Avengers divided into two factions standing on different sides of an ideological spectrum. While Steve Rogers/Captain America leads one side, Tony Stark/Iron Man, who is still smarting from the debacle depicted in Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), marshals the other. Besides being a smorgasbord of caped cameos – from Spiderman to Ant-Man, and an introduction to new crusader Black Panther – directors Anthony and Joe Russo dwell more on the introspective non-suited personas of the characters. There is also conflict between Stark-Rogers, Scarlett Witch-Vision and Black Widow-Hawkeye. For fan-boys and Marvel geeks, this might be a delight, but for the rest it takes some remembering as to why Iron Man hung up his suit or why Captain America is so protective of the Winter Warrior.  While the first hour is all about putting the several pieces and plots in place, the film picks up half-way, around the time Stark visits Peter Parker (a clever introduction to Tom Holland who slips into the friendly neighbourhood saviour’s suit) in New York City. This is about the time the repartee and punches kick in, which are usually the mainstay of a superhero movie, along with smart gadgets and weaponry-heavy action. Finally the film begins to soar. It’s cheeky, breathless and crowded with ideas. William Hurt, Martin Freeman and Daniel Bruhl also appear in pivotal roles joining the rest of the cast that is given scope to perform outside of their masked avatars. Captain America: Civil War makes up for the dullness of the previous Captain America films, and Chris Evans, with his pumped-up muscles and thawed-out all-American good looks, adds greatly to making this a satisfying watch. "
"May 6, 2016",POSITIVE,"Massive, overstuffed, overlong and yet fleet-footed, witty and terrifically entertaining."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL," Civil War pits the patriotic hero (Chris Evans) and his brainwashed buddy Bucky (Sebastian Stan) against Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) and a few lingering Avengers in a brawl of political proportions. Collateral damage from previous alien and robot face-offs convinces Tony Stark to put his super team on a leash. Steve ""Captain America"" Rogers doesn't want the government looking over his shoulder. Black Widow stands between them (despite not being in much of the movie). Boom: conflict -- and lots of it. This is the 13th episode in the theatrical TV series known as the Marvel Cinematic Universe, a marathon of character fury and super-powered brawls. Each 20-minute chunk in Civil War has its own beginning, middle, and end, and like the mid-season arc of any addictive show, it finishes where it starts: in a groove. There's no mass consensus on the Marvel movies. One man's Iron Man 2 is another man's Avengers. Case in point: as someone who put 2011's Captain America: The First Avenger on his top 10 movies of the year, didn't care for the beloved Guardians of the Galaxy, and thought Joss Whedon juggled the overloaded Age of Ultron with level-headed dynamism, Captain America: Civil War slid off my senses like Thor's hammer across Cap's vibranium shield -- the powerhouse hits land without so much as a scratch. Civil War is BYOI -- bring your own investment. You need to know what happened to Tony and his girlfriend Pepper Potts back in Iron Man 3. You need to remember the post-credit stinger from Captain America: The Winter Soldier so you buy that the once-evil Bucky wouldn't instantly kill Steve. You need to be able to discern the giant-objects-smashing-into-skyscraper finales of The Avengers, Winter Solider, and Age of Ultron to feel the gravity of destructive heroism. And you must have a snowballing love for these characters. There's no impending invasion or mass extinction event bringing Captain America and Iron Man together in Civil War. This is personal. They're their own worst enemies, and no amount of bro-hugging will calm them. Even the movie's shady villain is there to fan an existing fire. It's tragic if you see these characters as dimensional avatars of ideology and valor. Big ""if."" Civil War is not a self-sustaining story. Nor does it want to be. Civl War scales down to consider the consequences of the Avengers' actions. Should society control its heroes? Is one life more important than the survival of a city? Are guys with super suits and enhanced muscles really so sensitive that they have to resort to violence instead of talking through their problems? Civil War is the headiest Marvel movie to date, likely to provoke debate from conservatives and liberals, libertarians and collectivists. The movie doesn't carry its characters to true epiphany -- like a Game of Thrones season that plunges into the story and culminates with a cliffhanger, the latest Captain America isn't about to wrap things up knowing there's more to come -- but it does ask the questions, which is daring enough. Marvel's ""house style,"" the visual consistency that makes its mega-franchise installments television-esque, buckles in Civil War. Captain America: The First Avenger had grand, side-scrolling action set pieces that threw back to the WWII era. The Avengers whizzed around New York with single, sweeping camera moves. The Winter Soldier went for the Bourne-style shaky cam. With so many characters to manage, so much geography to cover, brother directors Anthony and Joe Russo are stuck shooting Captain America: Civil War like Arrested Development Season 4. Everything's tight and constantly cross-cutting, creating the illusion of everyone being in the same room. Who knows who was where and when, but for all the crime fighters crammed into the script, characters rarely entangle. The cold open, the Avengers thwarting a terrorist's plan to unleash a biological weapon, is a spastic, suffocated version of the Age of Ultron first scene. The big airport throw down teased in the trailers, and a brief mano-a-mano round at the tail end, are Civil War's few ""splash page"" moments, almost as crazed and colorful as promised. The whole movie rides the basic thrill of seeing Captain America, Iron Man, Falcon, Ant-Man, Black Widow, Vision, Scarlet Witch, etc., etc. do their thing. Not all at once. In pairs. Civil War suffers from the Iron Man 2 seed-planting problem. On top of the Captain America-Iron Man scuffle, there's teasing of an Avengers franchise carried by Vision and Scarlett Witch's romance, an enlarged Ant-Man sequel, and a new franchise starring Black Panther, played in the movie by debonair Chadwick Boseman. The king of fictitious African nation Wakanda, Panther is a regal, vengeful vigilante, a Captain America with claws. Boseman owns the role, chewing up scenery opposite Evans. If the script could spare him enough screen time to make him interesting, Boseman could surely do so. Doesn't happen. Civil War is brimming with that kind of potential, and hopes the visceral pleasure of catching a whiff will get your blood pumping. After making an unprecedented crossover deal with Sony, Marvel nabbed Spider-Man for its own uses. Teenage actor Tom Holland appears in the movie as a wisecracking webslinger, in part to pepper the fight scenes with humor, in greater part to setup his own franchise. His introduction scraps the origin story slog while still feeling like an intermission from the actual movie. For 10 minutes, Downey Jr. flirts with Marisa Tomei, the new Aunt May, and convinces Holland's Peter Parker to join #TeamIronMan. It's a funny, vibrant scene transplanted into Civil War where it feels like wheel-spinning. This year saw Deadpool rise from geek obscurity to a dominating box office force. Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice entered the cultural atmosphere like an asteroid and left shattered and charred. We have X-Men: Apocalypse, Suicide Squad, and Doctor Strange ahead of us. There's double the comic book mayhem to follow on actual television. Anyone worried about the onslaught of superhero cinema won't be won back by Captain America: Civil War, a languid yin to Age of Ultron's controlled chaos yang, a noble, character-driven blockbuster without much character. But anyone guzzling Marvel Kool-Aid in the off hours will lose his or her damn minds when they hit this quick-witted, reference-heavy, mythology-forging vehicle with plenty of room for emotional projection. It's a movie that gives and gives and gives to an audience that it knows can take it. Many will. Matt Patches is Thrillist’s Entertainment Editor.

"May 6, 2016",NEGATIVE," Starring Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan and Scarlett Johansson. Screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo. “Spider-Man will return,” promises a title card at the tail end of Captain America: Civil War, prompting a thunderous ovation from the capacity crowd at a Thursday night sneak I attended. I caught myself applauding along with them, as Tom Holland’s pint-sized webslinger runs away with this whole damn picture and he’s barely got thirty minutes of screen time. Awkwardly shoehorned into the proceedings with no bearing whatsoever on the outcome of the actual story, Peter Parker’s arrival feels more like a boffo product launch – interrupting a dutifully mopey tale of vengeance and consequences with a charming extended trailer for Spider-Man: Homecoming, opening July 2017. That everybody walks out of Captain America: Civil War talking about Spider-Man doesn’t bode well for Captain Steve Rogers, a bit of a stick in the mud here in his third “standalone” picture — an unfocused and overcrowed affair that appears to have been hijacked early in production and reconfigured into something more like Avengers 2.5 than Captain America 3. A shame, as Cap’s The First Avenger and The Winter Soldier were a cut above his funnybook brethren’s adventures. The latter in particular had a propulsive, paranoid energy and asserted that questioning authority is the patriotic duty of every American, captains or otherwise. I liked it a lot. Civil War finds Earth’s Mightiest Heroes called on the carpet for their pesky habit of leveling cities during those tedious third-act battle sequences when large CGI things crash into other things and I excuse myself to go use the restroom. The Secretary of State (William Hurt) wants The Avengers to operate under UN oversight. Robert Downey Jr.’s Tony Stark — riddled with guilt after his pet science project turned into James Spader and almost destroyed the world in last summer’s dismal Age Of Ultron – is suddenly all about accountability. Chris Evans’ Captain America – gone full libertarian after Robert Redford and the corrupt government agency he was working for almost murdered millions in a much better blockbuster from the previous year – makes his own decisions and that’s that. Captain America and Iron Man’s ideological differences are talked out rather incessantly and not particularly well, but we must have lots of hand-wringing about collateral damage and the price of heroism because the sad middle-aged dudes who cling so desperately to these films require constant reassurances that they’re *actually about serious issues and stuff* and not just fun stories for children in which men wear tights. Civil War covers a lot of the same ground as the recent Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice, but benefits from comparison by not being completely fucking terrible. Cap’s boyhood friend Bucky Barnes — brainwashed and turned into a super-soldier assassin that the bad guys kept in a freezer for seventy years — is still on the loose and now finds himself framed for a terrorist attack in the made-up African country of Wakanda. The King is killed and his son T’Challa (Chadwick Boseman) vows revenge, donning a vibranium jumpsuit in yet another product launch — this one for Ryan Coogler’s Black Panther, coming to theatres sometime in 2018. There are glimpses here and there of the more streamlined Winter Soldier sequel this was at one point obviously intended to be, with Cap and his trusty sidekick Falcon (a terrific Anthony Mackie) on the lam trying to rescue the last connection Steve Rogers has with his life before the ice. But franchise traffic management means we must also devote unwieldy swaths of screen time to Paul Bettany’s sentient android thingie developing romantic feelings for Elizabeth Olsen’s Scarlet Witch. (Two movies later and I still don’t understand what her powers are.) Cap is so marginalized in his own story that when he finally plants a smooch on the secret-agent-next-door he’d flirted with in the previous installment (Emily VanCamp) the moment is so comically unearned it seems to arrive out of left field. Evans continues to bring such a marvelous decency to the role — these days Captain America has taken over the pop culture post for aspirational goodness once held by Superman – it’s frustrating that what’s supposed to be his star vehicle keeps leaving him by the side of the road. There’s a flat, functional quality to the images in Civil War, as if returning directors Joe and Anthony Russo are working so hard to ground the fantastical events in the everyday that they’ve declared a moratorium on grandeur. The sleek, retro-futuristic surfaces and sly Washington D.C. iconography they brought to The Winter Soldier are replaced here by generic soundstage settings and indistinct location work. (A couple of pals on Twitter have been joking that this film was shot in Slough Business Park.) And yet Civil War boasts a single sequence better than anything in the other dozen Marvel movies. There’s a superhero smackdown roughly two-thirds of the way through the film — a six-on-six brawl across a strip of airport tarmac – that may be the most consistently delightful set-piece in any comic book adaptation ever. Tonally it doesn’t even fit with the rest of the picture, parting the clouds of gloom and doom with a gee-whiz sense of wonder and deliriously slap-sticky gags. (I don’t want to give too much away but our two special guest star bug-men have the best bits, and the best one-liners.) These superfriends may be fighting, but they’re also pulling punches and trying really hard not to seriously hurt one another, lending the entire scuffle a lightness and sense of play that’s sorely missing from the rest of this morose exercise in brand extension."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,Listening to the applause of cheers for deaths and devastation was a bit scary and more and more what we are seeing in real life. No wonder why!
"May 6, 2016",POSITIVE,"Captain America: Civil War, the third and perhaps final installment of the Captain America movie franchise is the kind of smart, emotionally resonant and visually exhilarating movie fans of the genre have been waiting for."
"May 6, 2016",POSITIVE,"The latest Marvel movie to build on the series' past while setting up its future, Captain America: Civil War is also the most ambitious film yet in that comic-book cinematic universe."
"May 6, 2016",POSITIVE," Writers-directors Joe and Anthony Russo have impressively crafted a movie that functions as a sequel for both the “Avengers” and “Captain America” movies, as well as one that further paves the way for the upcoming “Avengers: Infinity War” two-parter. Surprisingly, they’ve done so with making it feel overstuffed with fan service and superfluous plot points a la “Avengers: Age of Ultron”. It also puts that latter film into perspective and redeems it some by getting gritty with the collateral damage that often accompanies super-heroics, something BvS only half-heartedly tried (and failed) to do. Civil War picks up roughly a year after the events of Age of Ultron, with Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) leading an Avengers team with a roster of mostly newer recruits. Their mission takes an unexpectedly ugly turn that results in a number of civilian casualties, including delegates from the reclusive high-tech African nation of Wakanda. This is the last straw for the powers that be, who put forth a provision that the Avengers will either place themselves under the supervision of the United Nations or be shut down. A guilt-ridden Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) is all for it, but Cap is hesitant. Both have strong positions: Stark supports accountability and caution; Rogers fears placing the team under control of bureaucrats who have their own agendas. The situation is complicated further when Rogers’ old friend and war buddy Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), last seen as a brainwashed super-assassin on the run at the end of “Captain America: The Winter Soldier,” is framed for an attack that kills Wakanda’s king. The UN and the king’s son, T’Challa (Chadwick Boseman) want Barnes brought in dead or alive (mainly the latter), and Stark and company see it as proof of their cause. Rogers wants to protect his friend and is willing to go off the reservation to do so. Their teammates chose sides, battle lines are drawn, and friends become enemies in a fight that grows increasingly personal. Additionally, the Russos have the unenviable task of introducing two up-and-comers to the MCU. Boseman (Get on Up) is perfectly cast as the enigmatic, no-nonsense Black Panther, he of the bullet-proof catsuit, super strength, and claws sharp enough to scratch Cap’s shield. His is a fairly standard revenge plot, but it dovetails nicely with the plot and Boseman plays it with just the right degree of slow-burn gravitas. Tom Holland (In the Heart of the Sea) is an inspired casting choice as the new incarnation of Spider-Man. He and the Russos perfectly nail the high school-era version of the early comic books with a charmingly goofy mix of Peter Parker’s nerdy awkwardness and youthful enthusiasm. Marvel and Sony struck a joint-custody deal late in pre-production for Civil War and it shows; Spidey makes only a couple of appearances (each memorable) and his presence does little for the plot, whereas he was a key component of the comic book mega-crossover that the movie is based on. His presence feels a little forced, but it’s enjoyable enough to be forgiven. The more veteran characters are given equal time to varying effect. The traumatized Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and sentient android Vision (Paul Bettany) haven’t fully gelled yet, whereas Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) feels fully drawn with a distinct personality for the first time since his debut way back in the first Thor movie. James Rhodes/War Machine (Don Cheadle) gets his heartiest screen time since Iron Man 2, and Anthony Mackie continues to stick the landing as the high-flying Falcon. Paul Rudd brings comedy relief and some nice surprises as Scott Lang/Ant-Man, enough to anticipate a certain sequel. Last but not proverbial least, Marvel needs to hurry up and give Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) her own movie before fans riot in the streets. It’s a great many plates that the Russos manage to keep spinning, though it ultimately climaxes with a muted bang. Marvel’s biggest hang-up in a so far stellar body of work is its weakness for bland villains (Loki notwithstanding), and the trend continues in the form of Helmut Zemo (Daniel Bruhl), who feels like a lesser James Bond villain. Bruhl gives a strong performance though, and the door is left open for Zemo to develop into something more impressive. Besides, this is an instance where the heroes’ biggest threat is each other, and that is ultimately why this movie succeeds where Batman v. Superman failed: Civil War’s conflict is earned rather than contrived. It’s the culmination of tense friendships and strained egos that Marvel has cultivated for years. The stakes feel real, which gives this comic book spectacle more heft than the genre usually deserves."
"May 6, 2016",POSITIVE," The hype over Captain America: Civil War has been washing over us from the fan conventions and the parts of Europe where the movie has already opened. People who snagged an early look at this superhero flick are saying that it’s the best movie in the entire Avengers series. Now I’m here to tell you that it lives up to the hype, even if I had to consider the question for a while. After an Avengers’ rescue mission in Nigeria goes wrong and results in yet more innocent bystanders being killed, the new U.S. Secretary of State (William Hurt) lays down an ultimatum from the world to the superheroes: Submit to U.N. oversight, retire, or be arrested. In a bizarre yet logical twist, the egocentric maverick Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is the one pushing for limits on the group’s power, while the obedient soldier Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) leads the “no” camp. When the captain’s fugitive best friend Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) is blamed for a deadly terrorist bombing, the Avengers are forced to choose up sides, including newcomers Spider-Man (Tom Holland) and Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman). This is by the team of Anthony and Joe Russo, the brothers from a TV background who did such sterling work on Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Simply the way they handle the task of fitting 12 — 12! — superheroes into one movie without losing track or making anyone feel surplus to requirements is worthy of praise. The five-minute scene with Stark recruiting Peter Parker in his bedroom is a better origin story for Spider-Man than either of the films devoted to that purpose. In limited screen time, the movie gets more mileage out of Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) than his entire starring vehicle did. A late revelation about Tony’s parents lends him an emotional weight that the character hasn’t had since the very first Iron Man. The serious issues about how a superpower should behave in the world impart urgency, more so because both Tony and Steve are correct in their reasoning. The straight edge that Evans brings to the character has often served as a foil to the more flamboyant types around him, but here he’s a valuable steadying influence amid the moral ambiguity. As in The Winter Soldier, the Russos manage the lengthy, complex action sequences with clarity and aplomb, even if the 12-superhero brawl at Leipzig-Halle Airport feels as obligatory as the orgy that concludes a porno movie. More heartening is how many little character moments pop: Tony has a stinging confrontation with an innocent victim’s mother (Alfre Woodard), an early revelation about Agent 13 (Emily VanCamp) gives both Captain America and us a reason to invest in her, Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) has a psychological breakthrough while she’s under de facto house arrest, and Tony makes some fan-service jokes about how young Peter’s Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) looks. Just as notable is what isn’t here. There’s no dead spots like the other Avengers movies had, no pointless dream sequences, no dreary chatter about Asgard’s politics or those damned Infinity Stones. This 146-minute movie may be packed, but it’s also lean and agile. Instead of a one-dimensional supervillain dreaming of world conquest, there’s a life-sized guy (Daniel Brühl) who knows his limits and acts out of understandable motivations, which helps place the film on a more human scale. His story is mirrored in Black Panther’s, a young African king out for revenge after his father is killed in the bombing, which makes for a worthy addition to this capacious saga. This isn’t to say that everything works. I’m still not devoted to the undying friendship between Cap and Bucky that provides the fulcrum of this plot, and at some point some of these superheroes will have to die, not just to clear away excess characters but to provide a sense that wars have casualties and the people fighting them sometimes have to make sacrifices. (The Mark Millar comic book does that, but adapting writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely won’t take the plunge, even though not all the characters emerge in one piece.) Nevertheless, the balance that Captain America: Civil War strikes between action, character, emotion, humor, and intellectual debate makes this a compendium of all the best things the Marvel movies have had to offer."
"May 6, 2016",POSITIVE,"It isn't a perfect effort, but it's plenty to reach summer blockbuster status, and Civil War will leave fans salivating for the next installment in the series."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL," Not as bad by a long shot as “Batman v. Superman,” “Captain America: Civil War” is merely un­inspired, unnecessary and overlong by a half hour. Joe Johnston’s heartfelt and forthright “Captain America: The First Avenger” (2011) was 124 minutes. Joe and Anthony Russo’s unusually good follow-up “Captain America: Winter Soldier” was 136 minutes. This new, not very urgent “Captain America: Civil War,” again directed by the Russo brothers, is a stupefying 146 minutes, and it doesn’t even have a Hulk. After a prologue set in 1991, the present-day action begins with an anti-terror strike in Lagos by a part of the Avengers­ team, ending in awful collateral damage when a suicide bomber levitated by Scarlet Witch/Wanda Maximoff (a dull Elizabeth Olsen) goes awry. Enter the always helpful United Nations and the ratification of rules governing control of the “out of control” superheroes. Tony Stark aka Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr., whose sense of humor is ageless, even if he isn’t) thinks it’s better to accept supervision now. Steve Rogers aka Cap (a winning Chris Evans) is dead set against it. In the meantime, Bucky Barnes aka Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), the suspected terrorist bomber, who kills the father of African Prince T’Challa aka Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman, wearing what appears to be Catwoman’s suit), is captured. Wanda has been confined with synthetic humanoid Vision (Paul Bettany, upgraded from Iron Man’s computer Jarvis). Sam Wilson aka Falcon (Anthony Mackie) proves as adept at one-liners as Iron Man. Clint Barton aka Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) still have no superpowers to speak of, unless you count Johansson’s melting stare. And the globe-trotting visuals (London, Berlin, Washington, D.C., New York City, Cleveland, Vienna) are impressive, although I despise wearing those Imax 3-D glasses, which make everyone look like Larry King. Although the enlistment of Scott Lang aka Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and new Peter Parker aka Spider-Man (Brit Tom Holland), whose new Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) is hot, provides fun, it prolongs an overlong film. Sharon Carter (Emily VanCamp) returns to speak at Aunt Peggy’s funeral and be on receiving end of a sweet kiss from a smitten Steve. Newcomer Daniel Bruhl is quite good as evil Helmut Zemo. But the dialogue by series regulars Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely is wearisome, and I never for a moment believed that the warring Avenger factions — including Iron Man and Captain America — were truly out to kill one another. Also, who is supposed to get the 54-year-old “Manchurian Candidate” joke? Nobody except critics saw the remake. And why stick around for the Marvel trademark final teaser if there’s a good chance it’ll just be another Audi plug?"
"May 6, 2016",NEGATIVE," Captain America: Civil War offers that commodity in bulk, through amusing superheroes we know by electromagnetic heart, plus shrewd samplings of others, allowing Disney to see who clicks for next-phase Marvel universe expansion.  This movie feels like the fanboy event we've been sold before that wasn't delivered, epically constructed and briskly paced. More than any previous Marvel adaptation, Civil War conveys the comics' light touch amid somber circumstances. In a bold stroke, those circumstances are of the heroes' own making. At the core of Civil War is the collateral damage of saving the world, the unseen bodies in buildings and bridges collapsed by well-meaning superhumans. By extension, our gleeful voyeurism of all this CGI destruction is questioned. Sides must be picked, in a superhero family squabble. Steve Rogers, a.k.a. Captain America (Chris Evans), leads a contingent of emerging franchises believing might makes right, justifying any means of fighting evil. Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) is having a crisis of conscience, after one unilateral mission's particularly tragic outcome. He agrees with a United Nations accord restricting the Avengers' activities, requiring approval before zipping into action. Parallels to real-life moral and ethical dilemmas are Marvel's key to relatability, from teen angst to nuclear threats. Cap's hawkish perspective and Tony's sense of compromise can be viewed as allegories for a number of social and political schisms. For all of its fantastic embellishments, Civil War contains more humanity in a single confrontation than Batman v. Superman in its entirety. Of course, there's a villain (Daniel Bruhl) to vanquish but he feels extraneous, an unnecessary distraction from an emotional main event. As Civil War proceeds, an awareness grows of how much Marvel lore is packed into these trilogies, ensembles and cameos. Wisecracks and serious notes alike are underscored by that familiarity, feeling intrinsic rather than intruding simply to propel a plot. Stark's arc over the past eight years is particularly rich, from brash playboy genius to introspective hero. Power and responsibility have taken tolls on Tony, that the screenplay doesn't strain to convey. Downey gets the idea across by tamping down Tony's spark, a wearier wise guy. It's Cap's movie solely by virtue of its title, and Iron Man's in terms of carrying the story. At a juncture when franchises justifiably fall apart through defections and dead ends, Marvel's catalog appears to be finding a second wind. The in-fighting design of Civil War enables the introduction or expansion of newer heroes, some readier than others for a solo showcase, or in the case of Paul Rudd's Ant-Man, a second chance. In that regard, the breakout star of Civil War is Marvel's prodigal superhero, Spider-man, back in the fold after decades of stringing for other studios. It's a relatively small part but everything about Tom Holland's portrayal seems so right. For starters, he's the adolescent Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield couldn't fake, geeking about meeting Avengers. Bonus points for bringing along Marisa Tomei as a younger, sunnier Aunt May for Tony to hit upon. Civil War isn't perfect. One scene between Vision (Paul Bettany) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) stops the movie in its tracks. They and Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) are still cipher personalities. Action set pieces staged by sibling directors Anthony and Joe Russo remain too frenetically in-your-face to completely register. An extra millisecond between edits here and there is all clarity requires. But that's just being picky, and this is no time for that. Not with so much action fantasy fun on the line. Captain America: Civil War paves the way to Marvel's next phase of superhero adventures, and the future looks bright, indeed.

"May 6, 2016",POSITIVE," Brings up issues of loyalty and friendship. Also explores the idea of personal will vs. the collective good and hones in on the fact that people who are wrong but think they're right can be the most dangerous kinds of adversaries. Focuses on the necessity of trust between teammates and how keeping something secret can be thought of as lying to someone. Characters demonstrate courage, integrity, and teamwork. While all the Avengers are brave, Steve/Captain America continues to be exceptionally loyal, principled, and decent. He isn't willing to obey a law if it means limiting his ability to help others. Vision sees what makes Scarlet Witch/Wanda wonderful, even though the outside world treats her as a danger. Black Panther is steadfast and strong, and he's mature enough to see how vengeance was eating at him. Tony means well but lets his ego get the better of him. Natasha and Clint are unconditional friends. Rhodey and Falcon are loyal to their best friends. The Avengers all feel guilty about the people who've died while they're battling forces of evil. Avengers fight with outside forces and against one another. The fights usually involve their enhanced artifacts (like Cap's shield, Bucky's metal hand, and special suits), but the adversaries use weapons. A character grieves the death of a loved one. Explosions, guns, and enhanced weapons are used. Tons of explosions, collateral damage, and innocent casualties -- including a couple in more close-up than is typical for these films, which makes the impact more upsetting. An intense violent act from someone's past is revealed and shown. Nothing overt in the movie, but there are many, many Avengers-related toys, action figures, games, apparel, and other products associated with all the characters in the franchise. Parents need to know that Captain America: Civil War is the third Captain America installment and the 13th movie in the Marvel cinematic universe. It focuses on the growing tension between Steve Rogers/Cap (Chris Evans) and Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), which ultimately ramps up into an internal ""war"" between Avengers factions. It's about as violent as Winter Soldier: There's a lot of fighting, and it's all even more fraught because many of the big battle scenes are between Avengers. Although even young viewers might believe none of the main characters is going to die, characters do get injured (one so seriously he seems dead for a moment), and there's a lot of anguish as old friends find themselves on opposing sides. Language is infrequent but includes ""s--t"" and ""son of a bitch""; romance is limited to a quick kiss and a few longing looks and tender moments. To stay in the loop on more movies like this, you can sign up for weekly Family Movie Night emails. CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR opens with a fight between a crew of Avengers led by Steve Rogers -- aka Captain America (Chris Evans) -- and heavily armed mercenaries in Lagos, Nigeria, that ends up causing unexpected civilian deaths. Back home, Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) calls upon Cap, Natasha/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Rhodes (Don Cheadle), Sam/Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Vision (Paul Bettany), and Wanda/Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) to sign an international accord that would limit the Avengers' authority and allow them only to act at the behest of the Secretary of State and a global task force. Tony thinks it's the right thing to do, as do Rhodey and Vision, but Cap disagrees. When an assassin detonates a bomb at the United Nations, where the accords were to be signed, the culprit seems to be Bucky Barnes/the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) -- Cap's dear old friend. One of the casualties was the King of Wakanda; his son, Prince T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), believes it's his duty to seek vengeance and emerges as the Black Panther. Unwilling to turn Bucky over to be arrested without learning more about what happened, Cap enlists his side to go against the accords and protect Bucky. Ultimately, Cap and Tony engage in an Avengers civil war, with old friends taking sides, and new allies -- like Ant Man (Paul Rudd) and (possible spoiler alert!) Spider-Man (Tom Holland) -- joining the fray. With its death-defying action sequences, charismatic additional superheroes, and emotional character development, this Captain America threequel is both intense and entertaining. The Russo Brothers certainly know what they're doing. They once again prove that it's Captain America who's the Avengers' emotional core, with his immovable sense of loyalty and responsibility. It's unnecessary to choose sides, because -- as reasonable as Tony might seem when he goes on about the need of government oversight and accountability -- Captain America: Civil War is obviously Cap's movie, and therefore his is the more compelling argument. Evans goes through the entire emotional range as he deals with his complicated feelings for former-best-friend-turned-robotic-killer Bucky, as well as the knowledge that Tony believes he's betraying him and the grief of an unexpected but unsurprising death. As for the new additions, Boseman and Holland are fabulous as the Black Panther (the closest thing the Marvel universe has to Batman) and Spider-Man respectively. Peter Parker is for once played by an actual teen -- funny, nerdy, and in awe of his much more experienced fellow superheroes. In the big ""civil war"" fight scene, Peter prattles on, asking questions about everyone's suits and shield and abilities in a hilarious way. Meanwhile, Boseman is cool and fierce, believably a prince and a protector at the same time. There are small touches that reveal the deep bonds between this crew, like when Vision sweetly tells Wanda that he wants the world to see her as he does, not as a threat, or when Natasha asks Clint (Jeremy Renner), ""we're still friends right?"" We all know, no matter what side they might take in a particular argument, they're clearly still besties. Marvel might be churning these movies out at an incredible pace, but the quality and the depth in the Captain America movies in particular shows what's best about this superhero saga. Families can talk about the violence Captain America: Civil War. How does it compare to the other Avengers movies? Is there a difference in the impact between hand-to-hand combat versus catastrophic, buildings-collapsing type of explosions? What are the consequences of the Avengers' actions? Do you think they're role models? If so, which ones? How do they demonstrate courage and integrity? How does the movie explore the issue of revenge? Is it understandable how it affects the characters? What role does it play in the movie?

"May 6, 2016",POSITIVE," Captain America: Civil War, our 13th spin around the Marvel Cinematic Universe, is such a satisfying Problems In 21st Century Superheroics seminar that I'd be humming its theme for days if only I could remember it. Does Captain America have a theme? Does Iron Man? What about Black Widow? Haven't they each earned one by now? Eight years into a lovingly micromanaged franchise that has made Marvel Studios as indomitable as Galactus, benevolent mogul Kevin Feige still hasn't found a composer to elevate one of these movies to the firmament of earworms. Civil War's ersatz score, by Henry ""Not Wolverine"" Jackman, might've been borrowed from a '90s Tom Clancy flick. The movie isn't all that much to look at, either. Much of it takes place indoors, and its exteriors all appear to have been captured on the same cloudy afternoon in the spring of 2015 (though there's a Mark Fuhrman joke that American Crime Story has made topical again). Sibling directors Anthony and Joe Russo were best known for the hip TV comedies Arrested Development and Community before Marvel hired them to make the superb Captain America: The Winter Soldier; they're doing the next two Avengers, too. Their current Avengers movie, the one called Captain America: Civil War, has aerial combat and even a shot-in-IMAX sequence, but its visual sense remains stubbornly small screen. (I saw it in 3-D, which made the fight choreography — so crisp in Winter Soldier — look sloppier and the green-screen shots look faker. 2-D is A-1.) At least it'll hold up well on the at-home revisits it's bound to enjoy as Marvel's sinister-sounding Phase Three marches on. Because in all the ways that matter most — characterization, performance, emotional tension, allegorical heft — Civil War is Earth's Mightiest Marvel movie. It is also, at 147 minutes, the longest, but every minute is up there on the screen, so to speak. It's both more tense and more operatic than Joss Whedon's seminal Avengers chapters, and it juggles even more characters successfully. Best of all, it achieves genuine pathos while still being enormously funny. It's the Vibranium standard for superteam flicks. Liberally adapted from a Mark Millar comic book scenario circa 2006-7, Civil War finds the Avengers disassembled: The cumulative human cost of their adventures, plus a botched mission in this movie resulting in still more loss of life, has the world demanding the team submit to United Nations oversight. Tony ""Iron Man"" Stark, the hero most traumatized by their battles, thinks it's the right move. (As the person most responsible for creating Ultron, the malignant AI that talks like James Spader, he has good reason to believe that their power is too dangerous to remain unchecked.) But Captain Steve Rogers — still the lionhearted Brooklyn kid who tried again to enlist against the Nazis each time the draft board ruled him 4-F — believes the world will be safer if its guardians remain autonomous. And because screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely and star Chris Evans have developed the character so beautifully over the past five years, our hearts are with Cap, even though Stark's position is clearly the rational one. Things get more dire when Bucky ""The Winter Soldier"" Barnes (Sebastian Stan) — who, like his pre-brainwashing best pal Steve, has stayed in his early 30s since the early '40s thanks to evil Nazi cryoscience — becomes a suspect in an assassination that puts the enigmatic new hero Black Panther on his trail. Cap is maniacally determined to protect his oldest friend, even when he appears to be guilty. This pattern of characters we know to be good making honest and consequential mistakes is what makes Civil War resonate like a classical tragedy. Well, that and Robert Downey Jr., who in his sixth appearance as Stark appears more invested in the part than ever. He's not the glib egotist of films past; his worldview has darkened. And yet his scouting trip to Queens to recruit a certain friendly neighborhood do-gooder who lives with his aunt proves that even in brooding mode, Downey can still knock a comedic scene out of the park. He gets a big assist from believably adolescent new wall-crawler Tom Holland, who makes the occasion of Spidey finally being granted full MCU citizenship feel like the blessed event that it is. Perhaps sensing that some quarters of the audience may be getting fidgety after all this chitchat, the partners of McFeely, Markus, Russo & Russo reward our patience with the grandest, most inventive supersmackdown in cape-flick history. It's six on six; Iron Man isn't the only one who thought to bring backup. The filmmakers have approached the problem of how warriors with these particular talents might attack and counter one another with the zealous imagination of 9-year-olds. But they've also considered that each side is trying to subdue its rivals without causing irreversible harm. That would-that-it-'twere-so-simple objective, plus the humor that inexperienced combatants Spider-Man and Ant-Man bring to the fray, makes for an ingenious set piece that keeps finding new ways to surprise us. After that bravura sequence, the film wisely goes for intimacy rather than trying to top itself on spectacle. There are revelations large and small, and some plotting that's just as wobbly as Batman v Superman's if we're being honest. That kind of thing is almost inevitable in a story with this many moving parts and is easily forgiven in a picture — a franchise — that's done the hard work of making us care. That's not to say it isn't hard to look at all those perfectly sculpted visages: Anthony Mackie as Cap's best 21st century pal, Falcon. Daniel Brühl, playing a mysterious conspirator. Someone named Scarlett Johansson. (I had to look her up.) Chadwick Boseman, whose regal Black Panther makes you wish his Ryan Coogler-helmed movie was arriving sooner than 2018. Elizabeth Olsen as the Scarlet Witch, still learning to control her hex-projecting (really) powers. Paul Bettany as Vision, the Infinity Stone-encrusted android (stay with me) who is struggling with his feelings for a teammate. And Evans, who is struggling with his feelings for a S.H.I.E.L.D. colleague with a connection to his (distant) past. Stare at any one of them too long and your retinas will burn out. Even Martin Freeman — Bilbo Baggins, for crying out loud — gets a Slatteryesque silver-fox coif in this movie, as if a cameo by the real John Slattery weren't enough. And William Hurt, playing the official face of the U.N. oversight plan, looks hale enough to start filming Body Heat 2: Ragnarok tomorrow."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL," April 21, 9:53 a.m.: I was sitting down to watch an early screening of Captain America: Civil War on the Disney Studios lot in Burbank, California. I received a text inquiring if I’d heard the news. As a number of critics and studio types filed in – all immersed in their devices – we confirmed the news for each other: Prince was dead. One noted critic, whose name I will not mention because she may not want you to know she cusses like a sailor, posed the question aloud, “How the fuck are we supposed to pay attention to this now!?” Over the next 2 hours and 27 minutes, the full runtime through the end credits, Captain America: Civil War made me forget that Prince had died. It’s that entertaining. It’s that good a piece of summer distraction, which is exactly what it’s supposed to be. And let’s not forget that it’s a film fresh on the heels of DC’s Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice fiasco; oddly, one whose narrative is virtually the same as that of the Marvel film. Both Dawn of Justice and Civil War are about opposing camps of superheroes for one reason or another facing off in a battle to the death until a greater threat reveals itself. Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice was directed – which is to say “stylized” – by Zack Snyder. It’s exactly that, a Zack Snyder film, which is to say, bloated, bombastic, self-consciously serious, philosophically juvenile, and downright silly. Captain America: Civil War was directed by Joe and Anthony Russo, the brothers behind Captain America: The Winter Soldier and who will helm the upcoming Avengers: Infinity War – Part I and Avengers: Infinity War – Part II. The key difference between Dawn of Justice and Civil War is that the brothers Russo are not stylizers, but rather storytellers whose work is varied in both format and tone. From cult films like Welcome to Collinwood (2002) and You, Me and Dupree (2006), and even culty-er TV shows like Arrested Development and Community, the Russos are journeyman filmmakers with no personal agenda other than to make a really entertaining movie. It’s a combination of Avengers that includes the Captain (Chris Evans), Falcon (Anthony Mackie), and Natasha (Scarlett Johansson), among others. (But not the Hulk, who isn’t in this movie.) The mission goes badly, thus increasing pressure on the Avengers to come under some sort of authority. On the heels of events in New York, Washington, D.C., and the fictional land of Sokovia, nations have come to wonder if these superheroes are worth all the mayhem their protection provides. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is shaken by an encounter with the mother of a young man who was killed during one of his heroics in a scene similar to one in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice – but done better here. Long story short, Tony wants to submit to an authority that the league of nations has endorsed. Captain America, however, does not. Fanboys hate spoilers, but I wonder if the irony in the framing of Captain America: Civil War will go unnoticed by the superhero fans who will make this movie a worldwide box office hit. I wonder if they will get that Captain America, a soldier who is by default subject to the authority of the elected officials of the American government, would be less likely to refuse what is effectively a direct order from his superiors, whereas billionaire Tony Stark, an Ayn Rand archetype of a self-made man, would not be inclined to have his individual authority usurped. In any case, Civil War, though technically a Captain America sequel, is really a Marvel Universe sequel that uses this clash of heroes to introduce new characters – among them Chadwick Boseman as T’Challa (a.k.a. the Black Panther), king of the fictional land of Wakanda – and to reintroduce Spider-Man (Tom Holland). Yet in the end it all comes down to a showdown between Steve and Tony. And let’s face it, they never liked each other anyway. The fact that Captain America: Civil War is this good is surprising. There have been several of these superhero films of late and their relative entertainment value has been hit-and-miss for all but the most staunch Comic-Con-type fans. Guardians of the Galaxy and Deadpool were good. The previously mentioned Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Avengers: Age of Ultron, and a couple of those Iron Man films I could have done without. I don’t need any more Thor films, either. Not to mention any number of Marvel and DC TV series, from Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Agent Carter, Jessica Jones, and Daredevil to Gotham, The Flash, and Supergirl – each vying for their own galaxy in the Marvel and DC universes. So chances are that for me to consider Captain America: Civil War a good movie – good enough to make me forget Prince had just died – it must be pretty good indeed. Cast: Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Tom Holland, Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Jeremy Renner, Daniel Brühl, Paul Rudd, Don Cheadle, Marisa Tomei, Elizabeth Olsen, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Anthony Mackie, Emily VanCamp, Frank Grillo, Alfre Woodard, Hope Davis, William Hurt, Martin Freeman, John Slattery. Cameo: Stan Lee."
"May 6, 2016",NEUTRAL,"...while one of the story lines does pick up from Captain America: The Winter Soldier, it's Iron Man who steals the show."
"May 6, 2016",POSITIVE," They would wreck buildings. Innocent people would die. The media would think the worst of costumed vigilantes and the government would try to control them. That was the case in ""Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice,"" the ""Supergirl"" TV series and now ""Captain America: Civil War."" All are abruptly dark takes on what has traditionally been light, easygoing fare, but it does force fans to take a hard look at their popcorn-chomping, soda-sipping fantasies of superheroic justice. The latest example seems geared to make little kids cry as they watch their heroes punch each other bloody and kick each other through walls. But maybe kids will identify with the petty antics that set the Avengers at odds. There's even a moment when Iron Man demands that Captain America give back a toy that his dad made for him, because he's not playing fair. My sons, ages 9 and 3, never flinched at the screening. ""Civil War"" is a ridiculous movie, especially when two battle lines of angry heroes square off for an idiotic rumble reminiscent of finger-snapping ""West Side Story"" Jets-Sharks tangles. But damned if it isn't fun to watch Ant-Man infiltrate Iron Man's armored suit to mess with the wiring, Scarlet Witch light up Vision and Spider-Man pull off a Johnny Lawrence-approved leg sweep of Captain America. This is the cinematic equivalent of a little kid taking his action figures and ramming them together for two and a half hours, and that is a compliment, not a complaint. The movie soars in joyous spectacle where it could have withered in sour gloom as ""Batman vs. Superman"" did. My only complaints is that Thor and Hulk are nowhere to be found, with little explanation other than that they and the never-present-in-Disney Marvel movies, Fox-licensed X-Men always happen to be out to lunch when big issues pop up in Avengersland. The fact that Spider-Man is here, though, is enough to make the inner fanboy pop a braces-lined smile. It's heartening to see Spidey swing-kick his way through the mountains of legal webbing that prevented the Sony-licensed hero from playing with his superhero buddies. There is a mysterious bad guy in the movie, but his only purpose is to get Captain America and Iron Man to stop wrestling in the yard and come back inside for ice cream. Their reasons for making friends again are as dumb as their reasons for fighting, but none of it really matters. Like comic books, these movies exist not to solve issues, but give you reasons to buy the next issue. This movie accomplishes that, but then, so did the horrid ""Batman v. Superman."" We need our comic book heroes, so long as they restrict their building wrecking for the silver screen. Ryan Reynolds finds the superhero role he was meant for in this uproarious tale of the wise-cracking masked vigilante. With the help of the film, Deadpool escalates from cult favorite to bona fide superstar. A wickedly funny script combines with stellar action for one of the surprise smashes of the year. Blu-ray/digital copy special features include separate commentary tracks from Reynolds and the filmmakers, deleted and extended  scenes, a gag reel and galleries. Filmmaker David O. Russell once again reunites his go-to leads Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence to recreate the magic of ""American Hustle"" and ""The Silver Linings Playbook."" Robert De Niro, who was in the latter, is also back. Lawrence is at the center of a story that spans four generations, telling the tale of a woman who builds an unlikely business dynasty and juggles her personal life with her career needs. Extras in the Blu-ray/digital copy combo include a photo gallery, a Maureen Dowd interview with Russell and Lawrence and a background featurette. In yet another fun, free-spirited Lego adventure, Scooby, Shaggy and the gang investigate a movie studio ravaged by ghosts. Animators take the usual advantage of block-based humor, applying it to the traditional Scooby-Doo formula in a winning way. The Blu-ray/DVD/digital copy combo comes packages with a Scooby-Doo minifigure, and extras include three bonus episodes. This iconic Tom Cruise fighter pilot flick continues to endure in pop culture, and this tribute steelbook Blu-ray captures much of what makes the film an essential 1980s action/romance. Filmmaker commentary, making-of and survival featurettes and a look at the real Naval flight training program on which the film is based build up the Blu-ray/digital copy combo. "
"May 6, 2016",POSITIVE," “Captain America: Civil War” lives up to its advanced billing. And then some. It’s the “true” sequel to “The Avengers,” lapping last year’s sloppy “Avengers: Age of Ultron.” Disney couldn’t stop adding superheroes to the cast, clearly hoping to expand the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Less is very often more when it comes to colorfully clad heroes. Once more, Chris Evans is Captain America, a soldier frustrated by the new rules of engagement. The Secretary of State (William Hurt as Gen. “Thunderbolt” Ross) wants the Avengers to work under the auspices of the United Nations. The world sees the Avengers saving the day, again and again, while also racking up collateral damage. That makes them little more than super-powered vigilantes, officials argue. They must do their heroism the right away, by seeking permission before rushing into battle. Not so fast, counters Cap. He thinks the Avengers need to be autonomous, and that government restrictions can only slow them down … and maybe cost lives. The battle lines are drawn. Neither side is willing to budge. There’s only one way to settle matters. And it won’t come without a price. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo proved they were perfect for superhero projects with “The Winter Soldier.” That movie combined dizzying action with a grounded tale tied to the War on Terror. With “Civil War,” they add humor to their formula in an effortless fashion. You’d be hard-pressed to find a 2016 comedy with bigger, richer laughs. The movie brings Spider-Man back in the form of an agreeably goofy Tom Holland. He’s an awestruck teen recruited by Iron Man to fight on the government’s side. Holland brings a boyish charm to the role, along with the ridiculously young Aunt May (Marisa Tomei). And whatever doubts we had about Paul Rudd’s Ant-Man character are officially kaput. He’s hilarious as the accidental hero, one given the film’s geekiest screen surprise. Evans’ Captain America may seem like a footnote given the crush of new and old faces. He’s actually essential to the story, providing the moral compass a film of its ilk demands. It’s easy to brush off his work and say, “this isn’t Shakespeare, it’s a superhero movie.” Bringing Captain America, a character embodying the very best of this nation, to the big screen is a task Evans handles with continued grace. If only “Captain America: Civil War” were as flawless as its fight sequences. The figure pulling all the strings (Daniel Bruhl) embodies an arc with precious little payoff. It’s amazing to think how much work – and cash – went into “Civil War.” Yet a critical story line barely stands up to basic scrutiny. “Captain America: Civil War” is a shiny product meant to make millions for Disney. It’s part of our franchise age, a film to be consumed across the globe without offending any nation or people. Why is Aunt May “ridiculously young”? Marisa Tomei is 51, and Parker is meant to be about 16, right? Which would make her 35 when he was born. Sounds about right, if not on the older side. Yeah, that complaint is similar in ridiculousness to those complaints (even made by the great Ben Shapiro!) that Amy Adams was miscast as Lois Lane because she’s older than Henry Cavil.  First off, it’s only by a few years–big deal.  Second, Amy’s a poster-gal for “older than she looks”–if you didn’t know her real age, you could swear up and down she’s in her 20s.  Henry looks older than her.  Actors and actresses play characters older/younger than they are ALL THE TIME.  They do it because they’re able to. Sides, my aunt Kathy is 10 years older than my brother. Aunts and uncles really do come in all ages and sizes, just like she says in the film. Marisa Tomei is clearly not too young to be an aunt, but she’s by far the youngest version of Aunt May we’ve ever seen.  That’s about the only explanation I can give for “ridiculously young.”"
"May 6, 2016",POSITIVE,"A big, sprawling superhero mega-movie, with more spandex to the gallon than any flick that's come down the pike in a long time."
"May 6, 2016",POSITIVE," They couldn't be more different. Captain America, AKA Steve Rogers, or affectionately called 'Cap,' is a humble charismatic leader. Iron Man, AKA Tony Stark, is an ego driven playboy whose charisma is, at times, as much an obnoxious product of his bottomless checkbook as it is his amazing feats of heroism. But at their core, both adhere to an unshakable moral code - one that initially bound them together - but may ultimately divide them irreparably. The high concept team up film took a hit with the miserable 'Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice.' That movie was a failure because it did not live up to the exponential expectations placed on it. By positioning 'Captain America: Civil War' as merely one of the stand-alone projects in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the expectations are understandably tempered. But, make no mistake, this movie plays like a third 'Avengers' film hidden within the thin, sub-hero veneer. The story has Cap (Chris Evans) adjusting to a world after the events in 'Avengers: Age of Ultron.' A city was destroyed in the film, and the nations of the world grew suspicious of those with enhanced powers. Ironically, some of those thought to have powers are actually average humans with fancy technology. But these technology-enhanced heroes, like Lieutenant James Rhodes AKA War Machine (Don Cheadle), are lumped in with beings that have been genetically or magically enhanced. My problem with the human vs. enhanced being conflict is that it is comically handled - especially with bone crashes with iron. Quibbles aside, however, the conflict is a good one: can the Avengers be controlled? After things go badly on a mission, and Wanda Maximoff AKA the Scarlet Witch, inadvertently causes collateral damage to the public (death of innocent bystanders), the United Nations steps in and proposes a contract allowing the Avengers to act only when directed. The contract is in an attempt to cut down on vigilante justice. Posturing and negotiation is lead by newly minted Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt, who previously played 'Thunderbolt' Ross in 'The Incredible Hulk'). Ross' no-nonsense approach doesn't sit well with Captain America and a few others who ultimately choose to go their own way. And, let's face it, Cap is as much a general as Ross, but Cap's autonomy is the issue. And, in his way are the forces lead by Iron Man, who may or may not have his own particularly selfish motives. While the level of action and the destructive wake is on par with previous Marvel entries, a concerted effort is made to limit casualties. At every turn, there is consideration, repose, and exposition about how to prevent needless death. The destruction on the other hand, well - partial spoiler here - an airport in Germany doesn't survive the film. My favorite Marvel hero when I was a boy was Spider-Man, so, my heart is with the guy, but this new introduction of the character should warm everyone's hearts. And get a load of the new Aunt May Parker, who is played by non-other-than Marisa Tomei (even Tony Stark flirts with her). Also, laughs are had when Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) formally joins Cap's cause, while comically admiring the size of his impressive biceps. As a fan of the original limited Vision and the Scarlett Witch comic book series that now sits in a closet safely housed in an acid free box in my home, I'm pleased by how this complex sensitive relationship is developing. Vision (Paul Bettany) is a being of great but uncertain and evolving power matched well with another mysterious being the Scarlett Witch (Elizabeth Olsen). The seeds have been sown for a stand alone project involving them. But even though 'Civil War' contains all the traditional trappings of an 'Avengers' film, it is Cap's movie. And he gets plenty of screen time to prove he's one of the most important heroes in all of comics. When his super soldier flesh and bone fists clash with Tony Stark's iron, the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe crackles with renewed vigor."
"May 6, 2016",POSITIVE," Captain America: Civil War is packed with enough blockbuster super-stuff—scads of characters, oodles of travelogue mileage, and acres of eye-punishing shakey-cam action—to fuel two movies. But Civil War is of course only one movie, and so its excess of just about everything overwhelms its virtues. As has been the case ever since the Marvel Cinematic Universe was launched eight years ago, with Iron Man, this film is another way station en route to some sort of super-duper Avengers movie of the indeterminate future. Whether that galactic wrap-up will ever actually be reached is teasingly uncertain: a pair of purportedly climactic Infinity War films are in the works, but keep in mind that the Avengers' comic-book exploits have been going on for more than 50 years. Anyway, in this third Captain America picture, a crowd of familiar faces is once again assembled. That it's such a large crowd is one of the movie's problems. Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. are back, of course, still appealing as straight-edge Steve Rogers/Captain America and quip-slinging industrialist Tony Stark/Iron Man. Scarlett Johansson returns as the butt-slamming Black Widow, Anthony Mackie and Don Cheadle fly in as the Falcon and War Machine, Paul Bettany reprises the charmingly synthetic Vision, Elizabeth Olsen is the telekinetic Scarlet Witch, and Jeremy Renner is briefly on hand as Hawkeye (still standing up to the forces of interstellar evil with nothing more than a bow and arrows). A couple of Avengers are missing in action— Thor is still back home in Asgard and the Hulk is vaguely indisposed—but three newbies do a nice job of taking up the slack. Paul Rudd's Ant-Man features in one of the movie's more inventive action scenes, and Chadwick Boseman's formidable Black Panther adds at least iconic heft to the proceedings. Best of all, perhaps, is 19-year-old Tom Holland's giddy Spider-Man—a character finally freed from his bondage in the foundered Sony franchise. This time out, the team is caught up in an ethical issue of the sort that comic books are able to present with such simple clarity. The question is pressing: should superheroes be applauded for protecting the world from alien assaults, or are they dangerous vigilantes who need to be reined in? (This conundrum was also addressed six weeks ago, although more glumly, in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.) As fans will know, the Avengers have already wrought extensive destruction in New York City and the Eastern European country of Sokovia; and as the movie begins, we see them notching up more collateral damage in a raid in Nigeria to prevent the theft of a deadly biological weapon. The world has about had it with these people, and there are now calls for the Avengers to be brought under UN control. The US Secretary of State (William Hurt) advises the team to sign on to this plan, and Tony Stark surprisingly agrees that they should. But the more staunchly libertarian Steve Rogers resists: subjecting the Avengers to the whims of international bureaucrats, he argues, could only prove disastrous. What ensues is not a ""civil war,"" exactly, but Rogers and his supporters in the group do split off to continue their unhampered pursuit of world-threatening malefactors—at the risk of becoming international fugitives. The plot evolves with the return of Rogers's old friend-turned-enemy Bucky Barnes, the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan). He's still in the grip of his World War II brainwashing and has now been reactivated as an assassin by a mysterious figure called Zemo (Daniel Brühl). Rogers gets some unexpected help in tracking these two from former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Sharon Carter (a returning Emily VanCamp), the niece of his lost love of the 1940s, Peggy Carter. This is a serviceable story, occasionally warmed with sentiment (Rogers flies to London to attend the aged Peggy's funeral) and often flecked with humor (Stark's visit to a Queens row house to recruit budding web-slinger Peter Parker is tartly funny: ""So you're Spider-Boy,"" Stark dryly observes.) The overstuffed cast is a problem throughout, though: Johansson's Romanoff is sadly under-employed (where's her spinoff movie, anyway?), and Olsen's Scarlet Witch and Renner's Hawkeye barely have room to register. Stan's Bucky Barnes has a few heart-tugging moments, but he's still a dull character, as is Brühl's Zemo, who lacks villainous flamboyance. It's nice that directors Anthony and Joe Russo and their writers, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, have toned down the usual superhero real-estate-wreckage. But what they've replaced it with amounts to endless mano-a-mano fight scenes, all shot in a clichéd blur of handheld camerawork. There's some rousing action—especially an all-stops-out battle at a Leipzig airport, and a chase through a tunnel thick with speeding vehicles. But the leap-and-kick fisticuffs predominate, and over the course of nearly two and a half hours, they drag the picture down. By the time it wallows to a close, some viewers might feel little more than a sense of relief. But does it matter? Civil War is just another stop on Marvel's march toward world super-flick domination, and stand-alone movies featuring Spider-Man, Thor, Ant-Man and Black Panther are already in the pipeline.

"May 6, 2016",POSITIVE," In the 1950s, as declassified documents reveal, the Central Intelligence Agency created Project MKUltra, an attempt at using conditioning/interrogation techniques in combination with psychotropics (LSD) for mind control of subjects.  Uncovering moles was the Agency’s initial goal.  The program had considerable participation from numerous institutions and prestigious universities and, along with the Tuskegee Experiment and radiation exposure tests on Native American subjects associated with the Manhattan Project, the operation remains one of America’s darkest spots. Albeit a failure, MKUltra continued on through the 1970s.  Its test subjects included counterculture author Ken Kesey (One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest), and Ted Kaczynski—the Unabomber.  Ted Kaczynski was a UC Berkeley professor until he inexplicably quit in 1969, by all accounts then a normal individual until he was subjected to a controversial study conducted by Henry Murray.  Kacyznski is serving eight consecutive life sentences at a SUPERMAX prison for sixteen bombings committed between 1978 and 1995.   In 2010, ten Russian sleeper agents were arrested in the United States and exchanged in a prisoner swap.  The Cold War, it seems, never ended. Following the narrative set in motion by CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE WINTER SOLDIER, its title a reference to the Winter Soldier hearings and Paine’s quote in The American Crisis, the Avengers are met with fierce criticism in the wake of collateral damage in Lagos.  Wakandan aid workers in a nearby office building withstood an explosion the superheroes attempted to contain while in pursuit of a terrorist stealing a biological weapon.  Wakanda, for those new to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, is a fictional African nation, home to the precious vibranium ore—also fictional, a virtually indestructible material from which Captain America’s shield is made. Out of this catastrophe, the jurisprudence of the Avengers is questioned by Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt). They’re effectively under house arrest until the Sokovia Accords which will place their oversight in the hands of the United Nations.  A prime suspect at the center of foul play in the signing of the Accords is Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), a former instrument of the Cold War, not unlike those test subjects and sleeper agents—literally thawed out and “activated” by secret codes to assassinate targets  The embers of Barnes’ friendship with Steve Rogers/Captain America ignite a rift between two camps within the Avengers—those wary of their unchecked power and those skeptical of oversight by governments easily infiltrated by HYDRA, the Nazi splinter faction corrupting nations since World War II. Several of the characters are placed in a moral dilemma.  The opening scene’s destruction comes at the hands of Wanda Maximoff, a.k.a. Scarlet Witch, an “enhanced” individual with special powers; Marvel’s extant licensing agreement with Fox bars overt use of the X-Men trademark.  Wanda (Elizabeth Olsen), Vision (Paul Bettany), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Falcon (Anthony Mackie; watch for a timely Mark Fuhrman reference), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and other superheroes on both sides seem less cocksure of their chosen side (TEAM CAP or TEAM IRONMAN, marketing mirroring the media penchant for polarization).  But the standout is Chadwick Boseman as T’Challa/Black Panther. The son of Wakanda’s king, Prince T’Challa skirts the Magical Negro trope for his role as the one voice of rational skepticism guiding the principal, and predominately white, characters out of their conundrum—self-inflicted out of a plot-convenient failure to communicate.  However, a pivotal scene I will not spoil, makes T’Challa a leader:  He spares another man similarly consumed by rage, whereas Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) would have killed another. When directors Joe and Anthony Russo are at their best, inspired by Pollack’s THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR and Ritt’s THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD, they dive into character details.  In their previous film,  Black Widow and the titular Captain America bantered about their personal lives, continuing in that vein with a sensitivity absent in other Marvel films.  In CIVIL WAR, we see shards of Bucky’s shattered life—the tattered mattress on the floor of his flophouse room, candy bars strewn atop the refrigerator and a journal with a museum brochure in it. On the obverse, Sharon Carter (Emily Van Camp) receives short shrift despite a setup in THE WINTER SOLDIER for a solid, thoughtfully crafted role as Agent 13 in Marvel’s clandestine unit, S.H.I.E.L.D.  A shoehorned romance with Captain Rogers plays inappropriately, too soon, and entirely out of character for either of them.  A subplot involving other sleeper agents serves no purpose and meets no end except as a vehicle to further the rift between Stark and Rogers. The film lacks the grace of THE WINTER SOLDIER which paces its fantasy action and political thriller elements more evenly.  The Russos devote substantial time undoing the incoherent mess Joss Whedon left behind in AGE OF ULTRON—even working in a joke about Clint Barton’s (Renner) family life and Tony’s inexplicable un-retirement. So busy juggling character introductions and story setups, the story never really resolves its own central thesis: whether or not the Avengers, save for Rogers, can learn to fight for something beyond themselves and each other.  Once they take sides after Lagos, subsequent battles occur in remote or vacant locales presenting no moral quandary.  Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) has a funny scene that might turn horrifying if the airport weren’t conveniently evacuated. Saddled with the responsibility of introducing numerous characters and threads leading into the climactic INFINITY WARS, CIVIL WAR is effective yet falls short of brilliance, were it instead focused narrowly on rebuilding the fragments of Bucky and Steve’s friendship.  They’ve 70 years of catching up to do and the film cannot spare them a single moment, save for a glance of solidarity.  Why, when theirs is the saddest story of all?  Bucky was enlisted twice: First, as Steve’s friend and protector.  Then drafted into service, made a prisoner of war, tortured and conditioned to commit horrible atrocities.  Steve is still the little scrapper from Brooklyn who lied to enlist, so he could combat atrocities and the bullies who commit them. Bucky is a victim in recovery, fighting other people’s battles his entire life.  Like SSgt. William James in THE HURT LOCKER, Steve is no Sunshine Patriot.  For him, the war never ends."

"May 6, 2016",POSITIVE," Captain America: Civil War puts the fun back into superhero feuding. It remembers that we go to such movies not to see good guys kill each other, but to see them to work out their differences so they can stop bad guys. Captain America: Civil War puts the fun back into superhero feuding.

It remembers we go to movies not to see good guys kill each other, but to see them work out their differences so they can stop bad guys. Civil War reminds us it’s OK to enjoy a few laughs, even while diabolical villains plot doom, outraged citizens demand accountability and your best pal mistrusts you. One agreeably silly scene has super dudes piling into a Volkswagen and arguing about leg room. Winter Soldier co-directors Anthony and Joe Russo are back with Cap, again played by Chris Evans with chiseled authority. His brainwashed BFF Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) is still causing misguided mayhem. Most of that costumed mob and their pals are here: Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), War Machine (Don Cheadle), Vision (Paul Bettany) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) all take sides in the title bout. Thor and The Hulk are MIA, but the Russos and screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely rustle up yet more members of the Marvel Comics Universe to expand franchises: Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Spider-Man (Tom Holland), the latter two actors new to the MCU. The feuding is about owning your actions, a popular blockbuster theme of late. The United Nations is fed up with squabbling heroes and villains destroying buildings and killing bystanders, as an Avengers cock-up in Nigeria demonstrates early on. The U.S. Secretary of State (William Hurt) insists the Avengers submit to UN oversight, a shackling Iron Man agrees to (“We need to be put in check”) but Captain America resists (“The safest hands are still our own”). You’d normally get opposite opinions from these two. Discerning motivations and alliances passes the time between battles, especially since the film’s chief villain, played by Daniel Brühl, is more of a wearisome super brat like Jesse Eisenberg’s Lex Luthor in Batman v Superman.

"May 5, 2016",POSITIVE,"As long as talented, passionate filmmakers continue to be brought aboard to take these stories and characters in fresh directions, there is no reason to expect this massive franchise will grow stale or lose its vitality anytime soon."
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL," 
I was really dreading 
		sitting through this thing, especially when I learned it was well over 
		two hours long. However, it wasnt as painful as I had imagined, mainly 
		due to the special effects and the pace. Of course there is no acting, 
		its just one ridiculous fight after another between and among people 
		who are more or less invulnerable, ad infinitum. 
The plot, if you can 
		really believe that anything made for the sole and only purpose of 
		displaying special effects has a plot, is that the Avengers are asked to 
		sign some kind of agreement saying that they will not avenge unless 
		authorized by some higher governmental authority. Some agree; some 
		dont. The result is that they eventually face off against one another. 
I confess I really 
		dont know the players here. I havent seen all these, and I stopped 
		reading comic books shortly after I reached the age of reason, so Im 
		definitely not the audience for this type of thing.  
I saw the first one 
		and now this one. I missed the one(s?) in between, thank goodness. But 
		Im really not familiar with all these superhero characters, so I didnt 
		try to follow who was who and what exactly were their powers, or 
		anything else that might imply that there was some logic to it. 
Even the evil people 
		are treated sympathetically, with some sort of justification for the 
		actions they take. Its got all the usual suspects, Robert Downey, Jr., 
		Scarlett Johansson, Chris Evans, etc., etc. None is asked to act, just 
		recite their lines and hit their marks. They all accomplish that 
		sometimes as if they were in a trance.  
The budget for this 
		thing was only $175 million. I say only because the projected budget 
		for the upcoming two-part The Avengers: Infinity War is reported 
		by Bleeding Cool to be $1 billion! Robert Downey, Jr. is reported to 
		be receiving half of the budget set aside for actors, which explains why 
		he sacrifices his talent and reputation in something like this. 
This is a stark 
		example of what movies have become, which is intellectual diarrhea. Can 
		you imagine Clark Gable or Spencer Tracy or Cary Grant playing one of 
		these superheroes? Clark Gable in a cape? Cary Grant in tights? But, get 
		used to it. This junk makes money. There are nine, count them, nine 
		superhero movies in line to be made between now and 2019."
"May 5, 2016",POSITIVE,"Civil War is much better than Age of Ultron, but as a sequel of The Winter Soldier it falls short. [Full review in Spanish]"
"May 5, 2016",POSITIVE," That means in big capital letters, along with the likes of Berlin, Bucharest, Lagos, London and Vienna, to signal places where an important sequence of events is about to take place. And, if that already sounds like a crowded agenda, please know that you won't be able to tell a superhero without a scorecard, either. Many familiar personas -- Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Falcon (Anthony Mackie),  Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), War Machine (Don Cheadle), Vision (Paul Bettany), Ant Man (Paul Rudd) and that exceptionally weird Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) -- all return from previous movie engagements. Meanwhile, newcomer Black Panther (welcome addition Chadwick Boseman) adds some serious gravitas, and even a young Spider-Man (Tom Holland) shows up in a mostly lighthearted appearance. The latter, of course, becomes a real highlight amidst all the sturm und drang exhibited by the major players, mostly the title character (once again played easily by Chris Evans) and ever-smug Iron Man Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), whose act really is growing a bit old. Anyway, the former pals go in opposite directions after some talky exposition from a group of alarmed government officials (counting characters played condescendingly by William Hurt and Martin Freeman). The problem with the Avengers saving the world, it seems, is the collateral damage (read: accidental deaths) they always leave in their wake. So, the weary Stark sides with the bureaucrats, and the good Cap goes rogue and still trying to prove that his brainwashed buddy Bucky (""Winter Soldier"" Sebastian Stan from the last movie) is no bad guy. The others? Why they take sides, naturally, while the real villain of the piece (the great Daniel Bruhl) mysteriously plots his way through it all. Hey, I told you it was crowded, with revenge playing a key role in a very long story that only fanboys might genuinely love. Regardless, there remains a lot to like about it, such as an opening battle offering some sparkling 3-D effects, the thrilling final showdown, and its showcase cast. Believe it or not, the Russos somehow also manage room for Marisa Tomei, John Slattery, Hope Davis, Alfre Woodard, and a love interest for Captain America.

"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL," You, Me and Dupree casts Owen Wilson as Randolph Dupree, a perpetual loser who - following the loss of his job and apartment - moves into the home of best friend Carl (Matt Dillon) and new wife Molly (Kate Hudson). As expected, Dupree's sloppy hijinks begin to cause problems within Carl and Molly's marriage (Carl's tenuous relationship with his father-in-law, played by Michael Douglas, only exacerbates the situation). Screenwriter Mike LeSieur infuses You, Me and Dupree with some of the hoariest romantic-comedy cliches one could possibly imagine, and there are consequently very few surprises to be had throughout the movie's overlong running time. The predictable character arcs (ie Carl stands up to his overbearing father-in-law, Dupree learns responsibility, etc, etc) and thoroughly routine plot points (including, natch, the dreaded fake break-up) are augmented by Joe and Anthony Russo's bland directorial choices, as well as the exceedingly erratic pacing with which they've imbued the movie. The film's three leads deliver competent yet thoroughly uninspired performances, with Wilson offering up the latest variation on his laid-back, cool-guy persona (though he's still a personable, charismatic figure, his schtick has long-since lost most of its appeal). And while Hudson and Dillon are cute together, they're not given a whole lot to work with; they are, for the most part, trapped within the artificial confines of LeSieur's distinctly unimpressive screenplay. Periphery cast members such as Seth Rogan and Harry Dean Stanton (the latter of whom is wasted in a two-line role) generally fare better than their above-the-title brethren, but the bottom line is virtually everyone here deserves better than this. You, Me and Dupree is ultimately as ineffective and underwhelming as recent comedic efforts such as Click and The Break-Up, which is certainly a shame given the presence of some genuinely talented folks both in front of and behind the camera (even the Russo brothers have shown some promise in the past, thanks to their work on the now-defunct Fox sitcom Arrested Development). And while it seems likely that the film will appeal to the increasingly indiscriminating populace (how else can one explain the monstrous success of Dead Man's Chest?), there's little here to keep even the most forgiving Wilson fan entertained. A substantial disappointment after 2011's better-than-expected Captain America: The First Avenger, Captain America: The Winter Soldier follows Chris Evans' title character as he embarks on a quest to clear his name after he's branded a traitor by certain dark forces. It's clear immediately that directors Joe and Anthony Russo aren't looking to replicate the old-fashioned feel of Joe Johnston's first film, as Captain America: The Winter Soldier opens with a generic action sequence that could've been pulled from any number of contemporary thrillers (ie the rapid-fire editing and shaky camerawork lend it an incoherent, unexciting feel). The film does, thankfully, improve past that point, as scripters Christopher Markus and	Stephen McFeely offer up a propulsive narrative that's been augmented with a number of agreeable elements - with the conspiracy-based storyline certainly far more entertaining and compelling than one might've expected. It doesn't hurt, either, that the movie boasts a raft of charismatic performers within the supporting cast, with, in particular, Robert Redford's engaging turn as a senior S.H.I.E.L.D. official standing out as an obvious highlight. And although the opening hour contains a handful of impressively exciting set-pieces (eg Cap must take down an elevator full of villains), Captain America: The Winter Soldier begins to lose its grip on the viewer in the rather tedious midsection and buildup to the third act - with this vibe ultimately compounded by an almost interminable final stretch that's rife with over-the-top, overblown action sequences. (And, typically, most of this stuff feels as though it'd be more at home in a video game than in a movie.) It's a shame, really, given the effectiveness of Captain America: The First Avenger and the central character's likeable, appealing nature, with the film, in the end, establishing itself as just another mindless product geared towards teenage boys.  As tedious and uninvolving as its immediate predecessor, Captain America: Civil War follows Chris Evans' title character as he's forced to battle fellow Avenger Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr) over a political dispute involving  the forced regulation of superheroes. There's ultimately  little within Captain America: Civil War's ridiculous 146 minute running time that wholeheartedly works, as directors Joe and Anthony Russo, working from a screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, have suffused the proceedings with one half-baked, less-than-engrossing subplot after another - which ensures, to an increasingly distressing extent, that the movie suffers from an almost total lack of forward momentum (ie it  clumsily lurches from one broadly-conceived action set-piece to the next). It is, as such, not surprising to note that the efforts of an extremely capable cast fall flat, with most of the movie's performers trapped in the confines of one-dimensional, hopelessly underdeveloped characters. (This is especially true of the film's unwarranted emphasis on Sebastian Stan's tedious Winter Soldier.) Captain America: Civil War's lackluster vibe is compounded by the Russos mishandling of virtually all of its action sequences, as the filmmaking siblings' obvious discomfort with such moments (eg shaky camerawork, rapid-fire editing, etc) drains them of both their impact and their coherence. The much-ballyhooed battle royale that occurs around the halfway mark is admittedly quite spectacular, although it is, in retrospect, fairly obvious that the entire sequence could've been lifted out of the narrative with little negative impact. (This is to say nothing of the shoehorning-in of Tom Holland's Spider-Man.) And while the climactic fight between Evans and Downey Jr's respective characters is understated and intelligible, Captain America: Civil War has long-since confirmed its place as just another loud, overblown Marvel misfire - with the continued failure of these movies especially disappointing given the potential afforded by the larger-than-life characters. A minor improvement over Avengers: Age of Ultron, Avengers: Infinity War follows a variety of superheroes as they band together to fight and defeat a fearsome villain named Thanos (Josh Brolin). Filmmakers Joe and Anthony Russo have infused Avengers: Infinity War with a predictably erratic feel that persists for the duration of its insanely overlong running time of 149 minutes (!), with the movie's almost total lack of momentum perpetuated (and compounded) by a fragmented storyline that arbitrarily lurches from one sequence to the next (ie there's a palpable randomness to the placement of the movie's many, many subplots). The patchwork atmosphere ensures that the movie is rarely able to wholeheartedly sustain one's interest, with the  Russos' less-than-impressive directorial choices (eg most scenes are bathed in a darkness that quickly becomes off-putting) rarely alleviating the mostly underwhelming, unimpressive vibe. Having said that, Avengers: Infinity War has been suffused with a handful of overtly positive elements that ensure it remains, at the very least, watchable throughout - with the movie benefiting substantially from Brolin's surprisingly textured work as the completely computer-generated villain (ie the actor does a superb job of elevating Thanos above his one-note, Marvel-antagonist brethren). The smattering of agreeable attributes is ultimately crushed beneath the weight of a progressively excessive narrative, with, especially, the third act's preponderance of tedious, dimly-lit action interludes threatening to cancel out the marginally-effective nature of what came before (although, to be fair, the picture does end with an impressively low-key stretch that's probably more compelling than anything in this entire misbegotten series) - which finally does confirm Avengers: Infinity War's place as just another run-of-the-mill and somewhat irrelevant comic-book extravaganza."
"May 5, 2016",POSITIVE," In its comic-book form, Marvel’s Civil War was a mess in ways that the new movie deftly avoids. The seven-issue limited series, written by Mark Millar and released in 2006, aimed to situate superheroes in the world of practical politics. A team of young superheroes ambushes a group of villains in Stamford, Connecticut, for their reality show, an act that leads to a violent fight and explosion that kills 600 people, children among them. The public turns against superheroes, and Congress passes a registration act. As Daredevil says to a group of heroes debating the law: “[T]his has been building up for a long time. Stamford’s just the straw that broke the camel’s back.” Under more capable hands, this could have set the stage for a genuine debate over the ethics of superheroism. Should masked crusaders with incredible powers operate with full autonomy? Are they accountable to the public? What obligations do they hold to the damage they cause and the innocent lives they harm? Instead, readers were treated to a clumsy metaphor for the war on terror, where Tony Stark’s Iron Man joins the government’s registration push and arrests heroes who don’t comply (sending them to a superhero Guantánamo in the Negative Zone), and Steve Rogers’ Captain America is a civil libertarian leading a noble resistance. Any nuance in the conflict was squashed in favor of a plain-vanilla morality play that misread the core qualities of its central characters. (Somehow, the actual New Dealer in the story, Rogers, is the enemy of the government, while tech-triumphalist Stark is its stooge.) In the film, there is no registration act—just the “Vienna Accords,” drafted by the United Nations and meant to turn the Avengers into a strike force sanctioned by the U.N. Under the accords, our heroes intervene only when they have permission and stay on the leash when they don’t. The catalyst isn’t an incident as much as it’s a collection of incidents. The chaos of earlier films in the series—the destruction of Manhattan in The Avengers, of the fictional Sokovia in Age of Ultron, of Washington, D.C., in The Winter Soldier—as well as collateral damage in Civil War’s opening prompt a move to bring the Avengers under some kind of control. Tony Stark, anxious and grief-stricken after coming face-to-face with the human damage of his superheroism, signs the accords, bringing half the Avenger team with him. Steve Rogers, distrustful of authority and secure in his judgment, refuses. The two disagree, but don’t come to blows. Things change when authorities go after the Winter Soldier—aka Bucky Barnes, Captain America’s best friend—and a wall falls between Stark and Rogers, as former allies become rivals. This is the titular “civil war,” and it brings in a host of other superheroes, from familiar faces like War Machine, Falcon, Black Widow, the Scarlet Witch, and Ant-Man, to two new characters: Chadwick Boseman’s dutiful, imposing, and magnetic Black Panther, and Tom Holland’s nervous, excitable, adolescent Peter Parker, who are highlights of the film. (Civil War might be the first modern superhero movie with three black leads: Boseman, Don Cheadle as War Machine, and Anthony Mackie as Falcon.) The conflict between Iron Man and Captain America drives a wedge through this community of heroes. And they fight, in one of the most joyous cinematic superhero battles ever filmed, the closest thing we’ve seen to an on-screen splash page. What’s important, however, is that this isn’t the conclusion. There’s still more conflict, more pain, and more hurt to go between Captain America, Iron Man, and Bucky. Which gets to what distinguishes Civil War the film from Civil War the comic, and what makes it a unique entry in the Marvel canon overall. Civil War alludes to the politics of superheroism, but this isn’t a political film. There are tent-pole battles and huge spectacles—the chase between Captain America, Bucky, and Black Panther is an incredible example of deft cinema and showing character through action—but in the end this is a movie about friendships and conflict, and what can happen when the latter overwhelms the former. It’s about two genuine heroes who can’t reconcile their obligations and duties with the friendship they both cherish. It’s impossible not to compare Civil War to Warner Bros.’ Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice. They tackle similar themes—of collateral damage and the role of superheroes’ legitimacy—and they both bring a smorgasbord of characters and mythology to the table. But where Civil War is colorful and fun, Batman v. Superman is dour and dark. Where Civil War showcases the able filmmaking of the Russo brothers, Batman v. Superman reminds us that Zack Snyder is a stylist who can’t tell a story. And most importantly, where Civil War is rooted in character and emotion, Batman v. Superman is an excuse for spectacle. The heroes fight because that’s the movie they’re in, not because it makes sense. They’re not characters as much as they’re pieces on a $250 million board. That’s where the contrast with Civil War lies, and why Civil War is one of the best films to come out of Marvel Studios. Despite the huge ensemble cast and the expensive special effects, Captain America: Civil War is a human-sized affair. Yes, there’s a villain—Daniel Brühl as Baron Zemo—but he’s almost beside the point. Yes, there’s a final battle, but it isn’t the cataclysm of previous Marvel entries. It’s just two friends, tired and angry, whose mutual hurt and betrayal have brought them to blows."
"May 5, 2016",POSITIVE,"If there's something that we need to mention above civil war's perfect technical execution and rollercoster rythym, it's the way the characters connect with the audience after many years of exploring them. [Full review in Spanish]"
"May 5, 2016",POSITIVE," “United We Stand. Divided We Fall,” reads the poster art for Captain America: Civil War. I think the movie conveys a more pertinent and veracious feeling: “Even divided, we endure.” That’s downright Faulknerian for a comic-book movie, and not surprising for a Marvel production by the Russo Brothers, whose Captain America: The Winter Soldier was the film equivalent of a graphic-novel masterpiece. Civil War doesn’t reach that level, but it is solid, engrossing, and, in places, inspired. It fulfills the promise of the title and sometimes surpasses it with Brobdingnagian comedy and audacious mood swings. In this film, Tony Stark / Iron Man, the Avengers’ resident mastermind, and Captain America / Steve Rogers, the team’s leader, split over the question of whether they should submit to United Nations oversight and regulation. Shellhead says yes; Winghead says no. Stark / Iron Man recognizes that scores of innocent lives have been lost to collateral damage while he and the rest of the Avengers have saved Earth from Armageddon (twice). He argues that unless superheroes accept supervision willingly, more stringent controls will be forced upon them. Rogers / Captain America counters that accepting the UN’s proposal is a moral and political lose-lose, shifting responsibility for lost lives from the Avengers to their supervisors while wresting control of the superheroes’ powers from their own hands. For Joe and Anthony Russo and for screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, no social ideal is morally and intellectually pure, which automatically makes this film more adult than most contemporary political commentary. Is Stark open to supervision because he’s come to doubt his own judgment? Iron Man has been mulling over the mysterious death of his parents, who died before he could reconcile with his father; he also has come to recognize that his egocentric workaholism has driven his beloved Pepper Potts away from him. So he feels vulnerable when he’s guilt-tripped by the mother of a promising young man killed during the apocalyptic fight between the Avengers and Ultron. (The always-potent Alfre Woodard plays the aggrieved mom.) Rogers, for his part, ignores the UN plan partly because it would obstruct his ability to protect his former partner, Bucky Barnes / The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), a recovering programmed assassin who may have set off a bomb at UN headquarters in Vienna. As the tension between Stark and Rogers reaches breaking point, and their colleagues must choose a position, the men take sides out of loyalty or flattery. James Rhodes / War Machine (Don Cheadle), for example, stands by his Iron Man, while Sam Wilson / Falcon (Anthony Mackie) remains true to his Captain. The women are harder to pin down. Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), for maybe the first time, agrees with Stark. She also reckons that Rogers’s friendship with Barnes, and his conviction that he can salvage him from brainwashing, has clouded his judgment. But Romanoff can still cut Rogers a break, even after push comes to shove. Wanda Maximoff / The Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), feels guilt over catalyzing calls for Avenger supervision after her telekinetic powers cause a building to be bombed. She welcomes the soothing friendship of the synthezoid Vision (Paul Bettany), who sides with Stark, but she ultimately goes along with Clint Barton / Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), her main Avengers mentor, who comes out of retirement to help Rogers. The Russo Brothers don’t force the comic/dramatic friction among these characters—it emerges from the skill and personality of each actor. Downey is more dashing than ever in a role built around sardonic melancholy. Evans, a preternaturally square Captain America even when he goes rogue, makes a terrific foil for him, especially when Iron Man mutters, “Sometimes I want to punch you in your perfect teeth.” Actually, there isn’t a weak link in the cast. Olsen is alternately hyper-aware and moody as Maximoff, and as the Scarlet Witch she puts oomph behind her spell-casting, unlike what she did in Avengers: Age of Ultron, where she seemed to wield the sorcerer’s equivalent of jazz hands. Johansson is more fun to watch than anyone else mano to womano; she turns alertness and dexterity into super-powers as she practices an ultimate mix of martial arts, from extreme wrestling to parkour. One by one, the supporting players step to the plate and clean up, whether it’s William Hurt as the statesmanlike yet menacing Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross, Daniel Brühl as the haunted, enigmatic villain Helmut Zemo, or Martin Freeman as the smug counter-terrorism expert Everett K. Ross. The film hews to clean, involving storytelling logic. The essential virtue of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is that, on its own terms, it generates credibility. The key Marvel films don’t just make you believe that men and women can fly in intricate suits or that individual super-soldiers and hit people can take down entire cities—they also make you believe in a world where it all makes sense. The sparkling special effects aren’t merely glitzy, sugary eye candy. You won’t hear a niftier piece of exposition than Vision’s formulation of the Avengers’ existential dilemma: “In the eight years since Tony Stark announced himself as Iron Man, the number of enhanced persons has grown exponentially. The number of potentially world-ending events has grown at a commiserative rate…. There may be causality. Our strength invites challenge. Challenge incites conflict. Conflict breeds catastrophe.” In this elegant argument for oversight, the use of “enhanced persons” as a PC euphemism for mutants or human lab experiments is particularly clever. The filmmakers have embedded equal amounts of wit and purpose in the narrative, and that blend gives the film gravity—but without sobriety. The same goes for the action. In Civil War, when Captain America tells the Scarlet Witch “Let’s do this like we practiced,” it’s funny and thrilling to think that he can coax an out-of-control sorceress whose powers include telekinesis to try to become a commando. (Tragedy ensues because she’s not quite there yet.) Along with hyper-precise staging, what distinguish the set pieces are tempi that range from allegretto to presto. The “civil war” that erupts among Avengers foments filmmaking invention, not anarchy. It harks back to a comic-book tradition that predates the Avengers. DC’s Justice League of America, the progenitor of Marvel’s team comics, often found intriguing ways to break its corps of costumed superstars into manageable mini-dramas before bringing them together for a big finish. In the midst of all this, the Russo Brothers manage to introduce a dynamite addition to the MCU: T’Challa, crown prince (and then king) of the secluded, super-advanced African nation of Wakanda, who dons a clawed, bullet-deflecting big-cat suit midway through and becomes Black Panther. Chadwick Boseman (42, Get On Up) plays him with exhilarating black heat and, later, hard-earned wisdom. The showdown between Captain America’s team and Iron Man’s is marvelously entertaining, mostly because each side pulls in an offbeat ringer. Enlisted by Falcon, Scott Lang / Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) is so excited to be on Captain America’s team that he can’t restrain himself from feeling Rogers’s biceps. This unpredictable character’s presence and Rudd’s I-can’t-believe-I’m doing-this demeanor enable the Russos to pull off ingenious gags. One of Ant-Man’s tricks becomes the literal high point of the movie. On the other side, young Peter Parker / Spider-Man (Tom Holland) is so exuberant that he even infects the ultimate hardheads, Iron Man and War Machine, with his enthusiasm for reenacting a scene from The Empire Strikes Back. The Russo Brothers can’t find an elating way to come down from those giddy heights; the film’s final fight sequence is relentless and anticlimactic. It is pleasurable, though, to spend time with these actors, even when they’re clobbering each other. And by the end, every flashback clicks together with a satisfying snap. Captain America: Civil War isn’t as original or sustained as the previous Captain America movie, but it does meet the challenge of every serialized adventure—it makes you hunger to find out what happens next.

Here, you’ll find award-winning journalism not driven by commercial influences – a news organization that takes seriously its mission to uplift the world by seeking solutions and finding reasons for credible hope. With so many superheroes to choose from, “Captain America: Civil War” is a veritable Marvel smorgasbord. Most of it goes down easy, although the film is too much of what is, at best, a pretty good thing. The advantage of having all these Marvel characters in the same movie is that, if one subplot is not working, another, possibly better, one is sure to follow. The story line centers on who should have control of the superpowered – themselves, or the governments of the world. At odds are Captain America (Chris Evans), who bristles at any world oversight, and Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), who begs to differ. Choosing up sides is everybody from Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow to Paul Rudd’s Ant-Man. Even Spider-Man, looking distinctly boyish as played by Tom Holland, gets into the act. The film’s funniest moments come when Spidey, ever the fanboy, must square off against a few of his icons. The action, directed by Joe and Anthony Russo, is thuddingly effective without being terribly imaginative, but at least it’s not in the clobber-the-audience “Transformers” category. Downey Jr. persists in trying to give a real performance in these Marvel movies, and, against all odds, succeeds. I wish he would try to act more in movies that don’t require him to stand in front of a special-effects screen and wear a plastic suit.

"May 5, 2016",POSITIVE,The super-charged 'Captain America: Civil War' is a winner.
"May 5, 2016",POSITIVE," That's not the only way to do a superhero comic book movie, but it's dependable, reliable, comforting — like ordering at a chain restaurant. You know what kind of meal you're going to get every time, and you'll most likely enjoy it. ""Civil War"" centers around the ramifications of the events from ""Avengers: Age of Ultron,"" wherein the fictional nation of Sokovia was leveled, as well as a mishap in Lagos during an Avengers mission early in the film, which results in the loss of many lives. It's almost as if there needs to be some regulation on a band of superheroes romping about the globe, intervening in international affairs willy nilly. That's what Secretary of State Ross (William Hurt) believes, and Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) is inclined to agree with him, taking a more liberal, pro-government stance. Not quite in agreement is Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans), the libertarian type who is resistant to government intervention, and remains staunch in his beliefs that he knows what's right and wrong. His stance is exacerbated when his old buddy Bucky/The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) is framed for a bombing during a U.N. meeting to ratify the Sokovia accords. The film is refreshingly open to debate on this topic. Rather than pushing an oppressive or undisputed ideology, there's discussion about the nuances of the right way to do the right thing, that maybe there are many different ways to be right — you can follow the rules, or follow your beliefs. We're introduced to T'Challa Wakanda/Black Panther (Chadwick Bozeman), and his muscly feline prowess is a welcome addition to the team. As is the chipper teen enthusiasm of Peter Parker/Spiderman (Tom Holland). Though much of it can seem like crashing action figures together, the match-ups between the heroes of different powers are thrilling, and executed with humor and smarts. Marvel's marketing campaign has exhorted fans to choose #TeamCap or #TeamIronMan. Within the movie, this question becomes a debate between science and emotion, protocol and friendship. Neither is the wrong way, necessarily. The Avengers have always been powered by their shared collective power, so the friendship theme is important, but hammered home again and again in Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely's screenplay. America's brawny sweetheart puts on the nice guy airs, but he's loathe to see outside of his perspective, change his ways, or compromise. His old-fashioned, Greatest Generation schtick isn't quite as charming (or effective) this time around."
"May 5, 2016",POSITIVE," First it was Batman Vs. Superman, now it’s Avengers fighting Avengers as Marvel serves up Captain America: Civil War. KPBS film critic Beth Accomando says what DC got wrong, Marvel gets right.

CIVILWAR 1 (ba)

Captain America is on a roll. With Civil War the goody-two-shoes Marvel superhero delivers his third hit in a row. This time out he finds himself at odds with his fellow Avengers as he tries to protect his old buddy Bucky Barnes.

CLIP Sorry Tony you know I wouldn’t do this if I had any other choice but he’s my friend… so was I.

I’m not a big fan of these superheroes vs. superheroes plotlines. Villains you love to hate often make the best comic book movies for me – think The Dark Knight or the first Avengers. But Civil War succeeds where Batman Vs. Superman failed – it makes us care for both sides and finds the right mix of fun material and serious drama.

Beth Accomando, KPBS News.
 First it was “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,” now it’s Avengers fighting Avengers as Marvel serves up “Captain America: Civil War” (opening May 6 throughout San Diego). But what DC got wrong Marvel gets right. Captain America is on a roll. With “Civil War” the goody-two-shoes Marvel superhero delivers his third hit in a row. This time out he finds himself at odds with his fellow Avengers as he tries to protect his old buddy Bucky Barnes. The irony is that the square-jawed all-American hero turns out to be the renegade going against the government while the sarcastic, rebellious Tony Stark finds himself siding with politicians and agreeing to rules to govern the Avengers. I have to confess, I’m not a big fan of these superheroes versus superheroes plot lines. In comics, it’s an interesting twist to take but in a movie franchise where films takes years to make it feels an unnecessary diversion before we get to fight the real villains. Villains you love to hate often make the best comic book movies for me – think of Heath Ledger’s Joker in “The Dark Knight” or Terence Stamp’s General Zod in “Superman II” or Tom Hiddleston’s Loki in the first “Avengers” film.  But kudos to the Russo Brothers for making the best of a less than satisfying plot line. Plus they make “Civil War” succeed where “Batman v Superman” failed. The main failure of DC’s film was I didn’t care about anyone in it. It made no difference to me whether Batman and Superman fought or teamed up. They both seemed unmotivated in their hatred of each other and nobody seemed to be having a good time – except perhaps Lex Luthor. Everyone looked constipated and unable to shed that look of twisted pain although I’m told Wonder Woman cracked a smile in battle but it was so dark I apparently missed it.  Bottom line: “Batman v Superman” was a badly told story and that’s why the box office took such a steep downturn in the second week.  The Hollywood Reporter wrote, “Zack Snyder's tentpole tumbled 69 percent in its second weekend, tying with 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' for the second steepest drop in history for a marquee superhero title — only 2003's 'Hulk' did worse.” But “Civil War” is poised to not only have a super-sized box office opening weekend but to maintain a steady draw for weeks to come. The reason: it serves up an engaging narrative with characters we care about. We don’t want to see Steve Rogers and Tony Stark go at it; we want them on the same side fighting the real bad guys. The Russo Brothers, along with screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (who have written the previous two “Captain America” films), get that. They show us that despite differences the Avengers are a team but at the moment they are a team divided.  The film gives us scenes where the characters actually address that. There’s a serious tone to some of the scenes where they discuss the moral responsibilities they have as well as consider what abiding by rules set down by politicians and diplomats might do to their ability to fight crime and evil. Then to counter these serious moments there are still moments of fun, but levity that’s worked into the story and not just awkwardly inserted. So when Black Widow and Hawkeye are fighting they get to take a moment to ask if they are still friends but Scarlet Witch reprimands Hawkeye for pulling his punches. Then the film makes the point that there are real consequences when friends fight friends and people can get seriously hurt. I also love that the film can take a moment for a complete throwaway scene as when Bucky (crammed in the back seat of a ridiculous VW bug getaway car) asks Falcon if he could move his seat up and the disgruntled Falcon refuses. It’s really a nothing scene in terms of the plot but I appreciated that the filmmakers took the time for such an exchange. My only real complaint about the film, and especially in the 3D version I saw, was that some of the action looked bad and severely over cut. I wish American films would learn from Hong Kong action choreographers to shoot and edit fights in a manner that allows us to truly appreciate what is going on. There’s some nice stunt work and Black Widow has some impressive moves but too often the action just comes at us in rapid-fire flurries where we can’t always tell what’s going on. There isn't a scene like that breathtaking elevator fight from ""The Winter Soldier."" The cast is spot on once again and highly appealing. The filmmakers also get stellar actors for even small roles so Alfre Woodard has one scene as a grieving mom and Daniel Brühl brings some nuance to Zemo. Marvel finally got Spider-Man back into the fold (the character had been owned by Sony since 1999) and wisely cast the role with a relative unknown, Tom Holland. And Holland cracks wise and holds his own with the veterans of the cast. The only odd casting decision is to make Peter Parker's Aunt May hot by casting Marisa Tomei in the role. Previously she was played by older actresses like Rosemary Harris and Sally Field. Even Tony Stark thinks she's hot and that takes a little getting used to. It's also a bit uncomfortable having Steve Rogers taking a romantic interest in Sharon Carter (Emily VanCamp), the niece of his now dead girlfriend Peggy Carter.  “Captain America: Civil War” (rated PG-13 for extended sequences of violence, action and mayhem) delivers a highly entertaining comic book movie and proves that for the moment, Marvel is still beating DC at the film franchise level. But DC has the upper hand in terms of animated and live action TV with series like “Batman: The Animated Series,” “Justice League,” “Young Justice,” “Flash,” and “Arrow.” (My bad, I originally said ""Daredevil,"" which is Marvel, no excuse except I was writing at 2:00 am and my mind was thinking good comic book TV shows and not focusing on just DC.)"
"May 5, 2016",POSITIVE,"Splitsville followed by biffo, all with an extremely agreeable light touch."
"May 5, 2016",POSITIVE,"My biggest complaint --- and one I'm weary of repeating --- is the habit of such films to include massive carnage by bombings, guns, car chases, etc. ""Captain America: Civil War"" would have been every bit as entertaining without this excessive violence."
"May 5, 2016",POSITIVE,"""Captain America: Civil War"" has some surprises, but the battle scenes --- here we go again --- are far too long."
"May 5, 2016",POSITIVE,"   The action-packed and daring ""Captain America: Civil War"" is the most game-changing chapter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since — well, since ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier."" In that installment of the MCU, Captain America, aka Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), learned that the butt-kicking government agency he worked for, S.H.I.E.L.D., was infested by agents for Hydra, the evil cabal he fought back in World War II. He also found out his old Brooklyn buddy, Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), has been turned into a mind-controlled super-soldier. Cap's friendships with Bucky and with his current comrade-in-arms Tony Stark, aka Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), feed the fire in ""Civil War."" There's also political intrigue, vengeance and a boatload of new and returning characters. That's a lot to pack into one movie, even one that's 148 minutes (the longest in the MCU to date), but brothers Anthony and Joe Russo (who directed ""Winter Soldier"") make it worth the time. The first hour is spent laying the land mines that detonate spectacularly later. It starts with a solid action sequence, another mission to stop a bad guy. During the chase, there's a misfire that causes innocent deaths. Such collateral damage is getting all too common, declares Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt, reprising his ""Incredible Hulk"" role). Ross cites the Avengers' battle with the Chitauri in New York, the time Cap destroyed S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Washington headquarters and the fight against Ultron that leveled Sokovia. (It's also a fair comment about PG-13 action movies that ratchet up the body count in pursuit of bigger thrills.) Ross tells the Avengers they have to be reined in and put under the watchful eye of a United Nations panel under terms of  a treaty, the Sokovia Accords, signed by 117 nations. Stark, feeling guilty about too many innocent deaths, agrees the Avengers need oversight. Rogers disagrees, believing that when it comes to superpowers, ""the safest hands are still our own."" But while Stark and Rogers argue, and their superhero friends choose up sides, the movie's attention turns to another character: Zemo (Daniel Brühl), who has another agenda that springs into action when the U.N. meets in Vienna to sign the accords. Things go badly, and all signs point to the Winter Soldier as the culprit — leading Cap to go rogue to save his friend and learn the truth. How that plays out, in a sharp script by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (collaborating on their third ""Captain America"" movie), leads to some of the more intense passages ever put in a Marvel movie. It also turns former colleagues Stark and Rogers into bitter enemies. Not to give away more than what's in the marketing campaigns, but there are some hellacious action set pieces that bring in a slew of Marvel characters. Along with the returning heroes — Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), War Machine (Don Cheadle), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and Vision (Paul Bettany) — are two new heavy hitters: Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Spider-Man (Tom Holland).  That's a lot of balls to juggle, providing the necessary fan service and teasing future movies (Black Panther and the new Spidey have movies on the production schedule). The Russos do the juggling act masterfully, providing small moments for each character while keeping the central narrative moving. Unlike DC's attempt at staging a superhero battle, ""Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice,"" the fight between Captain America and Iron Man is based on something more than a silly misunderstanding. It's a real, and timely, disagreement on the limits of power and the trustworthiness of governments. Ultimately, I'm on Team Iron Man, because Cap is wrong about a superhero's capacity for self-governance, and his choices prove it. Here, unlike in the real world, the arrogant skirt-chasing billionaire has the right idea. It's that even-handed treatment that is the most audacious aspect of ""Captain America: Civil War."" In an era when Hollywood blockbusters telegraph every emotion they want audiences to feel, it's refreshing to find a movie that puts two heroes against each other and lets the audience decide who's right."

FILM REVIEW – CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR. With Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie. Written by Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely. Directed by Anthony Russo, Joe Russo. Rated PG-13 for extended sequences of violence, action and mayhem. 146 minutes. There was a time when Hollywood’s latching onto to the “Marvel Universe” seemed very clever. There were movies featuring the various superheroes individually with teases for what eventual became “The Avengers” (2012). It worked. Four years later, though, it’s getting a bit tiring. In order to fully appreciate CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR you will need to have seen all three “Iron Man” movies, both “Captain America” movies, both “Avengers” movies, and “Ant-Man.” Being familiar with “Spider-man,” “Thor,” and “The Hulk” wouldn’t hurt either. If you’re devoted to these characters, then this is second nature, but with each new entry requiring knowledge of so much back story–and there are many more films in the pipeline–it’s beginning to seem a little bit like homework. Here’s the new story: The Secretary of State (William Hurt) informs the Avengers that while some see them as heroes, many others see them as vigilantes. It doesn’t help that in their latest adventure, which opens the movie, the Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) protects Captain America (Chris Evans) from a bomb, inadvertently blowing up a building and killing a lot of innocent people. The solution is an agreement by 117 nations that would place the Avengers under the authority of the United Nations. For Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.) this is the responsible course of action. For Captain America, it is unacceptable. Thus when Zemo (Daniel Brühl), the film’s villain, activates Bucky/the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), the heroes are divided as to whether to take action or get authorization.  The rest of the film focuses on the conflict between Iron Man and Captain America, and the various heroes who align with one side or the other. Thor and the Hulk are absent from the proceedings, but we get not only Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Falcon (Anthony Mackie), War Machine (Don Cheadle), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), and Vision (Paul Bettany), all from last year’s “Avengers: Age of Ultron,” but also Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), and the newest Spider-man (Tom Holland). For the experts there’s also Sharon Carter (Emily VanCamp), the niece of Agent Carter–who knew Captain America in the 1940s,as well as Iron Man’s father (played by John Slattery). For extra credit, look for Marvel elder statesman Stan Lee in a cameo as a delivery man. Does it work? It’s a fast-paced movie for something running almost two-and-a-half hours. It raises an interesting question only to put the thumb on the scales on the wrong side (note which hero gets the film’s title), and then resolves the immediate story only to leave the larger issues hanging for movies to come. It’s sure to please those who beat up on “Batman v. Superman” because it mixes lots of quips in with the action, the moralizing, and the tragic revelations.  Daniel M.

"May 5, 2016",POSITIVE," It’s also about as close to “objectively better” as it gets. You never feel like you have to go online to find an explanation for a scene you just watched, the tie-ins actually feel tied in, and best of all, the characters don’t wax philosophic about the levels of meaning of their respective symbolisms before they stage a big punch-fight. It’s the greatest gladiator match in the history of the world! God versus man! Day versus night! Son of Krypton versus– SHUT UP, LEX, I’M TRYING TO WATCH THE MAN PUNCHING! Civil War‘s characters aren’t philosophers who mope around about “What does Superman even mean anymore” or “We were always criminals, Alfred,” they mostly just sort of act like children. When you strip away all the fluff, Civil War‘s conflict mostly comes down to this: Iron Man is mad at Cap’s friend, because Cap’s friend hurt Iron Man’s friends, and now the super-friends are torn apart based on who is whose better friend. Compared to a double daydream inspired by the one-percent doctrine, this actually counts as refreshing. It makes sense, at least. It’s not all puffed-up with existential buffoonisms while a manic Zuckerberg bounces around shouting the play-by-play. Best of all, the centerpiece action sequence actually lives up to the hype. That’s rare in the superhero genre, and even for Marvel, where these scenes often exist solely to fill out the trailer. Remember Tony Stark’s collapsing house in Iron Man 3? I can understand people hating the movie when I think of that, even if The Mandarin reveal and his fleeing henchmen are some of the best scenes Marvel has ever done. Point is, to shoot an action setpiece that rises above the din in a genre sold largely on the basis of action setpieces is to achieve the nearly impossible. Civil War does it, with tension, humor, and most amazing of all, wonder. Can you believe these are the guys who directed You, Me, and Dupree? Can you believe Marvel hired the guys who directed You, Me, and Dupree? Can you believe Marvel hired the guys who directed You, Me, and Dupree, and it worked out for them? That’s amazing.
 That said, the Batman V Superman comparison raises an obvious question: Do we really want to live in a Batman V Superman producer’s wet dream? It’s easy to be impressed by Civil War, it’s a lot harder to be happy about it. I mean good hustle, Marvel, but are we reviewing movies or a studio’s franchise plans? I used to think the answer to that was obvious, but it’s not anymore. Lots of people are, undeniably, into reviewing studio franchise plans. Hey, guys, great job making money! Much better than those other jerks, are we best friends now? Civil War has exactly one memorable scene (the previously-noted battle sequence team up). Civil War‘s main feat seems to be having created 147 minutes of reasonably entertaining #content while resolving nothing at all. Leave the resolution of all those storylines for future movies and television shows, I guess. Unlike Batman V Superman, Civil War also deserves a little credit for not ending with everyone having to team up to defeat some super bad guy or giant laser pointed at Earth. It ends instead, without spoiling too much, a lot like Ben Affleck’s The Town. It remains to be seen, however, whether this ending truly is a break with formula or if they’re simply saving the space laser for another movie. Even Guardians of the Galaxy, one of Marvel’s best, still ends with a space laser. (Hold for commenter explaining why, actually, that plot device wasn’t really a space laser. This kind of commenter seems to be the target audience for this movie, by the way, those who live to explain the extremely subtle gradations in the standard formula.) The entirety of Civil War is essentially a lover’s quarrel between The Avengers, the “they love each other but they just can’t get it together!” complication that goes at the beginning of the third act in every rom-com. Civil War manages to make that work pretty well, but as the philosopher Chris Rock once said, just because you can do something doesn’t mean it’s to be done. You can drive a car with your feet if you want to, that don’t make it a good f*ckin’ idea.

Captain America: Civil War is a masterful feat of juggling, but does it have to be? Do we even like jugglers? The main draw seems to be the high-wire act of keeping all these characters, from Hanglider Man and Jake Archery to Cat Dude and the Farrah Haired Assassin (Scarlett Johansson actually spends the entire first scene in a wrap-style leather business suit) involved in the story, despite the inherent ridiculousness of that. But there are some downsides to this approach. Do we really need to keep Hawkeye and Black Widow around when the Scarlet Witch can explode people’s hearts with her mind, and Vision, the computer entity made real, is floating through walls? Maybe develop what you’ve got instead of just teasing it. Jeremy Renner’s charm can only stretch so far. Also, I’ll say it: I miss villains. The charismatic supervillain was usually my favorite part of comic book movies, and they’ve been replaced by the machinations of shadowy cabals and Bourne-style procedural. Where’s the fun in that? And it’s not compelling in a cerebral way either, comic book plots ran out of real-world applications four movies ago. If you think I’m exaggerating about just how dry it’s gotten, the main source of conflict in Civil War is that the Avengers having to sign an agreement to be overseen by the UN. The UN! The UN couldn’t supervise the digging of a ditch, let alone a team of indestructible demigods led by a billionaire arms dealer who fly around on super-sonic jets that park in fortresses under the sea. You guys are seriously fighting over an agreement with the UN? There are ways Civil War could have sold this plotline. Like, maybe a slippery fella like Tony Stark was more okay signing an unenforceable agreement he knew he’d never stick to than Cap, the Greatest Generation Boy Scout who does what he says and says what he means. Or maybe this UN is a comic book version of the UN that actually has power and accomplishes things. But Civil War didn’t sell it that way. It gave us Vengeance! Sad! Laws! Friend! Punch time! (Along with a black SUV flipping over and someone landing in a tripod stance, the Wilhelm Scream of the MCU).. The consensus seems to be that Civil War is the best we can ask for of a comic book movie in the era of the expanded universe, and there’s certainly plenty of evidence of that. Namely the much crappier version that came out less than two months ago. But, I dunno, I’d like to think there’s still some room for improvement here.

"May 5, 2016",POSITIVE," “Captain America: Civil War” really is literature, with memorable characters, fascinating situations, revealing dialogue, action galore and the science fiction fans have loved for decades. This is a blockbuster among blockbusters, a must-see for any fans of the Marvel Comics Universe or the characters therein. Screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely are arguably among the finest contemporary writers. Captain America is my favorite character in this universe, although several others come pretty close. Because of his long-ago past, he continues to be a stranger in modern times, and his losses are profound. The show begins overseas, with The Avengers involved in a massive action sequence that includes car crashes, explosions and fistfights. While the superheroes manage to save many lives, they also destroy many in the process. Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) has another falling out with Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), who previously joined the Avengers in their battle against Ultron. The situation, which also involves Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), creates a controversy around the Avengers, who are viewed by some as out-of-control vigilantes. Stark favors legislation that will place the troupe under international control. But Captain America doesn’t see the point in limiting the team by placing someone else at the helm. That begins what amounts to a mammoth standoff that includes Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), War Machine (Don Cheadle), and Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) (and there are a couple of pleasant additions — one of whom is very young and another who is very tiny). Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan,) whose brain has been altered by sinister forces, returns as Captain America’s friend from decades before. Bucky says he’s being framed for a crime he did not commit, and Captain America further divides the team when he takes Bucky's side. The dialogue is full of one-liners — many of them hilarious — that reveal more about each member of the ensemble. Secrets are uncovered along the way, too, but it wouldn’t be fair to event hint at what those are. It’s movies like this one that confirm the low quality of such films such as “Mother’s Day.” Despite its big cast, ""Mother's Day"" has no character development: These are people who simply and predictably move around to force the plot along."
"May 5, 2016",POSITIVE,"CA:CV moves along at a brisk pace, the effects are fantastic and the superhero line-up is the best we have seen since Avengers Assemble. Bottom line, CA:CV is an entertaining film with some great action sequences."
"May 5, 2016",POSITIVE,"  After ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" sought to lay the groundwork for ""Justice League,"" Marvel's ""Captain America: Civil War"" assembles a dizzying dozen costume-clad heroes.   Marvel has made this notion of a ""cinematic universe,"" where multiple heroes co-exist, a foundation of its strategy, migrating the idea from comics to movies and TV.   ""Civil War,"" which is both thematically ambitious and extremely entertaining, feels like a culmination of those efforts. While lacking the label, it's basically a third ""Avengers"" film, and creatively the best of the bunch.   Directed by brothers Anthony and Joe Russo -- responsible for the well-regarded ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier,"" and the next ""Avengers"" -- the movie tackles a serious theme.   Specifically, Captain America (Chris Evans) and Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) wind up on opposite sides of a political debate involving tradeoffs to liberty in pursuit of security. In this case, that's about controlling these ""enhanced"" beings, with the U.S. government negotiating a global pact seeking to govern when and where they can take action.   To Captain America and those who rally around him, the precedent is dangerous. To Iron Man, it's simply pragmatic, given the collateral damage their heroics can inflict, and already have.   Well paced despite its near-2 ½-hour length, the movie features several elaborate, fast-paced sequences, building toward a showdown pitting the two groups of heroes against each other. Think of it as a basketball game, only with an abundance of high-flying and egregiously flagrant fouls.   Granted, this shouldn't come as a complete surprise, since these movies are designed to do more than tell an individual story; they are also tasked with whetting appetites for spin-offs and sequels. ""Batman v Superman"" not only brought in Wonder Woman before her featured vehicle but dropped in glimpses (commercials, really) for the Flash and Aquaman.   What's especially admirable about ""Civil War"" is that it manages to weave in those elements without losing its focus -- and more significantly, its sense of fun. Even during the central fight there are playful moments, such as Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) initially behaving like a tongue-tied fan, or Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) hoping they can still be friends when it's all over.   For some, the movie will doubtless feel too caught up in the larger Marvel universe as it careens from story to story. A few flourishes, as always, appear intended strictly to evoke gasps or chuckles from the handful of really committed fans that will get them. The ending is also a trifle messy, and rushed, and the villain (naturally, there has to be one) isn't particularly inspired.   Still, after a stretch where superhero movies have produced headache-inducing sequences with almost abusive computer-generated imagery, ""Civil War"" maintains a sense of humanity. The fights are fast, frenetic, and crowd-pleasing, but mostly avoid the trap of becoming hollow animated constructs. In that, the Russo brothers seldom lose sight of the fact it should feel like there are people underneath those masks and armor.   Nor should the movie's sheer scope be taken for granted. This marks a significant departure from the genre's past, even as recently as a few years ago. In those days, lone crusaders would usually be introduced -- complete with origin story -- and battle a single threat. Superheroes were James Bond, just with a more garish wardrobe.   What's changed? Special effects have obviously made the spectacle of multiple characters feasible. Growing international box office has also emboldened studios by increasing the likelihood that they'll see a return on these massive investments of $200 million or more on production.   While the idea of a DC-Marvel rivalry has been overstated -- as in the comics, there's room for both -- the former hurried the process in ""Batman v Superman,"" while Marvel assiduously built up to it. The result is a film that honors its comic-book origins while feeling like a massive spectacle. Moreover, ""Civil War"" touches on darker thematic elements without becoming grim or weighted down by the density of its mythology.   Simply put, when it comes to juggling multiple superheroes in a single movie, Marvel's latest comes close to setting the standard. And the studio, as well as the villagers, should have cause to rejoice. "
"May 5, 2016",POSITIVE," I would need 13 TED speakers and several flowcharts to detail every single thing going on in Captain America: Civil War. With a rising hero count close to bursting point, you’d be forgiven for thinking you were watching the third Avengers film. But as overwhelming as all this seems, the story stays incredibly focused on what defines Steve Rogers: never ignoring a civilian’s life, remaining true to a global view of freedom, and acknowledging the consequences of doing what you believe is right. With heroes battling heroes, those ideas strike harder than ever, and that’s what makes Civil War a great Captain America film. There’s also a heap of ass-kicking showdowns, so that helps. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo bring that grounded Winter Soldier touch to a number of key action scenes, including a stunning escape sequence that has Cap and Bucky turn a stairwell into a vertical pinball machine. But with more superpowers to show off, the Russos go beyond with a fantastic faceoff between the divided Avengers. Everyone gets a moment of badassery, a joke to crack, and a reason to be there (though some explanations are as light as “I’m always angry”). This quality extends to the introduction of Black Panther (who I want to be when I grow up) and the swift arrival of a new Spider-Man (who I wish I was when I wasn’t grown up). It’s also novel to see a Disney-Marvel film that doesn’t end in huge explosions, favouring a physically confined and emotionally charged finale. And while the Marvel Cinematic Universe has usually failed to provide memorable bad guys, Civil War’s villainous orchestrator ends up benefitting from being a forgettable person, for his motivation acts as the sharpened echo of the hundreds who felt ignored just like him."

"May 5, 2016",NEGATIVE," Well, whaddya know? You really can stuff too many superheroes into a 2½-hour movie, make them fight each other, throw in some mommy issues and, despite a muddled plot, actually leave audiences thrilled and hungry for more. Well, whaddya know? You really can stuff too many superheroes into a 2½-hour movie, make them fight each other, throw in some mommy issues and, despite a muddled plot, actually leave audiences thrilled and hungry for more. Captain America (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) are on a mission in Nigeria when a nearby office building is inadvertently destroyed. Cap, aka Steve Rogers, and Scarlet Witch, Wanda Maximoff to her friends, immediately recognize the horror. It’s one of a handful of moments of emotional heft in what’s otherwise a joyride of a movie. The final body count reveals 11 Wakandans were killed, which attracts the attention of Wakanda’s Prince T’Challa (Chadwick Boseman), who spends his downtime protecting his country as the masked hero Black Panther. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), meanwhile, is confronted by a State Department employee (Alfre Woodard), who slaps a photo of her dead son, a victim of The Avengers’ battles in Sokovia, to his chest. Guilt trip, ticket for one. So when the Secretary of State (William Hurt) presents The Avengers with the Sokovia Accords — a proposal backed by 117 countries that would place the heroes under the authority of a United Nations panel — Stark is the first to sign up. “If we don’t do this now,” he explains at one point, “it will be done to us later.” No longer the good soldier, Rogers isn’t having any of it. He doesn’t want to be sent to fight for something he doesn’t believe in — or be prevented from fighting for something he does. “It’s run by people with agendas,” Rogers says of the U.N., “and agendas change.” The tension between the two has been building since 2012’s “The Avengers.” With the fault lines exposed, all it takes is another devastating attack blamed on The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), aka Rogers’ childhood friend Bucky Barnes, for the team to split down the middle. Bucky’s a tragic figure. Over the decades, his Swiss-cheesed brain has been reprogrammed more often than a secondhand DVR. But at some point, Rogers is going to have talk to Dr. Phil about his codependency issues. I don’t care how many girls they hit on together at Rockaway Beach 80 years ago. Rogers needs to realize that Bucky’s just going to keep trying to kill him and everyone he cares about, and he needs to cut his losses. Unlike the “Batman v Superman” brawl that was just off-putting in its brutality, the six-on-six, heroes-vs.-heroes slugfest in “Civil War” is simply delightful. Sure, it’s mayhem. But it’s cleverly orchestrated, character-building mayhem. It’s also unexpectedly hilarious. There’s no slapstick, no wacky hijinks. But the action is complimented by a handful of solid, genuine, character-based laughs. The word “character” keeps popping up because the returning “Captain America: The Winter Soldier” team of directors Anthony and Joe Russo and writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely actually seems to care about making these people more than just guys and gals in funny outfits. A 10-second confrontation between Falcon and Bucky in a tiny car does more to develop those characters and reveal their relationships to each other than was accomplished during the entirety of “Batman v Superman.” “Civil War” also deftly continues to develop “Avengers: Age of Ultron” newcomers Wanda and Vision (Paul Bettany) during some quiet moments while bringing Black Panther and Spider-Man (Tom Holland) into the fold. Holland’s webslinger is easily “Civil War’s” best surprise. He projects a genuine sense of awe and wonder in the presence of the other heroes. And, despite holding his own in the action scenes, he comes across like a nervous kid — which is exactly what Peter Parker should be. Holland’s chemistry with Downey is off the charts. And Downey is terrific in his brief scene with Marisa Tomei, who offers a whole new take on Peter’s Aunt May. All of this bodes extremely well for the trio’s return in 2017’s “Spider-Man: Homecoming.” Sure, one of “Civil War’s” subplots is a bit of a dud. And it peaks about two-thirds of the way through, but that’s to be expected following one of the most sublime action scenes you’ll see all year. Around 800,000 doses of the vaccine are expected to be in place for the start of the rollout on Tuesday, a day that British Health Secretary Matt Hancock has reportedly dubbed as “V-Day,” a nod to triumphs in World War II.

"May 5, 2016",POSITIVE," Episode 13 of the very popular show “Marvel Cinematic Universe” is titled “Captain America: Civil War,” but it’s really more of an Avengers episode than a Cap episode, except that Thor and Hulk aren’t around. The rest of your favorites are here, though, plus the guy with the arrows. The internecine conflict within the Avengers arises from the world’s reaction to the collateral damage that occurs every time the Avengers save the world. Those climactic, destructive battles that have felt kind of repetitive and exhausting in some of these movies? Well, the people in the movies are starting to get tired of them, too. After what happened in Sokovia at the end of “Avengers: Age of Ultron,” the United Nations has drafted the Sokovia Accords, under which the Avengers would need U.N. approval before doing anything. And if the Avengers don’t agree to these terms? Then the Avengers are criminals. Somewhat surprisingly, Tony Iron Stark Man (Robert Downey Jr.) is onboard with this. He feels guilty about the death toll in Sokovia, especially after being confronted by the mother (Alfre Woodard) of one of the victims, and he believes the team needs oversight to maintain the public trust. Capt. Steve America Rogers (Chris Evans), on the other hand, believes the Avengers should remain independent. What if the U.N. sends them on a mission they don’t agree with? Or refuses to send them on one they feel is urgent? “We may not be perfect, but the safest hands are still our own,” says Capt. Rogers. The whole thing blows up when a meeting of the U.N., uh, blows up. The culprit appears to be Steve Rogers’ old friend Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), aka Winter Soldier, brainwashed and reprogrammed as an assassin. But Capt. Rogers thinks Bucky is innocent (of this, anyway) and wants to find him before the authorities do, as the authorities intend to kill him. That’s exactly the kind of off-mission endeavor the U.N. was talking about, and Tony Stark leads the faction that aims to stop Steve Rogers and HIS faction from circumventing the law. And that’s basically it: a team of good people is split by an ideological disagreement. It’s a smooth, simple conflict, easy to understand and succinctly explained by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely’s screenplay. Of course, like a soap opera, the movie must also address some of the individual characters’ story lines, and it has to set the table for the big Avenger-on-Avenger battle that will inevitably be its climax. That’s how a movie with such a smooth, simple conflict grows to be 146 minutes long, with the first 45 minutes serving as prologue. So it takes a while to get going, but once it does, it’s a blast. On Captain America’s side are Sam Falcon Wilson (Anthony Mackie), Wanda Scarlet Maximoff Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), the guy with the arrows (Jeremy Renner), and Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), fresh from his successful solo debut and starstruck to be working with Captain America et al. Over on Iron Man’s side, he’s got Lt. War Machine (Don Cheadle), Natasha the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), the thing that sounds like J.A.R.V.I.S. but is called Vision and is an all-knowing sidekick butler (Paul Bettany), and two newcomers: Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), an African prince whose father was killed at the U.N. bombing and who dresses like Catwoman; and Spider-Man (Tom Holland), a high school kid that Tony Stark picked up somewhere. When the two sides finally come to blows, it’s every bit as fun as you’d like a war between superheroes to be. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo shoot the action logically and coherently (i.e., you can tell what’s going on), and they make good use of the variety of personalities and superpowers involved. Since the combatants only want to thwart each other’s plans and not KILL each other, we’re able to enjoy the action as pure physical spectacle. It’s not a battle so much as a scrimmage — and scrimmages are fun. The new Spider-Man (who “Marvel Cinematic Universe” is pretending is the first Spider-Man because those other five Spider-Man episodes were in a different series) is a much-needed breath of fresh air, an eager, outgoing kid who’s delighted to be playing in his first match. (Ant-Man is similarly enthusiastic, proving yet again that Paul Rudd makes everything better.) Spidey is integrated seamlessly into the group — would that the missing characters’ absences could be explained as un-awkwardly as Spider-Man’s presence — and the Russos do an excellent job hinting at a rich backstory for Black Panther despite his limited screen time. Captain America doesn’t get as much attention as you might wish from a movie with his name in the title. He’s part of a team now, and not arrogant enough (coughIronMan) to turn the focus on himself unnecessarily. What I’m saying is that I think Captain America would be OK with being a co-lead in his own movie. He’s a good guy like that. We’ll see what the rest of this season of “Marvel Cinematic Universe” has in store for him."
"May 5, 2016",POSITIVE," By the
end of Captain America: Civil War,
there are no more pure heroes. The superheroes who are the central focus of the
film make poor decisions, form questionable alliances, and/or display and act
upon the sort of selfish motivations that we typically associate with the
villains of these stories. The
film's villain, by the way, seems to have the standard-issue plan for world
domination, but the truth of his motive is far simpler, more understandable, and
decidedly human. After so many of these movies have relied upon a generic
villain with a world-threatening plan to arbitrarily raise the stakes of the
story, it's refreshing to see one of these films actively toy with the notion.
More importantly, though, the villain becomes a reflection of a couple of the
heroes. If we can say that the story's villain somewhat resembles the heroes,
certainly we can also state that the heroes end up looking a bit like the
villain. All of
this complexity doesn't fully reveal itself until the film's climax, which
reduces the scale of the conflict to a very personal fight. Still, Christopher
Markus and Stephen McFeely's screenplay builds to it throughout the film, even
as it takes a few too many detours to continue to expand the scope of the
overarching universe that these Marvel movies have been constructing. Does this
film need to include all of the superheroes that make appearances here,
especially when the climax only depends upon three of the 11 superheroes that
the film includes? It doesn't, but for once, some of those diversions are
effective, particularly when the film introduces us to a new incarnation of a
certain web-slinging hero and offers an inventively staged battle royal between
two competing factions of superheroes. The
scope of the series' universe is, perhaps, necessary in this particular
instance, because this film is about the consequences of a world in which
superheroes have free rein to do whatever they see fit (Despite the title, the
film stops feeling like another Captain
America story fairly early). So far, the
results have been disastrous, as city after city has fallen victim to some
climactic battle. Here, the heroes are forced to watch the consequences of their
actions from the ground level, as edifices fall in various metropolises and,
during the prologue, an exploding bad guy kills a group of innocent people after
one of the heroes unwittingly launches the villain toward a building. The
superhero movie develops a conscience here, and the resulting battle between
factions is a fight over how to proceed from the moral conclusion that everyone
has drawn: When left to their own devices, ""enhanced humans"" are
potentially dangerous. Everyone believes these super-powered individuals should
take responsibility for the consequences of their actions. Steve
Rogers, aka Captain America (Chris Evans), believes that superheroes can and
should police themselves, lest they become caught up in the political morass of
wrong action or inaction. Tony Stark, aka Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr., offering
new layers to a character that seemed to have become static), believes that an
outside body with oversight should be in control of what the ever-growing team
of the Avengers does. He assumes that it's only a matter of timeand an
inevitably higher casualty countbefore that body leaves them no choice in the
decision. The
schism between the two heroes and their respective allies deepens with the
return of the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), a mind-controlled assassin who
was onceand still may beRogers' best friend Bucky. Rogers wants to protect
his old friend, and Stark, under orders from the U.S. government and the United
Nations, wants to bring him in for prosecution. Lines
are drawn. Old characters, such as Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Falcon
(Anthony Mackie) and War Machine (Don Cheadle), return. New ones, such as the
vengeance-seeking Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and the villainous Zemo
(Daniel Brühl), are introduced. Vision (Paul Bettany) remains a
nearly-omnipotent bore while he tries to assuage the guilt of house-arrested
Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen). Even the absence of certain characters, which
is typically treated as a joke in these movies, means something: The Secretary
of Defense (William Hurt) equates the Avengers being unable to account for two
of their members to the United States losing track of a pair of nuclear weapons. We get
what we expectthe action sequences, which are diverse and finely
choreographedand what we don'tthe tough ideological and ethical questions
of what the role of superheroes should be in a world that, in some ways, they
possibly may have made worse. In the midst of a kinetic sequence that pits the
conflicting sides of heroes against each other, we even get a gag of two
tiny-animal-inspired heroesAnt-Man (Paul Rudd) and Spider-Man (a
pitch-perfect Tom Holland, combining the aw-shucks wonder and amusing
awkwardness of being a teenage superhero)duking it out on an airport tarmac.
Within the full picture of that sequence, directors Anthony and Joe Russo let
the characters show off their skills and indulge in their gimmicks without
abandoning logistical cohesion or losing the central idea that there are
consequences to the chaos. There's
a lot going on here (as is becoming the norm with these movies, perhaps too
much), but it's balanced by the fact that there's a lot to digest, too. Captain
America: Civil War may look as if it's made from and operate as if it's
beholden to the mold of the regular, old superhero movie, but it doesn't feel
that way. Even superheroes cannot always save the day. There are some battles
that no one wins."
"May 5, 2016",POSITIVE," At a certain point in “Captain America: Civil War,” a gaudily clad superhero — I forget which one — says to another gaudily clad superhero, “This doesn’t have to end in a fight.” There you have the entire plot and pleasure of the latest Marvel whamalama, a fantasy-action juggernaut that worries mightily about the uses and abuses of (super)power only to pile on the battling brand-names. It’s a blockbuster behemoth that’s light on its feet, a movie that worries about collateral damage, team loyalty, and personal and international responsibilities — and then corrals every Spandexed or armor-clad warrior in Stan Lee’s phonebook for a mid-movie dust-up that’s absurd comic-book fun. This comes as a surprise, for the “Captain America” movies have always been the most self-serious of Marvel’s current franchise extensions (i.e., what we used to call “movies”). The last installment, 2013’s “Captain America: The Winter Soldier,” dealt with drone warfare, among other real-world concerns. The new “Captain America: Civil War” sounds like it might be tackling our broken political system. No such luck. The “civil war” of the title refers to the divided factions of caped crusaders, one wing of which wants to sign a UN-backed “Sokovia Accords” that will put all superheroes under international oversight. The other faction wants none of it, in part because there are still bad guys out there with murky, nasty plans. “If we sign this, we surrender our right to choose,” insists Captain America (Chris Evans). “If we don’t do it now, we’ll have it done for us later,” says Tony Stark, a.k.a. Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.). If you’re going to have a high school debate, I guess these are the guys you want heading up the teams. (Note: Spoilers by necessity follow, so if you’re the sort who reads reviews without wanting to know what’s actually in the movie, the exit’s that way.) Having almost destroyed the planet by accident in last year’s “The Avengers: Age of Ultron,” Stark has a case of the guilty yips, and he wants his fellow “enhanced individuals” to stand down on the orders of the US Secretary of State. (The latter is played by a trim, dynamic William Hurt with a late-period Paul Newman vibe.) Captain America, true to his name, doesn’t like to be told what he can and can’t do. He realizes his old Brooklyn pal Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) is the brainwashed supervillain known as the Winter Soldier but believes the latter has been framed for the new movie’s terrorist acts and that some shadowy Other is pulling the levers of evildoer-y. That’s all you really need to know about the plot: two guys and their friends having an interoffice spat. So why is “Captain America: Civil War” guilt-free popcorn even for a non-fanatic? Because the filmmakers — returning co-directors Anthony and Joe Russo and writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely — understand that they’ve built up a vast ensemble of character types, all of them played by better-than-average actors, and that they can mix and match the drama, comedy, or action as they see fit. In addition to Cap, Stark, Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) from the “Avengers” cadre, we have Iron Man’s friend “Rhodey” Rhodes, a.k.a. War Machine (Don Cheadle) and Captain America’s fellow veteran Falcon (Anthony Mackie). From the last “Avengers” movie, we have the touchingly emo Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and the maroon super-guru Vision (Paul Bettany), who spends the first half of “Civil War” as the movie’s unofficial C-3PO before getting to be interesting. Thor and the Hulk sit this one out; maybe they’re off having a beer. But wait, there’s more! Chadwick Boseman essays Prince T’Challa of Wakanda, who in a vengeful pique puts on a sleek ebony suit to become Black Panther. (What with Ta-Nehisi Coates’s revamp of the comic book, it’s been a very good year for this character.) Furthermore, the warring factions call on Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and a young Spider-Man (Tom Holland) for respective back-up. First, every movie should have Paul Rudd in it, especially the ones in danger of taking themselves too seriously. His superpower is blue-eyed snark. Second, the Spider-Man sequences, maybe 20 minutes in total, are so superior to the wretched recent reboots with Andrew Garfield that you’re actually glad the property is back in Marvel/Disney’s corporate hands. The movie grounds these cartoons with the right amount of psychology and lets the cast impart top-spin to their lines; you happily go along for the ride. And when “Captain America: Civil War” lets all these characters just whale on each other in an extended sequence two-thirds of the way in, it doesn’t bring the movie to a screeching halt (as in “Age of Ultron”) or turn into a headachy bore (as in the recent “Batman v Superman: Sorry We Asked”). It’s delirious multiplex pop art, stopping just short of the animated “pows!” of the old “Batman” TV series. Of course, the movie still has 40 minutes to go, and the other action sequences feature a stutter-start camera/editing technique that quickly turns annoying. But at least “Captain America: Civil War” forgoes the cliched doomsday-clock finale, throws in a red herring (or five), and provides its master villain with a human motivation instead of a galactic one. Too many superhero movies pull their muscles straining to convince us the world’s about to end; the title alone of the upcoming “X-Men: Apocalypse” is enough to make you flinch. This one just allows us to inhabit its make-believe world for two hours plus, and then sends us back to reality amused, entertained, and only slightly exhausted. It’s nonsense that knows its name.

"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL," “Captain America: Civil War” is really the third “Avengers” movie, and it’s the “We Are the World” of the multiplex. There are many beloved figures. We want them to be great. But “star quantity” is not a thing. Gushing with hundreds of second-string superheroes, “Civil War” ought to delight Comic-Con goers, bless their virgin hearts. It’s better than the jokey, tiresome “Avengers: Age of Ultron” or “The Amazing Spider-Man 2.” But after the first two “Captain America” entries, the finest comic-book movies of the last five years, this one is disappointing. The story doesn’t make sense: After two crashing but routine action scenes in Vienna and Nigeria result in civilian casualties, the world demands the Avengers be regulated — and the US secretary of state (William Hurt) not only agrees but threatens to lock up the Avengers if they don’t comply. America’s top diplomat wants to neutralize our advantages? So far, so John Kerry — and the Avengers get lectured on their lack of democratic accountability . . . by a king. But here’s what’s ridiculous: Notoriously arrogant, individualistic and brilliant Tony Stark, a k a Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), readily agrees to bureaucratic oversight. Huh? A handful of innocents were killed in Africa because the Avengers were saving millions from a deadly virus (this is the same plot as “Batman v Superman,” indicating our highest-paid screenwriters have now had their imaginations captured by the administrative state). So all superhero greenlighting duties should be turned over to a UN committee? So Cuba and Uzbekistan can filibuster when a nuclear-irradiated praying mantis the size of Philadelphia is chomping the top off the Empire State Building? Time would be of the essence when the world is under alien attack, so why is Stark suddenly as dumb as a box of Thor’s hammers? Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) is on Team Iron Man while Captain America (Chris Evans) and Falcon (Anthony Mackie) have misgivings, which leads up to the only first-rate scene in the movie: a 15-minute blowout at an airport in which a dozen superheroes cheerfully slug it out, in part on behalf of the Winter Soldier, Captain America’s best friend Bucky (Sebastian Stan), who is alternately good and evil depending on the whim of the moment. An amusing cameo from the new Spider-Man, now played by Tom Holland, helps give the scene its sparkle. That fight — cute though it is, and balancing humor with action as last year’s “Ant-Man” (a much better film) did so well — suffers from a lack of stakes. It amounts to a touch-football game in which no one is really trying to hurt anyone. A later skirmish is fierce, but so weakly motivated that a letter of apology is all that’s needed for all to be forgotten. Christopher Nolan’s “Dark Knight” movies were long because they had a lot of story to tell, but this one is long because it wastes time on the JV squad: Does anyone care about Elizabeth Olsen’s witchy-poo act or that silly Sterno snowball she’s always juggling? Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) is as dull as kitty litter, and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) is a glorified water boy. Nor do we need two Iron Men, so Don Cheadle’s War Machine needs to go, as does Paul Bettany’s Vision, who isn’t funny enough to be comic relief. They are to saving the world what Al Jarreau and Daryl Hall are to music."
"May 5, 2016",POSITIVE," It’s a wonder that we haven’t suffered collective superhero fatigue. After all, the comic book movies, be they Marvel or DC, dominate the multiplexes, as well as both the domestic and foreign box offices and the pop-culture landscape. But despite the reduction in originality and quality in recent years, audiences keep turning out. The Marvel films in particular have seemed like little other than giant ads for the next Marvel movie, as well as the enormous lines of licensed merchandise sold across the globe. All of this is just part of what makes “Captain America: Civil War” so refreshing. Directed by Joe and Anthony Russo, who also helmed “Captain America: Winter Soldier,” the new movie is the biggest of all the Avengers films, and perhaps the most satisfying.  It doesn’t quite reach the majesty of Christopher Nolan’s “The Dark Knight,” but it feels as though the franchise is growing up. It also features a slew of heroes confronting true ethical and moral dilemmas, action sequences that are exciting to watch and, for once, easy to follow, and a shattering of alliances we’ve all come to take for granted.  Like the last “X-Men” movie, which will be followed up in just a couple of weeks, it reinvents the Avengers and opens the door for the group’s next two epic pictures, “Infinity War,” which will be released in two parts in 2018 and 2019.  But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. “Civil War” works because the plotting is intricate and detailed, plus there are very few new characters, so we don’t have to spend time getting to know them.  The regulars who are the most enjoyable — Captain America (Chris Evans) and Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) — get the most screen time, but the supporting heroes are given enough to help them evolve.  Clocking in at just under 21/2 hours, it’s a movie that hits all the right marks and never lags. One of the best things about the “Civil War” story is that people actually die. People dying isn’t a good thing, of course. But it’s unavoidable, and in all the comic book movies, amid the massive destruction of cities and countries, we know inherently that people — innocent bystanders, folks who are just in the wrong place at the wrong time — must perish. “Civil War” takes that idea on and make its heroes emotionally accountable for their actions.  That starts immediately. While trying to prevent a team of bad guys from stealing a biological weapon in Africa, Wanda (Elizabeth Olsen), creates an explosion that, while saving the lives of many, takes the lives of a few. After the mishaps and devastation of the many previous films, that’s enough to force the United Nations to step up and demand that the Avengers submit to government oversight. Some of the members of the team agree, others do not, and this creates a schism between them. Making matters worse, the meeting where the accord is to be signed is attacked, and it appears to be the work of the Winter Soldier, aka Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), Captain America’s childhood friend and the victim-villain of the previous movie. That sequence, where a dozen superheroes battle it out at an airport, is spectacular. It looks amazing, it’s easy to follow, and there really are consequences for their actions. New heroes like Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and yes, a new Spider-Man (Tom Holland) are introduced, and they fit seamlessly into the game.  But though the action sequences are some of the best to date, it’s the meticulous scripting and wonderful character development from Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely that makes “Civil War” better than most, if not all, of this part of the Marvel universe.  There’s also a great subtlety to it in its bad guy, the Machiavellian Zemo (Daniel Brühl). Sure, his scheme on the whole seems, on reflection, fairly implausible, but it is a comic book movie, after all. The simple fact is that he is just a man with the ability to take advantage of his foes as people, rather than superheroes. Yes, it’s bigger than everything that’s come before, but it’s also better, and that’s a trait not usually reserved for a film this deep in a franchise. This year’s other inductees include Foreigner, Kool & The Gang and A Tribe Called Quest. Honorees in the Musical Excellence and Musical Influence categories included Dionne Warwick, MC5, John Mayall and Jimmy Buffett."

"May 5, 2016",POSITIVE,"Humor becomes a resource that saves the film. But even when that, the superhero formula is starting to feel old. [Full review in Spanish]"
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL,...works better as big group caper film than action extravaganza.
"May 5, 2016",POSITIVE,"Heroes fighting each other over a misunderstanding or ideological conflict is a longtime comic book staple. Batman v Superman is a great example of the exact wrong way to present this sort of conflict. ""Civil War"" nails it."
"May 5, 2016",POSITIVE," Nobody ever accused Marvel Studios of not playing the long game. With Captain America: Civil War, weâve now entered Phase 3 in the Marvel Cinematic Universe rollout/cash grab. But I do wonder if the MCU masterminds anticipated Civil War would be a better Avengers movie than, well, the last Avengers movie. While not all card-carrying members of that superhero supergroup report for duty here (Thor and the Hulk sit this one out), promising new recruits like Chadwick Bosemanâs steely Black Panther and Tom Hollandâs eager-to-please teen Spider-Man are introduced âÂ fresh fodder for future phases. You know this franchise is going to outlive us all, right? Thatâs a little bit chilling, considering the ripple effect these movies have had on popular entertainment â in Marvel Studiosâ super-saturation of the market, its double-dog-dare-ya to other studios inspired to launch their own hydra-headed franchises, and the lamentable squeezing out of midrange budgeted studio films (go big or donât bother seems to be the mantra these days). But thatâs a conversation â maybe a funeral dirge â for another day. For now, why not enjoy the contact high from Civil War? Joss Whedonâs swan song Avengers: Age of Ultron was a bit of a slog, but it laid necessary groundwork for a growing rift between Captain America (Evans) and Tony Starkâs Iron Man (Downey Jr.) that turns chasmic in this follow-up. Notably the second superhero movie of the spring to hang its plot around collateral damage âÂ is conscience catching? â Civil War hinges on a public outcry for accountability and oversight. Which sounds about as sexy as the minutes from a zoning meeting, but in practice makes for a toothsome debate. Stark, troubled by the win/loss ledger of their Age of Ultron battle in Sokovia (âVictory at the expense of the innocent is no victory at all,â Alfre Woodardâs grieving mother schools him), sides with UN officials wanting to register and rein in the superheroes, while Capâs healthy suspicion of authority and his uber-patriotic defense of civil liberties compels him to defy U.N. orders to comply. Thatâs a hard line in the sand that forces the various Avengers to pick sides, but the filmâs sympathies are strategically fluid (or flip-floppy, if youâre feeling cynical; donât want to burn any bridges when weâve got Phase 8 on the horizon!). As with Captain America: The Winter Soldier, returning directors Anthony and Joe Russo confidently assemble the action set-pieces but mount in the downtime stretches a sly audition reel to take over the Bourne franchise, or maybe the next le CarrÃ© adaptation: The sturm und drang that gets asses in seats never feels perfunctory, but you get the feeling their hearts thump hardest for the spy-intrigue shoe-leather in between the fight scenes. (Marvel is all in with the Russos; theyâre also slated to direct the next Avengers extravaganza, the two-part Infinity War.) Also returning from Winter Soldier are screenwriters and Marvel vets Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, creators of the TV offshoot Agent Carter and tapped to write Infinity War. They also co-wrote Thor: The Dark World, in which they smartly opted for a mano a mano final battle, and not the heroes vs. an anonymous swarm of villainy so common to these movies. That lesson carries over here: Civil Warâs main battle sequence is so effective because itâs six-on-six, and weâve spent the past decade getting to know the combatants. Friends turned hesitant foes, they pull their punches, but the effects donât â the whole point of being super-powered is so you can be flung against a wall or off a roof to no real damage, but the audience gets a dizzy rush anyway (the 3-D is top-notch). Apologies are made mid-wallop, and jokes cushion the blows, but thereâs no doubting this is personal, for the reluctantly warring Avengers, and the paying audience, too. After so many forgettable baddies, and so much random blasting, itâs nice to put a name to the face when the Black Widow (Johannson, third-billed but forever playing backup) jujitsus her best friend, Clint (Renner), or when Iron Man and Capâs brotherly bond is broken. Thirteen films in, thatâs a real return on investment.

"May 5, 2016",POSITIVE,"The players salvage this thing with their acting and awesome thighs, and the fun really kicks in when Spider-Man (Tom Holland), Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), and Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) join the squabble in an exhilarating airport sequence."
"May 5, 2016",POSITIVE,"It's not a great superhero fantasy but it's a good one -- genuine fun, thank heaven."
"May 5, 2016",POSITIVE," Instead of battling an external enemy, this latest offering in the Marvel Cinematic Universe finds humanity’s protectors reluctantly fighting an internal conflict that divides friends. The impetus for the story is the collateral damage — human and property — inflicted by the various superheroes in their previous clashes to save the world and protect the planet. As a smug Secretary of State Ross (William Hurt) points out, thousands were killed in New York, Washington, D.C. and Sokovia during the Avengers crusades to save the world. It seems the United Nations has passed the Sokovia Accords, which will place the Avengers under the U.N.’s jurisdiction, nullifying their ability to simply decide for themselves who, when and where to fight. Steve Rogers-Captain America (Chris Evans) is more of an idealist, believing the Avengers should not be under the constraints of any politicians or organization, that they should be free to deal with any threats whenever and wherever necessary. Sides are chosen: Supporting Iron Man — and agreeing to sign the accords — are Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson), War Machine (Don Cheadle) and Vision (Paul Bettany). Allying with Captain America are Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Cap’s lifelong friend, Bucky Barnes aka Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan). Events go awry when Barnes is blamed for a deadly terrorist explosion on the U.N. facility in Geneva, where the accords are to be signed. “Captain America: Civil War” uses a plot device seen a few months ago in “Batman v Superman: The Dawn of Justice.” That is, the emotional and political fallout from the deaths of thousands of innocent civilians in the course of doing what is necessary to save billions. In “Civil War,” at least, it is handled in a more rational manner than in ‘BvS,” in which vigilante justice seemed to be the sole recourse. Here, at least, a world body weighs in and votes that restraints were necessary. The film also marks the debuts of Chadwick Boseman’s Black Panther and Tom Holland’s Spider-Man, both of whom come to the aid of Iron Man and his cohorts. How the emotional dynamics of the schism impacts the characters is what elevates “Civil War.” These are friends and comrades forced to fight for their beliefs. Each blow they inflict on each other is as painful to them as it is to their opponent. The centerpiece of the movie definitely is the throw down at the Leipzig airport, where the two sides bash each other with all their resources. Yet, even in the midst of this intensity, flashes of humor are evident to lighten the tone. Credit must be given to directors Anthony and Joe Russo, as well as writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, for creating such an energetic and entertaining movie. With the Avengers now at odds, it will be interesting to see how the gradual healing of this rift takes shape in future films. I am confident that Marvel and their heroes will rise to the occasion.

"May 5, 2016",POSITIVE," His origin story The First Avenger and his second outing Winter Soldier were both fine examples of what Marvel superhero movies could be - that is, if you didn't cram them with Marvel superheroes. This, though, is pretty much Avengers 3: Family Feud. It might lack one space Viking and one big green guy - they're off being made funny by Taika Waititi in the next Thor movie, hopefully. It's crowded. It's long and it's got other stuff to do than just be Captain America III. It's acting as a launching pad for a couple of new Marvel men in spandex - the arrival of Spider-man/Peter Parker (Tom Holland) after he's recruited by Tony Stark is a joy - and developing some relatively new arrivals. Which is all well and good but that overstuffed feeling that marred those Avengers films is present here, especially as it heads past the two-hour mark. That said, Civil War makes some interesting moves along the way. It doesn't have a cosmic supervillain to overpower, just a smart guy (Daniel Bruhl) with his own agenda and deft puppetmaster skills. After the movie's opening set-piece leaves yet more civilians dead to add to the toll from Ultron, the Avengers are pressured by the US government (William Hurt, now Secretary of State having been a Hulk-chasing army general) to accept the oversight of the United Nations (Paging Helen Clark, a Tony Stark is here to see you ... ). Their stances do kind of make sense - Stark is feeling guilty for unleashing Ultron and there is his arms dealing past; Rogers experienced the corruption and destruction of their supposed protectors S.H.I.E.L.D. up close in Winter Soldier. And so the tension escalates between the factions, and after an event which introduces African superhero Black Panther, they are duking it out on the apron of a German airport. Because everyone gets grumpy while in transit. There, the arrival of Spider-Man and Ant-Man on Team Stark and Team America respectively help keep the action in hyper-slapstick mode, before, inevitably, someone gets hurt and everyone feels guilty. But, of course, that's not the end of it. And of course, this is just the beginning of it - this film marks the start of ""Phase 3"" of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. That might explain why - even as it tries to be different and attempts to be as distinctive as its Captain America predecessors, and spectacular and funny as it frequently is - Civil War feels like just another overstuffed Marvel movie working itself through a brand strategy checklist. Plenty will he happy with that. And yes, it's rather more fun than the last time a couple of superheroes went at it on the big screen."
"May 5, 2016",POSITIVE," From Iron Man to Guardians of the Galaxy to Thor, the company has honed a rhythm and a pattern that encourage consistency; the result is that none of the studio's films, regardless of who's in the director's chair, will ever stray too far from the crisp, almost bookish Marvel formula (good guys don't know they're good guys; good guys squabble; jokes are made; bad guys acquire devastating weapon; more jokes are made; good guys come together to defeat the Big Bad, etc.). The most common criticism of this approach is that the company's blockbuster behemoths come away from this formula feeling clinical, that they're soulless, corporate exercises obscured by flash and gloss. And we're all too busy grading on a curve  to notice. After seeing Captain America: Civil War, which is perhaps the most quintessentially Marvel movie about the most perfect and soulless superhero in the company's war chest, I say: Fuck that noise. Directed by brothers Joseph and Anthony Russo (who also directed Marvel's second Captain America film, 2014's The Winter Soldier), Civil War is a crackling bundle of celluloid that reminds us of just how dazzling superheroes can be. They have the unique ability to bring us sweet joy, to make us question our own morality, and to leave us in sheer awe. There is a moment in the new film where Chris Evans's Captain America bicep-curls a helicopter. A man bicep-curled a helicopter, and it touched my soul. If loving Captain America: Civil War is to love a soulless beast, then just leave me here. Let me lie back and dream of the English countryside as Chris Evans bicep-curls me into oblivion. And don't wait up. Civil War is loosely wrapped around a political skeleton: After cities like New York, Washington, DC, and Lagos, Nigeria, are caught in the crossfire between good and evil,   Captain America and his fellow Avengers are given a choice: Either sign away their autonomy to the United Nations, or retire. It's an incredibly difficult decision to make, since Captain America and his friends are professional fighters; it's not like Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) can just start selling yoga pants at Lululemon or Falcon (Anthony Mackie) will be just as happy teaching diners how to construct lettuce wraps at P.F. Chang's. Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) sees regulation as a necessity, the only thing that separates superheroes from supervillains. Captain America wants no part of that. Cap believes that becoming a free agent for the United Nations means fighting other people's wars. But at its core — without giving too much away, because the plot is incredibly intricate and riddled with spoilers — Captain America: Civil War is about friendship. Peel back the layers of sparkle and shine, the muscles on top of muscles, the zipping around through the sky, and all the brutal fights, and you've got a movie that earnestly believes our friendships have the power to define us, and to reveal humanity at its best. Steve Rogers, a.k.a. Captain America, started off as a fascinating, faintly plastic character in Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), graduated to comedic foil in The Avengers (2012), transitioned into a man out of time and place in The Winter Soldier (2014), and became a de facto leader at the end of Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015). Civil War represents the summation of Rogers's journey; in the four years or so since he's been thawed from his deep freeze, he's finally figured out who he is. And Evans has evolved right alongside his character, becoming a fine actor who easily holds his own against Downey as Iron Man, Civil War's main jerk/villain. Evans's role is less flashy than Downey's. His dialogue isn't peppered with one-liners or doused in sardonic humor. His most emotional scenes sometimes feature only him and his chiseled jaw. His character, Steve Rogers, is the kind of man who probably spends his days off just driving along an open road in a Volvo, 5-star safety rating and all, a mere 7 miles an hour above the speed limit. Yet Evans manages to infuse Rogers with a sense a dignity and humanity that makes the film work and gives the audience confidence that they've picked the right man. This entire movie depends on viewers taking Rogers's side and agreeing with him that superheroes should be free to run fast and loose despite the fact that letting them operate unregulated would never happen in real life. There's no way anyone would want superheroes, some of whom could level an entire city in an afternoon, running around without being subject to any laws. Just look at the way so much of the world stops and drops what they're doing whenever North Korea so much as musters up a fart. There's also the fact that Sebastian Stan's Bucky Barnes is basically the romantic lead of this film opposite Rogers. Rogers would do anything for his BFF Barnes, including breaking international law and risking precious things like the lives of his fellow Avengers. And Rogers's love for Barnes, just like his desire for unregulated freedom, must be compelling and convincing for Civil War to succeed. A misstep here or an unconvincing performance from Evans there, and Civil War would begin to crumble, because Iron Man has logic on his side. But it never does, because Evans is determined to make a believer out of you. In fact, there's never a moment where you'll think Rogers might be wrong. And that's all a testament to Evans's strength and evolution as an actor in this franchise. It's like the creative team at Marvel got an early look at Batman v Superman and took it upon themselves to show the executives at Warner Bros. how to make a superhero-versus-superhero film built on many of the same themes as Batman v Superman but that isn't a dark hurricane of disappointment and stink. The two films share similar parallels (see: the importance of parents and billionaire antiheroes) and themes (see: accountability, heroism, etc.). Both movies also feature the introduction of new heroes. But Marvel is just operating at a different level. Played by Tom Holland (a genetically engineered human who's seemingly spliced from the best parts of Jamie Bell and Josh Hutcherson), Spider-Man has once again undergone a reboot (Holland is the third Spider-Man in 14 years). But in Holland's winsome hands, and under the joyous, self-aware supervision of the Russo brothers, it's one that you hope will stick. Because, as Civil War proves, it's impossible not to smile when you see Spider-Man done right. The other hero making his appearance in Civil War is T'Challa, a.k.a. Black Panther, played by Chadwick Boseman. It's not an easy role, as Boseman has to muscle through a Wakandan accent (Wakanda is a fictional African country in the Marvel universe). But the actor is equal parts graceful and regal, showing off why Marvel is granting him a solo Black Panther movie in 2018. If we're being cynical, Spider-Man and Black Panther's scenes in Civil War could be seen as Marvel's marketing pushes for their respective upcoming solo films (Spider-Man: Homecoming is scheduled for a 2017 release). And make no mistake, these two characters' introductions, along with a giddy cameo from Paul Rudd's Ant-Man, are filmic detours, and the result is that Civil War doesn't feel as tightly scripted or cogent as The Winter Soldier (which is technically the better movie). But the highs that Spider-Man, Black Panther, and many of the other Avengers provide — Mackie, Olsen, Scarlett Johansson (as Black Widow), and Paul Bettany (as Vision) are all very solid in this film — are powerful in a way we haven't seen since the first Avengers movie. When people pay to see superhero movies, they're hoping to see moments they thought could only exist as static, 2D comic illustrations — Scarlet Witch's red bolts of energy, Vision's laser beams, Vibranium-induced concussions — depicted onscreen in dynamic live-action sequences. And Civil War's fight scenes are arguably the best (I'll have to watch The Avengers again to make sure) of any that Marvel has ever created. Under the Russos' direction, fight choreographers Sam Hargrave and James Young have created absolute magic. The movie plays with, leans into, and bends the laws of physics in such a distinct way that if you were to strip away the characters' costumes and just have stunt doubles in potato sacks go through the motions of each fight scene, you'd still be able to tell the scenes belonged to Captain America: Civil War. Hargrave and Young display a deep understanding of each character's powers, creating scenes where those powers collaborate and fuse together in innovative ways. A sizzling opening sequence featuring Falcon, Scarlet Witch, and Captain America is just a hint of what's to come: an Avenger-on-Avenger melee that is, without a doubt, the best single fight scene to happen in any Marvel movie to date and totally befitting of the title Civil War. There are some spots where the film's political angle and its characters' internal logic don't make sense. (For example, I have a difficult time believing that Civil War's iterations of Peter Parker and Black Widow would be so quick to sign free agent contracts with the government.) There are also times where the film is so busy and jam-packed with characters that it wastes too much time catching up with each one. And there might be three too many self-aware Marvel jokes. But ultimately, Civil War combines everything we cherish about superheroes — their strength, their powers, their goodness, their poreless skin and square jaws — and then elevates it to a higher level than I thought Marvel movies could reach. If Civil War is now the new standard for superhero movies, take my money and let everyone know I'm Team Cap.

"May 5, 2016",POSITIVE," Not only was a third Captain America film faced with the daunting task of being the follow-up to what is, arguably, the best entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe – The Winter Soldier – but it’s also absolutely stuffed to the edge of the screen with heroes, villains, and passersby. Overpopulation is an issue that’s hurt Marvel films as far back as Iron Man 2 and as recently as Avengers: Age of Ultron, and with the dissatisfying taste of the latter still fresh in our memory the prospect of another double-digit hero roster was worrisome. Turns out there’s no reason to be concerned after all, so go ahead and box up that worry and mail it to 4000 Warner Blvd, Burbank, CA 91522. Not only is Captain America: Civil War a top-tier Marvel film, but it’s also a terrific example of blockbuster entertainment that succeeds as well in its quiet moments as it does in its more bombastic. Familiar characters shine alongside star-making turns from newcomers, and action beats land with alternating laughs and dramatic weight. Best of all, and as they did with the previous Captain America film, directors Anthony Russo & Joe Russo deliver an epic adventure that finds its greatest power by scaling back the superhero antics to reveal the human combatants at their core. Captain America/Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) leads an Avengers-lite team into Nigeria in pursuit of Crossbones (Frank Grillo), but the ensuing scuffle results in collateral damage including several dead locals. Called to task by world governments tired of seeing their civilians pay the ultimate price, the Avengers are “asked” to sign an international accord putting them under the control of a committee who would determine which missions they can or cannot undertake. Rogers refuses with the certainty that handing control over to the political whims of others is not the answer, but Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) argues the opposite saying their collective powers should not be left unchecked in light of the damage they’ve already caused. The accord moves forward, but when a devastating attack leaves carnage in its wake with evidence pointing to the Winter Soldier/Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) as the culprit the Avengers’ differing ideologies turns to all out war. The two men, already used to butting heads as competing leaders of the Avengers, build teams of like-minded heroes around them and get to punching. Mark Millar’s popular Civil War comic from 2007 serves as more of an inspiration here than a template as writers Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely readjust that epic conflict with a more intimate focus on themes of guilt, grief, and revenge. We still get a beautifully-constructed face-off between a dozen heroes, but the character work afforded Captain America and Iron Man across seven earlier movies comes to an explosive head that imbues the action with more than simple entertainment. The former’s inflexible integrity, the latter’s unquenchable ego, and their begrudging relationship are doused with the guilt of fallen friends and strangers alike and set ablaze by the fiery insistence of their convictions. You’ll come for the big, colorful clash that feels like fun, but you’ll stay for the personal, bloody brawl that threatens to result in far more than mere bruises. But hot damn is the multi-hero clash and a thing of pure joy. Coming after a long stretch of dramatic chatter and smaller action beats, the eventual face-off between the opposing sides is a ridiculously fun sequence with the Russo brothers crafting the action so that each participant gets their time in the limelight. Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), War Machine (Don Cheadle), and Vision (Paul Bettany) fight with Stark while Rogers is joined by Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen). The face-offs are creatively staged and exciting in the moment, and they’re often made even more engaging and amusing through knowledge of traits and relationships built across earlier films. Two newcomers make their MCU debuts here, and both leave you immediately craving more. Rather than offering slight teases via mid-credits scenes (typical Marvel) or grainy video footage (shame on you DC), both Spider-Man/Peter Parker (Tom Holland) and Black Panther/T’Challa (Chadwick Boseman) arrive here fully formed and present across multiple scenes. Spider-Man in particular pops with the same electric energy and wit of Quicksilver’s debut in X-Men Days of Future Past, and Holland nails the teen hero’s youthful goofiness and charm. The cynics among you will see their presence merely as advertising for impending solo films, but the rest of us can accept that while simultaneously enjoying the hell out of their time here. One potential issue inherent in the idea of heroes fighting heroes is the common sense knowledge that nothing we’re seeing is permanent. They’re fighting because the script demands it, but while bad guys can be vanquished and possibly killed we know everyone here is going to be fine. That awareness makes it difficult to present these squabbles in an overly serious manner, and to that end the film injects the centerpiece battle with numerous gags and funny bits of dialogue making it an even more entertaining set-piece. An abundance of characters often means a shortage of character, and while this is unavoidably as much an Avengers film as it is a Captain America film our patriotic hero remains on center stage. The Rogers/Evans combination remains one of the MCU’s most perfect pairings (with the other being Stark/Downey Jr.), and once again we’re given a character and performance that feels far weightier and more effortlessly charming than typical comic book fare delivers. Also, as is again typical for the Captain’s adventures, much of the action has a more grounded, less CG-animated feel to it. Big set-pieces and certain characters are exceptions of course, but there’s quite a bit of gun play and fisticuffs on display here brought to life with real (stunt) people and only enhanced digitally. Oddly, early fights appear to be edited by someone told to replicate the films of Paul Greengrass even though their only exposure to his work is through the bitchy tweets of his detractors. They’re cut too quickly and cropped too tightly. The issue is quickly resolved for the remainder of the film resulting in far more enjoyable fight sequences, although – and I say this as someone who loves fight sequences – at nearly two and a half hours the film’s endless pummeling (punch! kick! fall down! stand up! repeat!) threatens a feeling of repetitiveness more than once. It never actually crosses that line, but it comes uncomfortably close. Civil War is tremendously enjoyable blockbuster entertainment, and while it probably won’t bring new converts to the MCU it shows what’s possible in big summer movies when all the pieces fall perfectly in place. Bring on the Russo brothers’ Avengers: Infinity War!"
"May 5, 2016",POSITIVE," After his old buddy Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), remade as Hydra's Winter Soldier, is falsely accused of a terrorist act, Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) finds his loyalties to his friend stronger than to Iron Man's (Robert Downey Jr.) guilt-driven upholding of the Sokovia Accords put in place to regulate The Avengers. Lines are drawn among the former allies in ""Captain America: Civil War."""
"May 5, 2016",POSITIVE," If you release a movie called “Captain America: Civil War” to an ideologically polarized nation in the midst of a notably contentious presidential campaign, you can expect to reap a whirlwind of think pieces. In spite of occasional public scolding about the rampant misuse of allegorical interpretation, hard-pressed, click-seeking cultural journalists and political pundits can be counted on to take up the hard work of finding echoes, resonances and subtexts in a big pop-cultural pseudo-event. If you hybridized Donald J. Trump and Elon Musk, would you get Tony Stark? Would Captain America’s endorsement have made a difference for John Kasich? Is Ant-Man a Bernie Bro? I hate to disappoint, but I have to say that I’m not really feeling it. The cues are there, of course. An aura of vaguely topical importance is as vital to a superhero-franchise movie as a merchandising deal. So “Civil War” pauses for a few moments of chin-scratching and speechifying about whether a group of genetically advantaged, highly weaponized individuals should be brought under the supervision of the United Nations. More seriously — because, come on now, do you really think Captain America is going to put on a blue U.N. helmet? — the film glances at some of the moral complexities of modern warfare. The designated good guys are responsible for the deaths of innocents, and the question of their accountability hovers over the movie and sets its plot in motion. But this very crowded, reasonably enjoyable installment in the Avengers cycle — written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely and directed by Joe and Anthony Russo — reveals, even more than its predecessors, an essential truth about the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It’s not so much a grand science-fiction saga, or even a series of action-adventure movies, as a very expensive, perpetually renewed workplace sitcom. New characters are added as the seasons wear on. Cast members are replaced. The thing gets a little baroque and tests the boundaries of coherence, but we keep showing up because it can be pleasant, in a no-pressure, low-key kind of way, to hang out with these people as they banter and squabble and get the job done. Sometimes you want to go where everybody knows both your street name and your nom de cape. (And yes, thank you, I’m perfectly aware that these Marvel superheroes don’t wear capes.) In this episode, based on a run of comics written by Mark Millar, some of the usual crowd is missing. No Hulk. No Thor. No Nick Fury.

"May 5, 2016",POSITIVE," It has maybe the most somber, serious tone of any of the Marvel Studios movies yet, but this is no Batman-Superman “I’m more angry and depressed than you are!” battle. Our heroes are divided in their allegiances in the latest installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe — it’s Avengers vs. Avengers — and that’s an intriguing starting point. When it comes to Marvel movies that bring superhero teams together, one storytelling element stays consistent: The filmmakers do some of their best work introducing new characters into the established core. On the downside: Veterans like Black Widow and Hawkeye could have stayed home because Scarlett Johansson’s role is wimpy and Jeremy Renner has almost nothing to do. The lead characters are Captain America, still smarting from the loss of lifelong friend “Bucky” Barnes being brainwashed to kill for Hydra’s villainous organization, and “Iron Man” Tony Stark, who we see facing a loss of family ties — both past and present. Tulsa acting legend Alfre Woodard further sets the stage in the opening minutes, getting in Stark’s face as the mother of a give-back-to-the-community son who was killed in the collateral damage of the superheroes’ “Age of Ultron” destruction. A U.S. official makes it official: Look, Avengers, the public owes you big time for heroic efforts, but you’re also dangerous, enhanced-powers people causing destruction and sometimes death with no supervision by the government, and that needs to change. Now. This “X-Men”-like government-management-of-mutants line is drawn in the sand, and it’s as simple for Stark (“If we can’t accept limitations, we’re no better than the bad guys”) as it is for Captain America: “I know we’re not perfect, but the safest hands are still our own.” This split of the heroes always plays better in its big-picture theme (Avengers debating and building to a battle) than either of the subplots that support this structure. Those would be Stark’s weak domestic drama on one side and the Winter Soldier’s expanded backstory, which expends a great deal of effort to reveal a secret that fizzles with little payoff. These liabilities mean that a significant portion of this 2 hour, 27 minute blockbuster creates average tension in a movie that wants to be a sizzling paranoid thriller as good as “Captain America: The Winter Soldier,” which is one of Marvel’s best movies. While the co-directors of that film return (and have been given the reins for the next two “Avengers” pictures), brothers Anthony and Joe Russo’s follow up is never as consistently exceptional in storytelling. Move quickly beyond an opening fight that is annoying in its shaky-camera, vibrating 3-D effect (go 2-D for tickets) and look forward to other standoffs like the all-hands-on-deck fight at an airport. The action is mixed with humor in this scene to fantastic effect. Paul Rudd’s Ant-Man delights by going small, large and extra-large. Black Panther is brutal, and Spider-Man is young and strong. Tom Holland (the star of tsumani movie “The Impossible” is 19 but looks 14) gives us a teen-looking Peter Parker and a quick wit that slays as he bounces off Stark, who he’s trying to impress. Wow. “42” star Chadwick Boseman brings his intimidating presence to bear as the royal prince of Wakanda in “Black Panther” comics forced by vengeance into battle and wearing maybe the best-designed Marvel outfit ever. Beautiful. “Captain America: Civil War” definitely continues that familiar Marvel style of action set pieces, comedy infusions, running gags, Stan Lee appearances and so much more."
"May 5, 2016",POSITIVE," EWTN News, Inc. is the world’s largest Catholic news organization, comprised of television, radio,
                print and digital media outlets, dedicated to reporting the truth in light of the Gospel and the
                Catholic Church. Heroes battle heroes in a slickly entertaining Marvel mega-blockbuster that outdoes both Batman v Superman and Avengers: Age of Ultron — but the ideas are half-baked and the ending lacking. My friend and Reel Faith co-host David DiCerto, a DC Comics fan who is somewhat bitter about the state of comic-book movies today — but I repeat myself — often says that Warner Bros.’ dark, heavy DC superhero movies, like The Dark Knight and Batman v Superman, are like comic-book opera, while Marvel’s frothy entertainments are like boy-band pop. I say: Bracketing the Dark Knight trilogy, a good slice of tasty pizza beats filet mignon that’s half underdone and half burnt to a crisp. Captain America: Civil War is a big ol’ slice of thick, cheesy, Chicago-style deep dish, heaped with absolutely all the toppings — and while as a New York boy I might prefer a more refined thin crust, there’s no point being a snob about these things. It’s all good. Well, mostly good. Civil War has nearly all the strengths of the best Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) movies so far, as well as some of the weaknesses. Among other things, it proves it’s possible for a Marvel movie to juggle an ensemble as large as Avengers: Age of Ultron — including most of the heroes from Age of Ultron, plus the Winter Soldier from Cap’s last movie, Paul Rudd’s Ant-Man, the triumphant MCU debut of Spider-Man (Tom Holland), and introducing Chadwick Boseman’s gravely dignified Black Panther — without collapsing under its own weight, like, well, Age of Ultron. (I’m tempted to extend the pizza-crust metaphor, but enough’s enough.) Civil War also demonstrates that the right way to do a “versus” movie pitting heroes against one another is by building relationships — and tensions — over time, then allowing characters to fall out over meaningful practical and personal issues. That way you don’t have strangers dutifully duking it out for essentially no reason beyond contrived plot requirements: just one of many, many things that went wrong with Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. Ever since they met in Joss Whedon’s The Avengers, Chris Evans’ Captain America / Steve Rogers and Robert Downey Jr.’s Iron Man / Tony Stark have had a complicated relationship blending mutual respect with mutual contempt. That’s not enough to justify a civil war, but it juices the conflict when Steve and Tony take opposite sides on a precipitous policy question — and, more darkly, when an unexpectedly personal revelation hits late in the game. There have been skirmishes between heroes in past MCU films — notably The Avengers, where Captain America broke up a brawl between Iron Man and Thor, who also went a couple of rounds against the Hulk — but never a plot that turned on pitting the heroes against one another. The bottom line is that this is a superhero movie without a supervillain or cosmic threat in the main plot — for good and for ill, and it’s some of both. On the plus side, among other things, no supervillain or cosmic threat means avoiding the sort of catastrophic urban destruction that has become both tiresome and problematic in these films — after the opening act, that is, in which an operation in Nigeria pointedly ends tragically. That opening act — the only sequence with a traditional villain (Frank Grillo’s character from The Winter Soldier, a Hydra agent now revealed as the terrorist Crossbones) — showcases how smoothly and effectively the Avengers function as a team with Cap in command, as well as the potential consequences of battling even a third-string villain like Crossbones in a urban setting. Like Batman v Superman, which tried to redeem Man of Steel’s massive urban-disaster trauma by turning it into a casus belli between Batman and Superman, Civil War tries to reckon with the fallout of the Avengers’ past actions. Concern for civilian casualties has been a recurring theme in Marvel movies (and was perhaps heightened in Age of Ultron in direct response to Man of Steel). What’s new here, adapted from the eponymous comics storyline, is a United Nations initiative to bring international oversight to the Avengers, who until now have acted as a self-appointed, unaccountable global security force, often being party to immense damage and loss of life even as they go about saving the world. The idea of being answerable to somebody sits better with Tony than it does with Steve. Tony is painfully aware of his character defects and has lived most of his life with too much power and too few checks and balances (and has lived to see the consequences, most recently the Ultron debacle). Steve, by contrast, has far less faith in bureaucrats and politicians than in individual human beings of conscience, like, you know, himself. Two-time Captain America directors Joe and Anthony Russo stage the action sequences with great energy and often considerable imagination. The centerpiece is an epic battle royale — comic-book action on an unprecedented scale — between everyone and everyone else in Germany’s Leipzig Airport, where a lot of stuff can be destroyed without imperiling a civilian population. For comics fans, The Avengers offered the geeky thrill of seeing Thor’s hammer come down on Captain America’s shield. The airport battle goes way beyond that, as heroes team up and square off in various combinations, with powers complementing or countering one another in unexpected ways. Other key Marvel ingredients include lightness of tone, humor, banter and the characters’ varying chemistry or lack thereof. All of these are reflected in the Leipzig Airport battle, where many of the combatants know and care about one another, and even the newcomers know the others by reputation. “Depends on how hard you hit me,” Hawkeye counters cautiously. Clearly they’re pulling their punches — as third character notes, taking out one of them a little more roughly than the other would have liked. My favorite mid-battle exchange may be the laconic moment of bonding/rivalry between Cap and Spider-Man. If I start geeking out about Spider-Man, this review will never end, so I’ll just say that this take on a brash, wide-eyed teenaged wall-crawler who slings quips as readily as webs could easily become my favorite portrait of my favorite superhero in next year’s Spider-Man solo film. I’m also hopeful for Boseman’s Black Panther movie the following year. (Boseman joins Anthony Mackie’s Falcon and Don Cheadle’s War Machine as the third hero of color in the Avengers circle. With only two superheroines — Black Widow and Elizabeth Olson’s Scarlet Witch — male heroes still outnumber the women by about five to one, although a third notable female supporting character also appears, and Marisa Tomei has a cameo as a very non-traditional Aunt May Parker.) As rousing as Civil War is, there are structural and thematic problems. If you think about it (and you might be happier not doing so), it’s hard to avoid concluding that the film’s real protagonist and hero is not Cap, but Iron Man — and that Cap is effectively, if not the accidental villain, at least the misguided antagonist. Cap’s opposition to UN oversight of the Avengers could easily have been given some warrant, for example by echoes of the paranoia thriller conventions of The Winter Soldier, but Civil War doesn’t go there. For a while it looks like Cap’s stance might be warranted by the introduction of an actual villain of a sort (Daniel Brühl), who seems to have a scheme of global proportions involving weapons of insidious power — but this doesn’t pan out as expected. Instead, the movie succumbs to a variation on the pitfall affecting most of the Mission: Impossible movies: Namely, the Impossible Missions Force is itself (like alcohol in Homer Simpson’s famous aphorism) both the cause of, and solution to, all our problems. In this case (vague spoiler alert), the Avengers are the only ones who can thwart an insidious scheme against … the Avengers. It’s like Paul Bettany’s Vision suggests: The Avengers incite violence as well as combating it. Tony’s case keeps getting stronger. Never has the MCU’s inability to come up with more than one compelling villain (Tom Hiddleston’s Loki) been a greater handicap. In a way Civil War is handicapped by an inevitable but limiting decision made in the first Captain America movie: to reimagine the star-spangled Avenger for a global audience as a hero of decency and valor unmoored from specifically American commitments. Disney’s big-screen Captain America never talks about democracy, constitutional freedoms, or civil rights. Chinese moviegoers buy a lot of tickets. The Civil War conflict in the comics turned on Cap’s commitment to individual liberty and opposition to government overreach. Here’s how these ideals are translated in this film: “If I see a situation going south, I can’t just turn away.” I could probably overlook these issues, if only the filmmakers would stick their landing like a movie should. In the MCU, every movie is a middle movie, like an episode in a TV series, or the latest issue of a comic book. That’s one thing for a weekly one-hour series or a monthly comic book — and clearly the series’ fans don’t mind — but I remain attached to the old-fashioned idea that a two-and-a-half-hour movie should generally tell a complete story, with a start, middle, and end. Not that Disney cares what I think. I still had a blast watching Civil War. I enjoyed it more than the popular (in my opinion overrated) The Winter Soldier. As Marvel pizza goes, bite for bite, this latest slice is among the tastier creations. At the same time, it manages to be both more than I can comfortably finish, yet not enough to satisfy. Steven D.

"May 5, 2016",NEGATIVE," You can feel comic-book movies struggling to grow up, slowly and awkwardly. Problem is, they don’t really want to — and it’s not at all clear that growing up is good for business. Comic books and comic-book movies are a consummately American narrative form. Americanism, meaning a worldview or state of mind that permeates much of the human population, far beyond the borders of the United States, is built on the proposition that you never have to grow up. History is bunk; power is virtue; the sovereign individual reigns supreme; all forms of collective governance are for sissies. These are the premises of the comic-book universe, and of fascism. They are also the fantasies of children. Is it unfair to suggest that the juvenile American fantasy universe that produces something like “Captain America: Civil War,” the latest preordained worldwide hit from the Marvel Comics pantheon, is closely related to the juvenile American fantasy universe that produces Donald Trump, Republican nominee for president? Maybe a little, but not that much. I’m not completely ignorant of actual comics, O enraged commenters of the near future: I was an actual American boy once, who purchased copies of “Doctor Strange” off a dusty beaver-board rack at McHaffie’s Drugs. I think they cost 45 cents. I’m aware that Marvel Comics have long had a left-libertarian streak, while the DC universe could more plausibly be accused of harboring proto-fascist archetypes. Donald Trump superficially resembles a Marvel villain more than a Marvel hero, but that’s missing the point. Trump is nowhere near as witty or urbane as Tony Stark aka Iron Man, the billionaire superhero played by Robert Downey Jr. who is in many ways (despite the film’s title) the central character of “Captain America: Civil War.” (If you are remotely likely to complain about whatever spoilers I may let fall about this movie inadvertently, and because I totally don’t care, then this article isn’t for you and you can stop reading it now. We counted the click already.) Stark wears stylish Tom Ford suits when not clad in an impregnable computerized tin can, whereas Trump is like the worst-dressed rich man ever. I’m sure his suits are expensive and all, but the Trumpian wardrobe displays no vestige of personality; he still looks like a guy who’s trying to sell you a $1,000 vacuum cleaner or a nonexistent condo in Cancun. Tony Stark is almost ostentatiously OK with having black friends, at a level that supposedly goes beyond “Here are my black friends” to “I don’t even think about that,” whereas Trump is — well, actually, Trump plays golf with Charles Barkley or whomever on exactly that same premise. How different are they really? The infantile fantasies driving the Trump electorate have been stripped of Tony Stark’s bogus veneer of Enlightenment and MIT education, but in both cases the fantasies are about disruptive levels of wealth and power, big enough to overturn governments and institutions and the girly-men who stand in the way of greatness. It’s nothing more than a hilarious accident that “Captain America: Civil War,” with its story of the Avengers — a world-dominating gaggle of superheroes, in case you’ve been comatose for the last decade — torn apart by moral debates, political squabbles and endless intensely engineered fight scenes, holds faint echoes of the real-world civil war within the Republican Party. If Trump and Ted Cruz could have a big WWE-style throwdown in armor-plated Underoos that involved the destruction of an international airport and featured psychic sidekicks (Carly Fiorina’s Scary Songs of Witchcraft!), John Kasich shrunk down to gnat-size and a surprise appearance by Spider-Man, that would be a lot more fun than flooding the Indianapolis airwaves with attack ads. Oh, wait: John Kasich has been shrunk to gnat-size in reality, too! Much of “Captain America: Civil War” is just the laborious working-out of leftover dangling plot elements from “Captain America: The Winter Soldier” two summers ago. I guess the enduring friendship between Chris Evans’ stalwart Captain America and his childhood companion Bucky (Sebastian Stan), who was engineered into a sinister super-soldier some decades back by the Soviets or Hydra or whoever the hell, is important to someone. Not that much to me. Both films were directed by the brothers Anthony and Joe Russo and written by the team of Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, and a certain coherence and even integrity flow from that. There are legitimate reasons for the amped-up eagerness of the fanbase, and for the fact that this movie is already a huge hit all over the world. (One of the recent twists to the blockbuster formula is to stage the international release before the North American release, partly to cut down on piracy and partly to make the movies more review-proof than they are already.) I personally find the Russo brothers’ lightning-fast action scenes difficult to process — it’s as if cinema editing now exceeds the speed of human brain functions — but they’re undoubtedly exciting and skillfully constructed. You generally know who’s fighting whom, where they are in the imaginary geography and what the objective is, which are not questions that have ever troubled Michael Bay, for instance. Furthermore, Markus and McFeely deserve credit for trying to push the moral calculus a bit further toward real-world questions. In recent years action cinema has featured enormous amounts of collateral damage — entire cities destroyed, thousands if not millions of deaths — which the protagonists barely seem to notice. Zack Snyder’s “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice” tried to tackle this after its own leaden fashion, but “Civil War” does it better. When Cap America and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and other random Avengers take down a squad of evil terrorists in Lagos, Nigeria, a bunch of African civilians get killed in the crossfire. Some of these are visitors from the peaceful nation of Wakanda, whose benevolent king (John Kani) calls for international action against the caped vigilantes. This is all old news in the superhero universe, for sure. But Tony Stark and Black Widow and War Machine (Don Cheadle) and the spectral-robot A.I. thingy known as Vision (Paul Bettany) all agree to sign a document that grants command-and-control authority over the Avengers to a special United Nations committee. Nothing could go wrong with that plan, am I right? To no one’s surprise, Captain America — who was asleep for 60 years or whatever and is pretty much the corporeal embodiment of American superpower hegemony — is having none of it. He doesn’t come right out and say that he’s all about making America great again, and that only a bunch of losers would sign an agreement written by a bunch of Third World socialist weirdos with unpronounceable names. But that’s sure how it looks. Anyway, when we fast forward to the end of the movie there’s a giant rock-‘em, sock-‘em fight between Iron Man and Captain America at a remote Cold War-era stronghold in Siberia, and a bunch of characters we supposedly like get sent to a super-secret U.S. government prison so awesome it might stop Dick Cheney’s heart (for, like, the 14th time). Along the way Downey chews up the scenery and has one moral crisis after another, and for a guy who was supposedly done making Iron Man movies he has pretty much made another one right here. By contrast, Evans just looks blocky and square-jawed and resolute — he is, more or less, the handsome guy that Donald Trump wanted to be when he was younger — although Cap does somewhat unexpectedly kiss someone and I have to admit that scene kind of won me over. (No, it isn’t Iron Man, though I’m not saying that tension is entirely absent.) I warned you about spoilers many paragraphs ago, and I can’t imagine that anyone who cares doesn’t already know that there’s a pileup of new and old Marvel characters herein. This isn’t officially an Avengers movie, I guess, because Thor and the Hulk are MIA, but the king of Wakanda’s son, played with impressive screen presence by Chadwick Boseman, turns out to be Mm-Hm You Know Who with the silly kitty ears, and because all you people loved Paul Rudd so much in “Ant-Man,” now we’re stuck with him. As I already said, a certain New York City teenage web-slinging sensation is unveiled in his latest and youngest iteration, played by Tom Holland, who is 20 years old and quite charming and English of course. But does it speak well of Spidey, or the Marvel universe, or the actual human race as a whole, that when a rich guy shows up in his bedroom and tells him what to do, he just does it?

 At the end of March, we had Batman and Superman throwing a hissy at each other, and now most of the Marvel universe (minus the Hulk and most of the X-Men) is at it in “Captain America: Civil War.” But, just to make this clear upfront: “Civil War” gets right almost everything that the dull, serious and chaotic “Batman vs. Superman” got wrong. The key thing — and this doesn’t sound like it would be optional but if you saw “Batman vs. Superman,” you know it is, apparently — is that “Civil War” gives us reasons for the people to behave like they do. As in the earlier movie, the dividing line is an attempted act of heroism that results in the loss of lives but, unlike in that film, it’s not that the superheroes in “Civil War” hate each other and want to kill each other. It’s that they disagree, philosophically, about how their activities should be regulated. And, while they do whale on each other, snarky jokes fly the whole time, indicating they will still all be putting on their little onesies together once this spat is over. Even when a life-and-death conflict does emerge late in “Civil War,” the film takes care to make sure we see why the wound is so deep, not only for the superhero in question but also for the movie’s bad guy (played by Daniel Bruhl), whose motivation is not the usual I-want-to-rule-the-world-and-wear-fabulous-tunics but a permanently aching heart.

Even the extent to which one might feel tempted to make fun of parts of “Civil War” feels very much in keeping with the movie’s willingness to take jabs at itself, whether it’s Paul Rudd’s welcome wryness as Ant-Man or Iron Man Robert Downey Jr.’s insistence on referring to his colleague Spider-Man as “Underoos.” With all of these cape-wearers on hand, I do wish “Civil War” took more advantage of the opportunity to to investigate whose superpowers are superior in, for instance, a battle between Spider-Man and Captain America. But maybe the point, as in the philosophical disagreement that drives the movie, is that good people can agree to disagree. Either way, I think most moviegoers will concur on this: “Civil War” is the movie to wash the bad taste of “Batman vs. Superman” out of your mouth."
"May 5, 2016",POSITIVE,"Civil War is of course a huge payoff for fans who've been following from the start, but even the casual movie-goers will pick up on the fact that there's something slightly more special about this one."
"May 5, 2016",NEGATIVE," Captain America: Civil War is a comic book pulped into today's newspaper. The bright colors have been desaturated into a crisp, clean gray. So has the plot, which jettisons the Avengers' aliens and astral gizmos for an earthbound mano-a-enhanced-mano between Iron Man and Captain America, both backed up by their dodgeball teams. Open a newspaper and there are 19 civil wars happening right now. This new Captain America makes it an even 20, while demanding we bear witness to the other headlines we'd rather skim: suicide bombings in Nigeria; terrorist bombings in Europe; bloodied victims sitting stunned next to ambulances; secret government prisons; and ineffectual United Nations resolutions. Enjoy your popcorn! Actually, you will enjoy that popcorn, because Captain America: Civil War isn't just the third Steve Rogers spin-off. It's the best Avengers movie to date, with an all-star cast that includes so many new and newish faces that there's no time to miss Hulk and Thor, the only absent Garbos. It's the Met Ball of Marvel movies — anybody who's anybody is there and dressed in literally killer couture. Bonus fashion kudos to debut hero Black Panther, played by an imperious and charismatic Chadwick Boseman, whose catsuit comes with an embedded necklace and retractable vibranium manicure. (Expect to see Jaden Smith wearing a knockoff at the Video Music Awards.) In the first 10 minutes, Civil War directors Joe and Anthony Russo make their mission clear: This comic-book movie will be real. Most filmmakers mistake ""real"" for dark and punishing, as though the average human is a mope surrounded by psychos. (Yes, I'm looking at you, Batman v Superman.) But to the Russos, real means relatable. The villain isn't a galactic ghoul, but a mortal with a stockpile of explosives. Lacking magic hammers and giant green men, our heroes fight with punches and kicks. And, most relatable of all, the movie finally admits that normal people matter. Usually, a PG-13 movie treats bystanders like cockroaches living under the fridge. We assume they're there when Hulk slams Iron Man into a skyscraper. Sometimes, the camera captures them scattering. But we'd rather not think about it, and, to keep a family-friendly rating, these films look away from the squashed goo. I can't even count how many skyscrapers exploded in The Avengers 1 and 2. Here, the big opening action sequence that sets up the film ends with telekinetic Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) accidentally firebombing one corner of a building. Yet this is the first blast to get a body count: 11 dead civilians, all from Black Panther's home country of Wakanda. Wanda — otherwise known as the Scarlet Witch — becomes the most demonized woman on the news. In the next scene, Tony Stark is confronted by a grieving mother who lost her son in Sokovia. Suddenly, the smash-em-up happy endings of every other Marvel film are rebuked. What have we really been cheering for? Thirteen films into the franchise, this is a strange, smart reversal that manages to both apologize for its past violence and reframe the entire series. It even steps back enough to question the entire Marvel blockbuster universe: What if the reason Earth has suffered 13 almost-apocalypses in eight years is because the initial emergence of Iron Man enticed killers to take their best shot? (We don't buy that pass-the-blame theory for a second, but cute effort, cash-counting studio execs.) With innocent humans a protected species (at least until Thanos comes laser-blasting for them in Avengers 3), the superdudes have no one left to hurt but each other. Stark capitulates to government pressure and demands that the Avengers sign the Sokovia Accords, a 117-country treaty that treats them like weaponry. Captain America can't cede his powers to bureaucrats — his brainwashed best friend Bucky, a miserable Hydra mercenary, proves that a winter soldier is only as good as his commanders. When the scraggly Bucky, looking like a rock star on a bender he can't remember, is spotted blowing up politicians, the battle lines are drawn: Cap wants to bring his friend in alive. Stark declares him rogue. This time, our old heroes can't both win. But they'll bludgeon each other — and the rest of their supersquads — trying. This all sounds bleak. It is. Yet the Russos keep the mood light enough for laughs — a magic feat as staggering as Wanda levitating a truck. At this point, we know these characters so well that they can speak in shorthand, like a family reunion where everyone still cracks up at Uncle Tony's same old punch line. Anthony Mackie's Falcon wrings giggles with just a wounded look. The inhumanly wise Vision (Paul Bettany) is used for comic relief, unnerving people by floating into their bedrooms and offering to cook them paprikash. And Tom Holland's pubescent Peter Parker actually made me look forward to this decade's third new web-slinger just by saying his own name. ""Sp-spider-man,"" he stammers, suddenly ashamed by his own swagger when he's too young to grow a beard. But, as the title promises, this sequel is all brawls — two and a half hours of traded blows — building up to a centerpiece battle of Black Panther versus Hawkeye versus Black Widow versus Falcon versus Rhodey versus Bucky versus Vision versus Wanda versus Spider-man versus Ant-man versus Iron Man versus O Captain our Captain. As our heroes duked it out on an airport tarmac, I pictured the Russo brothers as children in their Cleveland driveway clashing their action figures together and squabbling over which toy is best. ""Falcon beats Spider-man 'cause he flies!"" ""Nuh-uh! Spider-man's webs can stick Falcon to the ground!"" The Russos' mega-million-dollar adult playground has that same manic energy -- it helps that these fighters are mostly athletes and engineers, not Norse gods -- and the tactile smash-crash of metal hitting concrete. The camerawork is too shaky, but you can still see that Black Widow gets the coolest fight choreography. (And, for once, the camera doesn't reward her hard work by squatting in the perfect place to get a glamour shot of her ass.) That sounds like faint praise, but with Civil War, the Russos have won an impossible fight: They've gotten me eager to see the next 10 (yes, 10) Marvel movies. As Black Panther growls, ""The living are not done with you yet."""
"May 5, 2016",POSITIVE," The Avengers assemble once more for the Russo Bros.’ “Captain America: Civil War,” a film that brings to life one of the most popular storylines in the Marvel Comics Universe. This storyline offers up something a little different than what we’re used to seeing from the multiple Marvel films that got us to this point, and yet it still fits into the same typical package that viewers are used to getting, so don’t be surprised if it feels somewhat familiar at the same time. However, if we do focus on what sets it apart, you don’t really need to look any further than the title. Whereas in the previous films, there’s usual a standard villain that one or all of the avengers need to face (Loki, Ultron, Red Skull, etc.), here the Avengers become their own worst enemy as they’re faced with a rather difficult decision, all while once again trying to help humanity as best they can. And just what is it that would force them to turn on each other? Well, as we see at the start of the film, a mission in Nigeria meant to keep a biological weapon out of enemy hands ends in disaster as an explosion kills several innocent people, echoing previous tragedies in New York and Sokovia. A mother of one of the victim’s in Sokovia further brings the point to light when she confronts Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) about the death of her son, causing him to side with the authorities that want to place the Avengers under the supervision of a UN panel. Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), on the other hand, feels the complete opposite, worrying that such a panel might stop them from getting involved when they need to. As if this wasn’t enough to worry about, on the day the accords are to be signed, disaster strikes, with the primary suspect being Rogers’ old friend Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan). Rogers obviously feels obligated to track him down, but this only makes tensions worse, causing the Avengers to eventually come face-to-face on the battlefield while the real threat lies in waiting. “Captain America: Civil War” could have easily, and perhaps would have more appropriately, been called “Avengers: Civil War,” because while it does seem to focus a lot on the relationship between Rogers and Barnes, it really involves everyone (minus Thor and Hulk) and their choice of which side to be on. In that sense, it reminds me a lot of Joss Whedon’s films in that none of the characters feel like they’re left behind, with each given their due, which is all the more important as we’re trying to understand where they’re coming from when they choose their side. As stated earlier, this conflict gives the film a little something different for the fans to look forward to. Instead of just a “villain of the week,” it’s friend fighting friend, turning it into a somewhat awkward, though thrilling battle that has you wondering just how far each hero is willing to go. It also provides an interesting conundrum in that you really do understand why each side feels the way they do, making you wonder just how you would react in a similar situation. One side understands the need for oversight in order to prevent the senseless loss of more life, while the other doesn’t want potentially disastrous situations to become worse due to having to deal with red tape. Then again, you also have to wonder what would happen if all of the Avengers said no to the accords. Who would stop them? (A similar situation to trying to keep Superman’s powers in check in “Batman v Superman.”) It just so happens that about half feel one way, while half feel the other, leading to a rather conveniently-constructed showdown. Speaking of which, aside from the intriguing commentary the film offers, like its fellow Marvel adaptations, there’s plenty of fantastic action sequences to go around. Most notably there’s an epic chase in Bucharest that has both Rogers and Black Panther trying to catch Barnes, with the police in pursuit as well. In terms of getting your heart racing, this one certainly does the trick, but the one that most people will probably be on the edge of their seat for is the confrontation between Captain America, Iron Man, and their comrades (including Spider-Man, Ant-Man, Vision, and more). This lengthy sequence occurs on an airport runway that’s luckily away from the public, and, just like getting to see Batman fight Superman in the DC Comics Universe, is probably a dream come true for many fans who always wondered who would beat who in such a fight. This sequence also provides plenty of entertainment, and while the previously-mentioned chase outdoes it in my opinion, it certainly does justice to the film’s title. That being said, the film is not without its faults, sharing a very common pair of them that we’ve seen a multitude of times throughout the MCU films. These are, of course, that the film does eventually beat you over the head with a little too much action to the point where it has a somewhat numbing effect, and the fact that the film is far too long at nearly two and a half hours. To be clear, the inundation of action isn’t really to the point where it’s “boring” (as it became in “Batman v Superman”), but it does eventually have you wondering when the next advancement in the plot will arrive, and similarly, when the conclusion will finally occur. These are not to say that it’s a bad film, for it’s certainly not, just one that could have been trimmed down a little so as not to feel like it goes on for longer than it actually does. Chances are, as usual, that these issues won’t bother your typical comic book movie fan, you know, that person who just wants to see a lot of people get punched and lots of things get blown up real good without being bothered with a complicated plot. I’ve enjoyed almost all of these movies (with the great “Guardians of the Galaxy” remaining at the top of the heap), and while I can’t say that many of them have been memorable, I appreciated “Civil War” for not only some great action scenes, but also for delving into more internal issues with our heroes, allowing us to see them from an alternate angle than what we’re used to. Because of this, it has a hint of freshness, one that will hopefully carry over as we head into the next exciting phase of this ever-expanding universe. 3/4 stars."
"May 5, 2016",POSITIVE," Captain America — aka Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) — is on a mission in Nigeria with Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) when a tragic miscalculation results in multiple innocent deaths. The incident prompts an international outcry for the superheroes and their colleagues in the Avengers to be brought under the control of the United Nations. Particularly insistent is U.S. Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt), who views them as vigilantes who have been left to their own devices for far too long. Iron Man, aka Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), is sympathetic to Ross’ point of view. An encounter with a woman who blames the Avengers for the loss of her son has taken him aback. But Rogers bristles at the very idea of submitting to such supervision. Without their autonomy, he argues, the Avengers might be compromised to a dangerous degree. Battle lines are drawn, with some of the Avengers siding with Rogers, others with Stark. The situation only intensifies when Rogers’ friend Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), aka the Winter Soldier, is targeted by the authorities — while a mysterious man with an equally mysterious agenda (Daniel Brühl) looks on. “Captain America: Civil War” is in some ways a commentary on the previous films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which have been dismissed in some quarters as little more than excuses to blow stuff up and gleefully indulge in property damage. At the end of the day, it’s still a comic-book movie, but one that actually raises serious questions about security, accountability and revenge. Working from a screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, brothers and co-directors Anthony and Joe Russo deliver the required thrills yet leave room for moments of reflection — of which the actors, particularly Evans and Johansson, take full advantage."
"May 5, 2016",POSITIVE,"  The worst thing you could say about Civil War is that it doesn't really have an ending, but you could say the same about the last 12 Marvel movies. It's arguably less funny than previous Marvel movies (making Tony Stark a killjoy is a bold move indeed) but that's because the stakes are higher. Civil War is the culmination of everything Marvel have been working towards and it pays off in previously unimaginable ways. There is a moment that stuck in my mind way longer than the cameos or the fights or the explosions, of which there are many; a simple moment of compassion between Natasha and Steve at his lowest ebb: ""I didn't think you should be alone tonight,"" she says, tenderly touching his arm. The reason Civil War's punches leave you dizzy is because its cast of disparate heroes - from supermen to billionaires to assassins to weird red android goblins - genuinely feel like friends. And with friends like these, who needs Thanos? (Thanos is a big purple space dude, who- you know what, never mind).   Disclaimer: I work for Disney but that has not influenced this review in any way. These opinions do not reflect those of my employer."
"May 5, 2016",POSITIVE," Marvel is spitting out movies like Prince spit out albums in the 1990s.Over the past two years, Marvel released nine films, from Captain America: The Winter Soldier to Captain America: Civil War. Regardless of convoluted plots, video game-like CGI and running times as long as a Broadway show without an intermission, the movies are box office hits. The plots are generic, there's little to no nuance or character development, but who cares about cinematic details (well, I do) when audiences solely want to see over-the-top superhero fighting. Unlike Batman v. Superman, Captain America: Civil War does its job — but nothing more. All of the Avengers are here: Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), War Machine (Don Cheadle), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and too many more to count. This time around, the government believes the Avengers are vigilantes who need regulations. Half of the Avengers sign an agreement to operate under the United Nations committee while the others don't trust putting their hands in big government (sounds like a political debate). The ones who refuse to sign the agreement are breaking the law whenever they flaunt their super powers. Only their one-time friends can stop them — and CGI chaos ensues. Captain America: Civil War checks off all the boxes: sharp fighting sequences, campy comic book humor and an epic battle between two titans, Captain America and Iron Man. The two heroes don't disappoint and their feud runs deep with a plot twist that sounds like a scene from How to Get Away With Murder. The story is engaging enough without taking itself too seriously, resulting in one of the better superhero films of the last couple years.On another note, something needs to be done about the running time of these superhero films. Two hours and 26 minutes is asinine. Forty-five minutes could've been shaved off, which would've delivered a tighter, more action-packed film. Editing is an art form!Overall, lower your expectations and enjoy the CGI ride with characters who can do no cinematic wrong.

"May 5, 2016",POSITIVE," Marvel’s Captain America: Civil War trounces DC’s Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice in just about every category imaginable. Everything Batman v Superman got wrong, Marvel’s Captain America: Civil War gets right, from color palette to staging intense fight scenes to sprinkling plenty of moments of pure fun and joy throughout the two and a half hour running time. Captain America: Civil War isn’t lighthearted fare but it takes on serious issues (including private citizens relinquishing control to the government) in such an entertaining way that unlike Batman v Superman, the lengthy running time fairly flies by. The third film in the Captain America franchise is the first to truly allow the titular character the opportunity to show real depth, with Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) revealing his moral struggles while displaying the qualities that make him a natural leader. He’s flawed but loyal, and even if he didn’t have his superhuman strength you’d want him as your team captain. It’s also the first of the Marvel films to actual give Captain America an interesting personality that allows those unfamiliar with the comics to understand why he’s such a popular character. Prior films have made him come across two-dimensional, and in Captain America: Civil War he’s fleshed out, fallible, and above all a really likable guy. Captain America: Civil War takes place months after the events of Avengers: Age of Ultron, kicking off with Captain America, Sam Wilson/Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), and Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) in Lagos on a mission to stop terrorists. Unfortunately, Scarlet Witch accidentally causes damage to a building and civilians inside are killed. The U.S. government, as well as the heads of over 100+ nations, determines the Avengers must be brought in check and placed under the jurisdiction of the United Nations due to the collateral damage. They will not be allowed to act on their own anymore; all of their actions must be approved by the UN before any of the Avengers can participate in a mission. The strongest proponent of the UN proposition is Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr) who encourages his fellow Avengers to agree to turning over control and accountability to the government. Captain America strongly disagrees and is unwilling to have politicians determine when the Avengers will be used and who they’ll be fighting for or against. Sides are chosen, with Falcon, Scarlet Witch, Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), and Scott Lang/Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) standing firm with #TeamCap. Iron Man has James Rhodes/War Machine (Don Cheadle), Vision (Paul Bettany), Black Widow, T’Challa/Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), and Peter Parker/Spider-Man (the scene-stealing Tom Holland) on his side. With a line drawn in the sand, there’s no option but to fight it out after Captain America goes against the U.N. and rescues Bucky Barnes/Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) after he’s falsely accused of terrorist acts that left dozens dead. What’s really wonderful about Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely’s script is that just as TeamCap and TeamIronMan members dislike the idea of fighting their fellow Avengers, the audience also has a difficult time rooting against anyone, even with the knowledge that #TeamCap is on the right side of this particular issue. The script is strong and balanced, with action and quieter character-driven moments given equal attention. The film also features one of the most entertaining fight sequences ever put together in a superhero movie. When the much-anticipated battle between #TeamCap and #TeamIronMan actually unfolds, it is everything you’d want from a match-up between members of the Avengers. The CG is first-rate and directors Joe and Anthony Russo make sure each member is given time in the spotlight as the lengthy battle plays out. Captain America: Civil War also takes the right approach to introducing new Marvel characters to the big screen. While DC’s Batman v Superman used a ‘found footage’ approach to revealing first looks at Justice League members Aquaman, The Flash, and Cyborg, Marvel’s new Spider-Man and Black Panther had much more auspicious debuts. Tom Holland is introduced to Spider-Man fans in a near perfect scene with Robert Downey Jr. He then joins #TeamIronMan and spends the battle acting like a kid in a candy store surrounded by a never-ending flow of yummy goodness. Chadwick Boseman’s Black Panther is a more subdued, intellectual yet fierce character whose personality slowly emerges over the course of Civil War. Captain America: Civil War is one of the best Marvel films to date and easily the best of the three Captain America movies. It’s wildly entertaining, emotionally moving at times, humorous, intense, and just plain fun. Amid the spectacular action scenes and witty one-liners is a story about friendship and loyalty that will resonate with audiences of all ages."
"May 5, 2016",POSITIVE," Coming into this so late, it’s hard not to be skeptical, especially since the people who raved about “Civil War” also raved about “Age of Ultron” (which wasn’t good) and “Iron Man 3” (which I hated, maybe as much or more than Ang Lee’s “Hulk”). Because I’m legit.  If you ever see me at a screening or walking down the street or on the subway, there’s a very good chance I will have comics with me, since I already have some to read and while I don’t have the retention of some comic book geeks, I can guarantee that I’ve read more comics than 90% writing about the comic book movies. I read Civil War was it was being published by Marvel and there were a lot of interesting revelations that it produced: Spider-Man unmasked himself to the world and Captain America was shot and replaced by Bucky as the new Cap. It was a pretty pivotal event for Marvel Comics who were just a few years into Joe Quesada’s reign as Editor-in-Chief and  trying to rebound from the problems in the ‘90s that led to them selling off most of the movie rights to their biggest characters. I won’t talk too much about the plot and try to avoid spoilers, although you probably know most of what you need to know if you saw “The Winter Soldier.” Like the comics, it basically involves an incident that forces the government to crack down on the Avengers, wanting to put them under the guidance of the United Nations. Iron Man thinks it’s a good idea, Captain America doesn’t, and the other heroes either fall one of their way or the other. At the same time, everyone is still looking for the Winter Soldier, who Cap is trying to protect and that leads to… you guessed it… Civil War! The Russos continue to prove themselves as fantastic filmmakers especially when it comes to action movies, because “Civil War” continues at the same pace as “The Winter Soldier” with a lot of interesting developments to the characters and relationships introduced into the mix. This generally worked as a sequel to “Winter Soldier” in that respect.  Black Widow still kicks more ass than the men, and seeing her fight is always more of a treat than seeing Cap in some ways… but then also they brought Sharon Carter more into the action and any long-time Cap fan will know what an awesome that relationship is to the point where I really hope we’ll see more of Emily Van Camp in that role, because it truly pays off in the movie. Marvel is nuts for not making a Black Widow solo movie, too. Girls LOVE Scarlet Johansson in this role and it would easily be the biggest female-driven movie ever. Black Panther was really handled well and I think Chadwick Boseman was a great choice and can’t wait to see more of him in Infinity War and in his solo movie. While it may have seemed like a risk to do a Black Panther movie (based on the comic sales), I think Marvel will learn that there’s an audience for it. I also thought Spider-Man was as well integrated into the MCU as he could be, although I had some reservations about this. Starting him out with Aunt May and having Tony Stark come by to recruit him just didn’t work at all and they want us to believe that with everything going on, Stark had time to go to Queens to pick him up, design a new suit, and train him  to go after far more experienced superheroes? (He loses 24 hours of his alotted time to do this.) And the fact that Peter Parker is so young, just makes it less believable.  This is something that Bendis introduced in the Ultimate comics…and in fact, Bendis also brought Spider-Man into the Avengers since he never was one before he took over the book so maybe I should retract my statement about him being well-integrated and say that he was integrated better than I expected. And that brings me to the big airport fight scene that’s easily the best part of the movie and probably why everyone is ignoring some of the mediocre and plodding story developments and raving about the movie. You see, I was a little nervous that Civil War would just be one big fight sequence with hero fighting hero, which is something that I generally don’t care for when I read comics, but the film takes so long setting up the conflict and thankfully, it does deliver with 15-20 minutes of the most fantastic superhero-on-superhero fighting. I also dug the final conflict between Iron Man and Captain America, which also delivered on a visual and visceral level. It’s obvious the Russos took cues from the comics and actually was able to bring those giant splash pages to life. More importantly, I thought The Vision and Scarlet Witch and Ant-Man were all handled far better by the Russos than they were by Whedon in “Age of Ultron” and that’s probably one of the biggest deciding factors in why I liked it.  While I thought all of Marvel Studios’ films from last year were mediocre compared to earlier ones, I was really glad these classic Avengers characters had finally been introduced but “Civil War” really shows them off in a great way. We start to see the relationship between Vision and Scarlet Witch forming in a natural and organic way and Ant-Man, while it makes about sense to get him involved as it does Spider-Man (none), he’s used in such an awesome way in the fight sequence. The biggest problem is the movie comes off just as much like a sequel to “Age of Ultron” (which I’d just like to forget at this point) as it does “The Winter Soldier” (which is still the best of the Captain America movies). For a movie meant as a continuation of “The Winter Soldier,” there’s nary a mention of SHIELD or Nick Fury as Samuel Jackson’s character has pretty much vanished from the equation when it comes to the MCU. That’s a little odd since it was his cameo at the end of “Iron Man” and his appearance in “Iron Man 2” which helped set up the Avengers in the first place, and now he’s literally been forgotten. That’s a little disappointing considering what a small part he played in “Age of Ultron” and I don’t really see where or when Marvel can bring him back smoothly, not until Avengers: Infinity War.  The movie’s just too damn long. There’s just no other way to put it, and though the climactic fights do ultimately pay off, there’s a lot of fat that could easily be trimmed. You want to give some credit to the Russos for giving a fairly hefty movie for one’s movie-going dollar, but there were many character and exposition scenes that weren’t necessary to the overall story, even though I liked many of them (see above). That’s really the problem with a movie like this where you know you have one movie to get all the stuff you want into it but at least in this case, it all pays off, which wasn’t the case with “Age of Ultron.” Still, they could have gotten to the same point 15 minutes sooner and I would have liked the movie more. I have a few other minor quibbles with the plot, but I won’t get into them before everyone has had a chance to see the movie. So while I liked “Captain America: Civil War” quite a bit, it didn’t leave me in the same place emotionally that other Marvel films have, including “Winter Soldier.” I think it was generally far darker with less humor than, say, Joss Whedon’s first “Avengers” or some of the previous solo movies, but then you get to that airport battle and it’s hard not to completely and totally geek out, which I think is what is driving most of the overwhelmingly positive and gushing reviews. I already saw the movie a second time, which wasn’t the case with last year’s Marvel movies especially Age of Ultron (which I tried to watch a second time and couldn’t), but anyone who says this is “the best Marvel movie ever” is ignoring the film’s issues and just being geeky fanboys and girls, plain and simple."
"May 5, 2016",POSITIVE," By all rights, Captain America should be the lamest, worst Avenger. He came of age decades before the topic of segregation was even entertained. Rock & roll hadn’t been invented yet. If Steve Rogers is a real person, he’s likely a racist crank, yelling at the other Avengers to get off his lawn.  Thankfully, the Cap in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is none of those things. Steve Rogers is an open-minded skeptic, for whom Japanese internment camps are still a recent event. (It is not a coincidence that the word ‘internment’ is used in a crucial scene here.) He is mistrustful of the government — and who can blame him, after the events of “Captain America: The Winter Soldier” – and therefore loath to see the country he loves overstep its bounds a second time. This makes him a perfect foil for Iron Man/Tony Stark, a man whose genius is eclipsed only by his ego, and for whom reparations and accountability make sense, as long as everyone else pitches in to help him pay his bar tab.  This is the crux of “Captain America: Civil War.” The plot is more streamlined than the ’70s-era, conspiracy-minded “Winter Soldier,” but there are still some unsettling themes at play here, chief among them the concepts of freedom and safety, and the fear of compromising one for the other. The comics on which this film is based were written 10 years ago, presumably to point a finger at the George W. Bush administration for overreaching in terms of surveillance. Sadly, they’re even more prescient now. Captain America (Chris Evans) and a handful of Avengers are tailing a group of baddies intent on stealing a deadly virus. The plot is foiled, but there is collateral damage in the form of civilian casualties. On the heels of the events in “Avengers: Age of Ultron,” the governments of the world are demanding accountability for the actions of the Avengers. Thus, an accord is written, which has near-universal support, that the Avengers, um, check themselves before they wreck themselves. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is a chief supporter of the legislation, but Cap does not like the idea of the Avengers being kept in a holding pen and under governmental control.  Rogers’ case against containment is not helped when another terrorist attack takes place, and the culprit appears to be none other than his old friend Bucky Barnes, a.k.a. The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan). This only causes Stark and Rogers to dig in deeper, leading the Avengers to choose sides, while no one realizes that a larger game is being played.  The movie’s tone is similar to “Winter Soldier” in that it is the plot that drives the action and not vice versa, but when the action kicks in, it delivers on a number of levels. There is an escape sequence involving Cap and Bucky that has some of the finest choreography you will ever see, and the battle royale between the feuding Avengers alliances is one for the ages. The smartest move the script makes is staying as neutral as possible, making compelling arguments for both sides but ultimately taking Rogers’ side in the end, because it’s his movie.  “Captain America: Civil War” is the Avengers movie that “Age of Ultron” aspired to be. It balances an even larger cast of superheroes (hello, Ant-Man, Falcon, Vision, newcomer Black Panther, and hello again – again – Spider-Man) with a much more grounded, revenge-driven storyline. The reduced amount of political intrigue puts this just a notch below “Winter Solder,” but “Civil War” is one of the most entertaining, well-rounded Marvel films to date.  Every week Bob Westal whips up a new drink recipe, from the classics we all love to new recipes to try out when you're out or at home."
"May 5, 2016",POSITIVE," Captain America: Civil War is an abundantly-entertaining piece of blockbuster entertainment which gives lie to the notion that an adventure film with lots going on must devolve into chaos. Following the events of Avengers: Age of Ultron, the world has become understandably concerned about gangs of super people destroying bits of the planet every so often. When Bucky Barnes (Stan) is finally brought out of hiding, he becomes the catalyst to allow Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) to bring the world’s super people under control, starting with Steve Roger’s (Evans) Avengers. Ostensibly an excuse just to get loads of super people to wail on each other for our amusement, Civil War takes the opportunity it has to delve into the people who make up its world while also at least considering the real-world problems actual superheroes (and by intimation, real-world superpowers) would pose if they did whatever they wanted. And it really makes with the super people wailing on each other. A big part of Civil War’s strength is its insistence on avoiding the trap of cameos even when many of its characters only show up for two or three scenes. Instead it gives everyone something to do – from Vision (Bettany) and Scarlet Witch’s (Olsen) slow bonding to Spider-Man’s (Holland) introduction and brush with the big leagues to Black Panther’s (Boseman) dogged mission of vengeance – and something to feel (so that we feel it, too), creating a joyful smorgasbord of superhero action that is the most Marvel thing Marvel has ever made. The list of such character-based touches is almost endless and fantastic – Falcon and Bucky’s forced partnership, Tony Stark flirting with Aunt May to Peter Parker’s extreme horror, Vision trying to figure out how cooking works – with new elements melding seamlessly into the new. Spider-Man and Black Panther are organically accepted into the whole, particularly Panther who is well connected to the main plot, as the various characters work not only within themselves but as part of the whole. And none more so than Tony Stark. Alone and isolated and looking back on the mistakes of his life, Civil War is as much Downey’s movie as it is Evans, and it is with the pair that the filmmakers pull of their most difficult stunt; creating dueling protagonists with completely understandable but conflicting goals. Winter Soldier directors Anthony and Joe Russo (along with returning screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely) have brought back most of their creative team, continuing the techno-thriller aesthetic of that film to create a more grounded and believable experience until it is ready to let loose with the crazy. Returning cinematographer Trent Opaloch and production designer Owen Paterson (The Matrix) manage that wonderfully with desaturated backgrounds and a gritty feel, which still manages to transition to a world of bright primary colors at the halfway mark when Spider-Man arrives. The tonal shift anticipates the film’s finest hour when hero faces hero with a tone closer to fun and optimism than complex philosophical pathos. If the conflict between Stark and Rogers is the most poignant and emotional, the airport sequence where the Avengers finally face off against one another is the real heart of Civil War. For one glorious reel, the Russos throw out all assumptions about how much crap you can throw up on the screen in a show-stopping exhibition of technical prowess and raw fun. With John Wick helmers David Leitch and Chad Stahelski taking over Civil War‘s second unit, the action sequences are crisp and energetic, filled not just with clever gags but also intrinsic characterization (which makes sense given how much time they spend fighting). Despite the fact that many characters exist only to appear in this one moment, not a single one comes across as gratuitous or unnecessary; plus Ant-Man (Rudd) steals the film from everyone in those 15 minutes. As fantastic as all that is, no movie this full could make room for everything and unfortunately most of what gets pushed to the margins in Captain America’s movie is Captain America. Though undoubtedly the center of the film, this is really more of an Avengers movie heavily focused on Steve and Tony than a straight up Captain America installment. Compared with the last film, most of Steve’s major character development has concluded by the time Civil War starts, which makes him an easy choice to give up screen time for, but the lost is noticeable as he spends most of his time reacting while others actually develop. Those in his orbit suffer as well, particularly VanKamp’s Sharon Carter, who still has little reason to exist. She’s the last vestige of a problem which Marvel has mostly but not always successfully skirted – doing something just because it existed in the comics without due consideration as to whether it works on the big screen. Though Sharon Carter is an important part of the character’s comic book legacy, all of her story and character functions have long since been taken up by other characters in the film world, making her scenes forced or unnecessary. Though Civil War doesn’t have as much synergy between character, theme and plot as its predecessor, it has plenty to enjoy on its own merits and then some. If the worst that can be said of it is that it needs more Captain America (which pretty much is the worst that can be said of it), that’s not a bad price to pay for well-defined characters well-used within a complex plot that reaches for big ideas. Most of all though, it’s just fun, containing moments of laugh-out-loud enjoyment which these big movies can easily miss out on while attempting to reach for stronger dramatic stakes. Captain America: Civil War is about as well-executed and fun a piece of action storytelling as has been put together in recent memory and a reminder that for all the think pieces which have (and will continue) to pop up, there is still plenty of gas in this superhero thing."
"May 5, 2016",POSITIVE,"Plays out just like any grand superhero epic should, with plenty of edge of your seat action, thrills, comedy and more.(Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity etc. - Also Available)"
"May 5, 2016",POSITIVE,"""Captain America: Civil War"" appeals to me more strongly than any superhero movie of the last decade."
"May 5, 2016",POSITIVE," Captain America: Civil War, the feels-like-93rd entry in Disney's forever-going series devoted to Marvel Comics' spandex-and-metal-clad super friends, is perfectly fine – a little too rambling at two and a half hours, but otherwise just the right shade of light and bright for a movie about superheroes fighting superheroes. Civil War is one splash page after another filled with famous faces stuffed into Halloween costumes making jokey asides between the kicking and the punching. The first Iron Man, only eight years and one Terrence Howard ago, was a revelation: Comic book movies, wrought somber and dim when Batman began in 2005, could be fun. Civil War, the third Cap movie, is the culmination, the first comic-book movie out of all the comic-book movies to capture what it's actually like to read a comic book when you're 12 years old. Civil War, directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, brothers who made the last Captain America movie along with episodes of Community, is only loosely based on the comics' ""Civil War"" storyline. This isn't about superheroes being asked to reveal their secret identities, but about superheroes being told to wait for the United Nations' OK before saving the world. That suits Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) just fine: Iron Man is racked with guilt over all the dead stacked up during the last few issues … er, episodes … wait, movies. He’s desperate for someone else to take responsibility, convinced that with great power comes great weight he can no longer shoulder. But Cap (Chris Evans), once the good soldier, isn't about to take orders from Thunderbolt Ross (William Hurt) or his mustache, which looks just like it did when it appeared in the first issue of The Incredible Hulk in 1962. He and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) mucked up a mission, resulting in dead innocents, but far as he's concerned, that's the high price of doing the right thing. In short order, all the brand names – Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), the Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), War Machine (Don Cheadle), Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and the Vision (Paul Bettany) – are rounded up, asked to choose sides and told to square off. They’re joined by two newcomers: Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), the king of a fictional African nation out to avenge his father’s death, and Spider-Man (Tom Holland), the kid from Queens who spins a web and catches thieves just like flies. And there’s the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), Cap’s childhood buddy from the 1930s who’s also looking remarkably fit and trim well into the 21st century. There’s a bad guy in here too (Daniel Bruhl as Helmut Zemo, a far more tragic figure than the comics’ Nazi baddie). But he’s forgettable, nothing more than a third-act plot device that leads to one last bit of hero-on-hero-on-hero action. Civil War runs long because it wants to make sure no character gets short shrift - especially Holland's giddy Spidey and Boseman's brooding Panther, as this is their launching pad for coming spin-offs. They're given plenty of time to make their respective cases: Holland, particularly, given the desperate need to prove Spider-Man isn't covered in cobwebs after Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield stretched out the suit. There's also meant to be a deep message in this shallow kiddie pool - something about guilt, retribution, collateral damage and … hey, look, there's the dean from Community promoted to head of MIT. And Spider-Man fighting Ant-Man! While talking about The Empire Strikes Back! Well, that certainly makes it easy: movie of the year. Or comic book, at least. Robert Wilonsky, Special Contributor.

"May 5, 2016",POSITIVE," The bad news is, there are about ten movies going on in ""Captain America: Civil War,"" which is at least seven too many. The good news is, most of them are fun, and there are enough rousing moments to elevate the movie to Marvel's top tier. Although Thor, the Hulk and other recurring characters have gone missing this time (with somewhat vague explanations for their absence), nobody's going to mistake ""Civil War"" for a chamber piece. Trailers sold this installment as a tale of intra-Avengers warfare, set off by the government's demand that Captain America (Chris Evans) allow the arrest of his old friend The Winter Soldier, aka Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), an assassin whose moral compass has been scrambled by brainwashing, so that he can be punished for his presumed role in a terrorist attack. And it is that. But only some of the time. There are more than a dozen major characters and another dozen minor 
ones, including Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Spider-Man (Tom Holland), all running, flying, stomping and blasting through a long, lumpy story inspired by the 
2006 Civil War graphic novel arc. Thematically, it's potluck. Like ""Avengers: The Age of Ultron,"" ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" and ""Iron Man 3,"" ""Civil War"" is simultaneously about the ramifications of US intervention in a post-9/11 world; the responsibility of private military contractors (which is basically what the Avengers are here) to defer to their government and the United Nations; the question of whether civilian casualties negate the righteousness of a noble mission; the allure and price of vengeance; and individuals' ongoing, never-finished struggles to understand how their pasts drive their present-tense actions. (Several characters confess that they act from compulsion and then find ways to rationalize it.) There's a fair bit of ""The Dark Knight"" logic, or ""logic,"" to the 
storytelling. Characters do things to other characters because they know
 it'll set off a chain reaction that'll eventually lead to a very specific 
moment at the end; luckily for them, each step goes according to 
plan, because if it didn't there would be no movie. And, as in the inferior yet thematically similar ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,"" the hero-versus-hero slugfest only seems 
to spring from real and deep philosophical differences. It turns out that the real problem is that these 
characters don't talk to each other when they should.  All that said,
 this is a satisfying film that takes its characters but not itself 
seriously, and mixes sequences of wonder, visual 
wit and pathos in with the world-building and dramatic housekeeping. 
Reuniting the Cap creative team of directors Joe and Anthony Russo and 
screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, ""Civil War"" gets better as it goes along, both as an action movie and a sprawling ensemble. I've seen reviews complaining that no character gets enough screen time, but to me the distribution felt just about right. We know a lot about the established characters by now. There's not much this film needs to say about Peter Parker except that he's a lovable wise-ass spider-teen who lives with his Aunt May (51-year old Marisa Tomei, looking more like Aunt February) and has only been slinging web for six months. Nor does this story require much more of Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) but that he act starstruck by Tony and Cap and the gang and try too hard. Black Panther, aka T'Challa—subject of an upcoming Ryan Coogler solo movie—is defined by his righteous anger over an injustice perpetrated against his family and his nation, and that's exactly where the character needs to be for this film.  The action is solid, sometimes inspired. The best setpiece in ""Winter Soldier,"" Cap taking out a bunch of would-be assassins in an elevator, had a frenzied smallness that was much more exciting than watching helicarriers crash and monuments crumble; it seems to have inspired the better action scenes here—not just a stairwell punch-fest that finds Bucky swinging from a torn-up stretch of railing like Tarzan on a vine, but in a bigger, louder, wilder clash between Avengers (including emergency ringers Spider-Man, Ant-Man and Black Panther) on an airport runway. Although the cliched handheld, whipsaw-crazy action still lacks beauty and personality (a problem throughout Marvel's filmography, which has an assembly line quality) it's clean and exact, it makes clever use of the various heroes' powers, it's more comedic than vicious (Buster Keaton and Steven Spielberg are clear influences), and it leaves no doubt about the characters' angles and methods of attack, where they are in relation to one another, and what's at stake. The script never convincingly squares this film's vision of Cap as a guy who's willing to go it alone against government forces (led by William Hurt's Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross) who want to regulate super-heroic interventions with the Captain America of ""The Winter Soldier,"" who decided he'd rather go against his own government than allow one of its highest ranking military officials to order extrajudicial assassinations. ""We may not be perfect, but the safest hands are still our own,"" Cap tells Tony, a sentiment that could easily have been placed in the mouth of Robert Redford's ""Winter Soldier"" character Alexander Pierce. It's as if Cap is a hypocrite who thinks vigilantism is OK as long as he's the vigilante—which would be a solid point if anyone in this movie raised it.  Seems to me that Iron Man industrialist Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.), with his cowboy capitalist inclinations, would be a more likely candidate to espouse the positions Cap embraces here. True, Stark is troubled by seeing Cap, the Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johannson) cause innocent Wakandan relief workers to die while trying to stop the heist of biological weapons in Lagos, Nigeria, and he's genuinely shamed by an encounter with a state department employee (Alfre Woodard) whose son perished during the final battle in ""The Age of Ultron."" Still, the philosophical positioning of Cap in relation to Tony feels a bit ""take our word for it."" (I bet it worked better on the page.) But the Russos' deft switching between slapstick and melodrama, the surprising outcomes of key storylines, and the strength of the central performances go a long way towards overcoming nitpicks. Much has been written about DC Films' fashionable darkening of Superman, but the loss of the big blue Boy Scout doesn't sting as much as it would if we didn't have Cap around to fill that imaginative space. Evans has a bit of Christopher Reeve's magic. He's as nice as a screen hero can be without seeming dull. (The directors make the comparison official in a scene that evokes memories of the Daily Planet helipad disaster in the 1978 ""Superman."" Watch how Cap solves the problem—it's not just about super-strength, it's about figuring out what to do with his legs and arms.) Cap's straightforward goodness is a tonic in an age of grit for grit's sake, and his quiet scenes with Bucky have an un-ironic emotional charge that's ultimately more radical than Batman and Superman's glowering in Zack Snyder's recent mope-fest.  I missed the kooky, at times cryptically obsessive quality that Joss Whedon brought to ""The Age of Ultron,"" but this is a smoother, more consistent film with its own oddball moments, such as Paul Bettany's Vision making paprikash for Scarlet Witch while listening to Chet Baker, and Falcon's startling name-check of racist police officer Mark Furhman. I'm not sure Marvel's film slate will ever overcome charges that the series is less cinema than a giant-screen TV series that makes you wait several months for a new episode. But I don't think the filmmakers or the fans care about those distinctions. These are late capitalist America's version of Greek gods, running, jumping and flying through stories that are as contradictory and self-defeating as the country that spawned them. They often claim they're destroying the world in order to save it, but they don't really know why they do things. They're mysteries to themselves. The deeper Marvel dives into those mysteries, the more artful and memorable this franchise will become.

"May 5, 2016",POSITIVE," It’s the Avengers (well, most of them): guilt-ridden, conflicted and turning against one another. Who’s the winner of this “Civil War”? The audience. Rating: 3 stars out of 4. Their heroics in past adventures have brought them into disfavor with the public. The collateral damage attending their world-saving exploits against the villainous likes of the terrorist Hydra organization and the rampaging robot Ultron — smashed cities, mass casualties — have the world demanding that the brakes be put on these too-powerful do-gooders. ‘Captain America: Civil War,’ with Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Chadwick Boseman, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie. Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, from a screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. 147 minutes. Rated PG-13 for extended sequences of violence, action and mayhem. Several theaters. Leading the guilt-ridden Avengers faction is Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.). Sickened by what he perceives as having been the misuse of his megacorporation’s high-tech weapons, he’s now out of the arms-manufacturing business and is buying into the need to restrain himself and his colleagues. Resisting a push to make “enhanced” people answerable to U.N. oversight is Captain America/Steve Rogers (Chris Evans). He’s of the “can’t make an omelet without breaking a few eggs” school of superhero behavior: Fighting for the greater good sometimes gets a few good folks killed. If all this sounds a little familiar, it’s because it’s essentially the same basic plot as “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.” Only with a lot more characters. And greater depth. And better writing. And, eventually, humor. It’s the humor, arriving late to the proceedings, that saves “Civil War” from the curse of “Why so serious?” — which sinks “Batman v Superman” like a torpedo below the waterline. “Civil War” has 12 major characters: “Avengers” movie vets Iron Man, Cap, Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Falcon (Anthony Mackie), War Machine (Don Cheadle), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Vision (Paul Bettany), Winter Soldier/Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen). New to the mix is Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman). Also, familiar to Marvel fans but new to the Avengers world is Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and Spider-Man, in his third on-screen iteration. This time he’s played by young Tom Holland. And it just so happens that, almost single-handedly, the kid rescues “Civil War” from its near-oppressive solemnity. Showing up more than halfway through the picture’s nearly 2½-hour running time, Holland’s Spidey brings a disarming geekiness to the party. While awe-struck at being recruited by Stark, he’s discomfited by Tony’s sarcastic dismissal of his homemade Spider suit as a “onesie” and his mocking, “So, you’re the Spiderling. Crime-fighting Spider. You’re Spider-Boy?” In the first scene between the two of them, Downey makes a welcome return to the sardonic bantering that turned Iron Man into a superstar of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Sensory overload from fight scenes and chases is delivered throughout, which is expected in superhero movies. And the battle between the two super factions that’s the centerpiece of the picture is a showstopper, leavened with humor thanks to the antics of Ant-Man and Spidey, the latter of whom cheerily tells Cap he’s a “big fan” just before the two do battle. Working from a script by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, brother directors Anthony and Joe Russo, who previously directed 2014’s “Captain America: The Winter Soldier,” handle their massive ensemble like elite-level orchestra conductors. Each character gets his or her fair share of screen time, and the many subplots — Cap’s Avengers-fracturing loyalty to his troubled buddy Bucky being the main one — are connected up in such a way that each reinforces the picture’s central premise."
"May 5, 2016",POSITIVE," Kenneth Turan reviews Marvel’s ‘Captain American: Civil War’ starring Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Jeremy Renner, Chadwick Boseman, and Elizabeth Olsen. Video by Jason H. Neubert. First came “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,” with the twin titans of the DC Comics universe having at each other like enraged cage fighters. Now it’s Marvel’s turn, and “Captain America: Civil War” doesn’t hesitate to amp up the volume. Not for this group the existential loneliness of single combat. The Avengers are split asunder, with two six-person teams, one lead by Captain America, the other by Iron Man, facing off Stanley Cup playoff style. In fact, so many players go at it hammer and tongs it’s at moments hard to tell them apart, which is not necessarily a good thing. It’s not that “Civil War,” directed by Anthony and Joe Russo and written by Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely, doesn’t eventually win you over, doesn’t turn your frustration into grudging respect. But it turns out to be a longer slog than you may anticipate unless you are a Marvel true believer who lives and breathes these characters’ every quirk and qualm. For, paradoxically, the more the interconnectedness of Marvel films increases at warp speed (“Civil War” is described with a straight face as “the first film in Phase 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe,” MCU for short), the more insular they become. Despite their mushrooming popularity -- 12 consecutive Marvel films and counting have debuted at the No. spot in U.S. box office -- they are becoming increasingly exclusionary, making it difficult for random first-time viewers, if such people still exist, to come in off the street and fully enjoy them. Yes, the broad outlines of “Civil War” are knowable even from the title, but you can’t go five minutes in the film without seeing something that plays better the more of these you’ve seen, or without feeling you’re missing the joke because your Marvel memory is not as fresh as it might be. So if you don’t know the origins of the villain Crossbones (Frank Grillo), his key role in the film’s opening feels confusing, and if you don’t recognize that Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) is the same person as Gen. Thaddeus “Thunderbolt” Ross of “The Incredible Hulk,” you are not getting full value for his moment. Most critically, if you don’t know the intricacies of the complicated history between Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) and his World War II buddy James “Bucky” Barnes (Sebastian Stan) as revealed in the previous “Captain America: The First Avenger” and “Captain America: Winter Soldier,” critical aspects of this film’s plot will be lost to you. With so many characters to care about and look after, with so many personality trait boxes to check off, “Civil War” has to fight hard not to seem as pro forma overall as the cameo moment for Marvel’s spry eminence grise Stan Lee inevitably does. All this time and energy spent in these prescribed pursuits sometimes means that things that are truly important, like convincing us that the Captain America/Iron Man split is more than a convenient plot contrivance, don’t get the attention they need. Whatever flaws “Batman v Superman” had, Ben Affleck’s atavistic performance as the Dark Knight left you without the smallest doubt that he loathed the Krypton native. “Civil War” does eventually get to that point with Captain America and Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), but it frankly takes a shrewd Hail Mary plot twist far into the 2-hour, 27-minute running time to make it happen. Like “Batman v Superman,” “Captain America” shows us early on an example of collateral damage by the good guys as the Avengers end up inflicting casualties on the unsuspecting civilians of Lagos, Nigeria, (magically re-created on an Atlanta sound stage) while chasing a determined evildoer. After a dressing down by the aggrieved mother (Alfre Woodard, effective even in cameo) of a dead innocent, Tony Stark, a.k.a. Iron Man, starts to agree with the secretary of State and 116 other nations that to avoid charges of vigilante behavior the Avengers must sign the Sokovia Accords (named after the fictional city that got pulverized during a superhero intervention in “Avengers: Age of Ultron”) and agree not to spring into action unless a U.N. panel says it’s OK. This does not sit well with the good Captain, born into a more straightforward era, who feels signing would be a dereliction of his patriotic duty. This is the issue that causes the Civil War with, for those who are keeping score, Falcon, Ant-Man, Hawkeye, Scarlet Witch and Winter Soldier teaming up with Cap and Black Widow, War Machine, the newly introduced Black Panther, Vision and Spider-Man on Iron Man’s side. (Thor and the Hulk, having apparently picked a good time to take vacations, are not involved.) Fortunately, Zemo, “Civil War’s” main villain played by the fine German actor Daniel Bruhl, is quite an interesting character. It is Zemo we see as the film begins attempting to reactivate the golem-like Winter Soldier for his own nefarious purposes. Of equal interest are the newest additions to the Avengers canon, each of whom brings some welcome spice to the proceedings. Paul Rudd’s Ant-Man is amusingly light on his feet, Chadwick Boseman’s dedicated Black Panther is arresting even though he’s around mainly to promote his own upcoming feature, and, most intriguing of all, is the presence of Tom Holland’s new iteration of Spider-Man, a character whose appearance involved such complex negotiations between Disney and rival studio Sony they put the Sokovia Accords to shame. On the plus side, as has become the norm with Marvel films, the cost-the-earth action stunts are the best money can buy, and “Captain America: Civil War” finally works its will on us, wearing us down with the weight of its self-importance as much as anything else. If you live and breathe Marvel, this is one of the MCU’s stronger offerings. If you are a spy coming in from the cold, the answer is not so clear."
"May 5, 2016",POSITIVE," After the formulaic thrills of The Winter Soldier and Age of Ultron, Marvel's Avengers were in danger of getting stuck in a rut, but a smart script for this surprisingly focussed thriller kicks everything into a new direction. What's surprising is that the screenwriters have managed to incorporate a wide range of characters without the film ever feeling overcrowded. Each person has a journey to travel, so the actors get a chance to invest plenty of personality into the action. After the events of Ultron, there's a political debate about the need to oversee the Avengers' missions. Iron Man Tony (Robert Downey Jr.) thinks a special UN council is a good idea, but Captain America Steve (Chris Evans) thinks that will limit the team's ability to help people. Then Steve's best pal Bucky (Sebastian Stan) is framed for a bombing, and Black Panther T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) is drawn into the fray. The Avengers are forced to take sides, with those supporting Bucky becoming outlaws. Tony recruits Spider-Man Peter (Tom Holland) to his team, while Steve drafts in Ant-Man Scott (Paul Rudd). And as they all face off against each other, none of them realise that this entire situation is being manipulated by a vengeful man named Zemo (Daniel Bruhl). Watching this film requires the audience to suspend disbelief that these super-powered friends could be pushed to try to kill each other. That never quite makes sense, and indeed the script acknowledges this fact when one person goes down and everyone reacts emotionally. But the high-powered cast is so good at creating these intensely driven superheroes that it's not difficult to go with it. Evans and Downey are terrific at the centre, deepening their characters by keeping the tone jaggedly humorous even as things get nasty. As Vision and Scarlet Witch, Bettany and Olsen add some emotion in their interaction. Holland and Rudd provide a hugely amusing blast of energy, and Boseman's character is darkly fascinating. Johansson has the strongest role among more sidelined characters played by Mackie, Renner and Cheadle. And Bruhl is a surprisingly complex villain. Best of all is how the extra-long plot avoids the usual structure, maintaining a more personal approach that's edgy and resonant. This means that most of the battles have an emotional angle to them, while the story is more linear, inexorably moving forward to the next showdown. Directors Joe and Anthony Russo struggle to keep the action coherent (especially when it's blurred by 3D) or thrilling (because they surely won't kill anyone off), but there are exhilarating moments in each fight set-piece. So fans will be impatient for the next chance to catch up with this growing mob of heroes."
"May 5, 2016",NEUTRAL," Captain America: Civil War Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johnsson, Sebastian Stan. Directed by Anthony Russo and Joe Russo. Rated PG-13. Opens Friday citywide. His name might be in the title, but Captain America: Civil War is only nominally a Captain America movie. Really, it’s the latest chapter in the ongoing Marvel mega-saga, with a dozen different super-powered heroes crowding the narrative. Following up on last year’s Avengers: Age of Ultron as much as (or more than) 2014’s Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Civil War sets up a battle between factions of heroes led by Captain America (Chris Evans) and his fellow Avenger Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), who disagree on whether the Avengers should submit to government oversight. The core dispute between Captain America and Iron Man is thematically rich, and the filmmakers (directing brothers Anthony and Joe Russo and screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, all returning from The Winter Soldier) handle the concept of heroes battling each other over the right way to help humanity much more effectively than the recent Batman v Superman. At the same time, the thematic concerns of Marvel movies tend to be fairly superficial, and the best thing about Civil War is not the way that it explores competing moral philosophies, but the way that it throws together a bunch of badass superheroes and has them pummel each other. Midway through the film, as Captain America has gone rogue in order to clear the name of his buddy, brainwashed super-soldier Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), the two main heroes gather up their respective allies and engage in an epic showdown in an empty airport that’s one of the best action sequences in any Marvel movie. The filmmakers clearly understand the unique strengths and weaknesses of the various heroes, and they depict them smartly and distinctly over the course of the fight. The movie sort of peters out from there, especially as it focuses increasingly on the villainous Zemo (Daniel Brühl), a shadowy figure who turns out to be possibly the least interesting bad guy in a series of movies that has major trouble coming up with worthwhile antagonists. As with Age of Ultron, Civil War is full of setup for future Marvel movies, although at least in the case of new additions Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Spider-Man (Tom Holland), both poised for their own solo adventures in the next couple of years, that setup promises something entertaining down the road. As the movie reveals more about the true origins of the rift between Captain America and Iron Man, though, its deeper themes lose some of their significance. Civil War hinges on tearing the coalition of Marvel superheroes apart, but it’s hard to feel the impact of that schism when the movie’s real purpose is building up what comes next. “Across the Tracks: A Las Vegas Westside Story” was screened at both the Sundance Film Festival and locally at the Plaza, and the film serves ..."
"May 5, 2016",POSITIVE," What happens after superheroes like Captain America and Iron Man do their superdeeds, vanquish the baddies and head home for a quiet supper? People count their dead. It seems governments of the world (and we, the audience) can look away no more. In Captain America: Civil War, collateral damage not only catches up with the Avengers, it leaves them divided in the middle.  While Captain America (Chris Evans) believes you can’t save them all, Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr) is ready to become a soldier controlled by the United Nations. Enter the unity-destroying Sokovia accords, play the requiem for an end of a friendship. Make it friendships. More Avengers 3 than a Captain America sequel, directors Anthony and Joe Russo manage to keep superheroes snappy and smart in the film while ensuring a fast-paced, emotion-driven summer firework. Civil War is so crackling because it is intimate. Instead of flabby action scenes a la Age of Ultron, set pieces in Civil War – just like the stakes – are personal. Downey Jr tones down his hyper-verbal shtick, Chris Evans makes Captain America’s reasons compelling and Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow is more about dialogues than smouldering looks. The sweetest scenes are the ones introducing the new entrants. Chadwick Boseman’s Black Panther is a class act but it is Tom Holland as high-on-hormones, unusually chatty Spider-Man who is the pick of the lot.  Civil War doesn’t hold back its punches in either the action or the script department. Just when things start getting rough, along comes a witty one-liner or a rousing speech. And it has that secret weapon that Batman v Superman sorely needed – charm and wit that can cut through all the grandstanding."
"May 4, 2016",NEGATIVE," Geez, can’t these superheroes all just get along?  First Batman and Superman face off against one another; now Captain America and Iron Man do likewise—and each brings a bunch of colleagues along to turn their fight into a gang rumble.  In both cases, ironically enough, the argument is over excessive violence and collateral damage (along with the government’s effort to rein in the metahumans), but the guys can settle their disputes only by creating more of each.  You’d think that, being super and all, they could sit down and talk through a compromise—but that’s rendered impossible in the end because Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.), it turns out, has Batman-like issues about the death of his parents.  Indeed, “Captain America: Civil War” shares a lot with “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.”   That’s not intended as a compliment.  The movie begins—following a 1991 prologue about the programming of the Winter Soldier, aka Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan)—with a group of Avengers led by Captain America (Chris Evans) overcoming a bunch of terrorist thugs in Lagos.  Unfortunately, in the melee Wanda Maximoff, aka The Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) unleashes an energy bolt wildly, leading to the deaths of some people in a nearby skyscraper, including a group of aid workers from the African nation of Wakanda.  That provokes a move by the US Secretary of State (an emaciated-looking William Hurt) to place the Avengers under the supervision of a United Nations panel.  (Compare all of this to the narrative thread in “Dawn of Justice” involving Superman’s being blamed for needless deaths and hauled before a congressional committee.) Black Panther’s desire for revenge against the person he blames for a parent’s death is mirrored elsewhere in “Civil War” as well—in the reason behind Iron Man’s final mano-a-mano with Captain America, which is no less protracted and unpleasant than that between Batman and Supes, but even more significantly in what’s driving the story’s ultimate villain Zemo (Daniel Bruhl).  Bruhl brings a coolly menacing attitude to the role, but ultimately his motivation is no less grief-based.  Unfortunately, even a rather dim viewer should recognize that Zemo’s goal could easily have been achieved through much simpler means than the ridiculously intricate scenario he’s arranged here, which—like so many such diabolical schemes—depends on everybody doing exactly as he foresees at every stage. There’s no doubt that the appetite for further installments in the Marvel superhero juggernaut remains very strong.  One wonders, however, whether audiences will eventually tire of the endless stream of solo efforts and team-ups for their metahuman stable that the makers have in store, planning as they are to release them like $200 million issues of comic books at regular intervals.  (The same question arises concerning Disney’s “Star Wars” project and Warner’s DC Comics franchise.)   Still, “Civil War” isn’t likely to break the cycle of mega-hits from this source, even though despite its technical polish, it comes across more as just another assembly-line commercial product than the special event that fans are no doubt hoping for, and a letdown after the first two “Captain America” installments."
"May 4, 2016",POSITIVE," The most important element of any superhero movie is the villain. He (or she) has to pose a credible threat to humanity and challenge particular strengths and vulnerabilities of someone with extraordinary powers. In “Captain America: Winter Soldier” there was a paranoiac Pogo-esque “we have met the enemy and he is us” theme that is expanded in “Civil War.” It goes to the heart of the Avengers themselves as a critical issues divides them so they are fighting each other. The issue is not one we usually see in superhero movies or indeed action movies in any category: consequences. Part of the fun of action movies is seeing all of the chases, fights, and explosions, without having to worry about the cleanup or what the military euphemistically calls “collateral damage.” But this story has more impact because it acknowledges and engages with the damage that superheroes do while they are preventing worse damage. It falls somewhere between “The Incredibles” and “Eye in the Sky.” The true meaning of collateral damage is presented early on in “Civil War.” Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) has just announced that he will fund all of the student research projects at MIT when he is confronted by a mother (a small masterpiece of devastation and fury from the extraordinary Alfre Woodard). Her son was on a humanitarian mission when he was killed in the Sokovia crash of an entire city at the end of Avengers: the Age of Ultron. For her, it doesn’t matter that the entire world was saved in theory by a supervillain who is not around when her son was killed in reality by a man who is. “You think you fight for us,” she says. “You fight for yourself.” Stark is devastated. “We’re no better than the bad guys.” The man we first saw demonstrating his company’s military weapons as though he was a rock star performing an arena show and who had no problem defending the money he made in munitions finally has to reckon with the truth he barely realized he had been moving closer to. And that is why, after the typical superhero opening action sequence we get a non-typical reaction. With SHIELD collapsed following “Winter Soldier,” the Avengers are operating on their own, without any oversight. A coalition of 117 nations insist that they agree to be subject to a UN commission (the “or what” is not ever spelled out because, what would it be?). One of the film’s most intriguing developments is that not only do the Avengers line up on opposite sides but they don’t take the positions we might expect. Stark’s post-confrontation grapple with guilt has the most anarchistic of superheroes suddenly looking for the comfort of some rules. And the shock of SHIELD’s corruption has the most Boy Scout-ish of all superheroes, Captain America (Chris Evans) suddenly resistant to putting himself under anyone’s control. Some of the avengers pick a side on principle; some are more instrumental or practical. The Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), who has her own history of unspeakable crimes, says, “Staying together is more important than how we stay together.” Directors Anthony and Joe Russo deftly manage an enormous cast of characters. It’s easier to list those who do not appear in this film: Pepper Potts, Thor, Nick Fury, and the Hulk. Pretty much everyone else is here, and superbly added to the mix we have Paul Rudd as Ant-Man, who has some surprises in store, Black Panther (a lithe, powerful, and compelling Chadwick Boseman), avenging the death of his father, and the brand-new Spidey (Tom Holland, with Marisa Tomei as Aunt May). Bucky/Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) is here, too, and his storyline nicely mirrors the larger themes. He has been responsible for terrible crimes and abuses and some can never forgive him. But Captain America knows something about military operations. “We try to save as many people as we can,” he says. “Sometimes doesn’t mean everybody.” He knows how a human can become a weapon, and he is determined to get his friend back. Remember, this is not the Justice League. They are Avengers, and another character’s determination to get vengeance provides one of the movie’s most signficiant twists. I don’t want to give away too much, so I’ll just say the action is everything you’d hope, with superhero-on-superhero collisions beyond the dreams of fanboy heaven. Keep an eye on the motorcycle. And the helicopter. And Ant-Man. And some cool special effects with Stark’s augmented flashback/therapy. And stay through the credits, of course. Parents should know that this film includes extended sci-fi/comic book action violence with chases, crashes, and explosions, characters injured and killed, and brief strong language. Family discussion: What are the best arguments for Ironman’s position on the accords? For Cap’s? How is this Spider-Man different from other portrayals of the character?"
"May 4, 2016",POSITIVE," It's almost not fair that ""Captain America: Civil War"" is opening barely a month after ""Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice."" The movies share so much, from their escapist origins to their melodramatic themes of male honor and revenge to ambivalence toward unchecked power, that comparisons aren't just inevitable, but required. ""Civil War"" is by far the more dynamic, entertaining film — and not surprisingly so, considering how well Disney has shepherded the Marvel Comics Universe to big-screen dominance. Crisply photographed, thoughtfully acted and often refreshingly amusing, ""Civil War"" injects doses of much-needed fun into a genre of filmmaking that's become mired in dour pretentiousness, when it's not ridiculing its own excesses in such meta-snark exercises as ""Deadpool."" For all its considerable strengths, though, ""Civil War"" deserves mention with ""Batman v. Superman"" in one other respect, which is to suggest that the comic book spectacle is in danger of collapsing under its own weight. Overcrowded and overlong, it often plays less like a breathlessly awaited chapter of a rousing serial than a series of concussive set pieces strung together by vignettes that are either deeply serious or disarmingly witty, as the occasion requires. Its sheer bigness ultimately begins to work against it — as does the troubling tendency of the characters to talk just enough to express their feelings of bitterness and regret, but never enough to actually clear up a misunderstanding or solve an impending crisis. “Civil War” opens in Nigeria with an anarchic, spectacularly explosive action sequence involving gunfire, car crashes, fistfights and an acrobatic chase through a Lagos marketplace. The bludgeoning continues throughout the film, which bristles with undifferentiated hostility and aggression, amped up by a fragmented filming and editing style that gives the action a jittery, hyper-caffeinated edge. Everybody’s jacked up and angry — jangry! — in “Captain America: Civil War.” The world is jangry at the Avengers for their vigilantism and wanton destruction of cities and citizens in their pursuit of justice. Captain America (Chris Evans) is jangry because the U.S. government wants to subject the team to the oversight of the United Nations. Tony Stark — played in a characteristically smooth turn by Robert Downey Jr. — is jangry because of abandonment issues that have lingered since the tragic death of his parents (John Slattery and Hope Davis). And I’m jangry because Disney hasn’t seen fit to give Scarlett Johansson  her own Black Widow movie yet. It's a setup worthy of Bruce Wayne himself. But thankfully, ""Civil War"" isn't nearly the moody slog that Bat-v-Supes turned out to be, thanks in large part to directors Joe and Anthony Russo. As in their previous outing, ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier,"" the brothers display a fine sense of craft here, executing the story and set pieces alike with efficiency and finesse. If the pummeling, numbingly protracted fight sequences begin to take on a sense of diminishing returns — especially after an impressively choreographed showdown at the Berlin airport — the Russos at least try to balance them with genuine character development during the quieter moments. Toward that end, the filmmakers focus mostly on the title character — played by Evans in another appealingly sincere, straight-arrow performance — and Iron Man/Stark, who almost steals “Civil War” from his brother-in-arms. Downey has been accused of mugging in the past, but here he’s energetically on point as a master of the universe who’s been brought down a peg since the last episode. It’s Tony who features in the film’s best scenes, including a clever, CGI-enhanced flashback that’s staged not just with technical skill, but mournfully authentic emotion. (As for the fantasies of inflated potency these allegories are meant to stoke and indulge, Evans provides the film’s most indelible image, when he flexes improbably buff biceps and — literally single-handedly — prevents a helicopter from taking off.) To single out the seemingly dozens of characters who show up in “Civil War” by name would possess the excitement of a fourth-grade roll call. Suffice it to say that, rather than psychic powers or super-strength, casting has always been the Marvel movies’ secret weapon. That holds true here, up to and including charismatic newcomers Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther and 19-year-old Tom Holland, the latter of whom, as Spider-Man, plays off Downey with the seeming self-effacement of an old pro. Downey and Holland’s first scene together is a delight, as is the deepening friendship between Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision (Paul Bettany) and some comic relief by way of a miniaturized, franchise-hopping Paul Rudd, as Ant-Man. As for the rest of the Avengers, it’s inexplicably reassuring to see the band get back together — albeit on opposing sides of the exceptionalism-accountability debate, and without a couple of key players, whose absence is duly noted. As enjoyable as it is, “Civil War” often teeters on the brink of sheer overkill. As viewers approach the film’s second hour, they could be forgiven for wondering just how much more carnage, chaos and character-establishing they can take. The Russos are at their best when they’re camouflaging their movie’s real intentions, which is to tee up the more than a dozen Avengers movies planned into 2020 (including those anchored by Boseman and Holland). “Captain America: Civil War” acquits that duty with taste, skill and welcome pizzazz — even when it threatens to become way too much of a good thing."
"May 4, 2016",NEGATIVE,"New challenges, darker reflections, stranger characters, and enough dramatic lubrication to feed additional sequels and spin-offs, adding more width to this already gloriously widescreen world."
"May 4, 2016",POSITIVE,The Captain America series are the most consistent and satisfying films that Marvel have made. And Civil War is the best one yet.
"May 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,The movie fumbles the question at the very heart of the Avengers but not before giving its fan base plenty of reasons to cheer.
"May 4, 2016",POSITIVE," To destroy or not to destroy. That is the question, both for the superheroes anchoring our biggest blockbusters and the filmmakers who bring them to the screen. Critics and audiences alike are tiring of buildings being toppled, cities being leveled and innocent bystanders being dismissed — partly because these climaxes are aesthetically enervating and partly because they’re morally troubling. And so it’s no longer entertaining for the next comic-book property to be bigger and louder than the last one. There’s a hunger for a superhero flick that’s lighter on its feet, smarter in its conception and more personal in its execution. Captain America: Civil War is all of these things. At once the third Captain America movie and the third (and best) Avengers movie, Civil War takes as its premise the very question I initially asked. After a series of Avengers missions have resulted in mass destruction and civilian death, the United Nations has proposed an accord to bring the superhero team under U.N. authority. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), the increasingly beleaguered face behind Iron Man, agrees that he and the other Avengers need to be reined in, but Captain America (Chris Evans), a literal product of World War II, refuses to give up their identity as an independent American force for good. This tension is exacerbated with the return of Bucky/the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), Cap’s childhood friend turned brainwashed assassin and the key to a conspiracy to get Cap and Iron Man to turn on each other. If this sounds familiar, that’s because Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice tried to set up a similar confrontation only a few weeks ago. Yet whereas the character motivations there were murky at best and contrived at worst, here they’re intensely intimate. The personal dynamics among the Avengers that have been nurtured in the various other Marvel films up until now come into play, of course, but the screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely also manages to provide motivation for the newcomers. Recruiting the recently super-empowered Spider-Man (a charming Tom Holland), Stark asks him why he bothers fighting crime. His answer speaks to his own experience, but also offers a way to think about the film’s larger question: how should the powerful exercise their power? This emphasis on intimacy carries over to the action sequences. There are some big explosions to be sure, but most of the action — overseen by returning Captain America: The Winter Soldier directors Joe and Anthony Russo — involves tight, hand-to-hand combat. Indeed, Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow fights best in close quarters, and she has an acrobatic takedown of a terrorist in a marketplace that’s worthy of a bruising Bourne movie. Overall, Civil War is structured as a narrowing down of spectacle, so that the action sequences gradually shrink in scale. At the end, the movie is reduced to a bitter brawl involving Cap, Stark and Bucky, in which the framing is mythic — the Russos place the three figures against a series of rectangular windows and use every inch of the widescreen frame — yet the punches are personal. Throughout Civil War, there are acknowledged costs to the movie’s confrontations, from the bruises that almost every character sports by the end of the film to the bystanders who are killed in the crossfire. (Newcomer Black Panther, played by Chadwick Boseman, enters the fray because of the Avengers-related death of a loved one.) The Russo brothers are careful to stage the movie’s bravura set piece — a battle royale between Cap’s renegade Avengers and Stark’s loyalists — at an empty airport terminal, taking collateral damage out of the equation. Yet even here the fighting suggests that these former comrades are somewhat pulling their punches, trying to sorrowfully subdue, not illogically annihilate, each other. Such relative subtlety is a key point of distinction between Civil War and Batman v Superman. Another is the movie’s ability to inject elements of levity here and there. Holland, as Peter Parker, brings much of this (I have to believe he was cast for his squeaky voice alone), while we also get comic relief from cameos by Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Ant-Man (Paul Rudd). It turns out that when you’re pondering the geopolitical implications of exercising your influence as a superpower, it’s nice to have a moment in which two superheroes bicker over their seats in a cramped Volkswagen Beetle. It’s the geopolitical stuff that ultimately distinguishes Captain America: Civil War, however. I don’t want to overplay this aspect of the movie and suggest it offers any ingenious insights in regard to global security and foreign policy. But I don’t want to underplay it either. The fact that a film this big is even asking such questions — and offering a variety of perspectives in place of propaganda — makes it an especially significant piece of popular culture. When American-led air strikes in places like Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan result in civilian deaths, many of us scroll right past the story in our newsfeeds (if the story even makes it there). But when something similar becomes a point of contention between Iron Man and Captain America, most of the movie-going nation pays attention. The hope is that at some point, we’ll put the two together."
"May 4, 2016",POSITIVE,Toss in a few secrets revealed and Captain America: Civil War kicks off the summer movie season with a punch strong enough to make the Hulk's head spin.
"May 4, 2016",POSITIVE," That's the approach directors Anthony and Joe Russo take with ""Captain America: Civil War,"" the latest Marvel juggernaut that brings together lots of characters and story lines and world-saving action. It shouldn't. This is all really too much, and it mines some of the same ideas as ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice."" But it mines them a lot better, and where that movie brought up some decent superhero-fallout points, relatively speaking, it weighed them down with a seriousness that leached all the fun out of it. Fun, happily, is one of the many ingredients in copious supply here. When you include Paul Rudd as Ant-Man, how could it not be? Then again, there isn't a lot of room for him, so he's kind of wedged in there, but it's pretty swell when he's around. It's not all laughs, however. Collateral damage during a mission in Lagos, Nigeria, is the last straw for the world's leaders, personified by William Hurt as the Secretary of State. The Avengers recognize no borders, go where they want when they want, etc. Typically, they do this to save the world, yes, but at what cost? That's the question. The United Nations draws up accords it wants the Avengers to sign that will put them under its supervision. A guilt-ridden Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), out of the Iron Man suit for now, wants them to sign. Captain America (Chris Evans) does not. He fears such oversight will prevent the group from doing what it does best, namely, saving the world. They talk about it, but come on. This is an ""Avengers"" movie in all but title. You think this is going to be settled with words? The rest of the Avengers take sides (though Thor and Hulk aren't here), and it's all leading to a showdown. Inconveniently enough, while the world's superheroes are debating government oversight, there is an actual threat going on. Captain America is trying to prevent his old pal Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) from being brought in for a fatal bombing it appears he is behind while in his brainwashed Winter Soldier guise. (He claims innocence.) It has to do with a mysterious man (played by Daniel Bruhl), but the whole point is to have our heroes face off, and in one of the more entertaining action sequences in any superhero movie, they do, at an airport. The battle is both a technical marvel and funny because, as Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) tells Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) as he's fighting Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), ""You're pulling your punches."" They all are, to a certain extent. At least for now, hint hint. Not every fight will be conducted this way. Among the many other things going on, we also meet both Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Spider-Man (Tom Holland). The former has his own reasons for fighting, and while you're familiar with the motivations of the latter, the Russos put an Iron-Man spin on his story that's entertaining. Everything is. Because there is so much going on, among so many characters, it would be easy to lose momentum. And some characters do get lost in the shuffle, though in the end, it's basically Captain America against Iron Man. But the Russos just power on through, pulling off the trick that ""Batman v Superman"" could not: Giving us something to think about and then, even amid the chaos, allowing us to do so."
"May 4, 2016",POSITIVE," Hubble's Law of the expanding universe? Ha! That's nothing compared to Disney's Law of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
With every new installment of the comic book franchise, the scale gets bigger, relationships get trickier, new forces enter the fray. In Captain America: Civil War, the 13th title in Disney and Marvel's systematic plan for global domination, a dozen superheroes come and go, lining up on either side of a tumultuous ideological dispute. With every new installment of the comic book franchise, the scale gets bigger, relationships get trickier, new forces enter the fray. In Captain America: Civil War, the 13th title in Disney and Marvel's systematic plan for global domination, a dozen superheroes come and go, lining up on either side of a tumultuous ideological dispute. This may be the first film since Avatar that truly necessitates viewing in a gargantuan format: On a plain old normal-size 2-D screen all these superhumans could get lost in the crowd, and in the accelerated blur of action, mayhem, and snappy quipping. In Captain America: Civil War, the superdudes' (and dudettes') crisis of identity, of purpose, begins with an earnest attempt on the part of a squad of Avengers - Steve Rogers' Captain America (Chris Evans), Natasha Romanoff's Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Sam Wilson's Falcon (Anthony Mackie), and Wanda Maximoff's Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) - to thwart a plan to steal biological weapons from a lab in Lagos. Poor Wanda, still struggling to master her hex powers (lots of waving of hands and wrinkling of forehead), and lacking a cool costume like her peers, wields more hex than she should, resulting in the death of 11 innocent people. When news - and news footage - of the calamitous combat is broadcast around the world, Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt with a mustache) convenes a meeting at Avengers HQ back in New York. Are you heroes or vigilantes? he asks Tony Stark's Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), the Captain, and the crew, informing them that 117 countries have agreed to sign ""the Sokovia Accords,"" which will establish a governing body to monitor – and approve the missions of – the superheroes. No more pro-active interventions. Stark and Romanoff agree to go along with the plan, Rogers and his pals doesn't like it. It's Team Cap v Team Iron Man - let the games begin. This issue - well-meaning mighty saviors of mankind, or rogue players wreaking havoc? - has long been at the heart of the comic book world. It's a debate that the X-Men have had to contend with (and will, no doubt, again when X-Men: Apocalypse opens in three weeks), and that provided the motive and momentum behind Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you want to get hifalutin about it, it's also an issue that's been running through the presidential campaigns: Should the U.S. act unilaterally in conflicts and crises overseas, or should some group like the United Nations determine when and what actions are necessary? But let's not get hifalutin. Instead, let's go looking for an uber-baddie with a German accent, which is who we'll find pulling the strings in Captain America: Civil War. He is Helmut Zemo (Daniel Brühl), a madman bent on destroying the Avengers who uses a series of trigger words (""Longing. . ."" ""Benign. . ."" ""Freight train. . ."") to unleash the thawed ""Bucky"" Barnes (Sebastian Stan) on the world. Bucky, formerly the Captain's sidekick and one of the so-called ""Winter soldiers"" who've been hanging out in a cryogenics chamber, has been programmed a la The Manchurian Candidate. The Bucky doesn't stop here - he's everywhere, doing evil stuff. If you haven't read or watched or heard anything about who shows up in Captain America: Civil War - and if you care - you may want to stop right now and go get a latte or something. Perhaps the most significant introduction in sibling directors Anthony and Joe Russo's all-but-inevitable blockbuster is that of T'Challa, a.k.a. Black Panther, the African superhero who is played by Chadwick Boseman and who is getting his own stand-alone movie, coming in 2018, to be directed by Creed's Ryan Coogler. A new Spider-Man also rises, although Downey's Iron Man aptly cracks that he should be called Spider-Boy. Young Tom Holland gets the role. His Spider-Man: Homecoming is set for July, 2017. Directed by Anthony Russo and Joe Russo. With Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Anthony Mackie, Chadwick Boseman and Daniel Brühl. Distributed by Walt Disney Pictures."
"May 4, 2016",POSITIVE,"With Civil War, Marvel Studios has proven, once again, that the world's heroes remain in good hands."
"May 4, 2016",POSITIVE," It's all been leading to this, ""Captain America: Civil War,"" the 13th film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (and the beginning of ""phase three,"" if you care about that sort of thing). Strange that what fans have been waiting to see for so long is their favorite heroes fighting each other. Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo (""Captain America: The Winter Soldier""), ""Civil War"" certainly delivers on that front, and though smaller in scale — the fate of the world is never at stake — it might be the most action-heavy entry in the MCU to date. It probably doesn't need to run two and a half hours long, but at least it's a case of too much of a good thing. A better title would be ""Avengers: Civil War."" Minus Thor and the Hulk, and with the addition of Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Spider-Man (Tom Holland), the gang's all here — Captain America, aka Steve Rogers (Chris Evans); Iron Man, aka Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.); Black Widow, aka Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson); the Winter Soldier, aka Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan); Falcon, aka Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie); War Machine, aka James Rhodes (Don Cheadle), Hawkeye, aka Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner), Scarlet Witch, aka Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen); Ant-Man, aka Scott Lang (Paul Rudd); and Vision (Paul Bettany). The wedge driven between them is an international agreement to place the Avengers under the authority of the United Nations, due to the colossal collateral damage that has come along with their world-saving. Tony Stark, whose crisis of conscience set him on his altruistic path eight years GO and who has been haunted by PTSD since the first ""Avengers"" movie, is all for it. Cap, more distrustful of government than ever following the events of ""The Winter Soldier,"" favors the autonomy with which the Avengers have operated until this point. Heroes choose sides, and tension quickly escalates to a spectacular smackdown at an abandoned airport. All the work done in developing these characters in the previous 12 films pays off big time here, as even among the nonstop fisticuffs each retains a distinct personality and navigates the action in a logical way. The movie assumes at least a passing familiarity with the characters and previous events, providing little catch-up on what occurred in the earlier films. Even new faces Black Panther and Spider-Man are introduced quickly, but thanks largely to a magnetic performance by Boseman and a healthy dose of jittery, adolescent energy from Holland, they're integrated as smoothly as possible. The Russos, who have a history of juggling large ensembles as directors on TV sitcoms ""Arrested Development"" and ""Community,"" successfully balance an enormous group of actors here, giving each character not just a moment or two but a real reason for appearing. The cast also includes Daniel Bruhl as a mysterious doctor who frames Bucky, Cap's once brainwashed best friend, for an assassination; Emily VanCamp as CIA Agent Sharon Carter; William Hurt as the secretary of state; Frank Grillo as a returning ""Winter Soldier"" villain; Marisa Tomei as Peter Parker's Aunt May; Martin Freeman as a government official; and, in flashback, John Slattery and Hope Davis as Tony Stark's parents. (I'm worn out just typing all these names.) With its protagonists coming to blows, the tone of ""Civil War"" is grimmer than anything else in the franchise, but screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (""Winter Soldier"") throw in just enough humor to keep the darkness from consuming itself. Spider-Man and Ant-Man, the two biggest sources of comedy, show up at the most opportune time. The action builds to a somewhat anticlimactic ending that isn't quite as bleak as it could have been and, as is Marvel's way, favors set-up for future films over closure. Not that that's a bad thing; based on what ""Civil War"" gives us, I'm looking forward to ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" next year and ""Black Panther"" in 2018. ""Civil War"" is not the best of the MCU — ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is still my favorite — but it is concrete proof there is a master plan and a reason for connecting all these movies in a series that has no end in sight.

"May 4, 2016",POSITIVE,"Where Batman v Superman tossed out ideas without ever thinking them all the way through, Civil War is constantly aware of the consequences of its characters' actions, both to themselves and to the people around them."
"May 4, 2016",POSITIVE,"  The difference between the two blockbusters – and Captain America is destined to become one, instantly – is a matter of attitude. BvS, which was a lot more enjoyable than the reviews indicated, was intensely conscious of its mythic baggage. If you gave Batman and Superman each their own boulder to push up an endlessly steep cliff, they’d probably say, “That’s a just pebble. Got anything larger?” The characters in Captain America, by comparison, are a kind of extreme bowling league: They’ll demolish as many pins as happen to be set up, of whatever size, but they’ll make sure they have fun doing it – regardless of their own lachrymose backstories – and let us have a good time, too.
  So: The United Nations solemnly informs the Avengers that henceforth they must operate under that body’s supervision, or they’ll be treated as rogue powers and dealt with accordingly. If any of these superheroes bothered to read history, they would simply laugh, say something like, “Yeah, you and your old man” and go about their business. And yet several of them, notably Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and War Machine (Don Cheadle), agree to let the UN call the shots. Captain America (Chris Evans) and Falcon (Anthony Mackie), on the other hand, are not willing to serve as multilateral wusses. This sets everyone on a collision course, even though the real threat to global security has recently been thawed out of Siberian ice.
  It takes a while to set all this up, but Civil War is two and a half hours long and figures you’re not going to go anywhere anyway. And once it gets going, it really has its act together: The major sequences are arguably more rapidly fluid than they need to be – CGI can sometimes play less like special effects than a superior sleight of hand – but they’re beautifully orchestrated and sustained. Once they take off, they don’t come down. Nor do you want them to.
  The new Spider-Man is terrific, played by Tom Holland with a genuine boyishness reminiscent of the young Michael J. Fox. And the Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) has an attractive gravitas – you almost believe he really has prowled up and down the corridors of power, both governmental and superheroic.

"May 4, 2016",POSITIVE,"Even if it's a great movie for the genre, the movie is far from perfect. [Full review in Spanish]"
"May 4, 2016",POSITIVE," When you make the promises that the Marvel Cinematic Universe has made since the beginning, eventually you have to deliver on those promises.  Since Iron Man in 2008, Marvel Studios has not only given us some incredible imagery and story, it has given us characters to cheer for, characters who aren’t simple caricatures of the comic books but ones that actually come off the page in a truly cinematic way. We’ve spent hours with Captain America, Iron Man, Black Widow, the Hulk, Thor, Hawkeye, the Guardians of the Galaxy, Ant-Man, so many others… all of these characters have rich inner lives and inner struggles. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is constantly measuring himself against the values of his father and finding himself wanting. Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) has steadfast beliefs that, while true for him, conflict with the politics and the needs of the modern day.  The MCU films have never been lacking for spectacle, but we have seen these stories play out over the space of 8 years now, and the potential for where these films could go has been teasingly just beyond the horizon. No longer. In Captain America: Civil War, Marvel Studios has fulfilled those promises and then some, resulting in what could be the best superhero movie yet. “Civil War” couldn’t have gotten here any other way, and not to disparage other superhero movies from the Distinguished Competition, but it is due to the audience’s investment in these characters that makes the emotional resonance of what happens in “Civil War” even possible, and it’s not a place that can be reached with a single movie. We have watched these relationships build and be tested, and Captain America: Civil War is payoff for much of what we’ve seen with these characters so far. Moments of quiet conversation become riveting, intense moments because we are so engaged with these people – even the new ones, who although are placed right in the thick of things, are no less compelling than the ones we’re already familiar with. I don’t want to dive too much into the plot; first, the story really isn’t all that different than Batman v Superman, with many of the same beats. It’s just that this time, the moments stick. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo are masters at orchestrating each battle (with second unit help from John Wick’s Chad Stahleski and David Leitch!), with cinematographer Trent Opaloch keeping things bright, and knowing when to set up that comic-booky iconic frame. In some of these shots (one major battle sequence is shot with IMAX cameras, and it is glorious to behold), all that was missing was the pre-requisite POW! BANG! and SMASH! Screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely know these characters, know their rhythms, and best of all, know when to be funny and when to go darker. It is so graceful how the directors, the cinematographer, and the screenwriters tell this story, giving us bits of information and character development, so that during the film’s devastating third act our home is on the edges of our seats. Steve Rogers: I know guys with none of that worth ten of you. I’ve seen the footage. The only thing you really fight for is yourself. You’re not the guy to make the sacrifice play, to lay down on a wire and let the other guy crawl over you. Over the years, Tony Stark and Steve Rogers circle each other’s values and choices, and while their positions may change, how they reach those changes is integral to their characters. Captain America: Civil War‘s plot is heavily character-based; there is no world needing to be saved here.  Instead, it’s an ideal, a mission statement between two inexorable forces – who is worth saving? Who deserves redemption? When lives are on the line, how important are your ideals? Steve Rogers’ ideals have not changed, even in this bold new world that he has woken into. Indeed, he sticks closer to them more than ever, refusing to compromise them in a more complex political landscape. For Tony Stark, each life lost in these conflicts is another scar on his already shrapnel-scarred heart. Tony counts every single one of them – from the days when he sold weapons to any buyer who could afford them, to his days as a hero and an Avenger – and when this is brought home to him in a personal way Tony decides to take the initiative to prevent further loss of life. But for Steve, who with Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) is still tasked to find his friend Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), these compromises are too much. A personal loss further cements Steve’s resolve, while Tony is reticent to even put the Iron Man suit on for fear of more collateral damage. When a global incident occurs and Bucky is blamed, both Steve and Tony are forced to test their beliefs, and their relationship. Captain America: Civil War deepens and expands on already-established characters in terrific ways, but the real joy of the movie lies in the introduction of two new superheroes. Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa is a noble, righteous prince of Wakanda, and when his kingdom comes under attack, as the Black Panther he seeks justice and vengeance for himself and his people. Boseman is electric as T’Challa, and if there were any concerns over Ryan Coogler’s Black Panther film, those will be disposed of immediately. I love the ferocity of Black Panther’s attacks, but even more, I love the innate goodness of the regal T’Challa, and Chadwick Boseman brings real empathy and emotion to the role. He leaves the audience wanting more in the best way, and his interactions with the rest of the Marvel characters are revealing and entertaining. I foresee that Black Panther will do well when it is released in 2017. Of course, the second character is well-known to everyone, but due to the Sony/Marvel deal we finally get to see Spider-Man in his rightful place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. What’s even more wonderful is that in only a few scenes, Tom Holland and the writers accomplish what it took five films to only accomplish sporadically, even though Sam Raimi’s films are an achievement on their own – this is the Spider-Man of the comics. Living hand-to-mouth in a small apartment in Queens with Aunt May (Marisa Tomei), Peter Parker is driven to be a hero, and his scenes with Robert Downey Jr. are funny as well as touching. We’ve seen Spidey’s origin a few times now, and Captain America: Civil War wisely skims over it to get to the heart of Peter Parker quickly and honestly. Plus, this Spider-Man fights exactly like we imagined he would on screen – fast, formidable, skilled, and always popping a quip or a joke. Holland has the total charisma required to play our Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man, and how he interacts with the other heroes is worth waiting all those years for. Spider-Man: Homecoming gets a terrific jumping off point in Captain America: Civil War and I’m so happy to see this beloved character off to the right start. In fact, the airport battle may be the best action sequence ever in a superhero movie; hell, in any recent blockbuster. Although the stakes are high, it’s wildly entertaining, funny, and true to the characters. Paul Rudd’s Ant-Man is a standout – Scott Lang is just happy to be there, and during an unexpected moment in the combat, Rudd is both hilarious, menacing, and oddly sweet at the same time. Unfortunate comparisons will be made to Batman v Superman, and it may be lazy criticism to say that everything that film does wrong Captain America: Civil War does intrinsically right, but it’s also true. When these characters are in pain, we are in pain, because at this point we have such a deep rapport with them. While there are a few more films in Phase III to go before we get to Avengers: Infinity War, and new characters to introduce, the confidence of Marvel Studios in taking us there is overwhelmingly strong. Even when Marvel doesn’t quite stick the landing in these films, they still fit well into the long story arc that Marvel is telling here. There’s an alchemy here that shouldn’t work, but it does – we get great writing, great acting, spectacle with real thematic weight, and characters that we adore. That hasn’t happened to this degree since the heyday of the Star Wars original trilogy. And it feels like Marvel is just getting started. Can you imagine the stories that these films will inspire? There will be some 7-year-old kid who will see these movies and think, “I want to do that.” I can’t wait to see the art that these films will inspire. Until then, we’ll just have to settle for the glory of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Captain America: Civil War isn’t just perfect summer entertainment – this is one of the best blockbusters ever made."
"May 4, 2016",POSITIVE," It’s an idea that’s already crept into Netflix’s expanding suite of Marvel series, all of them taking place in a battered New York still in recovery after the first Avengers film, where superhero worship exists alongside distrust over how Manhattan was made to serve as a battleground. That was also the point of the best scene in the grim jumble that was Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, which presented a street-level view of Superman and General Zod’s brawl through Metropolis from Man of Steel. One of those two godlike beings means well, but from there on the ground, they look the same — indifferent to the humans scurrying for their lives far below. Captain America: Civil War features its own script-flipping depiction of innocents dying as a side effect of its characters’ actions. The movie, which was directed by Winter Soldier’s Anthony and Joe Russo, picks up in Lagos, where Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson), Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie), and a still-in-training Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) are trying to stop the theft of a biological weapon. It’s all going smoothly, with chases through busy byways and some bruisingly satisfying Black Widow fight sequences, until it isn’t: A last-ditch bomb gets set off in the middle of a crowded marketplace. In her efforts to contain the explosion, Wanda ends up letting it take out a floor of a nearby building instead — and the record scratches, all the high-impact heroics ending in a flinch. The superheroes leave a scene in which bodies are being pulled out on stretchers, day saved at an unexpected and unwanted cost. Among the dead and wounded are some visitors from Wakanda, which allows for the introduction of the royal T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), also known as the Black Panther, but also ignites an international debate over whether the Avengers need to be regulated, whether those casualties were a fuck-up that could have been avoided, why they don’t care about international borders and sovereignty, and whether it was their business being there in Nigeria the first place. The Avengers are fresh off kinda-sorta being responsible for the creation of an artificial intelligence that tried to cause the extinction of mankind by dropping a chunk of the Sokovian capital from the sky, so they weren’t in the best standing to begin with. A reel of their recent exploits is played back to them as they cringe, all those de rigueur building-crushing big finales repositioned not as hard-won triumphs but as incidents of mass destruction. Sinister shadow organizations, malevolent masterminds, figures from the past intent on revenge, and power-hungry siblings — turns out there’s no foe as quietly formidable as accountability. Accountability isn’t a theme that screams “escapist fun,” but it is a nagging issue underlying almost every story about superheroes who’ve taken it upon themselves to fight crime and evil, and it's the source of the conflict in the improbably good Civil War. It’s easier to deal with the sacrifices that heroes might have to make to save the city and/or the world than to suggest that not everyone they leave behind is tearily grateful. But as the genre has expanded and matured and demanded to be taken seriously on screen, it’s a theme that becomes unavoidable, especially in a series that’s made a point of having consequences carry over after each fade to black and credits roll. Spider-Man, who is reintroduced in Civil War as a squeaky-voiced teenage chatterbox played by Tom Holland, paraphrases a version of his “With great power comes great responsibility"" motto. But believing that because you can help, you should doesn't make you immune from the question of who gave you the right to play savior, especially when you're a red, white, and blue–clad patriotic symbol who's decided to go global. And then there’s the point Vision (Paul Bettany) raises, which is that by demonstrating their power, the Avengers seem to be luring more antagonists out than ever before: “Our very strength incites challenge.” Captain America: Civil War isn’t the best film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the world’s largest-scale, slowest-released television show masquerading as a series of films; I’d still give the edge to the unfettered, geeky joy of Guardians of the Galaxy and the tense paranoia of Winter Soldier (and who would have guessed that sad, square Steve Rogers would be at the center of two of the franchise’s most interesting movies?). But Civil War is the MCU's most thematically ambitious installment, setting up the decision of whether the Avengers are going to allow themselves to be governed by a U.N. panel seriously and allowing the accrued history of the 12 previous films to weigh on it. On one side you’ve got Captain America, who’s got a post-Hydra libertarianish distrust of large organizations, but a greater faith in individuals, including poor brainwashed Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), who’s once again made into a pawn of the unfolding plot. And on the other side you’ve got Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), whose life story has basically been that of a nose-thumbing capitalist longing for regulations to bump up against, forever going too far and then being confronted, as he is in the movie, with the ramifications of what he’s done. It’s a disagreement the movie treats with regretful inevitability, like a family dinner that’s about to dissolve into a fight because no one can keep the conversation from veering toward politics. There’s a villain in Civil War, an undramatic but highly motivated man named Zemo (Daniel Brühl), but all he really does is force confrontations that were brewing or bound to happen eventually. He prods at the right cracks, and the superhero supergroup ends up splitting right down the middle, with newcomers and recent additions like the aforementioned Black Panther (to whom Boseman brings gravitas and welcome frankness about looking out for his own), Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), and Spider-Man getting divvied up over the two teams. It all escalates into a group showdown that’s gloriously fun (despite some of the characters feeling spliced in from a much more chipper movie) and genuinely sad, because if you’ve made it through eight years of Marvel features, you care about these quippy oddballs and their imperfect alliance. Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice had its costumed duo try to punch each other to death over their ideological differences before declaring themselves inexplicable friends. Civil War is all about friends coming to blows over fundamental disagreements they don’t really settle (though the movie tilts sympathy to one side), with all sorts of personal resentments and loyalties and surfacing secrets mixed in. For once, fittingly, the fallout isn’t on a large scale, with a city to be half-demolished and civilians to be sheltered, but that doesn’t make it feel any less potent. It’s like watching a breakup in which both parties land punches, only most of them are literal."
"May 4, 2016",POSITIVE," Nipping at the heels of DC’s disappointing Batman vs. Superman tickle-fight (yes, disappointing) is Marvel’s most jam-packed ensemble piece yet – and we haven’t even reached the Infinity Wars. Captain America: Civil War tears apart an Avengers team that faces governmental restraint, but in doing so it also allows the Russo brothers to continue growing a Marvel universe ripe with moral strife, comedic tomfoolery and more spandex than a Halloween costume store. Yet unlike most overcrowded parties, everyone in Civil War serves a purpose, and we actually spend ample time with all the heroes we love. Batman V Superman? Stark V Rogers is the heavyweight comic book fight you’ve been waiting for. In Civil War, the Avengers begin to feud when they’re all slapped with government sanctions that require their signatures. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) leads the chorus of voices demanding that superheroes be held accountable for their actions (which result in some serious collateral damage early in the picture), while Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) argues that legislative interference will only impede the team’s duties. Making matters worse, Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) is blamed for the deaths of UN summit attendees – including the King of Wakanda – in a devastating bombing, a situation which Captain America hopes to debunk and defuse. As the Avengers take sides, affiliating themselves with either Stark or Rogers, common allies find themselves fighting against an unfamiliar enemy – one another. With so many heroes joining the fight, it’s amazing how Joe and Anthony Russo never let Captain America: Civil War crumble under its own gargantuan weight. Not only do we gain closure on Bucky’s Winter Soldier programming, but we meet two brand-new mainstays (Black Panther/Spider-Man), reacquaint ourselves with old friends (Ant-Man/Hawkeye/etc.), and witness the world’s turning attitude on devastating abilities that go unchecked. Seemingly every Marvel character and their mother (or more appropriately, their “hot” Aunt) pop up in some capacity during this tumultuous period in Marvel universe history, yet no one character feels glossed over or forgotten. Against all odds, the Russo brothers dutifully make the most of Marvel’s all-inclusive cast list, while STILL making this a Captain America sequel (his name is in the title, and all). Even with proper homage paid to each savior, there are still standouts (but no losers). Take Chadwick Boseman’s performance as Black Panther, for example. We’re still some two years away from Boseman’s Wakandian origin story, yet Civil War establishes the native warrior so well that viewers will find themselves both engrossed and invested in the character. Boseman grasps onto the film’s most emotionally fulfilling arc and establishes conviction in his portrayal of the Vibranium-clad hero, all while sharing the screen with Marvel’s heaviest hitters. Same goes for the young Tom Holland, whose Peter Parker tags into battle when Tony Stark shows up in Queens and aggressively hits on Aunt May (we get it, Marisa Tomei represents a hotter take than most). Black Panther and Spider-Man play second-fiddle to the battle being waged between Avengers, yet both establish themselves as prominent Marvel figures with bare-bones, interwoven exposure. Ah, the wonders of focused, meaty execution. On an equally impressive note, little guys like Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) jump into the fray when needed most, complementing bigger players like Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) with comedic wit. The dynamic between Falcon and Cap is as bro-tacular as ever, while Black Widow – and Emily VanCamp as Sharon Carter, for that matter – fight alongside their masculine counterparts with equal, and sometimes even more impressive ferocity. In fact, Black Widow pulls off some of the most stunning and well-choreographed fight sequences during an early-on pursuit of villain Crossbones (Frank Grillo). Writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely find importance in each character’s inclusion (Ant-Man’s infatuation with Captain America, or Hawkeye’s steely glare), and none of them give off a cheap, fan-servicing vibe. Captain America: Civil War is not without fault, though. Once again, Marvel struggles to generate a main villain worthy of the Avengers’ time, even if most the film stays centered on their own quarrel. Daniel Brühl’s Zemo subs in as the film’s nefarious mastermind, except his plan seems like an afterthought to Tony and Cap’s ongoing back-and-forth. Zemo’s hard work appears unnecessary once his final monologue reveals certain motivations, and while his planning does further Tony’s guilt-ridden complex, Zemo himself simply peters out like so many generic Marvel villains before him. This leads to my biggest gripe, which is that Captain America: Civil War was primed to send shockwaves throughout the MCU yet never strikes a dagger that could have redefined Marvel’s more “accessible” tone. Don’t get me wrong – the Russo brothers’ film is an all-star blockbuster blast, delivering high-octane action from start to finish (The Winter Soldier all over again). And this paragraph doesn’t denounce everything I’ve raved about so far. But, with that said, Marvel only furthers their neat-and-tidy superhero formula through yet another exciting, effortlessly predictable, city-crushing story. I’m not begging for darkness – Civil War addresses innocence lost and ushers in a more mature look at superheroes without going full DC – but an opportunity is missed here, and Marvel’s choice to ease off the pedal subtly slights Civil War‘s contextual dilemma. Thankfully, nothing mentioned above stops Captain America: Civil War from being a jam-packed action spectacle loaded with cinematic riches. The Russo brothers have another tremendous hit on their hands, ripe with explosive ass-kicking and a push towards a more socially relevant Marvel universe. Hell, restraint, and balance alone make Civil War a logistical marvel, as characters accentuate their scenes no matter how expansive their inclusion may be. Evans and Downey Jr. lead an ensemble packed with hilarious, charismatic daredevils, cementing their legacy as Marvel’s Mt. Rushmore figureheads while giving “lesser” heroes equal opportunity to shine. The punches hit harder, action gets grittier (especially with Bourne-esque camera work), and even the laughs are louder. Civil War, when the dust has settled, supplies everything needed to usher in a new, exciting chapter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
"May 4, 2016",POSITIVE,The film's real conflict is idealism versus realism... The actualization of that conflict gives the Russo brothers an anchor around which to stage half a dozen top-flight superhero battles.
"May 4, 2016",POSITIVE," CLEVELAND, Ohio -- While ""Captain America: Civil War"" did not follow the example of ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" and return to Cleveland for location shooting, in a sense the movie is all about Cleveland. Some fear the bitter internecine battle could go beyond ideology and become violent. They predict (or, in one case, threaten) that riots will spill onto the newly repaired streets of this struggling city, which has spent months spiffing itself up for its moment in the spotlight as host of the Republican National Convention. In ""Captain America: Civil War,"" which is directed by Cleveland's Joe and Anthony Russo, the civil war that breaks out within the Avengers team begins in a similarly fraught ideological and political disagreement. But in pursuing this quest, world leaders begin to ask, have they brought so much destruction and human suffering they're really no better than the bad guys? Have they, in fact, created new conflicts with their ""heroic"" aggression? Following an Act 1 battle in Lagos, Nigeria, that ends with the Avenger-caused deaths of many civilians, the United Nations decides the answer to both questions is yes. It demands that the Avengers wash the blood from their hands and submit to tight U.N. regulation of their activities. This demand creates a deep divide within the Avengers. Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), wrestling with guilt after several recent debacles, votes for signing what is called the Sokovia Accord, named for the mass destruction at the end of ""Age of Ultron."" The rest of the Avengers are forced to choose between them. On Team Tony Stark/Iron Man: Vision (Paul Bettany), War Machine (Don Cheadle) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). On Team Cap/Steve Rogers: Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Ant Man (Paul Rudd), Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and the split personality Bucky Barnes/Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan). If that list of names overwhelms and confuses you, welcome to my world. I had a rousing time at ""Captain America: Civil War,"" but - as a person who has seen only four of the previous 12 Marvel movies, and has not picked up a comic book since I was 11 (and even then it was ""Archie"") - I confess I got lost in the scrum of characters. And I haven't even mentioned the villain (Daniel Bruhl), who is so shadowy and nondescript I never caught his name - Zemo, it turns out - and didn't know what, exactly, he wanted until the very end of the movie. The movie's Marvel-patented, lickety-split pace made me feel like I was racing to sort out the characters and their relationships, unsure of their many back stories, motivations and alliances. At a certain point, I realized I would never catch up and might as well stop trying. It's the Marvel Cinematic Universe, populated by millions of fervent fans who know every detail, and I was just a visitor. Perhaps none of us should expect these movies to work as stand-alones. The Russo brothers do try to help the uninitiated along. They deftly orchestrate super-sized action scenes for the super-sized cast, a build-up of fighting that culminates in a Battle Royale at the airport in Leipzig, Germany. Thanks to their choreography and camerawork, you can easily differentiate the characters (the costumes help, admittedly) and get a sense of their personalities through their fighting styles. Between battles, the Russos throw in more character development than you'll find in most other superhero movies (though less than in the fantastic ""Winter Soldier,"" which they also directed). Each character gets a moment, sometimes more, of emotion and decision-making; the scene where Tony Stark recruits the simultaneously suspicious and star-struck Peter Parker is a giddy high point of the narrative. Writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely are generous with the requisite quips and sarcastic asides during the action sequences, and build narrative tension via judicious use of flashbacks. The flashbacks hint at withheld secrets that, once revealed, only ramp up the Avengers' conflict. If a Study Guide to the characters would help all of us visitors to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, a study guide to American history might help others. Taking its place with the best superhero movies, ""Civil War"" resonates not only with our current climate of hostile political divisions and questions about American intervention in foreign conflicts. It also carries echoes of American anxieties that stretch back to the beginning of the 20th century, to World War I, the League of Nations and our entry onto the world stage.

"May 4, 2016",POSITIVE," Tom Holland’s new Spider-Man makes a spectacular entrance in Captain America: Civil War, carving out his own space in Marvel’s overpopulated movie-verse. He gushes at fellow super beings, oozing the wiliest charms a millennial fan boy has to offer as a perfect distraction while he’s webbing feet or lining foes up for a full-swing, wide-screen kick. Suffice to say, Spidey owns during the lightweight bits he gets to swoop in on. But they are bits, so lightweight they can easily be plucked out. Actually, they don’t even really belong here, dropping in during fever pitch in a high stakes internal feud between the Avengers. As amiable as he is, Spidey’s presence compromises the very stakes Civil War is trying to pitch. Let’s backtrack a bit. The latest Avengers foray is mounted on an ideological battle between Chris Evans’ Steve Rogers, aka Captain America, and Robert Downey Jr.’s Tony Stark, aka Iron Man. They need to account for the civilian casualties that have gone unseen under all that CGI kablooey from previous movies. The United Nations demand oversight when it comes to future Avengers missions. Stark, burdened with guilt over one particular victim, is all for it. Rogers is suspicious of overseers, because if he learned anything from his century-old history, it’s that they can be manipulative or manipulated. Evans and Downey Jr. make for perfect frenemies in this argument. They’ve invested enough in their characters’ opposing views during the franchise’s long haul that the slow disintegration in their relationship works like dynamite. It helps that we’ve seen the politics they wield as ammo used in real world scenarios, adding heft to their battle between caution and will, pragmatism and beliefs. Varying Avengers alums fall onto either side of the debate, either because of their personal history, loyalty, or the outcome of their interaction with Bucky Barnes. He’s at it again in brainwashed Winter Soldier mode, though the man within, once Steve Rogers’ best friend, is fighting to be lucid. All these moving pieces come together with the same Bourne-style momentum that made Captain America: The Winter Soldier a Marvel standout. And then the franchise gears get in the way. Before engaging on a mission to detain his friends, Tony Stark heads to Queens to recruit our new Spidey, a gambit that goes against the very reason he’s fighting. If Stark wants to minimize unnecessary casualties by following due process with his superiors, why would he recruit a minor into a major battle without running it by anyone? It doesn’t make sense in the story’s terms but it makes perfect sense for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Spider-Man, Marvel’s most cherished property, has just been returned to the franchise on babysitting terms from Sony Pictures (who hold the movie rights to the character). So Marvel needed to shove that kid into Civil War so he could promote his upcoming movie, Spider-Man: Homecoming, even though his appearance here works against what purity this story could have had. This is just another example of my biggest problem when it comes to Marvel’s recent outings. They can’t focus on telling a good story — and Civil War could have been one — because halfway through, the franchise is already thinking about what’s coming down the pipeline. So the beef between old friends and the real world politics presented so craftily early on fades away amidst pulled punches and chuckles, with Spidey and Paul Rudd’s Ant-Man joining the fray just because they were asked. Chadwick Boseman’s fine take on T’Challa (aka Black Panther) at least has a revenge story, though it’s hard to care considering how much he has to elbow his way in to get noticed. That the directors Anthony and Joe Russo manage to juggle all the promotional tie-ins with some rather slick action is impressive. They keep things ticking along, having fun despite the heavy baggage in a way that Joss Whedon couldn’t with Age of Ultron. But the movie loses its heart, becoming less about a battle between ideas and beliefs, and more about breaking up the Avengers so that we can see them unite again in another franchise cycle. Civil War never had any stakes, because Marvel would have never let any of its lucrative properties die.

"May 4, 2016",POSITIVE," A house divided against itself cannot stand. But in the case of “Captain America: Civil War,” a divided house brings out the best in this supersized superhero franchise. “Captain America: Civil War” is an ambitious undertaking, a massive venture that could have easily felt bloated and overblown, much like March’s corrosive, joyless “Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice.” Instead, “Civil War” is lithe and lean, no small feat considering it features a dozen superheroes vying for screen time and runs a wink shy of the two-and-a-half hour mark. Credit directors Joe and Anthony Russo, the sitcom veterans who also helmed 2014’s “Captain America: The Winter Soldier” (and who are also on board for the next two “Avengers” films). They strike the right balance of serious and silly, knowing when to go action-heavy and when to lighten the mood (the script, by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, is always ready with a quick quip). Most importantly they keep everything constantly moving and never forget to have fun. This is, after all, a story about costumed superheroes, not life or death material. “Civil War” draws a line in the sand for the Avengers, with Captain America (Chris Evans, handsomely anchoring his third Cap film) and Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr., wearing the role of the snarky Tony Stark like a well-tailored suit) heading up rival factions of the super squad. At issue is the question of accountability, and the governing of the all-powerful “enhanced individuals,” as they’re known in the film. “Batman V Superman” raised similar questions about the policing of superheroes (although it also took on elements of religious allegory), but “Civil War” takes a much more practical approach, with Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) introducing legislation that will require the Avengers to answer to the collateral damage their missions produce. Turns out a lot of innocent people die when you level a city battling alien forces. Put simply, Iron Man agrees with the proposal and Captain America does not. This causes a rift and forces the other members of their team – including Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson, who still needs her own Black Widow movie), War Machine (Don Cheadle), Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Scarlet Witch (Lizzie Olsen) and newcomer Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) – to choose sides. And those sides clash in a mega battle on an airport tarmac that exemplifies the film’s mix fun and flash. It’s no major plot secret that “Civil War” also introduces a new Spider-Man, and the film’s handling of him is a perfect example of its efficient style. Stark visits young Peter Parker (Tom Holland) in the Queens apartment of his aunt May (Marisa Tomei), and over the course of a few short minutes, Parker’s motivations and storyline are established. No need for an overdrawn origin story that clunkily rehashes the same old plot points; “Civil War” trusts the audience enough to know who Parker is, why he’s here and where he’s headed. From there, it’s up to Holland to let loose in the role, and his Spidey is a youthful B-12 shot to the aging Avengers team. (Bonus points for giving his mask the ability to digitally emote.) After the big battle, “Civil War” goes further into the beef between Cap and Iron Man, and both Evans and Downey, Jr. turn in strong work in their respective roles. But “Civil War” never gets bogged down, it’s as skillfully plotted as the rollout of all the Marvel films and properties that led us to this point in the series. “Civil War” isn’t so much a Captain America or an Iron Man film as it is a third “Avengers” movie (Hulk and Thor are name-checked but, alas, are nowhere to be seen), and it’s worthy of the first two movies in the series. It is a smart, fun, highly entertaining blockbuster. This house divided stands tall."
"May 4, 2016",POSITIVE," Had they spent their days in deep prayer and meditation and their nights sacrificing the blood of virgin animals to the god Eris, Captain America: Civil War directors Joe and Anthony Russo couldnât have wished for a better moment to release their film than this one â a mere six weeks after Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice proved exactly how incompetent and depressing a superhero match-up movie could be. The lingering stench of DCâs shit-show is all over the rhapsodic reviews of Marvelâs latest, which looks comparatively masterful primarily by achieving such basic objectives as intentional laughter, well-defined conflict, clearly-photographed action beats, and occasional snatches of geopolitical relevance. It is a totally adequate superhero film. For a large percentage of its audience â an audience that will, it seems safe to bet, lift it to yet another record-breaking opening â this is enough. For months now, they have been promised an Avengers movie in everything but name (all of those filmsâ major players are present and accounted for, excepting Thor and Hulk), with the crew divvied up between #TeamIronMan and #TeamCap like sides chose up for a lunchtime game of kickball. Civil War delivers on the promises it makes; there is indeed a big (and, admittedly, engaging) battle between its all-star superhero teams, plus a separate mano-a-mano between Chris Evansâs Steve Rogers/Captain America and Robert Downey Jr.âs Tony Stark/Iron Man. So that all happens, and it all works. But itâs not particularly inspired. Which is to say, if weâre really doing this, if the superhero movie is going to be our common multiplex currency/shared cultural experience, and if mainstream moviemaking circa 2016 is going to amount to some variation on the Superhero Industrial Complex, then we have to ask a couple of big questions. Namely, what do we want out of these movies? And what do we expect of them? For me, a viewer who has admired some of these films and shrugged at others, those questions of desire and expectation have become central to the superhero moviegoing experience, because the disparity between them has grown so sharp â and was not always thus. What I want when I see one of these films, in a landscape that has become particularly saturated with them in the eight years since Marvel launched their Cinematic Universe with Jon Favreauâs Iron Man, is for them to do what that film did: surprise me. Landing in theaters a year after the hackwork of Ghost Rider, Spider-Man 3, and Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, a trilogy of hokey, dopey, lifeless, worst-case scenarios, Iron Man was a film driven not by effects but by the wit and personality of its director and stars. The best of the Marvel films that followed merged the needs of a commerce with a kind of anything-goes spirit, so that Joe Johnstonâs Captain America: The First Avenger could be a gee-whiz WWII flag-waver, or Joss Whedonâs The Avengers could be (at its essence) a personality-driven character comedy, or James Gunnâs Guardians of the Galaxy could be a funky ensemble goof, or Shane Blackâs Iron Man 3 could be a snappy action/comedy, or Anthony and Joe Russoâs Captain America: The Winter Soldier could flip the script of the entire series. But in recent films, you can feel that freedom butting up against a rapidly cementing Marvel house style, and losing. These formulas are coagulating, and with each passing film, in spite of the busy casts and self-conscious one-upsmanship, they seem less and less capable of â or even interested in â surprising us. Perhaps itâs just not possible, when youâre talking about this kind of scope. Thereâs just so much housekeeping to deal with when juggling this many characters; there are as many here as in you average Avengers movie, thanks to the return of Paul Ruddâs Ant-Man and the inductions of Black Panther and Yet Another Spider-Man. Between catching us up on the returning characters, introducing the new ones, and getting in the requisite number of set pieces, there is, unsurprisingly, not a lot of room for improvisation. And for all the time we spent mocking Batman v Supermanâs ridiculous stop-the-movie-for-four-teaser-trailers sequence, the new character meet-n-greets here are barely more graceful (though the Only You reunion for Robert Downey Jr. and Marisa Tomei is a welcome one). Early reviews have made much of the filmâs questions of responsibility and accountability, a question similarly posed by Batman v Superman, and itâs worth nothing that Downeyâs Stark has a little speech that sheds more light on the topic than the entirety of BvS. But thatâs also damn near all Civil War has to say on it; in both films, itâs merely the engine that spurs the conflict between central characters. And here, thereâs surprisingly little to explain why Cap lands where he does on the question â disappointing, considering a) itâs ostensibly his movie, and b) the ways in which the character grew, struggled, and questioned matters of naivetÃ© and cynicism in his two previous solo vehicles. Here, he seems to just make up his mind right away, and hold to it, and thatâs that. Will any of this matter to the superhero movie fan? Probably not. Theyâve known what they were getting every step along the way: the Apple-like Product Presentation of Phase III titles, logos, and release dates in October 2014; the official announcement of its cast and characters exactly one year ago; the set photos, the character posters, the first trailer, the teasers for the second trailer, the second trailer (this time with bonus Spider-Man). Thatâs a year-and-a-half process of, yes, promoting a film, but also making a checklist, which Civil War works its way down carefully and meticulously. Thereâs much to like here: the way Robert Downey Jr. throws away a line (his reference to Bucky as âManchurian Candidateâ is a gem), the ease with which Scarlett Johansson (and her stunt double) glides through an action scene, how heavy hitters like Alfre Woodard and William Hurt make every second of screen time count, the big Soderbergh-esque fonts for the Russosâ globe-trotting establishing shots, the impressive de-aging of Downey into his Less Than Zero years (though Ant-Manâs prologue sorta beat them to the punch). Itâs not a bad film. Itâs fine. But these movies are sort of like going back to a magic show where the illusionist dazzled you the first time or two, and realizing heâs just going to keep doing the same damn tricks."
"May 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,Downey is enough to make you think that an Avengers movie with no action at all might still be good. It might even be an improvement.
"May 4, 2016",POSITIVE," Spoiler Alert! Nothing overt but I hint at some plot developments that some readers may not want to know about until after they’ve seen the movie. Depends on your concerns about a “virgin movie-going experience.” Despite the name, Captain America: Civil War feels more like an Avengers movie than a Captain America one (not withstanding Cap’s participation in both series). Those who attend this movie expecting to see a superhero smack-down won’t be disappointed, but anyone partial to Captain America’s saga may feel shortchanged. Although Civil War doesn’t ignore the events of Avengers 2: Age of Ultron (something I’m sure many fans wish was the case), it glosses over them. Instead, this is posited as a direct follow-up to Captain America: Winter Soldier. To the extent that Civil War can be said to focus on any one of a myriad of subplots (there are too many), it revolves around the fractious relationship between Captain America (Chris Evans) and his childhood friend-turned-Manchurian Candidate Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan). Once again captured by bad guys and reprogrammed to kill, The Winter Soldier returns to the nemesis column - at least for part of the movie. Aside from the Cap/Bucky relationship, Civil War is about adding a real-world element to the existence of The Avengers. Viewed with increasing distrust by nations around the world, the superhero group is asked to accept oversight by an international commission. Several of The Avengers - Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), War Machine (Don Cheadle), and Vision (Paul Bettany) - reluctantly agree. Others - Cap, Falcon (Anthony Mackey), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) - believe that autonomy is critical. Newcomers Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Spider-Man (Tom Holland) side with Iron Man. Thus are the battle lines drawn and what starts as a political argument evolves into an all-out war. Consequences, however, are disappointingly limited. The recent Batman v. Superman attempted (with limited success) to address the subject of collateral damage from superhero actions - that the number of civilian casualties is unacceptable even when the objective (usually eliminating a supervillain threat) is achieved. Civil War goes down the same road, with William Hurt and Martin Freeman providing the “voices of reason.” The concept of a government body regulating superhero actions is intriguing but it’s neither well considered nor effectively implemented in Civil War. In general, the X-Men stories have done a better job of this. But at least this movie addresses the subject matter rather than continuing to ignore it. The film’s success rests with its ability to match fans’ expectations when it comes to the superhero-on-superhero violence. Back in the 1970s and 1980s, cross-over comic book battles were always big sellers, and this is just the next step in their evolution. As in the comic books, nothing really bad happens when the good guys rumble despite the serious issues in play. So Civil War features a lot of pummeling and punching and blowing things up (which is quite fun in its own right) but that’s about it. Plus, with so much happening during the big battle, co-directors Anthony and Joe Russo are unable to keep up with the action. Some characters are left in limbo until the camera gets back around to them. This is a problem when so many characters are involved and the filmmakers don’t want to shortchange any of them. Late in the proceedings, an intimate fracas is more powerful, provocative, and compelling. That sequence works in a way that the battle royale fan service doesn’t. The stakes, which have personal as well as larger implications, are high. There’s drama in that fight; it isn’t only about spectacle. Marvel’s desire to integrate the Spider-Man character as quickly as possible into the so-called “Marvel Cinematic Universe” results in some poor storytelling choices. Although Spider-Man provides a valuable contribution to the battle, his painfully bad introduction hurts the movie as a whole. Given an opportunity, Tom Holland might grow into a credible Peter Parker but this isn’t an auspicious beginning. Thrust into the deep end as he is here, it’s hard to get much of a feel for the character or his circumstances. And, as much as I admire Marisa Tomei, it’s hard to think of a more bizarre casting choice for the role of Aunt May. The decision to give Ant-Man his own movie has proven to be the right move because, unlike Spider-Man, he isn’t thrown into the fray without context. Paul Rudd’s Scott Lang feels like he belongs. And, although Spider-Man is better known (arguably Marvel’s most recognizable superhero), the same cannot be said about this Peter Parker. For all the right decisions Marvel has made about meticulously building their universe, this misstep mirrors DC’s choice to cram Wonder Woman into Batman v. Superman for no reason beyond rushing her to the screen. The production’s tone makes a refreshing change from the dour, gloomy approach adopted by Zack Snyder in Batman v. Superman. The purpose here is to entertain viewers rather than depress them. Tony Stark’s dialogue is peppered with his usual cynical one-liners. Spider-Man quips and banters as he fights (one of his opponents makes a comment about this). And not every scene takes place at night or in the rain. There are plenty of dark moments but they are counterbalanced by lighter scenes. Comic book-influenced movies have reached a point where each one is more interested in outdoing its predecessors than telling a good story. The Avengers remains the best team-up movie to-date - nothing in the past few years has come close to toppling it from that perch. Deadpool is the most entertaining superhero feature to have graced theaters since the 2012 blockbuster. Civil War is better than either the bloated Avengers 2 or the lugubrious Batman v. Superman but it’s not as gripping as Winter Soldier. As far as big superhero mash-ups are concerned, this one whets the appetite without providing a satisfying main course. Marvel continues to tease us about Big Things Yet To Come. One hopes that, when they happen, they’ll be able to fulfill the expectations resulting from the hype and build-up."
"May 4, 2016",POSITIVE," Spoiler Alert: The  Avengers are out to kill … each other! Hell, it’s all there in the title — Captain America: Civil War. Steve Rogers, a.k.a. Captain America, again played by the most excellent Chris Evans, heads up one faction. Tony Stark, aka Iron Man, in the person of the estimable Robert Downey, Jr, leads the other. “I’d like to punch you in those perfect teeth,” says Iron Man to the Cap. Ouch. The issue for these paragons of Marvel branding is collateral damage. Look at the mess these comic-book weapons of mass destruction left at the end of Avengers: Age of Ultron. Buildings toppled. Property destroyed. Civilian casualties. The Secretary of State (William Hurt, radiating Trump-like bluster) declares this will not stand. The United Nations demands accountability. Surprisingly, Iron Man agrees. The Cap, ever the rugged individualist, does not. Let the games begin. Wait — what? Fanboys buying a ticket to an Avengers smackdown are going to be lectured on the evils of vigilantism? Isn’t the damage purely digital? Did Marvel suits learn nothing from DC Comics when the dark cloud of pessimism  hung a cinematic pall over Batman v Superman? Relax. Once the sermons die down, the action intensifies without letup. Pow! Pow! Pow! You only have to pick sides. Are you Team Iron Man or Team Cap? It always comes down to who has the coolest  gadgets. The Cap — all praise to Evans for bringing a charming quirk to this retro straight-arrow — has that wicked shield, plus the support of Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), and Ant-Man (Paul Rudd). Iron Man — all praise to the quip-ready Downey — has that bracing wit that can cut through any and all script grandiosity, plus War Machine (Don Cheadle), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Vision (Paul Bettany) and the young Spider-Man (a scene-stealing Tom Holland). The Hulk and Thor are no-shows. Nobody can figure out what’s going on with T’Challa, a.k.a. Black Panther (a terrific Chadwick Boseman), except his hate-on for Bucky Barnes, a.k.a. Winter ­Soldier (Sebastian Stan), the Cap’s BFF except when the brainwashing kicks in and the Winter dude turns lethal. Iron Man calls him “the Manchurian Candidate.” Nice one. But for sheer villainy, there’s no one sneakier or more dangerous than Zemo (a sly, hissable Daniel Bruhl). Kudos to the Russo brothers, Joe and Anthony, for directing the hostilities for maximum impact and without neglecting character. Their thundering epic is also smart,  snappy, politically savvy and blessedly fast on its feet, a neat trick pulled off by screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, who have been with the series since 2011’s Captain America: The First Avenger. Is it hypocritical for a popcorn movie to condemn violence while reveling in it. You bet. That’s kind of rule No. 1 in Hollywood. The third chapter in the Captain America franchise is more like a third Avengers movie with the climactic airport battle pulling out all the stops as both teams — decked out in their best comic-book drag — gather on the tarmac to kick ass. Sure, it’s too much and way too familiar. But an emotional subtext bleeds into the kill zone. The conflict between this broken family of Avengers probably won’t be resolved till the upcoming two-part Avengers: Infinity War, which the Russos will also direct. Meanwhile, Captain America: Civil War brings the fun, the fierce and the fireworks. Summer, we have liftoff. "
"May 4, 2016",POSITIVE,"  The more I think about Captain America: Civil War, the more I like it even though it is an absolutely exhausting film. It’s draining in the same way of running a marathon—rewarding, leaving you high on endorphins, but absolutely spent nonetheless. It’s a movie where they should give out orange slices at the end. There’s so much to chew on, so much to admire, and so much gravitas, that it advances what we’ve come to expect and demand from the superhero genre both in terms of themes and in terms of sheer spectacle.   Captain America: Civil War is a superhero film that undermines its superheroes. It’s not grimdark, all-heroes-must-die, hating gods-among-men like this year’s other superhero brawl, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.  It undermines its heroes to turn them into humans, and while I admired Captain America: The Winter Soldier for not giving Captain America (Chris Evans) feet of clay, directors Joe & Anthony Russo have wisely moved the character forward with a more personal story that requires him to be on uneven ground for the first time.  He can no longer be the rock of the Marvel universe, and this is a movie with no rock.  Both Captain America and Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) are in the wrong, and yet they’re both admirable nonetheless.   Following a mission in Lagos, an accidental explosion is the final straw that calls for the Sokovia Accords, a document that would make the Avengers subservient to a UN council.  Some superheroes, led by Tony Stark, believe they need to be kept in check and that the cost of innocent lives has become too high.  If they answer to somebody, and if there are regulations, then they can be kept in check and people will be safer.  Other superheroes, led by Cap, believe that “the safest hands are still are own.”  It’s the libertarian point of view, where it’s better to trust the individual than a government institution, or worse, a bureaucracy that would prevent them from going off to do good.   The conflict explodes when a terrorist act gets pinned on Cap’s pal Bucky (Sebastian Stan), and Cap makes things personal by going after his old friend to protect him, thus putting the Sokovia Accords to the test—do the Avengers get to run their own operation, one that has no time for government oversight, or do they turn themselves in and let the law run its course even if the law is misguided and there are nefarious actors, in this case the mysterious Helmut Zemo (Daniel Bruhl), at work?   When I was on the set last year, screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely said that they wanted people to leave Civil War arguing about who was right, and in a way, they’ve achieved that. Both sides are presented equally, and while this is nominally a Captain America movie, there’s a strong case to be made that this is just as much an Iron Man movie with Downey giving a raw, personal performance that’s the best he’s given in a Marvel movie to date.  But while you can leave the film arguing whether or not you’re “Team Cap” or “Team Iron Man”, you can also leave thinking both sides are right or both sides are wrong.   Civil War is a film that lives and breathes shades of grey, not as a way of saying that morality doesn’t exist or that there is no good or evil, but that not all conflicts are so simple.  Everyone in Civil War has a reason for joining the fray, and while some reasons are stronger than others (I had a tough time believing that Hawkeye was so restless he would risk jail than be with his family), they all make sense and it all builds to a reasonable conflict.  Nothing feels forced, and everything feels personal.   And it’s a personal film that’s 12 movies in the making.  This couldn’t be the third film in the trilogy.  It may be the third Captain America film, and it has some important things to say about his character and what he represents as an individual and as a symbol, but you can’t get to this movie without the Iron Man films and The Avengers and everything else from the MCU.  Only Marvel could have made this movie, and the results are tremendous.  In its own way, Captain America: Civil War is even more impressive than The Avengers.   I have to pause a bit and single out Spider-Man for being so damn good.  Yes, he’s a bit shoehorned into the movie for the sake of including Spider-Man.  He doesn’t offer much in terms of the larger themes of the movie.  But it doesn’t matter when the character is handled with this much joy and verve.  Not to take away from what Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield have done with Spider-Man, but this is the take on the character we’ve always wanted.  It doesn’t hold back with how young and inexperienced he is, and how much fun we can get out of that.  And the moves they pull off with this Spidey are nothing short of spectacular.   But it’s hard to pick just one amazing element of the action when everything is so incredible.  This is a movie that when it finally comes time for the big battle delivers on the “war” in Civil War.  It’s everything you hope to get from a blockbuster movie and then some.  I won’t spoil any of the action beats, but it feels like the Russos left nothing on the table when it came to turning the superheroes against each other.   And that’s where the heart of the movie is as well: heroes against each other.  It’s not about taking down the villain, which is why Civil War has one of the most brilliantly played baddies to date.  I wish other Marvel movies were as smart with their antagonists as Civil War, and what the movie does with Zemo and his plan (which, granted, does rely a little heavily on coincidence and luck) has a tremendous payoff, which I won’t spoil here. I’ll simply say that when his grand plan was finally revealed, multiple people in my audience audibly gasped.   Captain America: Civil War is a tremendous feat of filmmaking.  It will leave you breathless.  It will make you laugh constantly.  It will make you cheer.  It will make you think about the positions these characters take, and it may put you at odds with a hero you love.  I love Captain America and I disagree with his choices in this film.  And that only makes me admire Captain America: Civil War all the more.

"May 4, 2016",POSITIVE,"There's a lot of something for everyone in this standardly super, superhero movie."
"May 4, 2016",NEUTRAL," The question isn't, and nor was it ever, really, whether ""Captain America: Civil War"" will draw people to theaters when it kicks off the 2016 summer movie season this weekend. They will come, and in droves, for this 13th official installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the first in what is being called that universe's third phase. In fact, the droves have already started droving. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo's big-budget superhero ensemble opened in some 37 overseas markets last weekend, earning north of $200 million before even one popcorn kernel was consumed by its U.S. audiences. The real question is whether ""Civil War"" can bring something new to the table, something more than Marvel's tried-and-true -- but at times frustratingly familiar -- ""Avengers"" formula. The answer, it turns out is, yes, for the most part. Granted, ""Civil War"" has a whole lot of characters to serve, and even more backstory to acknowledge. All of that threatens to push the whole exercise dangerously close to incomprehensibility at times for those who haven't quite kept up with their ""Avengers"" movie mythology. Despite that, it still manages to deliver the blend of thrills and laughs fans have come to expect from the standard bearer of superhero movie franchises. Those who sit through its talky, belabored first half will be rewarded first and foremost with the finest fight scene of any ""Avengers"" film to date, one that doubles as a satisfyingly popcorny start to the summer season. Along the way, they can also expect a whole lot of myth-building, a whole lot of comic-book philosophizing, hints of modern-day relevance and -- if we're being honest -- a whole lot of jawboning that could have probably been dispensed with. But there's also a lot of action, a lot of humor and a lot of good, fun, sensory-overloading excitement -- which is why anybody goes to a Marvel movie to begin with. All anybody really needs to know going into the theater is that the ""Avengers"" movies -- which include the ""Iron Man,"" ""Thor,"" ""Captain America"" and ""Ant-Man"" franchises -- unfailingly deliver high body counts and enormous levels of on-screen destruction. As ""Civil War"" starts, the nations of the world have had enough of the mounting collateral damage. In an effort to rein it all in, world leaders have proposed a landmark accord that would provide bureaucratic oversight of the superhero squad -- and hopefully keep it in check. Half of the Avengers are cool with that. The other half are not. And so the two factions choose sides and face off, with Iron Man and Captain America serving as alpha dogs. Complicating matters is the fact that a mysterious figure has emerged (Daniel Bruhl) to activate the latent killing machine residing in the brain of Captain America's longtime best buddy, Bucky Barnes (who also happens to be the ""Winter Soldier"" after which the previous Captain America film got its subtitle). Cap is convinced it's all a setup. Iron Man wants to bring Bucky in -- or down -- once and for all. That sets the table for the film's real payoff, an Avenger-on-Avenger donnybrook that arrives about two-thirds of the way through the film -- and which provides what is hands down its most memorable sequence. In it, we get established ""Avengers"" heroes going toe-to-toe. We get a brand-new one joining the fray, as well. Most notably, we get the appearance of a certain web-slinging crowd-pleaser -- on loan from Columbia Pictures -- which serves to tease the 2017 reboot of his own hugely popular franchise. Aside from the massive mid-film fight scene, the most impressive accomplishment of ""Captain America: Civil War"" just might be in reigniting interest in that reboot. A decade of Marvel: For the 10th consecutive year, a Marvel film launches summer movie season(Pro tip: Sit through the credits for two ""hidden"" scenes, one of which includes said webhead.) Granted, there's a lot sit through before the credits roll. ""Captain America: Civil War"" runs just under two and a half hours, and it feels it, for better or worse. Admittedly, the storyline also feels faintly repetitive, coming as it does on the heels of this past spring's other superhero-on-superhero epic, ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice."" Snapshot: The 13th official installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe sees the Avengers picking sides and going to war against one another, with half lining up behind Iron Man -- who favors a proposed accord to enact bureaucratic oversight of the superhero squad -- and the other half lining up behind Captain America, who favors autonomy. : Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Daniel Bruhl, Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Jeremy Renner, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Rudd, Tom Holland."
"May 4, 2016",NEGATIVE,It's just stultifyingly dutiful.
"May 4, 2016",POSITIVE,"By this time one would think that the Marvel formula was getting old and that it wouldn't work anymore, and yet the studio just keeps making it better."
"May 4, 2016",NEUTRAL," The script has a villain with a point of view and motivation, though the “Civil War” of the title seems more a plot necessity than anything anyone thrown into conflict on screen actually believes in. And the villain is nobody we can sink our teeth into. The film lacks Joss Whedon’s light touch with that script, Jon Favreau’s whimsical way with the characters or Joe Johnson’s lump-in-the-throat pathos behind the camera. And there’s something unsavory about the absence of fanboy punching bag Pepper Potts, more precisely the actress playing her (Gwyneth Paltrow). She’s kicked out of Iron Man’s life in a manner that screams “pandering” or at least “market research.” That said, “Civil War” makes for a watchable parable about infighting, hubris and all-powerful “enhanced” personalities who never ever can admit they were wrong. It’s about the limits to absolute power and the consequences of “avenging.” The “Winter Soldier” (Sebastian Stan) is still out there, Hydra’s last assassin, and is supposedly behind a bombing at a U.N. meeting. Captain America (Chris Evans) alone is sure his former childhood pal has been set up. Bureaucrats (William Hurt, Martin Freeman) are all about reining in The Avengers, whose brawls have been cool to watch, but with a body-count and collateral damage only now being brought into question. Iron Man Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and War Machine (Don Cheadle) are reluctantly willing to accept some limits and responsibility for their “very public mistakes.” Cap and Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and the unidentified Scarlet Witch (tarted up Elizabeth Olsen) are too high-handed for that. Their sense of certitude has them hunting for answers. And this African prince (the wonderful Chadwick Boseman of “42”) resolves to don his own “enhanced” superhero suit (Black Panther) to avenge his father’s murder in that U.N. bombing, with or without help. Meanwhile, this odd Putin-esque presence (Daniel Bruhl of “Rush”) is piecing together old Hydra manuals, digging into the Soviet-linked work that led to The Winter Soldier, pulling the strings. Flashbacks foreshadow where the past — a younger (digitally de-aged Downey) Stark recalls his last conversation with his parents (Hope Davis, John Slattery) — ties into the present. We bounce from Vienna to Berlin, Washington to Cleveland, with every city ID’d with huge, portentous titles. And that’s where “Civil War” finally finds its sense of fun, dragging in much of the rest of the Marvel universe so that they can all fight it out. Iron Man summons up his Marvel favorites. Captain America has his own superheroes up his sleeve. Co-directors Anthony and Joe Russo are no better at comedy than they were back with “You, Me and Dupree.” The film’s pacing is slow, thanks mostly to a script that has all these waypoints to hit to reach its title-decreed destination. It takes a good hour and a half to really get going, not that there aren’t a few (action sped-up) fights and chases before then. They’ve made a film claiming life-or-death consequences for uses of force (Alfre Woodard is given half-a-scene to make that point), without the guts to deliver those consequences. They’ve introduced a villain with a real Magneto-sized beef with the world, but the script and Bruhl never let us see that. They’ve split up the Avengers with no more thought than they gave the other bone they tossed the fanboys with the removal of the GOOP gal. As shown by “Batman v. Superman”and earlier “Avengers,” comic book movies have morphed into the ensemble era with a sense of their own gravitas, with screenwriters determined to freight them with analogies to the state of America and the world. It works here about as well as it did with the Bat and the Man of Steel. Only this series — A”Captain America” movie without the heart, or an “Avengers” movie without the comic sizzle? — strains to find its footing in either tone. What might be lost without a Whedon, Favreau, Johnson or others of like mind, is a sense of fun, the real marvel of Marvel. And if you’re not having fun with guys and gals in tights and capes, what is the point? Cast: Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Anthony Mackie, Elisabeth Olsen, Don Cheadle, Daniel Bruhl, William Hurt, Paul Bettany and Chadwick Boseman.
Credits: Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, script by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. A Marvel Studios release. Or, she had the guts and integrity that Downey seems to have abandoned, walking away from lucrative material not worthy of her. Just saying it looks as if fanboy feedback chased her out of the movies. These movies are cynical products, not art. Spider-Man is as replaceable as a set of tires, Don Cheadle over Terrence Howard, because any black actor will do. Etc. Sheesh, well even the best films get lame reviews like this here and there. It’s your opinion, just doesn’t seem like you care for CBM’s too much,,especially smart ones. Here you are complaining about a lack of jokes, buddy the ‘Civil War’ storyline is not about that. ‘Winter Soldier’ should have taught your blind butt as much. Did one of the Russo’s have an affair with your wife or something?  It’s almost a willing suspension of the ability to enjoy at play here. Yeah they’re on a really bad streak aren’t they? Not making any money, critics hate all their work & nobody is excited to see what’s next……………LLLLLLLOOOOOOLLLLLLL!!!! Dear Edd; they wanted their gravitas and jokes, too. AN HOUR AND A HALF BEFORE ANYTHING REMOTELY FUN happens. I timed it. Did you? They want grief and violence with consequences. But they don’t have the balls to deliver that. Are you serious? THE VERY FIRST SCENE IS FUN. What’s more fun than a well choreographed and exciting action scene to kick off the movie? According to whom? The movie is a big hit at the box office, and has gotten overwhelmingly positive reviews from most critics and fans. You need to humble yourself. Your opinion is not a fact. Don’t bother replying because I won’t be reading. “Nobody went broke ever underestimating the tastes of the American public.” It’s turning out that you can’t make a comic book movie that flops. Even if it blows. Congratulations on being the less than literate, short-attention-span lemmings. Hollywood is making bank off you.  I’m no Marvel fanboy, and you may have valid points in your review, but I have to call bullshit on the above statement. The Russo brothers directed the majority of Arrested Development and Community – arguably two of the funniest, wittiest, most iconic comedy television shows of all time. It’s simply moronic to say they aren’t good at directing comedy. Strictly small-screeners, pal. I would disagree with pretty much everything you said, especially “wittiest.” “Arrested” had its moments, a cult thing thanks to savvy casting. “Community” was sitcom lame. I liked the movie, but saying two cancelled sitcoms are iconic shows is nonsensical. Seinfeld is iconic. Frasier is iconic. Friends is iconic. Community is not. It was canned by NBC, then it was picked up by Yahoo before being cancelled again. The execs at Yahoo who championed it have now been fired because the show lost them over 20 million dollars. Go to Metacritic. Fairly broad spectrum of opinions, less overall enthusiasm is evident there. Far tougher criteria for “top critic,” too. By the way, “everybody” endorsed “Barbershop: The Next Cut,” too. “Everybody” needs to grow some standards.  Thank god for it lacking “Joss Whedon’s light touch”. He’s proved himself to be a one trick pony who can only write good dialogue but still fails to write a decent story. A find it very hard to believe that the reviewer rates this lower than Batman vs Superman. Even if the reviewer didn’t like either film, objectively this film is put together in a more coherent fashion where the plot can be followed and the characters motivations are clear (even if you don’t agree with them). And yes I went to Metacritic, 75% there compared with the Top Critic score of 7.5/10 on Rotten Tomatoes seems to sync pretty well, not sure why the reviewer is using Metacritic to illustrate less overall enthusiasm. Surprises? did i watch the same film? everything was spoiled on the trailers.
And yes, this dude up there is right, independently of your taste, Civil War is a better film. Don’t have any problem with this review, cranky and dead inside as it is, it’s just opinion and that’s fine.  I should point out though that Terrance Howard was replaced because he was a dick on the set, not because any black guy would do. That’s the story, anyway. Never had a hard time believing it, but Hollywood’s rule, “You always work with talent” was tossed aside. Disposable actors. Kinda like James Bond.
“Dead inside.” Yeah, bad comic book movies in a nutshell. Pity their clientele is so passionate about piffle. "
"May 3, 2016",POSITIVE,Exceeds all expectations as this marvelous epic ensures every other summer blockbuster is vying for second best.
"May 3, 2016",POSITIVE,"It's simply just a story about the bonds of friendship, doing the right thing when presented with a difficult decision and how we're ultimately shaped by our choices."
"May 3, 2016",POSITIVE," The superhero-stuffed ""Captain America: Civil War"" - an engaging if overwrought series of vibrant visual effects sequences featuring furiously fast fights choreographed by editing software - takes on surprisingly complex political issues in Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely's dense and prickly screenplay. Good questions, yet this movie - a sequel to ""Captain America: Winter Soldier"" and a third ""Avengers"" adventure - begins on a clunker note when Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) says to her fellow superheroes: ""You guys know I can move things by using my mind, right?"" (Isn't that like Superman asking Lois Lane if she knows he can leap tall buildings in a single bound?) ""Civil War"" quickly recovers. During a mission in Lagos with Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Sam Wilson/Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans), Wanda loses control of her telekinetic powers, allowing an explosion to go off in a high-rise, resulting in many fatalities. The U.S. secretary of state (William Hurt, impressive as a voice of reason) acts quickly, insisting the Avengers come under the control of the United Nations as demanded by 117 concurring nations. Robert Downey Jr.'s pragmatic Iron Man/Tony Stark, perhaps wracked with guilt over the deaths caused at the end of ""Age of Ultron,"" says they must comply now to avoid more serious restrictions later. ""Civil War"" brings in Rogers' estranged best bud Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), a super assassin thawed out of a cryogenic deep-freeze in 1991 to be the Winter Soldier. He figures into a seriously edgy subplot about loss and outrage, with Daniel Bruhl's nefarious villain proving to be a super manipulator. Youthful British actor Tom Holland pumps Marvelous fun into ""Civil War"" as Peter Parker, playing him exactly as I remember him from the 1960s Stan Lee ""Spider-Man"" comic books. Holland, assuming the role from Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield, nails Parker as a naive science nerd and unlikely superhero constantly worried that his doting Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) will discover his secret crime-fighting identity. He contributes to a bizarre superhero pile-on of Marvel denizens, among them Chadwick Boseman's T'Challa/Black Panther (out to avenge his father's murder), along with Paul Rudd's Scott Lang/Ant-Man and Jeremy Renner's Clint Barton/Hawkeye, who pop in for enjoyably superfluous, virtual shout-outs to lighten things up. Wanda punches a huge hole through the floors in a high-rise without considering she might be killing people below. Later, the Avengers don't hesitate to destroy a few floors of a packed parking garage."
"May 3, 2016",POSITIVE," Even though Zack Snyder buried brilliant stuff in his moody opus, Anthony and Joe Russo maintain their magic touch throughout Civil War without descending into the murky passages we endure as Dawn of Justice drags on. 1 — If you do not count Guardians of the Galaxy — because it remains an eccentric outlier — Civil War now easily ranks as the best movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is more focused, more logical and less esoteric than Avengers: Age of Ultron; it maintains the nuttiness of the first two Iron Man movies (thanks to the droll Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man); it cleverly loops in Ant-Man (Paul Rudd is still hilarious); and it gives Chris Evans the opportunity to enhance Steve Rogers/Captain America, evolving him into a more complex, morally struggling and interesting leader. Meanwhile, Batman v Superman is not even the best movie in the two-title DC Extended Universe: That honour belongs to Snyder’s less ambitious yet more accomplished Man of Steel. 2 — The plot of Civil War is logical and relevant in today’s political climate. With a screenplay credited to Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, Civil War pits two factions of the Avengers against one another over the linked issues of accountability and government supervision. Rogers leads the “we-know-best” group against Stark’s “we-need-limits” group. When the two factions engage in a brutal battle, viewers are as conflicted as the participants. In Batman v Superman, our two superheroes are easily manipulated by the villain. Stupidly, their battle turns on a single name spoken: “Martha!” Arrrgh! 3 — Performances are consistently bright throughout Civil War, whether it is the lead superheroes — Evans, Downey, Rudd, Scarlett Johansson, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Bettany and Jeremy Renner — or the excellent support ensemble that includes Sebastian Stan reprising his role as the mixed-up Winter Soldier and sublime William Hurt reinventing his character from The Incredible Hulk. Formerly a military man obsessed with the Hulk, Hurt’s Thaddeus (Thunderbolt) Ross is now the U.S. Secretary of State. He provides the gravitas and grace necessary to legitimately hang the Civil War plot on global politics. Meanwhile, Batman v Superman suffers inconsistency issues, particularly because Ben Affleck is so much better as Bruce Wayne than as the clunky Batman of the superhero battle. Credit where credit is due, however, because there are great performances, too, including Jesse Eisenberg as psycho-villain Lex Luthor. 4 — The visual palette in Civil War is a joy to behold. The Russo Brothers again worked with a creative team led by Canadian cinematographer Trent Opaloch (District 9, Captain America: The Winter Soldier) and English composer Henry Jackman (The Winter Soldier). New to the team is production designer Owen Paterson (The Matrix trilogy). Together, along with excellent editors, sound engineers and costume designers, the crew seamlessly create a superhero world that seems both realistic and fantastic. In contrast, Batman v Superman features interminable battle scenes in semi-darkness — and Affleck’s reinvented Bat-gear makes him plod along like a RoboCop reject. 5 — The Russo Brothers introduce new Avengers with an electrifying buzz that makes the expansion of the Marvel Cinematic Universe as much fun for us as it obviously was for the actors. Specifically, we get the Marvel debuts of Chadwick Boseman (who played Jackie Robinson in 42 and James Brown in Get On Up) and Tom Holland (a 19-year-old Londoner best known for playing Billy Elliot on stage). Boseman is boldly charismatic as T’Challa/Black Panther and will have his own Marvel movie in 2018. Holland is amusing as a naive chatterbox version of Peter Parker/Spider-Man, a kid who has only had his powers for six months when Tony Stark recruits him for the superhero battle in Civil War. In Batman v Superman, new spinoff superheroes are introduced awkwardly in “found-footage” videos.

"May 3, 2016",POSITIVE," Let’s say “Captain America: Civil War” opened in theaters in Gotham City and Metropolis right around the time Batman and Superman were about to go at it, and let’s say Bruce Wayne hosted a star-studded benefit premiere, and Clark Kent covered it for the Daily Planet. When the lights went down and the storyline kicked in, Bruce Wayne would have been nodding in agreement with Tony Stark, while Clark Kent would have been thinking: I like the way Captain America thinks. As was the case with “Batman vs. Superman,” there’s a major rift between iconic superheroes over “collateral damage,” i.e., the loss of innocent human lives that occurs during epic battles between the forces of good and evil. “Captain America: Civil War” is a lighter and much more crowded film, with so many superheroes zipping around and exchanging blows that at one point it felt like the Marvel Universe equivalent of one of those music awards show all-star jams where everyone from Paul McCartney to the Weeknd to Taylor Swift to Adele is onstage. And although there’s no shortage of dark moments and violent moments, with personal tragedy motivating some characters to attempt to maim, cripple and kill, the overall tone is relatively light (albeit in a PG-13 kind of way). Iron Man and Captain America and the Black Widow and the Scarlet Witch and Falcon and Hawkeye and Ant-Man, among others, often exchange quips even while in the midst of intense combat sequences. I guess they don’t have to worry about saving their breath. Kudos to co-directors Anthony and Joe Russo and the team of writers for juggling more than a dozen comic-book characters and nearly that many plot lines, and only occasionally getting us (and by us I mean ME) lost in the Geek Weeds. They also seem to realize a movie about superheroes can respect the genre while also taking pause once in a while to acknowledge the sheer giddy silliness of the whole endeavor. “Civil War” has a number of pop-culture punch lines, from a terribly green Spider-Man referencing a movie from the 1980s to Tony Stark referencing a movie from the 1960s to Ant-Man meeting Captain America for the first time and not even trying to contain his fan-boy glee. The internecine conflicts within the core group of Avengers are so entertaining and dramatically rich, it’s a relative letdown when the attention shifts to a generic madman villain (Daniel Bruhl) with a master plan. The battle lines in “Civil War” are drawn after an overseas mission led by Chris Evans’ Captain America inadvertently causes the death of a number of innocent civilians. Cap and his team, including Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), are deeply affected by the tragedy — but they still firmly believe they’re saving far more lives than could be lost during their takedowns of terrorists. It’s horrible and devastating when dozens are killed, but isn’t that the better choice than hundreds, or even thousands, falling at the hands of the evildoers? Robert Downey Jr.’s Tony Stark doesn’t agree. World-weary and emotionally exhausted from decades of seeing the carnage caused by weapons of mass destruction — both the type his company once manufactured and the superhuman kind — Tony agrees with U.S. Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) and the leaders of 116 other nations, who have drafted a phone-book-thick accord giving the United Nations the power to decide if and when the Avengers will be called into action. Iron Man recruits a VERY young Peter Parker/Spider-Man (let’s put it this way: Marisa Tomei plays kindly “old” Aunt May). Captain America counters by adding Paul Rudd’s Ant-Man to the mix. (“Civil War” also finds room to introduce Chadwick Boseman’s Black Panther, who, like Tom Holland’s Spider-Man, will soon have a film of his own.) Even with a running time nearing two and a half hours, “Civil War” keeps things moving along, with a solid balance of character soul-searching and kinetic action sequences. (Some of the early action scenes are a bit TOO frantic, with so many jiggling camera moves and insanely rapid quick-cuts, one pictures Johansson, Downey et al. relaxing in their trailers or dubbing their lines while the stunt doubles and the CGI handle the visuals.) It’s nice to see further cracks in Captain America’s Mister Perfecto persona. When Tony Stark/Iron Man says he’d like to punch Steve Rogers in the face, we can relate. It makes the Cap all the more interesting when the Cap makes some really bad decisions. The wonderful actors reprising their superhero roles are as excellent as you’d expect them to be — although I did feel the mega-talented Downey might be getting just a tad restless inhabiting Tony Stark/Iron Man yet again. Forget the calendar and the spring cold. “Captain America: Civil War” is a classic example of what the big-ticket summer movie experience is all about. Marvel Studios presents a film directed by Anthony & Joe Russo and written by Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely. Running time: 147 minutes. Rated PG-13 (for extended sequences of violence, action, and mayhem). Opens Friday at local theaters."
"May 3, 2016",POSITIVE," Nick Cave has been singing about mortality for decades, and he's really good at it. Whether the narratives are biblical or pulpy, the victims innocents or death row convicts, the circumstances comprehensible or cruelly random, Cave's songs are on intimate terms with the infinite ways a life can be extinguished. And yet, ""Skeleton Tree"", his latest album with his estimable band, the Bad Seeds, is a relatively concise song cycle shadowed by death that feels different than all the rest. Read the full review.

""Blonde"" is a critique of materialism with Frank Ocean employing two distinct voices, like characters in a play, a recurring theme throughout the album and perhaps its finest sonic achievement. A party spirals out of control, the music rich but low key, a melange of organ and hovering synthesizers. Ocean uses distorting devices on his voice to add emotional texture and to enhance and sharpen the characters he briefly embodies. The upshot: They're all little slices of Ocean's personality with a role to play and they each sound distinct. Read the full review.

Read the review. The solemn, wrecking-ball mediocrity that was “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice” made either too much or not enough of its key themes: collateral damage; vigilante excess and the ethics of peacekeeping through extreme force; and, more to the marketing point, the bloodsport appeal of should-be crime-fighting allies beating the hell out of each other for what seemed like several days. Those bullet points return, to far livelier and more satisfying results, in “Captain America: Civil War,” the latest Marvel Studios exercise in ensemble superheroism and the fine art of making big piles of money. One: Tone. The directors Joe and Anthony Russo stage, shoot and edit their action in ways I don’t always love, but really do admire. When the Avengers, pre-breakup, take on their new adversaries, led by a sinister and plausibly motivated Daniel Bruhl, the individual beats amid the beat-downs resemble superhero action sequences from another decade at eight times “normal” speed.  It sounds cheesy, and exhausting, and parts of the movie certainly are that. But the best of “Civil War” is heightened and comic-bookish enough to work in the preferred Marvel mode of realistic fakery. “Civil War” comes from screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. They worked on the first “Captain America” as well as the second one, “Winter Soldier.” The former was relatively light, sprightly, old-fashioned; “Winter Soldier” dealt in the more profitable and fashionable realms of gargantuan suffering and threats of the apocalypse, goosed by a frenzied, hand-held camera attack. The new “Civil War” more or less combines the traits of the earlier two, and the mixture of tones, the grimness and the levity duking it out, actually comes out about right. Two:  Safety in numbers. Early in “Civil War,” a botched Avengers antiterrorist mission in Nigeria leads to many civilian casualties, echoing the collateral damage inflicted at the climax of “Avengers: Age of Ultron.” Should the Avengers be reined in and subjected to stronger federal oversight? Among the gang, some vote yes, including Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.); War Machine (Don Cheadle); and the humanoid red man Vision (Paul Bettany, who sounds like he’s president of the local HAL-9000 impersonators’ club). Others, notably Captain America (Chris Evans), refuse to sign the necessary papers requiring the Avengers to comply with United Nations oversight. This causes a rift and leads rather neatly to the internal strife and intramural civil war of the title, a showdown at the Leipzig/Halle airport. When I say the gang’s all here, I mean the gang’s all here. Many “Avengers” universe regulars suit up, among them Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner, looking surly and inconvenienced as usual), Scarlet “Finger Flames” Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Ant-Man (Paul Rudd; more on him in a sec). Three: Wit.  “Civil War” actually has it. Just about everyone on screen here, with the perpetual exception of Evans’ stalwart and vaguely synthetic Captain America, knows how to extract the wit in their material. For a couple of movies now, Downey Jr. has been working on autopilot as Tony Stark, aka Iron Man. Here, the character goes through another of his trademark soul-searches, but this time Downey Jr. seems to mean it. He invests in the dramatic bits enough so that we can fully enjoy the movie’s crucial change-of-pace sequence around the midpoint: the meeting between Iron Man and Spider-Man, wherein Stark makes derisive note of Spidey’s “onesie” and the two actors clearly are out for comic blood. It’s delightful. Nothing in “Civil War” takes your breath away. All the exteriors are shrouded in the same overcast, indistinct light. Little in story terms is what you’d call daisy fresh. But almost everything in it works on its own prescribed terms, and the quiet moments register.  It’s telling, I think, that for all the epic, scowly intensity on screen in “Civil War,” the moment that got the spontaneous applause at the Monday night Navy Pier IMAX screening belonged to Rudd’s Ant-Man and a sudden transformation followed by a swell reaction shot, proving that it’s always a plus to be able to see an actor’s eyes. Rudd’s Ant-Man is my kind of underdog in this universe, happy and a little bit stunned to be called up to the majors."
"May 3, 2016",POSITIVE," Chris Evans as Captain America—with that retro-patriotic turtle-shell of a shield strapped on his back, and muscles sculpted into the exaggerated proportions of a parade balloon—looks completely ridiculous. Yet his very lack of embarrassment is what makes him so shiny and wonderful, and his spirit sets the tone for Captain America: Civil War. It’s that rare superhero movie that doesn’t grind you down with nonstop action or, worse yet, the usual tiresome cavalcade of smart-ass wisecracks. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo have reassembled essentially the same cast from Joss Whedon’s leaden 2015 Avengers: Age of Ultron, including Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, who, thankfully, has more than six lines this time around, and Robert Downey Jr., who dials down his high-strung Tony Stark/Iron Man shtick to bearable levels. Overall, the movie around them is smarter and more intimate. What do superheroes talk about when we’re not around? The dialogue here gives us some idea: It’s Paul Bettany’s gallant, solar-powered Vision attempting to cook a meal for Elizabeth Olsen’s soulful but stubborn Scarlet Witch, under house arrest for possible misuse of her fire-starting powers. This is an act of selfless romantic daring, considering he’s never even eaten before. Civil War’s plot is more of the usual: The Avengers must work together to vanquish evil, yet their petty disagreements divide them. Well, of course they do! And as in the recent Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, this superhero supergang has been supershamed by the fact that too many innocent civilians tend to be killed while they’re doing the business of dispatching baddies. (At the beginning of Civil War, it’s Olsen’s Scarlet Witch who commits a particularly glaring transgression—she registers the horror of what she’s done with a kind of anguished matter-of-factness, a recognition that she’ll have to live with the consequences for the rest of her days.) Just why are superhero movies only just now cottoning to how many random humans are killed or injured while their protagonists are reducing skyscrapers to rubble or making smoldering scrapheaps out of giant mechanical villains? This carte-blanche carnage has been happening for years now, especially given how elaborate special effects have become; until recently, it seems, we’ve just been expected to look the other way, muttering something about the greater good. Now, superhero guilt and culpability are major plot points, though it’s hard to say if it’s a way of making these characters richer and more complex, or simply of justifying bigger, more elaborate destructo-fests, as long as they’re accompanied by some token handwringing afterward. Still, in Civil War, regret feels like progress, a hook of feeling for the actors to grab onto (and not just an excuse for a sodden gloominess à la Batman v Superman). Like all modern superhero movies, even this relatively restrained one is still bigger and louder than it needs to be, and it’s overstuffed with action sequences. But the Russos add enough witty touches to prevent complete brain shutdown: There’s Sebastian Stan’s beefy, bipolar Bucky Barnes/Winter Soldier handily mounting a spinning motorcycle he’s just grabbed out of the air, and the vision of one superhero (whose identity shall not be revealed by order of the spoiler police) standing so tall and mighty above the rest that he could be a Ray Harryhausen stop-motion giant—it’s a computer-generated effect that still, somehow, retains enough awkwardness to look endearingly handmade. Yet Captain America is most enjoyable for its quieter moments, and for its more intimate special effects, like Scarlet Witch’s ability to make tiny tongues of flame leap from fingertip to fingertip, or even just the way Evans’s Captain America, frozen in the ’40s only to be thawed in a strange, modern world, always looks a little dreamily out of place, as if he’d really prefer to be listening to Sinatra. And there’s a superb new addition, Chadwick Boseman’s Black Panther, an African prince turned enigmatic crimefighter. As both man and cat, he’s patrician and polished, a touch of class padding quietly onto the scene. Like him, Civil War, at its best, is blessedly light on its superhero-booted feet."
"May 3, 2016",POSITIVE," Most of Captain America: Civil War breaks down into two storytelling modes. In one, heroes have quiet, sincere talks about their personal beliefs and intentions. They explore the principles they operate on, and sincerely try to communicate them to each other. In the other mode, they get pissed because communications have broken down, and they find creative, involved, and very immediate ways to beat the ever-living crap out of each other.
It's no surprise that one of these modes is much more fun than the other. And it's no surprise that both modes inform each other. Civil War's internal politics, and its symbolic ones, are deeply complicated. (We'll get into all that in a later piece, once more people have seen the film.) And its storytelling is similarly complicated, and not always successful. In terms of narrative ambition, and giving meaningful screen time to an ever-growing stable of onscreen characters, Civil War rivals Joss Whedon's MCU standout The Avengers. And in terms of sheer thrill, it surpasses Avengers — at least for fans who come prestocked with an emotional investment in these characters. It's no surprise that one of these modes is much more fun than the other. And it's no surprise that both modes inform each other.

And in terms of sheer thrill, it surpasses Avengers — at least for fans who come prestocked with an emotional investment in these characters. Captain America: Civil War is openly, unapologetically for fans. More than any Marvel Cinematic Universe film before it, it trades on the history built up in previous films, the protagonists' relationships with each other, and the goodwill (or lack thereof) they've engendered in audiences. Viewers who come in not caring about them personally — about their agendas, their emotional well-being, or at the very least, who would win in a fight — may find the film endlessly frustrating. Screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely spend a lot of time on scene-setting and obfuscation, and on callbacks and echoes. Like any ongoing comic title, this is a continuing story, and it's aimed squarely at people who are already completely on board. Civil War has more baggage to unpack than Avengers, and less room for the MCU franchise's trademark humor. Still, by comparison with the heavy-handed hero-on-hero face-off in Batman v Superman, Civil War maintains a wry, light voice. Markus and McFeely also wrote the MCU's previous two Captain America films. They also scripted Thor: The Dark World, and co-created the spinoff TV series Agent Carter. And they're writing the two-part Avengers: Infinity War saga that's meant to cap Phase Three of the MCU film saga. At this point, they're intimately familiar with MCU banter, and the shifts from somber to sarcastic that keep the tone manageable. They're also intimately familiar with Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) and Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), and they assume viewers are as well. But that doesn't mean they charge directly into the action. Civil War hinges on the ideological clash between Steve (aka Captain America) and Tony (aka Iron Man), the two generals in the titular civil war among the Avengers super-group. When an Avengers intervention results in civilian casualties, and the UN attempts to put the heroes under bureaucratic supervision, Tony is in favor, and Cap isn't. The involvement of Cap's old sidekick Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), both in the past and in the present, hugely complicates the situation. So do other behind-the-scenes factors. After three Iron Man films, two Captain America films, and two Avengers films where they fight side-by-side, Steve and Tony's personalities are well-established, and their roles in this particular drama are foreordained: Captain America is a compulsive do-gooder who can't imagine asking permission to save lives. Tony has seen his reckless arrogance cause catastrophes, and he recognizes the need for responsible oversight. Both men have good reasons for their perspectives. It could be seen as a flaw in Civil War that neither of them makes a particularly good argument for those perspectives. Their ideological argument rapidly becomes a physical one, and it almost immediately morphs from a frustrated shoving match into an ugly, fury-driven grudge match. But everything about it feels consistent with the MCU's past. Steve and Tony could spend an hour of the film laying out their arguments, but it would be out of character for both of them. They're used to solving their problems with brute force, clever tactics, and steely determination, not with rhetoric. And the questions they're facing are large, abstract, and morally complicated, in part because they reflect actual current events. Like the previous Captain America movies, Civil War looks to America's current foreign affairs policies for inspiration. Questions like ""Do citizens of one nation have a right to unilaterally address global problems?"" or ""Who takes responsibility for civilian collateral damage incurred in an attempt to save more lives?"" are rooted in real international debates, and they aren't going to be solved overnight by people in colorful costumes. For balked and cornered heroes, punching everyone who disagrees with them at least feels like an immediate answer. The questions the Avengers face in Civil War are also increasingly familiar from other superhero films. Man Of Steel kicked off a long, weary cultural conversation about what makes a hero, and whether the excitement of massive-scale onscreen demolition excuses heroes with little interest in protecting individual people. The MCU movies have continued that conversation, particularly in Avengers: Age Of Ultron, where rescuing individuals amid global-scale catastrophe became an overt part of the story. Still, civilians died in that film, and the Avengers are continuing to pay the price, both in international disapproval and in personal guilt. Markus and McFeely make sure that guilt is felt over and over, and not just by the leads. Part of the focus-shift to the less central characters is just a practical attempt to make them real enough to the audience that it matters who ends up on what side and why. The approach isn't entirely even-handed: sidekicks Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and War Machine (Don Cheadle) both get plenty of time to prove themselves in combat. But even though they have the most right, and the most responsibility, to call Cap and Iron Man to account for their actions, they're both distressingly willing to do whatever they're told. The approach can also feel narratively lumpy — the film takes significant detours for Vision's experiments with cooking and the inadequacies of Spider-Man's homemade crime-fighting costume. When the screenwriters focus on trivia, inertia sets in rapidly. Still, even dull downtime moments make the characters a little more human, and a little less like rubber CGI figures. Once they start smashing each other through walls, any element that differentiates them from each other helps a little. Still, Civil War lives in those moments when the smashing starts. The central fight between the two halves of the Avengers group is a tremendous sequence, full of imaginative teamwork and impressive effects. (Though the film does often feel the loss of the franchise's two champion smashers, Thor and Hulk, who are both AWOL for this installment.) It's the sequence fans will be talking about long after they've lost interest in the ins and outs of the film's politics. But even the non-fans may appreciate the rigor invested in making sure everyone on the battlefield has a different reason for showing up. Like Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Civil War lets some of its more recent characters serve as franchise fanboys: Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and Spider-Man (Tom Holland) both drool over the chance to stand next to their heroes in a fight, and neither question what those heroes tell them. Other characters have ugly personal agendas. In particular, Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), introduced to the MCU films here ahead of his 2018 solo film, proves capable and compelling, but he's exactly the kind of border-ignoring, utterly unchecked international vigilante the UN is afraid of. Off the battlefield, his personal vendetta doesn't stand up to the faintest hint of moral scrutiny. In a fight, when he's clawing his way through all other adversaries to get to his chosen target, it's simultaneously crucial to him, and irrelevant to almost everyone else. And that complicated interplay between individual and group motives becomes significant, because for all the big, symbolic issues of responsibility, transparency, and oversight, at heart, it's just a story about personality conflicts and personal loyalty. Civil War is thrilling as spectacle, but it'll only feel satisfying to viewers who already care about these characters and their choices, and feel the weight of their lightly sketched moral conflicts. To MCU fans, it matters that these heroes disagree. It matters more that they have no idea how to resolve those disagreements without trying to flatten each other. But just raising the questions, and heaping emotion and violence on the problem, doesn't get the writers any closer to answers. Captain America: Civil War ends with nothing really resolved — not the rift in the Avengers, not the question of whether UN supervision is a workable solution, not the question of responsibility for the aftereffects of violence. That's meant to set up more films to come, and it lets all the characters walk away equally compromised, with no one fully admitting fault. It also pulls the story closer to the real world. There are no easy answers to any of these questions. Sometimes watching them debated endlessly and fruitlessly makes us all feel like punching someone in the face. On that front, at least, Civil War fully delivers."
"May 3, 2016",POSITIVE," The Marvel Cinematic Universe has a villain problem. With a few blessed exceptions—Tom Hiddleston’s arrogant trickster god Loki; the ex-boyfriend-from-hell played by David Tennant on Jessica Jones—its bad guys aren’t half as interesting as its good guys. That’s true, mostly, of the sneering Machiavellian schemer Daniel Brühl portrays in Captain America: Civil War, who’s about as unmemorable as the usual intergalactic conqueror or corporate scumbag making life tough for Earth’s mightiest heroes. But the film’s hook, its big conceptual draw, is that it doesn’t really need a heavy at all: In this long but brightly entertaining return trip to the ever-expanding MCU, star-spangled do-gooder Captain America (Chris Evans) and playboy flyboy Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) find themselves on opposite sides of a conflict, their typically testy rapport flowering into a full-on showdown. The studio solves its villain problem by basically removing the villain from the equation. That’s an old comic-book trick, pitting the superheroes against each other, and Civil War draws a battle line down Marvel’s whole roster, dividing the extended Avengers family into opposing camps. Don’t be fooled by the title, which tips off a slight allegiance in sympathies more than anything else: This is an Avengers movie, every bit as densely packed with plot, locations, costumed characters, melodrama, screwball comedy, and future-sequel groundwork as last summer’s Age Of Ultron. That Civil War doesn’t collapse under the weight of its various moving parts, that it manages to be the most serious entry yet in this franchise of franchises without sacrificing much in the way of valuable comic relief, is a testament to the creative mojo of directors Joe and Anthony Russo and screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. They’re as close to a dream team as Marvel’s got, and as in the last Captain America movie, the propulsive conspiracy thriller The Winter Soldier, they wring plenty of thrills and grace notes from company mandate. Though the basic plot outline comes from a decade-old crossover comic-book event, Civil War is more like the summation of its dozen big-screen predecessors, building the titular title match from the wreckage of several consecutive city-destroying climaxes and the seeds of friendly-fire antagonism first planted in The Avengers. As in this year’s other superhero grudge match, collateral damage is the catalyst: After an opening standoff with mercenaries adds another few names to the body count, the Secretary Of State (William Hurt) calls for some oversight, demanding that the Avengers submit to the authority of the United Nations. Haunted by guilt (and the breakup blues), Tony Stark, a.k.a Iron Man, proves amenable to the sanctions. But Steve Rogers, a.k.a. Captain America, wants to stay independent, fearful as he is that politics will begin to muddy the ethics of the crime-fighting business. Things get personal after a terrorist attack puts Cap’s brainwashed ally Bucky (Sebastian Stan), a.k.a the Winter Soldier, in the line of fire, and suddenly half the team is chasing the other half across the globe. It’s a bit like The Fugitive, if Harrison Ford had super-powered backup and the man with one arm was the one trying to prove his innocence. Directing episodes of Arrested Development and Community might seem like odd qualifications for a tenure in tentpole mythmaking, but orchestrating the comic chaos of those seminal sitcoms has made the Russos old pros at ensemble multitasking. Civil War somehow does right by all its bickering attractions, from airborne sidekicks the Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and War Machine (Don Cheadle) to steely old allies Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) to the most magical members of the team, Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision (Paul Bettany), who bond during a faintly romantic dinner for two. The filmmakers assume a total audience familiarity with these figures, most of whom are identified only by their civilian names. (Skip last summer’s Ant-Man? Don’t expect the movie to catch you up on what Paul Rudd’s doing here.) This being a Marvel movie, Civil War also shoehorns in a couple of new teammates, about as gracefully as possible. It helps that they’re instantly appealing: Chadwick Boseman (42, Get On Up) gives the African prince T’Challa, a.k.a. Black Panther, a soulful regal intensity, while Tom Holland (The Impossible) redeems the idea of yet another Spider-Man reboot by playing the character as an endearing ball of adolescent energy. There’s obvious political metaphor to all this Avenger-on-Avenger violence, the infighting doubling as a crude debate on unilateral action. (Captain America, firmly against drone warfare in The Winter Soldier, here makes the case that a war on terror may result in occasional civilian casualties—a shift in worldview that might generously be read as a reflection of the country’s own sparring, mutating ideologies.) If that seems like pretty heavy thematic material for an all-hands-on-deck superhero jamboree, Civil War wears it lightly: The film is ambivalent about foreign policy but absolutely staunch in its belief that watching jacked-up titans bound through rush hour traffic is really cool. The action scenes in this movie, which blend intelligible CGI wizardry with vehicular mayhem and parkour-inflected fight choreography, are generally spectacular. It’s clear that the Russos have thought about how each of their numerous players would use their abilities, and have carefully staged the various showstoppers—like a brawl that plays out on a stairwell, creating multiple planes of blow-by-blow combat—to give everyone their due. That becomes most clear during the movie’s centerpiece sequence, an extended bout of melee mayhem in an abandoned airport that’s like a microcosm of everything audiences love about the Avengers movies. As these once (and presumably future) team members tear into each other, forgetting to hold back as tempers flare and insults go off like fireworks, the film gets closer than any Marvel movie before it to actually capturing the playful, free-for-all spirit of its source material. It becomes, for these few blissful minutes, a true live-action comic book, and for once the strategy of endless interlocking spinoffs pays off: It’s like we’re seeing the fruit of the entire shared-universe labor, a set-piece built on not just the powers but also the personalities established across eight years of serialized storytelling. Civil War won’t turn skeptics into true believers; it refines rather than transcends its formula, and the ending, while admirably suffused for once with personal (rather than global) stakes, is too beholden to future franchise plans to go as far as it could and maybe should. But it does prove, if Marvel hasn’t already, that something can be both a load-bearing act of brand extension and a nimble, colorful blast of entertainment. Now just imagine if they could cook up a few more quality villains."
"May 3, 2016",POSITIVE,"Their respective motivations are convincing, and the 16-minute ""splash panel"" showdown at the Leipzeig airport is fun."
"May 3, 2016",POSITIVE," Para bien y para mal, Capitán América: Civil War (Captain America: Civil War, 2016) sorprende en más de un sentido; el balance presenta aristas positivas, pero también algunos asuntos cuestionables. La apuesta se sustenta en una inversión: el soldado –Capitán América o su sangrón apócope, “Cap”– se convierte en rebelde, y el rebelde –Iron Man– en soldado. De la credibilidad que uno le conceda a esto depende en buena medida la verosimilitud de la cinta. Capitán América: Civil War es la más reciente entrega de Anthony y Joe Russo (responsables de Capitán América: El soldado de invierno) y retoma el pretexto de partida del cómic homónimo. Nos lleva a un momento en el que las actividades de los súper héroes acumulan resultados negativos, particularmente muertes de inocentes. De ahí que la ONU proponga controlarlos y sujetar sus incursiones a un consejo. Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) está de acuerdo, pero el Capitán América se rehúsa a aceptar esta decisión. Esto provoca una escisión y la guerra civil mentada en el título. El enfrentamiento se da cuando el segundo protege a Bucky/Soldado de invierno (Sebastian Stan), su fugitivo amigo (¿o algo más?), y el primero es encargado de detenerlo. Con una vistosa puesta en cámara y un ritmo ágil, los hermanos Russo consiguen dar buen curso a su entrega. Con emplazamientos de cámara sugerentes, la acción se despliega con claridad y fluidez. Los pasajes de esta naturaleza son además dosificados con fortuna (a diferencia de las largas y a veces tediosas batallas que hoy prodiga este género). La estrategia se implementa en las diferentes ciudades en las que transcurre la historia, al estilo del 007. Y hasta aquí el tándem entrega buenas cuentas. Los Russo parten de un visitadísimo lugar común, la regulación de los súper héroes, que podemos ver lo mismo en la novela gráfica El regreso del caballero nocturno de Frank Miller que en la animación Los increíbles de Pixar. Como anticipaba líneas arriba, en Capitán América: Civil War “perpetran” un giro en los antecedentes que tenemos de la conducta de sus personajes principales: el soldado obediente y patriotero aquí se declara en rebeldía; el arrogante y rebelde inventor está de acuerdo en ser controlado. Ellos y los otros Avengers encaran culpas del pasado y eso condiciona sus lealtades. Todos creen que están haciendo lo correcto y, conforme avanza, la historia se inscribe en el terreno de la moral. Las decisiones de todos tienen un matiz ético, y aquí se abría un campo en verdad atendible. Pero como sucede a menudo con el cine norteamericano, no se exploran los dilemas que se presentan entre lo correcto y lo legal ni se lleva el asunto a las últimas consecuencias; tan sólo se alimenta el enfrentamiento entre Iron Man y el Capitán. Sólo un personaje tiene un gesto encomiable que va más allá de la venganza (ese gran surtidor del cine norteamericano), y no es ninguno de los principales. Más allá de la antipatía que me genera el Capitán América, una especie de emblema propagandístico del tío Sam, los giros que presentan los personajes no termino de creérmelos. El comportamiento del militar del escudo me parece, además, que lleva un mensaje político al mundo: llegado el caso, Estados Unidos no se somete al mandato de una autoridad internacional, como sucedió con el protocolo de Kioto sobre el cambio climático que empujó la ONU y el presidente norteamericano no firmó. El alcance de los temas propuestos se debilita, además, por lo que hoy parece una obligación para el cine de súper héroes: imprimir abundantes dosis de humor y llevar las cintas a un terreno que podría llamarse épica cómica (más que una batalla a menudo asistimos a una serie de chistes). Este afán, que habita numerosos pasajes de Capitán América: Civil War (el peor es el enfrentamiento directo entre las dos facciones de los Avengers, con un Spider-Man bufonesco), si bien suma en amenidad, resta en seriedad. Y no es que uno espere en una película como ésta las grandes revelaciones o la iluminación rigurosa de los grandes temas de la humanidad. Pero si se plantea un asunto que reviste cierta gravedad, al menos habría que ser congruente en el tono (¿o quién se toma en serio el enfrentamiento recién citado?). A estas alturas, cuando los súper héroes han probado que son habitados por cierta complejidad y pueden encarnar dramas profundos, sabe a poco quedarse en la superficie anecdótica o el chiste."
"May 3, 2016",POSITIVE," The new thing among big-screen superheroes is to air their differences by beating the snot out of each other while the public wrings its collective hands over how much collateral damage these fabulously dressed people cause while fighting supervillains, aliens and other assorted monsters. Now, we have the world holding The Avengers accountable for their destructive ways in “Captain America: Civil War.” The backlash causes a schism in the gang between those willing to let the United Nations control the superheroes (Team Iron Man) and those who believe that nobody should be in charge of The Avengers except The Avengers themselves (Team Captain America). Then again, if you want a superhero to open up a can of justice on bad guys intent on ending the world, understand they’re going to have to demolish some stuff in the process.  But the filmmakers don’t help by throwing so many superheroes in the mix, presumably because Marvel wants to give all of its marketable heroes as much face time as they can get. Sometimes here, it’s nearly impossible to know who is fighting whom.  The film opens with the Avengers, now led by Captain America after Iron Man takes some personal time, again wreaking havoc while chasing baddies. The world has had enough. Various leaders come up with a plan to put The Avengers under the oversight of the United Nations.  Captain America (Chris Evans, showing some real heart) is absolutely opposed, but doesn’t offer much resistance — until his old buddy Bucky (Sebastian Stan), also known as The Winter Soldier, returns to seemingly assassinate someone pushing hard for Avengers oversight. While the world chases down Bucky, Cap assembles some allies and tries to prove Bucky was framed. Here’s where the infighting begins, and the ridiculous meter begins to climb. Sometimes, you just have to go with it, even when 20-30 superheroes (way too many) are destroying an airport while throwing vehicles and one-liners at each other. New heroes are brought into The Avengers mix and confuse things even more, though I love the scene where the new Spider-Man (played by 19-year-old Tom Holland), tries keeping Iron Man alter-ego Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) away from his Aunt May (Marisa Tomei).  It’s also fun watching Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) receive just as much respect as you would expect from the other Avengers. But it also gets tedious after a awhile, as you try to keep track of all the costumed craziness and become numb to the violence (only one superhero gets seriously hurt, which is insane, considering what they’re doing to each other). The climactic scene, when a revelation is made about Tony Stark’s parents, sees Captain America and Iron Man really trying to kill each other, and it’s somewhat hard to watch, considering how brutal the former friends get with each other. "
"May 3, 2016",POSITIVE," Rollicking and action-packed, Captain America: Civil War (out May 6) is a comic book extravaganza that lives up to the hype. The characters are on point. The plot doesn’t require a doctorate degree. At 147 minutes, it manages to move (fairly) briskly. Smart humor is peppered throughout. All right, let’s just spell it out: This movie course-corrects nearly everything Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice got wrong.  Perhaps its most impressive accomplishment is that despite a cast full of Marvel favorites, Captain America isn’t just the title character in name only. Chris Evans’ decidedly square superhero, a former World War II soldier programmed by the government to be an indestructible figure, still feels like an outsider even as he dons the red, white and blue. He’s also seething that his ol’ Brooklyn buddy, James “Bucky” Barnes (Sebastian Stan), was brainwashed to be an assassin. The character carries that emotional baggage as the movie lands in Lagos, Nigeria — where he and his cohorts are on a mission to smoke out some guys up to no good. But one mercenary’s mere mention of Bucky sends the Captain into a bone-crunching rage. Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) uses her mystical hocus pocus to fly the villain into a building, and, well, this all ends very badly for many innocent civilians.  The secretary of state arrives at the Avengers headquarters with a proposal: From now on, the U.S. government will call the shots on the superheroes’ employment. In order to cut down on the global destruction, the various caped crusaders will no longer be free to roam the world to unleash their powers. Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) is on board with the plan because, as he puts it, “we need to be put in check.” Steely Natasha Romanov/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) sides with him. But Steve Rogers/Captain America is finished following orders and refuses to sign.  A moral disagreement explodes into a bitter feud. And after Bucky is punished for a crime he didn’t commit, Captain America goes rogue. Sure, he has trusty Falcon (Anthony Mackie) as a confidant, and Agent 13 (Emily VanCamp) returns to bat her eyes at him, but the Captain is essentially alone. Screw the rules and the hyper-verbal Tony Stark — the vet is determined to hunt down the man responsible for turning Bucky into an evil Winter Soldier.  Fans will also get a kick out of watching familiar faces emerge and pick a team. The retired Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) gets drawn back in and promptly joins Cap’s fight club. Falcon also reins in that pesky outlaw Ant-Man (Paul Rudd). Meanwhile, an intriguing new character named Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) unites with Iron Man because he believes Bucky is responsible for his father’s death.  Just don’t try to make sense of why, say, Scarlet Witch aligns with Captain America or why Black Widow scraps her alliance with the former soldier and stands by Iron Man. Snappy punchlines asides, many of the characters’ rationales are murky at best. For that matter, Iron Man working so closely with the government goes against his rakish, devil-may-care M.O. These inconsistent qualities may prove bothersome for comic book aficionados and fans of the franchise.  The result of all this infighting is a bone-crunching and satisfying war in which every superhero has a moment to shine. (Jokes one, “Everyone’s got a gimmick now!”) Indeed, it’s a remarkable feat that the movie rarely feels overstuffed with characters and plots. Even the chief villain, Daniel Bruhl’s Helmut Zero, is quietly thoughtful yet forceful. He could teach Jesse Eisenberg’s Lex Luthor a lesson in how to underplay.  You don’t have to take a side, though. There’s no right or wrong or even a lame cop-out ending in which everyone agrees to get along and sing an all-star version of “Kumbaya.” Just root for both teams and enjoy. "
"May 3, 2016",POSITIVE," Captain America: Civil War starts off with an incident suggesting the “new normal” for Cap and company. That new squadron of Avengers assembled at the end of Age of Ultron is stationed in Nigeria, where they’re forced to prevent a threat from stealing a biological weapon. As tends to be the case when the Avengers show up to prevent a disaster, another one breaks out in its place, ending in a crucial error by Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen). By the time Civil War reaches the 20-minute mark, it’s already established something that’s been clear to regular Marvel viewers for some time now: the coming of superheroes to this world has been a mixed blessing from the moment Tony Stark identified himself in public as Iron Man. Where there are heroes, there are bigger threats rising up to challenge them. Civil War feels like the film that Marvel has been building toward for a while now; despite Age of Ultron being the direct sequel to The Avengers, Civil War feels like more of a proper continuation of the stories and characters established in that corner of the franchise. Due in part to the city-lifting fiasco during Ultron’s big finale, the global community is understandably worried about whether the Avengers are doing more collateral harm than focused good. Tony (Robert Downey Jr.) is especially concerned, since the grander costs of superhuman war have been his burden for a while now. As established in Iron Man 3, Tony might have overcome the worst of his PTSD, but he still carries the moral weight of the world he had a significant hand in creating. Under pressure from world governments to institute some kind of control protocol, the Sokovia Accords are born, a peace agreement stating that the signed Avengers will agree to leave war to sovereign territories and will only report for battle if approved beforehand by the United Nations. Tony spearheads the effort, Vision (Paul Bettany) agrees that from a standpoint of objective risk it’s the right thing to do, and the Avengers are united in hopes of bringing an end to their periodic fits of catastrophic destruction. Captain America (Chris Evans) knows that the accords will only work up to a point, that the door Tony opened years ago cannot be closed, and that the evil the Avengers have unleashed will not stop simply because they’ve decided to do so. There’s also the issue of Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), the Winter Soldier. An early flashback is reprised throughout the film, harkening back to December 1991, when he was sent on a retrieval mission, one with lingering implications. Cap wants him protected and returned to his onetime self, Iron Man wants him somewhere he can’t hurt anybody ever again. Ergo, Civil War. Up to a greater point than your average modern-day superhero movie, Civil War has to serve many masters. It’s an adaptation of a beloved comic arc, a sequel to Captain America: The Winter Soldier and essentially Ultron as well, the beginning of Phase Three of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and crucially, the introduction to two new, essential characters. One is T’Challa, or Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), the Wakandan prince who’s dragged into the fray when the signing of the accords leads to him suffering a grievous loss. Even by the reluctant standards under which some Avengers joined the team, T’Challa wants no part of their inter-group squabbling. It’s an interesting performance given what Marvel has established, with Boseman delivering a turn of dignity and strength where so many Avengers deal in loose banter and varying degrees of attitude. The other is a teenager in a red jumpsuit. Peter Parker (Tom Holland) has finally made his way into a Marvel Studios production, and for the heaping doses of fan service that Civil War doles out, his Spider-Man might be the most immensely satisfying. Adaptations of the character, even the exceptional ones, have to date framed Parker as an old soul in a teen’s body, an uncertain teenager who doesn’t particularly seem like one. Holland’s read on the character, by contrast, is relentlessly giddy. He’s still a boy genius, but for what feels like the first time, Spider-Man comes off like a kid. You may have realized by this point in the review that there’s a lot going on in Civil War. And what’s perhaps most notable about the film is how well it manages to tie its many stories together. By firmly rooting all of the film’s sprawling drama in a singular conflict, directors Joe and Anthony Russo manage to do what many superhero films have struggled with in recent years: find a truly effective reason to pit superpower against superpower. Here’s it’s not only the ethics of the accords at stake, but the ethics of the personal as well. The key to the film’s mostly successful storytelling is that Cap and Iron Man are both right and both tragically wrong. There’s no chance that Steve will abandon his longtime friend, after all the violence and actual domestic treason he’s been through to save him. There’s no chance that Tony will let a walking powder keg go free; even if Steve is right about Bucky being somebody else’s pawn, the Winter Soldier is still a legitimate threat to every Avenger, and to the larger world. It then stands to reason that, inevitably, Avenger will fight Avenger. But to their endless credit, the Russos manage to take the film’s centerpiece action sequences in directions that feel fresh, even by the studio’s 13th release since 2008. The airport tarmac brawl that breaks out halfway in, when Steve and Bucky attempt to flee the country, might be the closest a Marvel film has come to date to feeling truly akin to a comic book. As an extravagant team battle breaks out, the Russos frame each individual scrap as its own spectacular splash page, in a way that’s been approximated in other Marvel films (those hero shots from the Avengers films come to mind), but rarely with such an earned sense of grandeur. A dozen films have given these characters value, and if there’s something to be said for the universe model of storytelling, it’s that it lends even the smaller fights some gravitas. There’s a simple joy in watching Spider-Man swing his way around Iron Man as Ant-Man crawls through Stark’s suit that speaks to what makes the best of these films worth watching, and the Russos capture it ably. Their visual approach still features some of the hallmarks of modern action’s less desirable instincts (shaky camera work, rapid cuts that distract from some of their more striking visuals), but the Captain America films have always been refreshingly straightforward. The Russos understand how to pace action better than many of their MCU contemporaries, and as such, Civil War moves at a rapid clip despite all the table-setting and it being the lengthiest Marvel film to date at 146 minutes. And wisely, Civil War takes a break from the climactic “put every dollar on the screen” property demolition of so many modern superhero movies (and action films, for that matter). A battle late in the film might be the most subdued in the Marvel canon to date, in a fashion. It’s punishing, and for all of its flash, it’s rooted in something painfully intimate as well. Civil War doesn’t break new narrative ground, necessarily, with its questions of domestic responsibility and the morality of inhuman power essentially breaking down to “who watches the watchmen?” and its schisms in the group having been explored in previous Marvel movies, The Avengers in particular. But what it does accomplish is a substantial feat for the long-form cinematic storytelling that Marvel invented and every other Hollywood studio is now attempting to approximate. Civil War is a story with no simple solutions to its conundrums, fit to scale. It’s grand blockbuster storytelling, even if the nature of the endless production cycle does and always will draw the ceiling for dramatic stakes into question. Civil War doesn’t fully work as its own singular, stand-alone film in the same way as the previous Captain America films, as it’s too invested in pushing forward even as it does a fine job of tying up a high number of the loose ends preceding it. It’s very much the middle chapter of an ongoing saga, but it’s a preeminent one as well. And for all the cacophony taking place onscreen, Civil War finds itself operating on a deeper intellectual level than the surface pleasures of watching a paragon of absolute American good triumph over evil. It’s a soon-to-be-massive summer movie about what happens when even good people make terrible mistakes, and the cost of those, and what good even means in a modern landscape marred by sectarian violence. It’s also a movie where Captain America and Iron Man wail on each other. Like the best escapist filmmaking, it offers a little bit of everything, just as long as finality isn’t high on your list of expectations."
"May 3, 2016",POSITIVE,"Naturally this is all cluttered and overstuffed to the point of bursting, and yet the convoluted feel and overfamiliarity of much of the plotting is compensated for by the Russo brothers knack for gargantuan action, some tough laughs and real acting."
"May 3, 2016",POSITIVE," Marvel movies, specifically the Avengers films, are a fact of life now—common as weather, expected as seasons. Now 12 movies in (it’s 12, right?), we have the equivalent of a full season of a network series of Avengers, over 24 hours of Iron Man, Captain America, Black Widow, etc. So whatever thrill of the new that was once used to lift these films up, giving them the airy buoyancy that became their hallmark, is gone now. By the time last year’s The Avengers: Age of Ultron (and that same summer’s Ant-Man) rolled around, the series’s smooth verve had become weighted down by a sense that the films had turned into cluttered corporate brand extensions, instead of legible stand-alone films. At some point the Avengers movies became shrewdly entertaining, instead of being genuine entertainment—they’re slick, functional native advertising. The latest Avengers film, Captain America: Civil War, packs the product placement into nearly every square inch of the film, featuring promos for, among other things, the Black Panther movie, the next Spider-Man movie, and another Ant-Man movie. I suppose you could, less cynically, look at all of this table-setting as merely a necessary part of crafting a long and unfolding saga told in chapters. But there is something awfully railroading, and even a little malevolent, about the way the Marvel movies force us to pay attention to their upcoming projects, like the free weekend in Florida is almost entirely time-share pitch and only a little beach. Those strings are very much visible in Anthony and Joe Russo’s film (they also directed Captain America: The Winter Soldier, the one everyone says is modeled after 1970s conspiracy thrillers, because that’s what it said in the marketing materials), a dutifully on-message cog in this extraordinary machine. But to be honest? The film is so fun, and so clever about how it stuffs in everything it’s required to, so droll and archly self-aware (but not obnoxiously—a fine line), that I was happy to be sold. Pitch me, Marvel! As long as the films are as adroitly, wittily staged as Civil War is, I’ll forgive Disney for already setting up ticket lines for the next movie outside screenings of this one. Beyond its deftly staged action sequences—the standouts being a long melee in Bucharest and an Avenger v. Avenger showdown at a German airport—what makes Civil War such a success is that it’s the first Marvel movie in some time, or maybe ever, to figure out how to weave all its threads together into one cohesive loop of yarn—the big bad villain and his big bad plan actually have something to do with advancing the story forward, and have meaningful connections to at least one previous film in the series. Civil War still has its diversions and its MacGuffins, but the film is upfront about those devices, and by the end, has pretty much justified all of its detours and embellishments, while marrying theme with obstacle in a way the series has failed to do before. The Russos had the onus of making two big introductions: Black Panther and a new teen Spider-Man. They handle both well. Black Panther’s story line is especially convincing, drawing the Wakandan prince T’Challa into the central story while also providing him with his own rich personal motivation in just a few scenes. He’s played by a strong Chadwick Boseman, and by the end of Civil War, a case has been more than effectively made for his own movie. Add him to the pile! Why not. There’s also the matter of young Peter Parker, here played by an entirely winning Tom Holland. His introduction is maybe the film at its most wry and self-deprecating: the movie is hip to the fact that this kid is being shoehorned in, after so many other damn Spider-Man movies no less, so it has some fun with the shamelessness of it all. There’s even a flirty joke about Marisa Tomei, who plays Aunt May, being the same age as Robert Downey Jr., who plays Iron Man. (Still doesn’t do much to fix that particular imbalance.) Befitting of its directors, who helmed over a dozen episodes of Community, Civil War has a curious relationship with its meta-ness—both ironic and sincere—that approaches the cerebral. The film is playful and swift, but it also twists itself into some interesting, self-reflective knots. The inevitable, unfortunate (for the other guy) comparison here is March’s tortured, torturous Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice. Like that chore of a film, Civil War is about beloved heroes battling each other over differing views of vigilantism. But unlike the D.C. universe’s saturnine slog through Metropolis (and Gotham), Civil War figures out how to be bracing and, yes, even thought-provoking without losing its grasp on the series's defining snappy, propulsive tone. As Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) and the Cap’n (Chris Evans, emerging as a fine actor as this series wears on) clash over some pretty important ideology—Tony wants the Avengers to subject themselves to the U.N.’s authority, Cappie does not—the film ponders superhero identity with just as much solemnity as it needs to, without ossifying the movie into a pretentious drudge. That’s no simple feat, especially considering the Russos were studio-mandated to keep a California Pizza Kitchen’s worth of plates spinning at once. I’m going light on plot here because, well, it’s hard to explain, but I’ll pretend it’s because I don’t want to spoil anything. Which I don’t! Because Captain America: Civil War is worth seeing. It’s the most lively, engaging Marvel movie since Guardians of the Galaxy, and among the very best of the whole Avengers series. With its cast of smooth pros—Anthony Mackie, Paul Rudd, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Bettany, and others all do their thing nicely, while Scarlett Johansson, as ever, threatens to walk off with the whole series if someone would just give her a shot—and the Russos’ confident blending of arresting action and sardonic (but, again, not obnoxious) humor, Civil War is perhaps indication that the Avengers can still entertain us in ways that seem more artful than advertorial. Here at the start of Marvel’s Phase III, which I’m told we’re now in, we know that every individual movie is but a trailer for the next one. But Civil War lets us forget that corporate reality for a blissful, giddy stretch, before it gives us a sly little wink, as if to say, “Thanks for shopping.”"
"May 3, 2016",POSITIVE," The last Captain America film, Winter Soldier, was simultaneously the most promising and frustrating entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It opened up rarely explored avenues of self-examination in superhero movies by calling into question the value of S.H.I.E.L.D. operating under a vague notion of “the greater good,” only to throw out any actual criticism by revealing the agency’s increasingly fascistic operations to be the result of Marvel’s approximation of Nazis. Captain America: Civil War operates similarly, confronting the immense collateral damage left by the Avengers across various missions, only to find ways to duck answering its own ethical questions. Civil War actually has a scene in which the Avengers are made to watch footage taken by normal, everyday civilians of their homes being turned into ash and rubble as a result of the Avengers’ battles in various cities. One of these skirmishes, from earlier in the film, takes place in Lagos, with Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) stopping a suicide bomber from killing Steve Rogers, a.k.a. Captain America (Chris Evans), by containing the blast, only to lose control and release the explosion among civilians. The sequence is, in the moment, exciting and filled with intricate choreography, but news reports of the event are sobering in their clear documentation of the damage caused. Marvel movies stress the efforts that heroes make to minimize casualties, but for once the characters must face the possibility that they do as much harm as good. The film doesn’t even trot out the usual strawman of an impotently jealous liberal politician to voice these concerns, instead placing them in the reasonable words of United Nations delegates and international leaders who understand that the Avengers wish to help, but simply require more oversight. This solid foundation gives way, however, when Civil War introduces, then immediately discredits, the possibility that Steve’s best friend, the brainwashed Winter Soldier Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), is responsible for an attack and assassination. As in Winter Soldier, the film quickly nullifies its conceit, pinning blame on the mysterious Helmut Zemo (Daniel Brühl). In the process, this revelation dismisses the darker implications of the Captain’s obdurate refusal to answer to others by justifying his destructive efforts to keep his friend from being captured. This quickly turns the narrative into a straightforward fight of positions between proud Captain America and his allies on one side and a guilt-ridden Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) on the other. The question of who’s right falls to the wayside in favor of a reductive selection of sides based solely on hero preference. But if the fight becomes the centerpiece instead of the philosophies that prompt it, Anthony and Joe Russo at least pack the film with a great many set pieces. The filmmakers aren’t particularly adept at shooting action in a classical, cogent manner, but they make a sincere effort to visually represent how each character’s conditioning and powers factor into combat. Brawlers like Captain America and Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) are filmed with frantic close-ups that approximate the intensity of their brute strength and reflexes, with the occasional boomeranging shot that follows Captain’s shield when it’s thrown at foes. Meanwhile, Iron Man gets slightly longer shot lengths and camera distance to account for his long-range weapons and strategic fighting. But perhaps the greatest beneficiary of the Russos’ method is the new Spider-Man (Tom Holland), whose inexperience and youthful enthusiasm for his powers is well suited to the directors’ antic but capable style. Nonetheless, the undeniable fun of the action scenes only exacerbates the failure of the narrative to adequately contend with its own themes. Though it lacks the stultifying somberness that weighs down Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Civil War in way ways shares ties with Zack Snyder’s film a willingness to decry collateral damage while causing even more; it also uses personal loss to motivate characters who apparently cannot care about destruction unless it happens to someone they know. Whether it’s Steve’s overriding loyalty to Bucky or the seen and unseen deaths that spur Black Panther and Spider-Man to don their masks, intimate tragedies compel the heroes in ways that the broader issues of their global impact never do. What starts as a provocative debate with major consequences rapidly devolves into an airing of grievances, yet this doesn’t personalize the film so much as negate its intended scale. That the third Captain America movie remains so generally entertaining is a testament to the idiot-proofing of the Marvel Studios formula, in which everything is rendered just well enough to tick every box in an audience member’s idea of a blockbuster worth their money. But it’s also the latest in a growing body of evidence that the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s need to evolve and deepen is held back by that same formula, and that if this universe is expanding, it’s nonetheless finite.

"May 3, 2016",NEGATIVE,The latest Captain America adventure us nothing more than a really long trailer for the new adventures of the new Spider-Man. [Full review in Spanish]
"May 3, 2016",POSITIVE,"While it lacks the sense of surprise of [the last film], its mix of action, humor, effects, the introduction of a new character and the reintroduction of an old one strikes just the right tone for a film that is as much about marketing as moviemaking."
"May 3, 2016",POSITIVE,"The summer movie season has barely begun, and already the remedy for superhero film fatigue has arrived."
"May 3, 2016",POSITIVE," In seeking to create an expansive multi-film universe, Marvel has managed to both bless and curse each of its subsequent films. The blessing comes in the form of a character development that takes place over the course of films and phases instead of scenes and acts. Characters who we met eight years ago have grown and changed before our eyes, and the history we share with them allows for newer films to take narrative shortcuts when it comes to filling in their backstory. Lines of dialogue and certain actions can carry the weight of nearly a decade of audience knowledge and understanding. This near-serialization is a powerful narrative tool for directors and writers who know how to use it. The curse, however, stems from this same root issue: with so much history to the story, it can be hard for dilettantes or less-invested filmgoers to grasp the greater depth of what is going on in any given film. Television shows can prime an audience’s memory with “previously on” sections that air before an episode. A film, however, does not usually have such a luxury. This makes each subsequent entry, steeped as it is in the foundation of those that came before, difficult to judge on its own. It is not hard to imagine that someone walking off the street and buying a ticket for Captain America: Civil War might feel overwhelmed by characters with strange and wonderful powers that are never truly explained, allusions to past actions devoid of context, and relationships that are intimated but never explored. All the same, comic books are steeped in tales of people doing the impossible, and so it makes sense that a comic book movie would likewise be able to achieve what at first seemed an impossible goal. Thanks to strong performances, deft writing, and clear, snappy direction and editing, this newest volume of the Marvel Cinematic Universe manages to be at once a thoroughly-entertaining standalone story while also serving and benefiting from stories that came before. Directors Joe and Anthony Russo (who previously helmed Captain America: The Winter Soldier, still the series’ strongest film) have managed an impossible feat far surpassing those of their cinematic heroes. Following a cold-open dripping with enigmatic post-Cold War portent, we are thrust into an action scene that showcases the Russo Brothers’ penchant for complex, kinetic set pieces comprising many locations, characters, and objectives. As with all of Civil War‘s set pieces, the action is filmed with a kind of trembling immediacy that never devolves into the rapidly edited anarchy of something like Paul Greengrass’s excellent-yet-inscrutable Bourne films. The geography and rhythm of each fight prove clear and traceable, allowing for a sense of engagement and understanding even as super-powered beings toss one another across plazas and runways. Its explosive conclusion also sets into motion the story to come. Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), known professionally as Captain America, has been leading a new set of Avengers on dangerous missions across the globe, but when Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) makes a crowded office building the scene of some unfortunate collateral damage, the world begins calling for oversight. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), who set off the superhero trend when he became Iron Man, has been shaken enough by the events of his past three films to accept and even help to form a set of doctrines known as the Sokovia Accords (named after a city destroyed in the last Avengers film). The Accords would put the Avengers under the United Nations’ thumb, adding a layer of political bureaucracy to their missions that Captain America finds unacceptable. Stark, who allowed his ego to guide him against such oversight so long ago, can no longer bear the guilt that comes with being the world’s self-ordained protector. Rogers, being a solider before a superhero, feels more at ease taking on the moral burden of his actions — so long as he doesn’t feel that the ability to help when help is needed becomes impeded. This ideological divide is sharply illustrated and articulately (though shallowly) discussed. This being a comic book movie, what could have become a rather compelling battle of thoughts and ideas very quickly becomes a battle of fists and bullets. It is a bit of a shame that debate and discourse must be subsumed by sound and fury, because both Downey Jr. and Evans bring a lot of earnestness and passion to their characters’ opposing viewpoints. That said: if action must come, then at least it comes in the form provided by the Russos. Each set piece is a well-crafted exercise in novelty and visceral impact, and each is lit and shot for maximum clarity. From a super-powered foot chase on a city street that sees the participants running just as fast as the cars that occupy the road to a melee at a German airport that mixes inventive, powers-based hijinks with down-and-dirty brawling, each scene herein is designed to outdo the one that came before. There is always something new on display, be it a brand-new ability, a dynamic setting, or a heightened sense of emotional stakes. This attention to detail — and the sheer number of characters on display — helps to keep the ball rolling toward a surprisingly intimate and personal climax. The divide between Rogers and Stark becomes more intractable once it appears Steve’s old friend, Bucky (Sebastian Stan), who had been turned into a brainwasher super-weapon, is responsible for an act of terror that kills the king of the African nation of Wakanda. This death sets up T’Challa (Chadwick Boseman, a born star) to take the mantle of king and seek revenge under the guise of the Black Panther. His personal vendetta adds yet another layer of immediacy to the story while also lending another ideological standpoint to the mix. Stark seeks lethal justice, Steve seeks to redeem his fallen friend, and T’Challa wants blood retribution. It is these four characters — Rogers, Bucky, Stark, and T’Challa — that form Civil War‘s competing hearts and minds, and there is not a weak link among them. With this much plot and this many characters to shuffle — I haven’t even mentioned Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Vision (Paul Bettany), Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Spider-Man (Tom Holland), Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), War Machine (Don Cheadle), or Sharon Carter (Emily VanCamp) — it comes as no small shock that the Russos and their screenwriters (Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely) are able to keep the balls in the air. While the movie overstays its welcome by a beat or two, on the whole it is a brisk, engaged story from start to finish. There is enough immediate plot to keep the story moving and enough callbacks to make the time spent in the other films feel valuable without being wholly necessary. While no one could be advised to see it without having seen a single other Marvel film, these storytellers do a stellar job making sure that, should anyone be in that unenviable position, they will not be wholly lost. By this point in their evolution, it would be understandable if Marvel’s films began feeling repetitive or lazy. It would also be understandable, if not unavoidable, that their mythology might be so convoluted that entry into them would prove intimidating to non-fans. With their previous installment, Avengers: Age of Ultron, it seemed as though that might very well have become the case. To see Captain America: Civil War is to be reminded that the things we might expect are not necessarily unavoidable. What one might assume to be a brainless, bloated light show of impenetrable nonsense can actually be a taut, sinewy piece of film-making with enough brains to keep you engaged and enough brawn to keep you in awe. Its hard to know where the Marvel films will go from here, but, for now, they seem to be operating in top form."
"May 3, 2016",POSITIVE,"The third ""Captain America"" film entertains relentlessly, which is to say loudly and busily, but with enough humor and intelligence to make it seem less pandering than it actually is."
"May 3, 2016",POSITIVE,"  Captain America: Civil War is the first superhero film to skillfully depict the consequences of collateral damage. We got a hackneyed attempt to address this issue in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. Where that utterly failed, Civil War succeeds in a dark and thoughtful way. It tears the Avengers apart, turning the most stalwart allies into bitter enemies. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo have crafted a mind-blowing action film with a deep, personal connection. It is not flawless, suffering from the bloat of cramming in multiple storylines. It seems each of these films has to set-up a dozen others down the road. I wish they had scaled back a bit here, because they could have had a comic masterpiece. This review is spoiler free except for one declaration, which will have fan boys beaming from ear to ear. Spider-Man has NEVER been this good on film. Tom Holland, you're about to be a mega-star.   Captain America: Civil War opens with the Avengers tracking an old enemy in Lagos, Nigeria. They apprehend him, but at a tremendous cost of innocent lives. The world has had enough of their heroics. Thaddeus 'Thunderbolt' Ross (William Hurt), now Secretary of State, presents the team an ultimatum - The Sokovia Accords. Named after the tiny country that was destroyed in their battle against Ultron. It would give the United Nations control over the Avengers. Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) is totally against it. He knows that politicians should never have the reins of such a powerful group. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) not only disagrees, he has helped to orchestrate the agreement. Recent events, and reflection on his losses, have uncharacteristically made the rebel a conformist.   While the Avengers debate the issues, a sinister deed from the past has resurfaced. The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) has become the pawn of a mysterious enemy - Helmut Zemo (Daniel Brühl). Like a puppet master, he is pulling the strings towards a secret agenda. Steve believes that the Soldier, his dearest 'Bucky'; is being manipulated. Stark does not, as well as several other members of the team. The situation gets even more complicated with the emergence of a new hero, the Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman). He's sworn vengeance against the Soldier. As the Avengers splinter into factions, new allies are chosen, but all are completely oblivious to the real endgame.   The character development in this film is superb. We've reached a point in the Marvel Cinematic Universe where all of the Avengers are well known. Their personalities, failures, and strengths have been thoroughly explored. We understand what makes them tick. Tony Stark and Steve Rogers have been on a head to head collision from day one. They both have an incredible aptitude for good, but are unshakeable in their faith once choices are made. This is the true clash of titans. Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans are excellent here. They own these characters. It is both exhilarating and heartbreaking to see them as adversaries.   The supporting characters in Civil War steal a whole lot of thunder. The climactic battle against each other is worth every freaking penny. I daresay this is the most entertaining fight scene in any Marvel film so far. The newest Avengers bring their A-game to take on the big dogs of the team. Two in particular are so awesome and unexpected; they lift the showdown into the stratosphere. The Russo Brothers did a helluva job staging these scenes. I fully expect them to blow our minds even further with the Avengers sequels.   The bone that I have to pick is the bane of the genre. There's way too much going on here. Captain America is the star, but by a hair. Civil War could easily have been the third Avengers film. While I loved all of the characters, it's a pile on. The overarching story is so interesting and provocative; it's a shame to get lost in the buffet. Yes, these are made for profit, not to satisfy the nerds. But there has to be a point of saturation in a film. It kills me because Civil War hangs on the cusp of greatness. The good obliterates the bad, but it doesn't erase it entirely. Note to Disney and Marvel, you have us already enthralled, it's okay to pull back.   My final thought is all about Spidey. Tom Holland is a joyous discovery. I didn't have a clue who this actor was, but the Marvel team has struck gold. They have finally cast the perfect Spiderman. I'll be setting up my tent now to be the first in line to see his standalone film.  Julian Roman has been with Movieweb for twenty years. An avid film buff, he watches nearly 200 films a year across every genre. He feels lucky to have interviewed and written extensively about Hollywood's greatest talents. In his spare time he plays guitar, treasures good company, and always seeks new adventures."
"May 3, 2016",POSITIVE,The Marvel blockbuster machine keeps on trucking with a double-sized new issue of Captain America that packs enough punch to distract from its grinding plot mechanics.

"May 3, 2016",POSITIVE," The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is so lumbering and massive and unwieldy that it really is sort of a miracle that any of the movies work at all. And yet most of them do. (The best: The original Avengers. The worst: Iron Man 2.) This has been for two primary reasons. The first is that the franchise’s template was laid down by two terrific four-quadrant filmmakers, Joss Whedon and Jon Favreau, men blessed with the seemingly impossible ability to package escapist, familiar entertainment as something distinctive, even original, while still pleasing their corporate masters. Their sensibilities are a through line—filtered, distilled, but undeniably present—from one movie to the next, connecting disparate characters and filmmakers with radically different sensibilities. (The only thing Kenneth Branagh and James Gunn have in common is that they both breathe air, but they fit snugly together in the MCU.) The second reason for the films’ success is that the corporation in charge has a deep, emotional connection to all the characters because, well, it created them. This is not some dude in a suit and loafers in a Culver City studio coming up with a comic book movie because that’s what the kids are into these days; the people who make this stuff take it as seriously, if not more seriously, than the people they’re making it for. They’re always going to do right by these characters, because it means doing right by themselves. The inherent danger, of course, is that those who love these characters and this universe will never know how much is too much—which brings us to Captain America: Civil War, a film that is entertaining and well-paced and meticulously constructed, and still made me wish I had an index with me so I could remind myself what was going on and who, exactly, all these people were. I have no horse in this comic book world: I just want an entertaining movie that uses the basic tools of filmmaking to guide me through what’s happening. When done well, you have The Avengers, which was a joyous exploration of just how much giddy fun you could have with these iconic characters, Whedon playing with his figurines in the backyard and inviting you along. When done poorly, as in that other superhero vs. superhero epic of 2016, casual observers are left on the outside looking in, wondering why everyone is so angry with one another and why it’s all so goddamned loud. Civil War—which, for all intents and purposes, is Avengers 3—is definitely on the upper tilt of that comic book curve, with a clear storyline and understandable character motivations, and action scenes that always have a little more thought put into them than might have been absolutely necessary. And yet you’ll still end up with your head spinning by the end of the movie. Captain America: Civil War has a lot of plates in the air.  This is a film with so many characters that Don Cheadle is essentially the seventeenth credited actor, but it all starts with Captain America (Chris Evans) and Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), the anchors of the MCU. In the wake of all the destruction caused by the first two Avengers movies, the United Nations asks the Avengers to sign a document saying they will not act without global approval; Iron Man wants to sign it, and Cap doesn’t. There are a million subplots, but that’s the basic conflict, as gaggles of superheroes (minus The Hulk and Thor, who are conveniently out of town like your Canadian high school girlfriend) line up on one side or another, leading to an inevitable and legitimately awesome set piece in which all the heroes fight each other in an airplane hangar. It’s the geek-pleasing “weeeeeee!!!!!” sequence that’s a blast start to finish, even if you don’t know or care that much about any of the ancillary characters, if only because the filmmakers’ enthusiasm is so infectious. You pay your money to see Ant-Man and Black Panther do battle, and the movie serves it to you in style. Civil War gives you what you want it to, another staple of the MCU: This is capitalist filmmaking, but they’re populist capitalists. They send you home happy. Directors Joe and Anthony Russo, who made the last Captain America movie and will be helming the upcoming Infinity War movies, are extremely organized filmmakers, and with a movie this crowded, they have to be. They juggle everything well, from building up to that big fight scene, to keeping Captain America and Iron Man on opposite sides, to providing viable human villains in a world constantly being invaded by all-powerful aliens to, most impressive, introducing more characters who will end up with their own standalone movies. The two big new faces here are Black Panther, played by a typically terrific Chadwick Boseman, and Spider-Man, saved from Sony’s chronic mishandling of what was once the biggest superhero franchise of them all and portrayed by 19-year-old Tom Holland as the dorky, motor-mouthed teenager he was probably meant to be all along. They’re both strong additions, but you’ll still find yourself a bit exhausted by their presence: There is enough overstuffed story going on without them, let alone Ant-Man and Black Widow and Hawkeye and Vision and War Machine and all the rest.  Civil War can’t stand up to the two Avengers movies or even the last Captain America movie: There’s too much going on, too much world building, to have the Avengers’ sense of loopy discovery or the tight focus of the last Captain movie. The movie is nearly three hours long and still feels truncated, like a ton of stuff was cut out. (Editing these movies must be a nightmare.) It doesn’t help that the Winter Soldier himself, who is a major driving force of the plot in this film (even more than in the film that bore his name), is a bit of a dull pickle; Captain America and Iron Man are essentially fighting over him, which makes it a bit of a problem that he’s barely in the top 20 of interesting super-powered beings in this movie. Marvel generally has trouble with villains too, and it’s difficult to be invested here in a human bad guy when we’ve been fighting off monster lizard aliens and robots bent on destroying the planet for the last few movies now.  Civil War is both a Captain America sequel and a third Avengers movie, and that’s more than any movie could possibly pull off. Still: There are smart people in charge of these movies, people who care about the characters and want to do right by the audience. That’s not nothing. After requiring about a month after seeing Batman v. Superman for my brain to stop rattling around my head and the fillings in my teeth to stop bleeding—for me to have faith in the human condition again—I’d say that’s quite a bit indeed."
"May 2, 2016",POSITIVE," When it comes to superhero culture, can there be too much of a good thing? That's the conundrum facing the purveyors of the shared-universe paradigm: early adopter Marvel and Johnny-come-lately DC. Marvel Studios' unprecedented plan, in cahoots with Disney—and generally enthusiastic reception from fans and critics alike—reaches a new zenith with Captain America: Civil War. It's possible that, with this film, palpably more satisfying than the heavily hyped Avengers films that preceded it, Marvel has stepped up to a symbolic line not so different from the one drawn in front of Cap and his allies in Civil War...this far and no further. After all, here we have a superhero movie that gathers no fewer than fifteen heroes and villains in roles that amount to considerably more than cameos. They populate a sprawling story with marching orders to serve as a direct sequel to Captain America: The Winter Soldier (and resolving the can of worms that film opened concerning Cap's sidekick-turned-""Manchurian Candidate"" super-soldier ""Bucky"" Barnes), a crazy-cool superhero team-up/smackdown movie to make Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice look like a tea party, and a franchise-launching introduction to the new Spider-Man (teenage Tom Holland). Seemingly, it's everything a comic-book junkie would expect from a single Marvel movie, and more, for the price of a single ticket. I mean, it took Twilight, The Hunger Games and Divergent two movies each to tell their culminative stories, and they were all dull as dishwater. Now, for around nine bucks, you get a James Bondian film-opening action sequence times four (heroes), a centerpiece six-on-six clash of the superheroic titans, and a twist-y this-time-its-personal fight climax, along with enough quips to get you double-checking the credits for a Joss Whedon assist (nope: all screenwriting credit goes to Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely). This is what one calls ""an incredibly high degree of difficulty,"" and the writers join directors Anthony and Joe Russo in sticking the landing. Non-comic-book-geeks may struggle to keep up with the storyline, and the frantic-ness of the action (especially in 3D) may prompt some to lapse into diabetic comas, but those people will be the one-percenters of this movie's guaranteed-to-be-massive global audience. I haven't forgotten to tell you what the film is about, although does it matter? As in Batman v Superman, questions of collateral damage (as Avengers ""routinely ignore sovereign borders"") plague our heroes, prompting U.S. Secretary of State Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (William Hurt) to show up at Avengers HQ and intone, ""The world owes the Avengers an unparalleled debt."" Yeah, there's a ""but"" coming: the United Nations has drafted a superhero-control act dubbed the Sokovia Accords, set to be ratified by 117 countries, and Ross would like the Avengers to sign it, thank you very much.And there's the sticking point of this Civil War: Steve ""Captain America"" Rogers (Chris Evans) doesn't trust nations to set agendas when the stakes remain so high, while Tony ""Iron Man"" Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) feels it's time to eat a little crow, pay a little penance, and earn back some trust. Heroes old and new line up with Team Cap (Sebastian Stan's Bucky, Anthony Mackie's the Falcon, Elizabeth Olsen's Scarlet Witch, Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye, and Paul Rudd's Ant-Man) or Team Iron Man (Spidey, Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, Boseman Chadwick's badass moralist Black Panther, Don Cheadle's War Machine, and Paul Bettany's the Vision). It's just the discord mysterious baddie Helmut Zemo (Daniel Brühl) wants, ""to see an empire fall."" And it's just what a modern movie audience craves: prime action-adventure fare. Markus and McFeely serve the extraordinary number of characters with their impressive construct, and the movie pays forward, many times over, the team-up thrills initiated by The Avengers and nudged along by its sequel and Batman v Superman. This is a Captain America movie that builds to the Tom Joad-esque promise ""If you need me, I'll be there"" while pausing to allow Iron Man to groom Spidey and put him to the test. It matters not to my not-so-inner child that Civil War has new players but few genuinely new themes or tricks. Says he: yes, please. But enjoy the bargain-value ticket price now: Marvel's hatching plans for its own two-part extravaganza (Avengers: Infinity War—Part 1 and 2) to prove there's no such thing as too much or too far, especially when it comes to box office. Disney sends Captain America: Civil War home in a Blu-ray 3D + Blu-ray + Digital HD special edition with reference-quality A/V and a battery of pleasing bonus features. The 3D image is plenty spectacular. Even in the dark prologue, the transfer immediately produces a sense of depth, as when an arm extends toward a keypad deeper in the frame. In quiet moments, the 3D comes in the form of a ViewMaster-style effect of characters and objects placed on differing planes of depth, such as when prison bars or mesh separate captives and their freedom. Supertitles, readouts, falling snow, and reflective surfaces lend themselves to 3D plus-ing, as of course does the high-flying vertiginous action. Freefalling bodies excitingly define depth, and the 3D version uses popout effects sparingly enough to give them good impact, as is the case with flying debris and shattered glass coming at the viewer, Cap reflexively swinging his shield back through the frame and seemingly into the viewer's space, and Iron Man's projectiles in the climactic fight. Naturally, the biggest 3D excitement comes in the seventeen-minute IMAX sequence, for which the aspect ratio expands to fill the screen at 1:85:1: particularly the clashes of Spidey and Cap, and Spidey vs. Bucky and the Falcon. The only complaint is that the 3D image feels at times a touch dimmer than perhaps it should (I only noticed crosstalk being a minor issue for the subtitles for the deaf or hard-of-hearing: the picture itself never was troubled by crosstalk on my display). The 2D transfer is likewise terrific and a nice option for those times when 3D might be a bit much for the brain or eyeballs. Tightly defined and thus sharply detailed, the colorful image never struggles to keep up with the kinetic action. Contrast is well-calibrated and deep blacks anchor an image with perfect contrast. This transfer, too, opens up from its usual 2.39:1 aspect ration to 1.85:1 for the best-in-show 17-minute IMAX sequence (this was the first movie to film with the IMAX/Arri 2D camera). Though the theatrical exhibition could be enjoyed in Atmos, the home-video presentation is in DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1. Never fear: this is a blisteringly powerful action mix also capable of subtlety and clarity in dialogue, the thunderous music, and effects. Placement is top notch, and immersion is such that, for the first time in my home theater, I actually jumped in my seat—due to a well-placed door clang in the right rear speaker. The Blu-ray disc auto-plays three Sneak Peeks also available from the main menu: a Dr. Strange teaser trailer (2:03, HD); an Audi behind-the-scenes promo/advertisement (2:10, HD) directors Joe and Anthony Russo, stunt coordinator Sam Hargrave, co-producer Mitchell Bell, Sebastian Stan, stunt coordinator Andy Gill, Chris Evans; and an ad for the game Marvel: Contest of Champions (:32, HD). A feature-length audio commentary with Anthony & Joe Russo and Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely finds the fantastic four discussing the project from early development to completion, most intriguingly touching on abandoned script ideas. ""United We Stand, Divided We Fall—The Making of Captain America: Civil War, Part 1"" (22:25, HD) gathers directors Joe and Anthony Russo, producer Kevin Feige, Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Marvel Studios co-president Louis D'Esposito, writers Stephen McFeely & Christopher Markus, Anthony Mackie, executive producer Nate Moore, fight coordinator James Young, Stan, visual effects supervisor Dan DeLeeuw, Hargrave, Frank Grillo, Elizabeth Olsen, Jeremy Renner, prop master Russell Bobbitt, Paul Rudd, Scarlett Johansson, William Hurt, Don Cheadle, and head of visual development Ryan Meinerding to begin discussing the production, stunts, concept, story, themes, and characters, especially in the sides they take. ""United We Stand, Divided We Fall—The Making of Captain America: Civil War, Part 2"" (23:18, HD) completes the discussionby adding Paul Bettany, executive producer Victoria Alonso, Chadwick Boseman, Tom Holland, and Daniel Brühl. A wealth of production B-roll footage, as well as film clips, gives us exciting access to the set. ""Captain America: The Road to Civil War"" (4:11, HD) and ""Iron Man: The Road to Civil War"" (4:27, HD) use clips and talking heads to recap and comment on each character's journey to and through Civil War; they're promos, but surprisingly meaty despite the compact run times. ""Open Your Mind: Marvel's Doctor Strange—Exclusive Sneak Peek"" (4:02, HD) unveils new footage and interview clips of Feige, Benedict Cumberbatch, director Scott Derrickson, executive producer Stephen Broussard, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Tilda Swinton, Benedict Wong, and Mads Mikkelsen.

"May 2, 2016",POSITIVE," Este año será recordado por muchas cosas pero para los fanáticos de las historietas será recordado como el año en que dio inicio formalmente la batalla entre los universos de cinematográficos de Marvel y DC, los cuales lanzaron toda la carne al asador en este año con el estreno de Batman v Superman y Captain America: Civil War. Esta última, Captain America: Civil  War, es de la que hablaremos el día de hoy, cinta dirigida por los hermanos Russo, quienes después de hacer un excelente trabajo con Captain America: Winter Soldier, han tomado las riendas de esta cinta y de las futuras Infinity War. Esta película levantó demasiadas expectativas, ya que no solo cuenta con el regreso de Chris Evans como el justiciero americano, sino que cuenta con la participación de la mayoría de los Avengers, con excepción de Hulk y Thor, quienes se ha confirmado harán dúo en Thor Ragnarok, la tercera cinta en solitario del Dios del trueno. Captain America: Civil War se desarrolla algunos meses después de la batalla en Sokovia y durante otro operativo intentando atrapar a un vendedor de armas llamado Cross Bones, causaran graves daños colaterales por lo que quedan en el ojo de las naciones, quienes los consideran peligrosos, es esta razón la que orillara a las naciones unidas a solicitar un registro de super héroes, al cual el Captain America se opone, al contrario de Iron Man, quién se unirá al gobierno para obligar a registrarse a los “vigilantes” o de lo contrario encarcelarlos. Mientras todo esto sucede, un misterioso personaje aparece con sed de venganza en contra de todos los Avengers por lo que hará uso de un inestable Winter Soldier para lograr su cometido. Los Hermanos Russo, Joe y Anthony, demuestran tener un excelente dominio del tema de los super héroes, con una trama política envolvente que a algunos les parecerá aburrida pero, sienta bien las bases de un conflicto que esta por estallar en cualquier momento, el problema es precisamente ese, el conflicto nunca estalla totalmente, además de incluirle un villano misterioso que se mueve en las sombras, solo nos regala minutos extras que no aportan mucho a la trama y de hecho la vuelven incongruente. La trama esta basada en el famoso arco argumental de Marvel Comics, Civil War, que enfrenta al Captain America y Iron Man, por las mismas razones, aunque no con las mismas consecuencias, lo cual es lamentable. Sobre todo el hecho de que los principales e increíbles aciertos de la historieta fueron hechos a un lado por los guionistas, dándole a los fanáticos hueso colorado, más corajes que satisfacciones. Una de las promesas más grandes que tenia Captain America: Civil War, era la aparición de nuevos personajes como lo son Black Panther y Spiderman. Muchos teníamos nuestras dudas sobre como serían incluidos o si sus apariciones estarían muy forzadas como sucede en Batman V Superman con el resto de la Justice League. Afortunadamente, tanto Black Panther y Spiderman se les da su merecido espacio dentro de la pantalla logrando que no se sientan de relleno, incluso el peso del personaje de Black Panther es mas grande y presenta de manera decorosa a un personaje cuya película en solitario ya estamos esperando. Las secuencias de acción son buenas, pero nada más, por momento la secuencia donde podemos ver la batalla entre todos los Avengers entre ellos, se siente como película de Michael Bay, sucede tanto en pantalla que no sabes a donde mirar, lo cual puede llegar a incomodar. Captain America: Civil War es una película entretenida, agradable a la vista y con desarrollo estable, excepto los último 15 minutos, en los cuales se empeñaron por echar abajo todo el trabajo hecho, que si bien no era sobresaliente, era suficientemente bueno para asegurar el éxito de la película, pero en las últimas secuencias develan al mal diseñado villano, quien nunca resulto un verdadero peligro para los Avengers y le dan un final de cuento de hadas que terminara por decepcionar a todos."
"May 2, 2016",POSITIVE,The audience will truly b satisfied for a very specific reason: this is truly a battle between heroes. [Full review in Spanish]
"May 2, 2016",POSITIVE," En Titus, la épica shakesperiana dirigida por Julie Taymor en 1999, un niño de unos diez años juega con sus soldaditos en la mesa del comedor. La batalla es épica, la sangre (de catsup) corre, los ejércitos de juguete se enfrentan sin piedad. De improviso, gracias a una elipsis (artificiosa pero efectiva), el mismo infante se encuentra ahora en el Coliseo, los ejércitos que antes eran de plástico se tornan en humanos reales mientras que el niño -asombrado- se vuelve mudo testigo de una batalla legendaria. Aquel inicio en Titus bien podría ser el inicio del más reciente tanque diseñado para arrasar la taquilla llamado Civil War. La película -y lo digo como halago- es un elaborado juego de niños donde pareciera que algún infante es la mano que mueve todas las decisiones argumentales persiguiendo un único objetivo: el que (casi) todos los superhéroes del universo cinemático de Marvel se confronten -para deleite del respetable- en una batalla campal de varias pistas, harto CGI pero (y he ahí la clave del éxito) también con mucho, mucho humor. La película se puede dividir en tres. En el primer tercio (el menos logrado y de hecho bastante aburrido) se plantea el conflicto: los Avengers son señalados por el gobierno a partir de sus recientes batallas (en Avengers 1 y 2) donde la destrucción masiva ha tenido trágicas y considerables bajas “colaterales” (eufemismo para decir que su indolencia ha matado civiles). Un hecho a todas luces imperdonable, cuantimás para un superhéroe. Así, el gobierno plantea un acuerdo donde las acciones de estos superhumanos estén bajo la dirección estricta de las Naciones Unidas. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr., ya en automático) y su sentimiento de culpa apoyan el acuerdo mientras que el Capi América (Chris Evans, que no deja el gimnasio desde 2012) se opone al gobierno y su iniciativa (¿quién lo diría? yo siempre pensé que el Capi era de derecha) al interpretarla como una coerción a sus libertades básicas. El conflicto está en la mesa y aunque siempre queda la sensación de que podrían hablarlo un poco más y ahorrarse los trancazos, ello resultaría menos espectacular por lo que ambos bandos se enfrentarán irremediablemente. Sin la espectacularidad y la amplitud del combate en Manhattan de la primera Avengers (2012), los hermanos Russo deciden hacerse la vida fácil: sacrifican el manejo de los espacios (ya sea por torpeza o decisión asumida) para hacer de la gran pelea un circo de varias pistas, en un aeropuerto convenientemente vacío, con pocas tomas amplias que muestren la amplitud del conflicto y que -cual niños en parque de diversiones- ambos bandos tiran tantos golpes como chistes y one-liners (muchos de ellos a cargo de Spider-Man) , al grado que incluso se toman su tiempo para hacer un homenaje (francamente logrado y hasta con retro chiste millenial) a “esa película vieja” llamada Empire Strikes Back (1980). Rumbo al último tercio, uno pensaría que ya todo está acabado, pero es justo cuando los motivos del “villano”, el Barón Zemo (Daniel Brühl, probablemente el único actor en el set), se revelan. Y esto no es menor. Acaso esta sea la primera vez que un supervillano (al menos en el universo Marvel) sea simplemente un tipo con un plan. No hay superpoderes, no hay trajes de spandex, no hay risas macabras: simple y llana venganza. Resulta imposible no comparar esta cinta con Batman v Superman (Snyder, 2016). Ambas películas en el fondo son lo mismo, manejan los mismos temas y los mismos traumas: la responsabilidad de los superhéroes con la sociedad y el trauma por la pérdida (siempre trágica) de los padres. Pero Marvel (muy en su estilo) sabe alejarse de la solemnidad e inyecta humor. Eso hace toda la diferencia. El conflicto, aunque pueril, está aquí mucho mejor estructurado. Cuando en el tercer acto Rogers y Stark se enfrentan, la pelea es mucho más intensa, mejor justificada y con más ímpetu y ritmo que aquella en el bando de DC. Curiosamente ambas se empatan visualmente y ambas tienen en su cénit el reclamo por los padres muertos. Pero superar al incapacitado no debiera ser mérito. El mérito si acaso es que, a pesar de estar superpoblada, los hermanos Russo saben administrar bien los muchos personajes que aparecen en pantalla (una nómina abultadísima que incluye desde Scarlett Johansson hasta Jeremy Renner pasando Paul Rudd y un pobre Paul Betanny que se la pasa de sweater y con la cara pintada de rojo… lo que hay que hacer para comer), tener buen ritmo, privilegiar el humor y mantener las cosas simples. Todo ello en un guión bastante flojo (la necesidad de tantos letreros explicando dónde y cuándo estamos es señal inequívoca de problemas estructurales...o de cierta flojera argumental) que no descubre el hilo negro ni revela inspiraciones profundas (los directores declararon que la cinta estaría influenciada por El Padrino y Se7en… no veo de dónde). Y es que por más que la crítica norteamericana quiera poner esto al nivel de Spider-Man 2 (una de las mejores cintas de superhéroes en la historia del género) o tildarla simplemente de “la mejor película de superhéroes jamás hecha”, lo cierto es que esta pieza adolece de lo mismo que casi todas las películas de esta nueva ola de superhéroes: cierta seriedad impostada (aunque en este caso muy bien resuelta) y una falta absoluta de consecuencia. Uno esperaría que esta supuesta “guerra” tuviera bajas, pero la cultura nerd está peleada con la muerte. Los niños juegan con soldaditos en el parque y la sangre es de catsup; cuando mamá llame a cenar todo terminará en risas y un apretón de manos. Esto, más que una película, es un juego de niños: muy bien elaborado, muy bien resuelto e irremediablemente divertido. El cine puede ser también un patio de juegos y, en ese tenor, Civil War es el mejor juguete con el que podrán jugar este verano."
"May 2, 2016",POSITIVE,"A film that doesn't really know what kind of movie it wants to be, and in the end is only entertaining action. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"May 2, 2016",POSITIVE," Menos es mÃ¡s. Ese parece ser el lema utilizado por los hermanos Joe y Anthony Russo, directores de âCapitÃ¡n AmÃ©rica: Civil Warâ, al hacer su pelÃ­cula. En su caso, âmÃ¡sâ se refiere a un montÃ³n de superhÃ©roes ya conocidos, a los que se les aÃ±aden dos nuevos, con quienes tenÃ­an la misiÃ³n de hacer una historia que no se saliera de control y que aparte fuera divertida y emocionante. âMenosâ, vendrÃ­a a ser la estructura de esta historia. Mantener las cosas sencillas, tener un objetivo claro y asÃ­ es mÃ¡s fÃ¡cil balancear tonos. PodrÃ­a seguir analizando esto a profundidad, pero soy sincero: la mayor parte de la pelÃ­cula me la pasÃ© sintiÃ©ndome como un niÃ±o de nuevo, que veÃ­a a sus figuras de acciÃ³n cobrar vida en la pantalla. La nueva entrega del Universo CinematogrÃ¡fico de Marvel nos cuenta cÃ³mo los famosos hÃ©roes ya no pueden con las consecuencias de sus actos. Es decir, sus batallas en grandes ciudades han matado a miles de inocentes y es momento de hacer algo al respecto. AsÃ­ se crean los Acuerdos de Sokovia, con los que el gobierno pretende regular la actividad de seres con habilidades especiales y asÃ­ evitar daÃ±os a terceros. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) estÃ¡ a favor, Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), en contra. Y cada hÃ©roe asume uno de los dos bandos, convirtiÃ©ndose los unos en criminales y los otros en la autoridad oficial.  La trama es asÃ­ de simple, pero tiene muchas mÃ¡s complicaciones e implicaciones. Y tambiÃ©n, por otro lado, es sÃºper divertida y tiene una acciÃ³n increÃ­ble. Como los hermanos Russo hicieron al mando de la entrega anterior del CapitÃ¡n AmÃ©rica, âThe Winter Soldierâ (2014), aquÃ­ vemos una mezcla tanto de acciÃ³n cuerpo a cuerpo, como de grandes efectos por computadora. Ambos elementos manejados con maestrÃ­a, con cuidado e inteligencia. Hacer acciÃ³n requiere de mucho ingenio y en eso se sacan un 10 estos directores. Cada momento de balazos, golpes, patadas, rayos y hasta telaraÃ±as y poderes telequinÃ©ticos, es mejor que el anterior. No es nada sencillo hacer esto, sobre todo considerando que no se trata de una pelÃ­cula donde todos los hÃ©roes peleen contra una gran amenaza que quiere acabar con el mundo. Porque la acciÃ³n no es nada sin una buena historia y, como ya lo dije, aquÃ­ la sencillez es clave. QuÃ© gran diferencia en comparaciÃ³n con la destrucciÃ³n masiva de las dos cintas de âThe Avengersâ, donde la batalla final, repleta de caos y un montÃ³n de minions genÃ©ricos que salÃ­an como hormigas de todos los rincones, llegaba a volverse monÃ³tona. AquÃ­ las peleas son cuerpo a cuerpo, sabemos bien dÃ³nde estÃ¡ cada quiÃ©n y por quÃ© pelea contra quien pelea. Porque la lucha de esta historia es entre hÃ©roes y nada mÃ¡s. Ese es el conflicto y ese es el corazÃ³n de la trama, que hace que toda la acciÃ³n tenga sentido e importe. Los Acuerdos de Sokovia son asunto serio y, de nuevo haciendo referencia a la grandiosa âThe Winter Soldierâ, los hermanos Russo han demostrado que no le temen a jugar con los tonos de Marvel, a llevar las cosas un paso mÃ¡s allÃ¡ y alterar toda la trama como la conocemos. El drama de la historia estÃ¡ bien manejado, hasta el punto de que todo se llega a tornar muy oscuro. Pero con todo y ese tono de thriller-polÃ­tico-drama, la diversiÃ³n no se deja de lado. PodrÃ¡ parecer fuera de lugar, pero el humor funciona por su cuenta. Estas pelÃ­culas son para pasar un buen rato en el cine y âCivil Warâ es garantÃ­a. El guion es cuidadoso y cuando llegan los momentos cÃ³micos, la mayor parte condensados en una escena de acciÃ³n en particular, no podemos mÃ¡s que aceptarlos. Sobre todo por lo bien realizada que estÃ¡ la escena, siendo el equivalente de un niÃ±o que juega con sus figuras de acciÃ³n. Pero no me refiero al caos, sino a la inocencia y magia que transmiten. Esa emociÃ³n de ver a tus hÃ©roes cobrar vida en todo su esplendor, de mostrar todas sus habilidades en un momento que se siente relajado, suelto y entretenido. Como cuando terminabas de hacer la tarea y tu mamÃ¡ te daba permiso de salir al patio a jugar.  Digna de aplauso tambiÃ©n es la presentaciÃ³n de los dos nuevos hÃ©roes: Black Panther y Spider-man. Es la primera vez que Marvel presenta dos personajes grandes sin una cinta previa en solitario y les sale de maravilla. Panther (Chadwick Boseman) es genial, aunque no entendemos bien cÃ³mo funcionan sus poderes, entendemos al personaje y sus escenas de acciÃ³n simplemente son increÃ­bles. El esperado nuevo Peter Parker (Tom Holland) es diversiÃ³n total, una personalidad que sirve casi de âcomic reliefâ, pero que tampoco pierde sus grandes momentos para billar en acciÃ³n. Aunque el primero tiene mÃ¡s importancia en la trama, ambos tienen suficiente atenciÃ³n para satisfacer nuestro deseo de entretenimiento. Ninguno decepciona. Y esa es otra gran clave de esta pelÃ­cula. Que todos los hÃ©roes tengan sus momentos. Aunque algunos tienen mÃ¡s importancia que otros, todos consiguen sobresalir. Algunos quizÃ¡ se puedan ver como simples cameos, pero no cabe duda que son cameos increÃ­bles. Creo que la cinta le da el peso y la importancia que cada uno merece, haciendo incluso un mejor trabajo que âThe Avengersâ (2012), cuyos aciertos tambiÃ©n son similares. Pero todo esto funciona porque la historia funciona. Porque el conflicto de los hÃ©roes, las motivaciones de cada uno y el hecho de que las consecuencias de sus actos no son del todo heroicas, se trata con mucho cuidado y seriedad, a pesar de ser una sÃºper producciÃ³n que no necesita nada para vender boletos. Entre los adultos que quieren ser niÃ±os y los niÃ±os que quieren pasar un buen rato, esta pelÃ­cula tiene mucho que ofrecer para todos, sin sentirse inconsistente. El drama aquÃ­ es personal para casi todos los personajes y es por eso que nos emociona, por eso que nos sentimos atraÃ­dos por todo lo que sucede, y por eso cuando se estÃ¡n dando unos buenos golpes, sentimos la importancia en cada puÃ±o. Una gran cinta como Ã©sta tiene el claro objetivo de entretener y hasta complacer a los fanÃ¡ticos, pero todo eso importa poco si no se cuenta una buena historia, con, mÃ¡s que encapuchados, seres humanos (o no tan humanos) que nos importan. AsÃ­ se hace el entretenimiento de calidad."
"May 2, 2016",POSITIVE,"Civil War is just a little short from being one of the third best Marvel movies ever, but it's deffinately good. [Full review in Spanish]"
"May 2, 2016",POSITIVE," In their ongoing pursuit to thwart all wrong-doings around the world, the Avengers continue to fight together to beat the bad guys. However, the public's trust in them is beginning to wane thanks to the devastating damage and fatalities they leave behind in their wake after each and every battle. Unfortunately, their doubter's worries are amplified when a mission against an enemy from Cap's past results in the death of several innocent Nigerian civilians, causing the UN to intervene in their crime-fighting and enforce some controlling regulation laws. Plagued by the guilt of destroying Sokovia in Avengers: Age Of Ultron, bankroller Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) backs the accords along with James Rhodes (Don Cheadle), Vision (Paul Bettany) and a surprisingly receptive Natasha Romanoff AKA Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). On the other hand however, leader Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) questions whether they'll still be able to keep people safe abiding by such restrictions and refuses to sign the treaty, as does his loyal comrade Falcon (Anthony Mackie). Their differences of opinion prove problematic to the government, who threaten that they either go along with their rules or retire. The ultimatum soon turns Rogers and his team into wanted 'dangerous criminals' after a menacing German agent, with vengeance on his mind, throws a spanner in the works in the form of Bucky Barnes AKA the Winter Soldier and forces the star-spangled hero to take heroism into his own hands. Well... that is how it's done, DC. While Captain America: Civil War is a completely separate entity to Warner Bros' Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice which came out in March, given how closely the two were released and how similar, in a sense they are, in plot, comparisons can't help but be made. Unfortunately for the latter, Marvel's attempt at pitting, not just two but several, heroes against one another is superior in so many ways. Just like the other Captain America instalments that have come before it, Civil War can also lay claim to the statement that it features some of the best choreography work we've seen in the franchise. Executing the high-speed combat scenes with military precision, each one is more thrilling than the next, leading up to an emotion-filled showdown towards the end of the film that will leave you not even sure who you're really rooting for any more.  It's no secret that thanks to Cap's occasional goody two-shoes nature, the character fares better with fellow Avengers to bounce of off – a theory that was proven in 2014's The Winter Soldier instalment. Here, he has a plethora of other skilled-ones to banter and spar with, creating both hilarious and even heart-wrenching scenes. While Marvel has always owned humour in their movies, its the soul of this film that really stands it above its predecessors. Throughout, it's evidenced that they know how important it is to fill these popcorn entertainment blockbusters with real heart as well as action-packed fight sequences and what successfully keeps Civil War as a Captain America instalment rather than Avengers 3 is the focus on Rogers' awkward but always touching friendship with enemy-turned-ally Barnes. Both out of time, it's clear the pair will always share a bond but with Barnes now a brain-washed ticking time-bomb of a killing machine, they both realise they can't remain side-by-side forever and it's truly sad. Similarly, Rogers' friendship with Stark comes into play frequently too. Yes there is a villain, but there's no over-the-top big bad here, it's not needed. Not when the real shock comes from seeing the Avengers broken from within. On top of all of the existing characters and story that they had to allow time for in the movie's 147 minute running time, the fact that newbies Spider-Man and Black Panther get such effective introductions into the MCU is quite simply remarkable, and makes audience members desperate to see their upcoming standalone movies mere minutes after leaving the cinema. But as much as their impact is down to screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely for allowing them to shine, it's actors Tom Holland and Chadwick Boseman who really deserve the praise. Almost polar-opposite, and perhaps why it was so genius to keep them both in the movie, Boseman's T'Challa is grave and noble, shouldering the burdening responsibilities of a fallen King and feeling more forced into a necessary rough-and-tumbles rather than playing a long for kicks. Holland's Peter Parker on the other hand is eager to run alongside the big dogs, despite the danger and his relatively rookie status. Enthused at the opportunity to impress Iron Man during the film's biggest [here's looking at you Ant-Man] scene, he manages to hold his own fight-wise but both his youth and inexperience show. ""I don't know if you've been in a fight before, but there's not usually this much talking"" berates one of his opponents, honing in on the fact that his quippy Queen's wise-cracks are what we love most about the spunky character. Things are certainly not all about the fresh faces in the pack however, as the film is just as dedicated to developing familiar characters arcs too, touching upon subjects as diverse as Scarlet Witch struggling to keep hold of her humanity with her developing powers, Vision's confusion as to his meaning on Earth and Stark's crippling need to protect both the world and his relationship with Pepper Potts. They even make ample time for a splash of romance and the obligatory, if not mildly annoying, up-close shot of Johansson's derriere – just how do they do it? Marvel, our hats are well and truly off. "
"May 2, 2016",POSITIVE," Books and movies have a different language. Usually, comics are lot closer to the linguistics of film. They’re both dialogue driven and rely on irreverence to get the job done. But with Captain America: Civil War, the plot is thicker than usual. The movie is nothing like the comic book. Definitely not in terms of story intricacies. It deviates from the details of the Marvel comic world but the big play is the same, team Captain America versus team Iron Man. Superheroes fighting superheroes. Kind of like gladiators in a colosseum. And like the legendary Roman entertainment bouts, there’s a strong undercurrent of politics here. And it’s all relevant enough to modern times for you to sit up and take notice. It’s that rare superhero movie that’s intelligent and complex. It may not be the best movie ever made, but it is a far cry from the usual cacophony of CGI-inspired stunts that make superhero movies nowadays. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo, who previously did Cap’s Winter Soldier movie continue their fine form with Civil War. Some of the direction on offer, especially the first action sequence with Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow and co. stampeding through a busy African market is stellar. Combined with IMAX 3D this particular action set shows you how technology can enhance the experience of watching a film. Even the consequent sequences, like the superhero royal rumble on the air strip and the concluding brawl between Captain, Iron Man and Bucky Barnes are all engaging and like a dream for action aficionados. There are no large explosions and disregard for human life and property, just intense combat and a steady sense of drama and conflict. If you can abstain from Sherlock Holmes tendencies to critique the script, Civil War has all the trappings to sway your experience and make you feel like you’ve watched the best superhero movie of your life. Without handing out spoilers, the best thing about this film is the repartee between Tony Stark and Peter Parker. There’s a particular scene of bro-code between Captain, Falcon and Bucky that involves a kiss and a nod and it’s absolutely brilliant. Spider Man and Ant Man are a rage in the superheroes versus superheroes battle. The new big guy on the block, Black Panther (played by Chadwick Boseman) is a definite value-add to the Marvel movie universe. Civil War has a lot of momentum going for it. It’s a seriously impressive film with the right amount of irreverence. But if you are a stickler for logic and Civil War comics, you might feel a little underwhelmed.

"May 2, 2016",POSITIVE," Captain America: Civil War sees every comic book fan's dreams become a reality as the Avengers fracture and go head-to-head in an epic battle to end all epic battles. Given the rate of superhero movies in recent years, 'cape fatigue' is a real concern with audiences as overblown, CGI-heavy fight scenes become utterly unimpressive and run-of-the-mill. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo have cleverly decided to turn the genre on its head with Civil War, where our favourite superheroes divide down the middle over differences of opinion on how they should be regulated. The Avengers land themselves in hot water after a calamitous mission in Lagos which sees innocent bystanders die at the hands of Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen). Grappling with the backlash from an angry public, who have deemed them no-holds-barred 'vigilantes', a United Nations summit is convened at which it's decided that the Avengers need to hand over their autonomy and sign a treaty. But some of the team just can't bear the thought of being regulated. They're headed up by Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans), who sees inherent problems in having a government body deciding their missions. Grappling with guilt and regret is Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), who takes the surprising decision to support the Avengers being regulated. Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Vision (Paul Bettany), Col. James Rhodes/War Machine (Don Cheadle) and newcomer T'Challa/Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) are also in his corner. Adding even more excitement to the mix are two late additions to the teams - Paul Rudd as wise-cracking Ant-Man and Tom Holland, who makes an extremely promising and charming debut as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. To make matters worse for the clashing superheroes, and to complicate the plot further, Daniel Brühl is introduced into the mix as German agent Helmut Zemo. He has his own sinister motivations, and looks determined to exploit the dangerous potential with the Winter Soldier. The sheer number of characters may seem overwhelming, but the tale of the warring camps is skilfully and effortlessly told, as the superheroes' loyalties are tested to the max. Crucially, cheesy one-liners have been phased out in favour of genuinely funny, laugh-out-loud moments, which are dotted about for some much-needed comic relief. The best of all is Tony Stark recruiting a wet-behind-the-ears Peter Parker, who exclaims worriedly ""I've got homework!"" when Stark invites Spider-Man into the Avengers fold. Despite the two-and-a-half-hour running time, Captain America: Civil War manages to keep entertainment levels high throughout, doing the mammoth task of juggling an impressive line-up of new and returning characters, without feeling bloated or confusing. It also nicely sets up a handful of new Marvel outings, including the Black Panther and Spider-Man solo movies. © RTÉ 2024.

"May 2, 2016",POSITIVE," Sledgehammers are omnipresent in Jean-Marc Vallee's latest tale of self-help redemption by way of a trite metaphor. In 2014's Wild, the Canadian director shot Reese Witherspoon as a wayward woman finding herself out in 'the wild'. No prizes then for guessing what gets Jake Gyllenhaal's character back on his feet after his wife's death in Demolition. But while some of these sledgehammers are tangible, most are figurative ones wielded by Vallee to push the film's ""rip it up and start again"" symbolism. The point is laboured, to say the least. Davis (Gyllenhaal) is a dead-on-the-inside Manhattan executive whose young wife dies in a tragic road accident. He seems unable to mourn, which doesn't help his already problematic relationship with father-in-law and boss Phil (Chris Cooper). He writes all this (and anything else his troubled mind excretes) in letters to a troubled customer-service worker called Karen (Naomi Watts). Soon, he has moved in with her and is bonding with her troubled teenage son, Chris (Judah Lewis). You may have noticed that many of Demolition's white middle-class suburbanites are ""troubled"". Davis and Karen in particular subsist on the kind of navel-gazing, free-associating waffle that New Yorkers love to relay to overpaid therapists. Put simply, hardly a single line sounds like anything uttered by real people in real life, and this makes them difficult to fully relate to. Of course, this isn't real life. This is that America where people in million-dollar glass boxes without financial cares are entitled to totally extricate themselves from society if the happiness boat is rocked. Vallee's 2013 Oscar-winner Dallas Buyers Club hit a note because redemption came at a cost in that film. Here, it's couriered straight to the door along with some pretty cinematography. Risteard O'Domhnaill does things so the rest of us don't have to. Or that is sometimes what it feels like as he lays out the effects of capitalism and corruption in a world in which many of us are too daft, scared or worn out to notice.  His previous award-winning documentary The Pipe examined the Shell to Sea campaign and his latest documentary makes similarly vital, if somewhat depressing, viewing. Atlantic focuses on three fishing communities - in Ireland, Norway and Newfoundland - each affected by different large interests. When Ireland joined the then EEC in 1973 we handed over control of fish stocks, and each year the member countries are allocated a fishing quota. This means that small Irish fishing operations look on as supertrawlers from other jurisdictions swallow vast quantities of fish from the Irish sea, killing off the indigenous industry and wreaking havoc on North Atlantic fish stocks. It was sweeping measures to counteract a threat to cod stocks that put the fishermen of Newfoundland out of business in the 1990s. They then reinvented themselves for the oil business, but now that is under threat too. In turn, it is oil exploration that threatens the closely protected Arctic fishing industry in Norway. The documentary reveals a cycle of short-sighted measures based on short-term gain that wreak long-term destruction both on the small communities immediately affected and the entire eco-system of the North Atlantic. I confess that the prospect of yet more super heroes duelling it out did not fill me with joy - I have a limited capacity for super folk and this year's supply is all but used up. However, this serving of conflicted mega peeps, almost all of the Marvel characters now familiar on the big screen, proved an enjoyable, if overly long, episode in a series that still has a long way to run. Following the destruction wrought in Avengers: Age of Ultron, the UN and the US Secretary of Summat (William Hurt) want the Avengers to either submit to official control or cease and desist all world-saving ops. The issue for the authorities is whether they are heroes or vigilantes, but the issue for Avengers is the quality of the power they will be subject to. Fuelled by guilt and the need to get back in with his girlfriend, Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr) leads a cohort, including War Machine (Don Cheadle) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson, pictured below), who are keen to agree to regulation. On the other hand, Captain America (Chris Evans), aware that their first task will be to kill the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) - his childhood friend turned ruthless killer - is more conflicted. With him are Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Falcon (Anthony Mackie). The remaining heroes, and a few extra recruits, pick sides and civil war ensues. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo, working from a screenplay by Christopher Marcus and Stephen McFeely, keep a firm hold of what, with so many characters and so many stars, could have gone badly wrong. They deliver a strong story about friendship and principle that hits the right notes without getting po-faced and has a very different tone to Batman V. Superman, the film that it will inevitably be compared to. There's a light touch, and it is often funny. There are many series in-jokes - the scene where Iron Man recruits Spider-Man (Tom Holland) is a classic example. And the action scenes are outstanding. It is a further measure of the utter insanity of the Nazi regime that when it became obvious that it was losing the war, rather than focus on military efforts it stepped up the extermination rates in the concentration camps. This put pressure on one aspect of the death camps rarely focused upon, the actual system of mass murder. The system required that some inmates, known as Sonderkommando, be chosen to process the ones who were to be killed. These Sonderkommando were kept alive long enough - but not too long - to be able to do all of the work involved in murdering thousands of people each week. In this extraordinary film, Hungarian director Laszlo Nemes, working from a script he co-wrote with Clara Royer, tells a story set over two days in Auschwitz from the point of view of Hungarian Sonderkommando Saul Auslander (Geza Röhrig). The entire film is shot via close-up of Saul, who, at the beginning of the story, sets himself a mission to find a rabbi. This mission overrides almost all other concerns, including at times the escape plans of his co-Sonderkommando. The camera angle is wearing in places but effective in that it expresses the focus the men must have needed in order to do the work demanded of them. They each had a task handling the ""pieces"", as the SS referred to the bodies, and in the background, out of focus but still present, tasks such as extracting gold teeth from the corpses continued. But life of sorts always goes on, the valuables stolen from the murdered were not always handed over and became currency for other inmates, for food, sex or favours. But Saul's mission to find a rabbi is his personal fight against dehumanisation."

"May 2, 2016",POSITIVE," I won’t go as far as to say Captain America: Civil War sets a new bar in Superhero films, but its pretty darn good. When I first walked out of the screening a few weeks ago, I was on a giddy high, thinking it was probably one of the best films of the year, but now that I’ve had a few weeks away from it, the hyperbole is a bit toned down. Of course I have a tendency to forgive a film’s obvious flaws the first few hours after an initial viewing. First thing you need to know is, really this isn’t a real Captain America film. It’s a straight up Avengers film. Which is great because last year’s Avengers film was a mess. This movie is just as much about the characters as it is about the action sequences. It can almost be used as a study on how to properly make big tent pole action films. All the action in it, there’s a LOT, is done in service of the story. While the first half of the film feels incredibly jumpy as it moves at a breakneck pace from one location to another it all comes together nicely towards the middle of the 2nd act. One big gripe is the growing, tired idea of the bad guys always having video cameras in places they shouldn’t or just conveniently having access to said surveillance. It’s become the modern day Deus Ex Machina. They did it in Batman Vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice so much that it got irritating. Here the plot device is used once in the 3rd act and you can’t help but shake your head at the plot twist and marvel at the idea that there was a camera out in the middle of the woods. As someone who read the original Civil War event, it was a little hard watching this big screen adaptation because it’s very loosely based on that book. There are some nods to it, but they are shallow. What makes this film work so well is that both sides aren’t inherently wrong and I love that the events of all the previous Avengers and Captain America films had an impact on the real world impact. You can sympathize with the regular people on the ground who are directly impacted by the city wide destruction and collateral damage that is caused when Superheros do battle. It’s one of the aspects of Batman vs. Superman that I loved and love it here as well. I hope it doesn’t become an overused “gimmick” in future Superhero films. At some point we just want to go along for the ride and not think about all the property destruction and people who would die if these conflicts happened in the real world. Especially the standard shot of idiot New Yorkers who don’t have enough sense to run away. I did think the idea of having Alfre Woodard play a grieving mother who blames Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) and the Avengers for the death of her son, both affecting and hokey at the same time. She is the catalyst for Stark hard on for forcing all heroes to submit to an international oversight committee. Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) of course disagrees, saying the last thing heroes need to be is essentially an armed force for the Govt. The two find themselves at odds on this issue. At the same time Rogers is on a personal mission to try and save his long time friend Bucky ( Sebastian Stan ) who gets blamed for blowing up a Nato conference and killing Black Panther’s (Chadwick Boseman) father. I’m not going to waste your time with a laundry list of all the characters in this film except to talk about the two newest additions Spider-Man and Black Panther. As someone who read the book, I sort of gave the hope that Spider-Man would even be part of this, so the fact we got him here was one of the films true wow moments. Unfortunately I think the trailers ruined the surprise. He’s not a player here and his appearance amounts to glorified Fan service – not that there’s anything wrong with that. I thought they made him way too powerful in this brief appearance. He was taking people out left and right. Which, as an old school Spider-Man fan I know he’s fully capable of. The point of including him in this is to let fans know that yep, Tom Holland‘s Spider-man is going to be awesome when his own film comes out. What I said about Spider-Man applies to Black Panther as well but he has more scenes in the film. While he’s on Stark’s side, I don’t remember him having a discussion about why – other than he wants Bucky dead for killing his father. Boseman brings a quiet dignity and class, benefiting of a King to the character. He is the perfect embodiment of the character from the pages and everything fans would hope for. The movie does a nice job of introducing Black Panther without getting bogged down in a tedious origin story. It’s here he is, he’s pissed, let’s go. Usually I roll my eyes at Superhero conflicts because most of them are caused by simple misunderstandings that would never happen if they just spent 2 minutes talking before throwing punches. Not to mention you know after five minutes they will hug it all out and go after the real villain. See Batman v. Superman for an example of this. Captain America: Civil Works precisely because there was a debate and there’s no bridging the divide that formed. This movie doesn’t have a traditional “villain” and there’s no simple “let’s work together bro” moment in the movie, well there is, but that moment lasts literally 4 minutes. There is someone who, it turns out, is manipulating events behind the scenes, but the big reveal felt anti-climatic and dumb. I’m not going to go on my soap box about the Marvel verse butchering yet another major villain, but come on. His appearance and reasoning at the end felt like forced way to call a momentary truce. Ultimately once the genie is out of the bottle, there’s no easy way to put it back in. This Civil War is going to be around for awhile now, the split feels real and that should lead to some interesting consequences in future installments of the Marvel U."

There’s some good stuff in “Captain America: Civil War.” That’s what these Marvel things are now: a lot of stuff. Some of the stuff is enjoyable, some of it’s rousing; some of it’s thumb-twiddling, some of it causes migraines. Almost all of it, good or bad or indifferent, is now there simply to keep the perpetual Marvel Cinematic Universe machine moving. The franchise is now Too Big to Fail. There are too many moving parts, too many sequels and spin-offs to set up, to create something like the relatively stripped-down pleasures of the first “Iron Man.” At best they’re an out-of-control monster its many makers can barely control; at worst they’re arrogant, assuming viewers will always show up in droves, no matter how listless or chaotic the entries.
RELATED: Interview: Jeremy Irons worries about Trump and an upcoming revolution

But like we said, the third “Captain America” has some good stuff, if not as much good stuff as outliers like “Guardians of the Galaxy” and “Ant-Man.” Where the second “Avengers” was a Michael Bay-style mess of crap comin’ at ya, “Civil War” has a fairly clean emotional undertow. Where both “Avengers” recklessly destroyed cities for our enjoyment, this one — just like the loathed “Batman v Superman,” as it were — focuses on the aftermath and the hundreds, maybe thousands of civilian deaths. There are, once again, too many characters, but they don’t clog the screen at the same time all the time. The story mostly zeroes in on Cap/Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) and Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), who not so politely disagree on a key point: that the do-gooder Avengers need to be regulated, lest they destroy yet another village in order to save it.

But “Civil War” also has some bad stuff, or at least some stuff that falls short of the franchise’s increasingly unwieldy ambitions. It’s more somber than any Marvel entry, but also more of a drag. Even this comparatively pared-down story is too immense for streamlining, meaning endless expository scenes setting up countless threads that may be addressed here or, likely, a future entry. Every now and then there’s a fight.

Even this comparatively pared-down story is too immense for streamlining, meaning endless expository scenes setting up countless threads that may be addressed here or, likely, a future entry. Every now and then there’s a fight. It’s not very involving storytelling, and it’s not helped that even the debate that drives the film — and ushers in the civil war that will split the team into two outsized factions — is barely addressed. Rogers simply doesn’t think the Avengers should have governmental oversight, and that’s that. Some team members agree with him, more out of loyalty than the eloquence of his arguments, which he never quite makes. Stark, meanwhile, has good reasons: He’s haunted by the high civilian body count of previous romps. He’s also the character the screenplay comes closest to portraying as a bad guy — apart, that is, from the actual bad guy, who, amusingly, is just some guy played by Daniel Bruhl, out to quietly manipulate the goodies into fighting each other. It’s not cynical to decipher all this as a mere excuse to get to the film’s centerpiece: a mass Avengers vs. Avengers smackdown on an airport tarmac. It’s almost worth it, too: Returning “Captain America: The Winter Soldier” directors Joe and Anthony Russo have no sense of scale, but they delight in fun pair-ups, pitting dueling abilities for kicky superhero-on-superhero action. Paul Rudd’s Ant-Man shows up for no reason than to be another body on the field, which is good enough. Ditto newbies like Chadwick Boseman’s serious Black Panther and our new Spider-Man (Tom Holland), who turns out to be delightfully gee-whiz, endearingly over-eager to play with the big boys (and two girls). Holland is charming enough to make us long for the second Spidey reboot — but there we go again. Now 13 titles in to the MCU, we’ve been trained not to look at what’s in front of us but what’s coming next. They’re perfect films for the current pop culture landscape, in which the articles with the biggest hits tend to be about news of films that will be made, not about the films themselves once they’re cobbled together. Not to sound like someone who’s listened to too much Rage Against the Machine, but these movies reflect and perpetuate a dispiriting trend in the entertainment world, turning nerds into corporate tools who angrily defend the brand against anyone who would defy it. “Civil War” could have been the one to turn the ship around. Sometimes it almost does. The big brawl is essentially comedic — until, of course, it’s not. The climax isn’t another clangy spectacle in which a metropolis is giddily leveled. It’s intimate, even borderline scary. But this won’t be the “dark” one. This is no “Game of Thrones” because Marvel isn’t about ruthlessness. Indeed, by the end we’re back on course for the nine other MCU films en route in the next three years alone. Ultimately even the stuff that thrilled us or emotionally engaged us or maybe even provoked deeper thought turns out to be just that: stuff."
"May 2, 2016",POSITIVE," Walking into Captain America: Civil War, the 13th Marvel film to be released since 2008, I felt like I knew exactly what I was in for. Like with a good majority of Marvel's past films, I assumed this was going to be another two-and-a-half hours of excellent action and CGI imagery peppered with some witty dialogue, wrapped around a serviceable plot with an uninspired villain. Unsurprisingly, Civil War managed to hit a lot of those same notes. That's not to say it isn't enjoyable (and so very, very cool), and it's still undoubtedly better than a certain recent hero-on-hero film from a rival comic company, namely Batman v Superman. Picking up some time after the events of Age Of Ultron, Civil War kicks off with Captain America (Chris Evans) leading a detachment of Avengers into the fictional African country of Wakanda in a mission to stop the theft of a biological weapon. But the Avengers end up getting blamed for an explosion that kills a bunch of innocent people, causing the world to question the idea of letting a group of super-powered individuals with no allegiance or overseeing authority run amok across the planet. This leads to the establishment of the Sokovia Accords, an international initiative meant to bring the Avengers organisation under the UN's wing, acting under their authority. This drives a wedge between Captain America and Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), with the former against the bill and the latter for it. Things come to a head when the Captain goes rogue to find his fugitive friend Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), aka the Winter Soldier, and the other Avengers must choose which side of the line they stand on. As with all Marvel movies since the first Iron Man, Captain America: Civil War is very much like riding a roller-coaster: there's the slow build to the inevitable conflict, then it's all just a thrilling, heart-pounding blur before pulling back into the station. From the very beginning to the end, Civil War is just one spectacular action scene after another. Marvel has really managed to outdo itself with the choreography in its action scenes, a commendable feat considering how already action-packed its previous entries were. One thing I noticed pretty quickly is how visceral all the fight scenes look now. It's still a PG-13 Marvel movie of course, but every kick, punch or vibranium-shield in the face looks so much more weighty and real. You really can't help feeling sorry for whoever is on the receiving end of any hero's attack. It's probably not a surprise that Civil War features a lot of heroes. While I was initially worried that the film would stumble on its own need to shed light on all of its considerable roster, the directors (Anthony and Joe Russo) and writers managed to give everyone enough screen time to develop their motivations for taking part in the conflict between Cap and Iron Man. Every character was given their own moment to shine, though that's not to say that some don't shine brighter than others. Of particular note is Paul Bettany's Vision, who manages to receive some much welcome characterisation following his brief origin story in Age Of Ultron. While much of his character's humour stems from the clichéd ""robot-learning-to-be-human"" premise (like not understanding the need for a door), Bettany's portrayal of the android is consistently charming, both in humorous and serious moments. But the real stars of the show come in the form of the two new additions to Marvel's superhero ensemble: Black Panther and -- wait for it -- Spider-Man. Prince T'Challa of Wakanda -- otherwise known as the Black Panther -- manages to bring a whole new level of cool to a universe already chock-full of it. Portrayed by Chadwick Boseman, the character's central role in the story means that we get to see a lot of him in action, and yet the character never quite managed to break out of the mostly one-dimensional motivation. I look forward to learning more about this character in his own film, set for release in 2018. Now, I can't even begin to describe how happy I am to see Spider-Man's long-overdue appearance in Marvel's cinematic universe. Even better, this incarnation of Spider-Man is undoubtedly the best so far, even though his only part in the film is the titular clash at the airport. With just the right amount of wit, awkwardness and sincerity, Tom Holland's Spider-Man doesn't exactly take himself quite as seriously as Tobey Maguire's or Andrew Garfield's, the two actors who came before him. This only makes it all the better, as his banter with many of the Avengers is certainly among my favourite moments. Though officially Spidey belongs to another comic book label, Marvel and Disney would be foolish not to do whatever it took to give their version of Spider-Man his own trilogy. As for the plot, while the philosophical divide between Cap and Iron Man definitely serves an interesting premise, the film's writing never really manages to get past the same old arguments from the same characters, repeated over and over again. While the film tries to present both sides of the argument, many of the conflicts that lead to the affirmation of these arguments seem to stem from simple pitfalls like pride and stubbornness, and could probably be avoided altogether, though that wouldn't make for a very interesting film, would it? If you're a fan of the previous Marvel films, then this film is pretty much just more of what you already like, with all the Marvel-spectacle you could ever hope for. But if you've never really enjoyed a Marvel movie before, this one won't do anything to change your mind."

Cofundador y editor en FotografíaCalato.com y NoEsEnSerie.com, y crítico de Cinencuentro.com, MeGustaElCine.com, y Ventana Indiscreta. Los Hermanos Russo son lo mejor que le ha podido pasar al Universo Cinematográfico de Marvel. Al principio, algunos creímos que había sido el gran Joss Whedon —su primera película de los Vengadores fue notable al juntar a tanto héroe conocido y superpoderoso para una aventura divertida y altamente destructiva. Sin embargo, su Vengadores: Era de Ultrón, aunque entretenida, fue una película menor, especialmente comparada al Capitán América y el Soldado de Invierno de los Russo. Verosímil, emotiva, y llena de acción, esa segunda entrega del buen Capitán se sentía más como un thriller político al estilo de las películas de Bourne, que una típica cinta de superhéroes. A pesar de haber trabajado principalmente en series de televisión cómicas (como «Community»), Joe y Anthony Russo demostraron que eran unos maestros escenificando secuencias de acción, y lograron mezclar violencia, intriga, humor y una historia interesante para desarrollar una de las mejores entregas del MCU (las siglas en inglés del Universo Cinematográfico de Marvel). De hecho, a dicho filme le fue tan bien tanto con la crítica como con el público, que Marvel decidió darle a los Russo las riendas de sus películas más complejas: las dos entregas de Los Vengadores: La Guerra del Infinito (la épica culminación de las primeras cuatro fases del MCU), y Capitán América: Guerra Civil, la cual serviría como una prueba de su habilidad para combinar tramas y subtramas por doquier, y una gran cantidad de personajes, desde héroes hasta villanos y civiles en roles menores. «Capitán América: Guerra Civil» es una película innegablemente épica, llena de batallas intensas y de gran escala (como deben imaginarse, hay un combate central en el que todos los héroes se ven involucrados), pero también contiene un elemento emotivo que funciona a la perfección, caracterizaciones simples pero efectivas, grandes efectos especiales, y un tremendo sentido del humor. Me gustó más que «La Era de Ultrón»; es la mejor película de Marvel desde -lo adivinaron- «El Soldado de Invierno». Por todo lo que hemos podido apreciar en los trailers, muchos creíamos que la película iba a ser algo así como un Avengers 2.5, y que el título de Capitán América estaba ahí únicamente porque… bueno, solo Marvel lo sabría. Habiendo visto el filme, sin embargo, entendí porque Kevin Feige y compañía decidieron hacer de esta historia una secuela de «El Soldado de Invierno» y no una nueva película de Los Vengadores: el foco de la trama, claramente, está en Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) y en todo lo que pudimos ver en la película previa de los Russo.  ¿Por qué es que los Vengadores se dividen en dos grupos, uno liderado por el buen Capitán, y el otro por Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), alias Iron Man? Pues resulta que los eventos de Los Vengadores (la batalla de Nueva York), El Soldado de Invierno (la batalla final en Washington), Era de Ultrón (la pelea en Sokovia) y, en esta película, una notable escena de acción en Lagos, Nigeria, trajeron consigo graves consecuencias: hay gente que ya no confía en los héroes, y más bien cree que son un peligro para la humanidad. Debido a esto, el General Ross (William Hurt llama los Vengadores y les propone firmar el Tratado de Sokovia. Dicho documento, aprobado por 117 países, propone regular a los superhéroes a través de un comité de las Naciones Unidas, para que no se lleven a cabo más desastres. Stark, culpable debido a la muerte de un chico inocente en Sokovia, está de acuerdo con esta moción, pero el Capitán América se rehúsa a firmar. El primero es apoyado por Ojo de Halcón (Jeremy Renner), Sharon Carter (Emily Van Camp), agente norteamericana y sobrina de Peggy Carter (Haley Atwell), el Halcón (Anthony Mackie), Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), Ant-man (Paul Rudd), y la Bruja Escarlata (Elisabeth Olsen).  Por el lado de Iron Man, tenemos a War Machine (Don Cheadle), la Viuda Negra (Scarlett Johansson), Pantera Negra (nuevo personaje interpretado por Chadwick Boseman), la Visión (Paul Bettany), y último pero no menos importante, al Sorprendente Hombre Araña (Tom Holland), quien esta vez es un chico de no más de 15 ó 16 años, que vive con una Tía May bastante más joven y… atractiva (interpretada, por supuesto por Marissa Tomei). El conflicto de la película está expertamente realizado. Entendemos por qué cada bando tiene su propio punto de vista, y por qué está dispuesto a luchar para defenderlo. Tony Stark es un personaje profundamente imperfecto, alguien con buenas intenciones que ha cometido varios errores (véase La Era de Ultrón, por ejemplo) y que quiere corregir las cosas debido a la culpa que siente.  Por otra parte, el Capitán América es alguien que simplemente quiere hacer lo correcto y que entiende que siempre habrá daño colateral, y que después de la infiltración de HYDRA en SHIELD, no confía en nadie más que los héroes para combatir el mal. Las motivaciones de los personajes son claras, y el choque entre héroes es presentado de tal manera (gradualmente, como consecuencia de eventos que hemos visto tanto en esta película como en las anteriores) que uno puede creer que estos personajes, antes compañeros de batalla y amigos, terminarían peleándose tan violentamente. Muchas comparaciones se han hecho entre esta cinta y Batman vs Superman: El Origen de la Justicia. Después de todo, son dos películas estrenadas por compañías rivales en fechas muy cercanas. No quiero comenzar una nueva discusión sobre quién es mejor, si Marvel o DC Comics; el simple hecho es que ambas cintas tienen propósitos similares, por lo que mi breve comparación involucrará un comentario sobre la estructura de sus respectivos guiones, el desarrollo de sus personajes, y el tono de las películas, y no la superioridad de una empresa (o unos héroes) sobra otra. En pocas palabras: aunque no odié Batman vs Superman tanto como otros críticos (hubo varios momentos que me dejaron con los pelos de punta), debo admitir que Capitán América: Guerra Civil es, en general, un producto superior. Consideren, por ejemplo, la manera en que los nuevos personajes son presentados en cada película. Mientras que la Mujer Maravilla protagoniza escenas aisladas de la trama principal, viendo ridículos videos en su laptop en los que introducen de manera forzada a otros héroes como Aquaman o Flash; Capitán América presenta a Pantera Negra y Spider-Man de manera mucho más orgánica en la trama.  Pantera Negra es parte del conflicto principal desde la primera escena en la que aparece: quiere vengarse del Soldado de Invierno porque cree que él mató a su padre. Y Spider-Man es reclutado por Tony Stark para pelear contra el otro equipo de héroes. El primero es caracterizado de manera sobria, como alguien serio y elegante (después de todo, es un rey), mientras que el segundo me dio esperanzas de que la recién anunciada «Spider-Man: Homecoming» puede funcionar. El Spider-Man de Tom Holland es un chico hablador, muy divertido y carismático, diferente a lo que hicieron tanto Tobey Maguire como Andrew Garfield, pero muy fiel a lo que uno puede encontrar en los cómics. Y bueno, también está el asunto del tono del filme. He leído muchos comentarios en internet manifestando que «Civil War» contiene demasiados chistes, que es ridícula por momentos y que las líneas de diálogo cursis son excesivas. Pues no puedo estar de acuerdo con eso. «Guerra Civil» es, en general, seria; después de todo, nos cuenta sobre la división de un grupo muy unido de héroes, sobre una pelea emotiva entre amigos, sobre la muerte de los padres de Tony Stark, y sobre las consecuencias de las impresionantes batallas que hemos visto en películas anteriores de la MCU. Hay peleas violentas, muertes súbitas, e incluso un intento de suicidio. Las líneas graciosas sirven para que la película no se vuelva demasiado oscura, para aligerar la tensión cuando sea necesario pero, más importante, para divertir. Prefiero una película de este estilo que un tono excesivamente oscuro, deprimente, y carente de carisma como el de Batman vs Superman. Robert Downey Jr. nos entrega a un Tony Stark bastante más serio, lleno de culpa y remordimiento. Todavía es carismático, y todavía es capaz de ser sarcástico y bromista, pero a la vez uno siente que ha madurado. Como Steve Rogers, Chris Evans logra desarrollar a un personaje que realmente cree estar haciendo lo correcto, que aparentemente es incapaz de pensar que, quizás, está equivocado, y que contra todo pronóstico, podría tener un ego más grande que el de Stark.  Scarlett Johansson sigue demostrando lo perfecta que es como una heroína fuerte y aguerrida (sus escenas de pelea son impresionantes); Sebastian Stan es el centro del conflicto entre Iron Man y el Capitán, lo cual quiere decir que no le dan una personalidad demasiado compleja a su Bucky Barnes; Anthony Mackie es divertido y simpático como Falcon; Don Cheadle va mejorando, haciéndonos olvidar cada vez más que Terrence Howard pudo haber aparecido en esta película; Jeremy Renner, como Ojo de Halcón, tiene un rol pequeño pero importante; Paul Bettany interpreta a Visión como alguien que se está humanizando poco a poco, incluso desarrollando sentimientos románticos hacia alguien; Elizabeth Olsen hace lo que puede con un personaje (Scarlet Witch) al que le falta algo de dimensión; Paul Rudd es muy divertido como Ant-Man (quien, dicho sea de paso, tiene una gran sorpresa bajo la manga); Chadwick Boseman es intimidante como Pantera Negra (y hace que uno tenga ganas de ver su eventual película); Tom Holland es el Spider-Man perfecto; Emily VanCamp resalta como Sharon Carter; Daniel Brühl es sutilmente intenso como Zemo, un nuevo villano, y Frank Grillo, como Crossbones, es partícipe de una memorable batalla al principio del filme. A nivel técnico, la película destaca. A diferencia de Joss Whedon, quien prefería presentarnos combates muy espectaculares, llenos de explosiones y destrucción masiva (sin llegar a los excesos de alguien como Michael Bay), los Russo trabajan a una escala menor, favoreciendo las peleas mano a mano, y coreografiando sus combates de manera realista y muy intensa. No obstante, esto no quiere decir que la película carezca de momentos épicos, como la batalla central en el aeropuerto. Todo superhéroe tiene su momento para brillar, aunque Ant-Man y Spider-Man son los que verdaderamente destacan. Los efectos visuales son excelentes, como se deben imaginar, pero la banda sonora compuesta por Henry Jackman es decepcionantemente genérica y olvidable. «Capitán América: Guerra Civil» es de las mejores películas de súperheroes porque trata de hacer algo diferente. El choque entre dos equipos de héroes es algo que no hemos visto en el cine antes, y las consecuencias del mismo, tienen como resultado un futuro con infinitas posibilidades, las cuales me imagino veremos en pantalla cuando se estrenen las dos películas de Guerra del Infinito. Combinando tensión con comedia, acción de la buena con una trama interesante, y ofreciendo buenas actuaciones, Guerra Civil es todo lo que esperaba y más. Veremos si es que algunas de las siguientes películas de esta cuarta fase de la MCU (Doctor Extraño, Guardianes de la Galaxia Volumen 2, Spider-Man: Homecoming, Thor: Ragnarok, Pantera Negra, Vengadores: Guerra del Infinito, Partes 1 y 2, Ant-Man y la Avispa, y Capitán Marvel) logran superarla, o si logran construir algo interesante sobre la base establecida por este notable filme. Lo que me parece problemático con los cómics es que los héroes son imposibles para que los niños copian. Ellos simplemente equiparan el poder con el bien, que es raramente el caso en la vida real. Superhéroes que pueden volar son mucho menos valiente que aquellos que pueden mantenerse firmemente en la cara de la Verdad. Así que mediante la elevación de los cómics a este nivel, enviamos un mensaje a nuestros hijos que la Verdad es menos importante que el poder. Por lo tanto, los abusos de poder aumentarán."
"May 2, 2016",POSITIVE," Given the relative dullness of the Marvel supervillains, the studio has resorted to making its colorful superheroes fight one another in Captain America: Civil War, a combination jamboree and ethical colloquium. There’s a lot of bloat, but the fanboy in us all will have a hard time not grinning when Spider-Man be-webs Captain America’s shield while Ant-Man scoots around pulling out wires in Iron Man’s suit. The film pivots on citizens enraged by collateral damage, because it turns out that when superheroes throw supervillains into sides of buildings, many people in those buildings die. That danger hadn’t occurred to me, frankly, insofar as superheroes don’t really exist — so who needs pesky real-world consequences? But 9/11 has sensitized us to the horror of collapsing skyscrapers (Americans were the last to get the news), while modern comics writers (along with directors Christopher Nolan and Zack Snyder) have earnestly taken up the ethics of vigilantism. Snyder’s Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice opens with Bruce Wayne/Batman watching Superman and General Zod pulverize Metropolis and blaming (inexplicably, given his own leanings) the savior rather than the psycho. Our heroes here are similarly pilloried. More than pilloried. The secretary of State (William Hurt!) lectures the chastened Avengers for “routinely ignor[ing] sovereign borders” and being “unconcerned” about the hell they leave behind. The United Nations wants them to sign a treaty promising not to fly around smashing invaders willy-nilly. Robert Downey Jr.’s Tony Stark/Iron Man thinks this is a good thing and Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) thinks it’s not. I’d guessed the high-tech Stark would be the one to opt for security over accountability, but early on he’s schooled by Alfre Woodard* as a mother whose son died in the last Avengers film. Captain A, on the other hand, consoles a guilt-ridden Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) on the inevitable trade-off: “This job is trying to save as many people as we can,” he says. “Not all of them.” The script puts us on Cap’s side: Safety first. It even features a cute drone. The politics do get muddled in the end — but who’s lining up for the clunky debates? Captain America: Civil War turns on another of those momentous questions: Who would win in a fight — Batman or Superman? King Kong or Godzilla? Tyrannosaurus Trump or Robo-Hillary? And so Scarlet Witch, Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), and the newly enlisted Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) line up behind Captain A, while War Machine (Don Cheadle), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Vision (Paul Bettany) side with Iron Man. Spider-Man (Tom Holland) pops up, too. Superheroes can take a lot of punishment and the results are predictably inconclusive. But … you know: Iron Man zapping Captain America bonking Iron Man getting electro-fogged by Scarlet Witch getting kung fu–ed by Black Widow — how cool is that? It’s too bad Hulk and Thor were otherwise engaged and Samuel L. Jackson likely cost too much even for a budget this gargantuan. But there are wild cards, among them Cap’s old pal turned nemesis Bucky Barnes/Winter ­Soldier (Sebastian Stan) and the African president who moonlights as Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and thinks the Winter Soldier killed his dad. On another front, an enigmatic Daniel Bruhl slays former hydra officials in a quest to locate a bunch more bio-enhanced Winter Soldiers in stasis somewhere in the former Soviet Union. It’s a busy, busy movie. But not an especially inventive one. Say what you will about Zack Snyder, he aims for a mythic palette, mixing Expressionistic silent-film imagery with art-museum-worthy religious iconography. Overseen by ex–sitcom directors Anthony and Joe Russo, Captain America: Civil War is a hodgepodge, with action sequences handled by sundry effects factories working in sundry styles. The most rousing set piece is the very first, a hyperspeed fight between terrorists and a handful of Avengers that’s noticeably rotoscoped, the slight flicker making the real bodies and computer-generated mayhem seem all of a piece — and brilliantly punctuated by the Captain’s pinging shield and the elastic gymnastics of Johansson and her stunt double. How many gag writers supplied one-liners? I especially liked the bit in the car where the Winter Soldier asks the cranky Falcon to move up his seat. Holland shows promise as the new, unusually juvenile Spidey, a chatterbox full of hormones and grooving on his power. Martin Freeman has a brief but amusingly creepy part as a CIA liaison who’s a little too happy doing his job. Olsen can suffer without being a drip — her mask of grief is eloquent. The best way to think of Captain America: Civil War is as a toy box in which the sheer quantity of toys partly makes up for the lack of anything new. But the big takeaway is worrisome. Marvel has created a universe teeming with superheroes who simply don’t have enough to do. They’re all suited up with nowhere to go."
"May 2, 2016",POSITIVE," 

Tired of superhero movies?  Brace yourself because there’s a lot more to come.  Captain America: Civil War marks the first movie in “phase three” of the Marvel cinematic universe.  A total of 10 movies will be released over the next 3 years with everything coming together in a two-part Avengers flick entitled Infinity War. 
The opening third of this latest instalment has a strong political flavour.  It’s becoming an overused theme in superhero films but The Avengers find themselves losing favour with the public.  It may sound hard to believe given the number of times they’ve saved the world and defeated a zealous villain.  The problem is the rising civilian death toll.  The King of Sokovia sums it up best – “victory at the expense of the innocent is no victory at all.” 
A proposition is therefore put to The Avengers by the United States Secretary of State.  He sees the danger in them having “unlimited power with no supervision.”  In searching for a middle ground, he is happy for The Avengers to continue operating but they must now follow a set of rules and take direction from a governing body controlled by the United Nations.  More than 100 countries around the world support the idea. 
It’s at this point where the division begins.  Iron Man (Downey Jr) knows of the dangers of too much power (refer back to Age of Ultron) and is happy to endorse the concept.  He is joined by Black Widow (Johansson), War Machine (Cheadle) and the Scarlet Witch (Olsen).  Vision (Bettany) shares a similar view and puts forward an compelling argument about the growing number of villains looking to take down The Avengers.  Does strength breed challengers? 
On the other side of the fence is the faction led by Captain America (Evans).  He’s a little more “old fashioned” and believes that having been gifted with super powers, he should have the right to choose where and when he can use them.  Those loyal to his cause include Falcon (Mackie), Hawkeye (Renner) and Ant-Man (Rudd). 
When watching an AFL or NRL match, there are brief moments where a fight breaks out between the two teams.  It normally involves a bit of pushing, shoving, and jumper grabbing.  There’s a lot of passion involved but the players are smart enough not to do anything silly or life threatening.  They’ll often shrug it off and shake hands at the end of the game. 
That’s not the case in Captain America: Civil War and it makes for strange viewing.  There are several action sequences where these characters are beating each other as hard as they can.  I’m not sure what they’re trying to achieve.  Are they trying to kill their friends… or merely injure them?  It’s hard to take seriously and there’s not much in the way of tension. 
The good news is that there is a more interesting storyline running in parallel.  The Winter Soldier (Stan) has been accused of being the mastermind behind a terrorist attack in Vienna.  He proclaims his innocence but few believe him.  It sets in motion an elaborate manhunt that involves two new additions to the series – Daniel Bruhl as Helmut Zero and Chadwick Boseman as the Black Panther. 
There are more characters and subplots that a Game of Thrones episode but somehow, directors Anthony and Joe Russo have managed to mash it all together into something that works.  The political elements grabbed me most but there are still plenty of laughs for those looking for light hearted entertainment.  Spider-Man (Holland) stands out best in that regard and is hilariously chided for talking too much during the fight sequences. 
With many storylines left open as the closing credits start to roll, Captain America: Civil War feels like the first episode in a lengthy mini-series.  It sets the stage, offers a few surprises, and teases audiences with a glimpse of what lies ahead."
"May 1, 2016",POSITIVE,"A remarkably coherent and tightly focused affair that by virtue of clarity and concision, manages to keep all its ducks in a row while providing both the movies billed, i.e. the sequel to Winter Soldier and the Avengers' civil war."
"May 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"This film may excel at building anticipation for cool things coming a year or two down the line, but does a movie called Captain America that leaves you wishing you were watching one called Spider-Man really count as a win for blockbuster fans?"
"May 1, 2016",POSITIVE," The pagan in me loves the latest trend in superhero movies; the more gods the merrier. And thanks to the length and breadth of the “Marvel cinematic universe”, directors Anthony and Joe Russo have umpteen gods to choose from for their third Captain America yarn.  One household name, in particular, has been pumped full of zip. When Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) falls out with Avengers leader Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), the latter seeks help from a YouTube sensation whose number one priority is “homework”. Andrew Garfield was perfectly decent in Sony’s The Amazing Spider-Man but 19-year-old Tom Holland’s Peter Parker/Spidey is a delight. He’s giddy with callowness. He’s young-school. It’s also great to see Paul Rudd’s Antman — recruited by Captain America — rubbing up against the big guys during a spectacularly inventive fight sequence. And Chadwick Boseman, as vengeance-fuelled T’Challa/Black Panther, is superbly poised.  Even Iron Man, whose smug and jaunty schtick was overused in Avengers: Age of Ultron, becomes a permanent source of pleasure, mostly thanks to scriptwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. A CGI effect allows us to see a false memory of Stark’s younger self. The old man of the group has a character arc that’s poignant. When he goes to war, it’s thrilling. True, it takes a long time for him to go to war. The plotting is tighter and more plausible than in Batman v Superman, but only just (there’s an everyman baddie with limitless funds. I should be such an everyman).  As for our titular hero... With Stark becoming the surprise poster-boy for big government, Rogers — desperate to protect his friend and one-time Soviet stooge Bucky (Sebastian Stan) — is forced to fly the flag for libertarianism. Unfortunately, the captain himself has become a big, fit nothing. In fact, only the presence of his charisma-free love-interest Sharon (Emily VanCamp) saves him from being the dullest person in the room. The central debate is topical but it cries out for input from some of Marvel’s newer creations (if only there was space for Ms Marvel, aka Kamala Khan, a Pakistani-American teen from New Jersey). You can’t help wishing, too, that the film-makers had been allowed to think outside the toy box. In Marvel comics, super-heroines never look a day over 30 and, as a result, middle-aged actresses never get to smash shit up on screen. But imagine if Meryl Streep were parachuted into the proceedings. She’s played the Iron Lady; why not Iron Woman?  Marisa Tomei (as Spidey’s sexy Aunt May) quips that “aunts come in all shapes and sizes”. The superheroes in this movie are certainly the most diverse we’ve seen so far, yet the status quo remains unchallenged.  Of course, I’d be happy to revise this opinion if the Cap and Bucky were to become a romantic item in Avengers: Infinity War. Don’t tell me you haven’t noticed the way Bucky looks at Cap! Such a move would probably create civil war among comic book fans. But isn’t it time superheroes joined the (real) modern world?"
"May 1, 2016",POSITIVE," Scrapping superheroes are suddenly all the rage. Hardly have the critics stopped mauling the incoherent and insufferably self-important Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice than here comes another clash of irresistible forces and immoveable objects. If not quite as stupendously wonderful as some of the breathless early reviews suggest, Captain America: Civil War still deserves a prominent place in what is so grandiosely called the Marvel Cinematic Universe. As befits a film that was colossally expensive to make (Robert Downey Jnr’s fee alone is reportedly enough to make the knees buckle), it is spectacular, exhilarating and showy: the action flits from London to New York via Lagos, Vienna, Bucharest and Berlin. But best of all, and unlike the match-up between the Caped Crusader and the Man of Steel, it never takes itself too seriously. Wit is at least as important as volume; the essence of any really good superhero movie. ‘You’re being uncharacteristically non-hyper-verbal,’ says Scarlett Johansson’s Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow, wryly, to Tony Stark/Iron Man (Downey Jnr), when for a rare moment he falls silent and contemplative. He has much to be contemplative about. One of the problems with the rival DC empire’s Batman v Superman was that it piled up unsubtle allusions to God, 9/11 and the spectre of nuclear holocaust. But the superhero universe does need to remind us of our own, and in this film the big issue is that ghastly military euphemism for the regrettable slaughter of innocent people: collateral damage. The Avengers and Iron Man have caused far too much of it in the relentless fight against evil, and the United Nations, with the backing of the U.S. Secretary of State (William Hurt), want them brought to heel. That’s what causes the super-schism: Iron Man and Black Widow, plus others including War Machine (Don Cheadle) and Vision (Paul Bettany), think the UN might have a point. They are willing to make themselves more accountable. Also mixed up in this internecine brouhaha are Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), and the latest Marvel Comics superhero to be made flesh, T’Challa/Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman, last seen playing the ‘Godfather of Soul’ James Brown in Get On Up), as well as one rather more familiar character: Peter Parker/Spider-Man. This, however, is a brand new Spider-Man, played by 19-year-old English actor Tom Holland, who made his name on the West End stage as the ballet dancing Billy Elliot. He doesn’t get much screen time here, but directors Joe and Anthony Russo (the brothers from Ohio who also directed 2014’s excellent Captain America: The Winter Soldier), along with writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, weave plenty from what little he has. They give him the lovely Marisa Tomei as Aunt May, and some prize dialogue. Sweetly, Peter is not sure he can get involved in any international superhero business on account of having too much homework. Eventually, inevitably, the two factions collide, in what is basically a giant game of Rock, Paper, Scissors — can Captain America’s powers trump Iron Man’s? Is Black Widow strong and resourceful enough to deal with Falcon? Our loyalties are divided, which of course is the idea, but we, the audience — and they, the superheroes — need an antagonist to unite against, and get one in the form of Helmut Zemo (Daniel Bruhl). He not only has Cap’s former best friend, Bucky Barnes (otherwise known as the Winter Soldier, and played by Sebastian Stan), in his thrall, but might just have masterminded the whole civil war thing in a fiendish bid to get the forces of good destroying each other. I’ll give no more away, save to say that it’s always fun to watch Marvel films, as I did, in the company of diehard fans, who cheer every quip and nuance, and practically hug themselves with delight when the creator of many of these characters — that spritely nonagenarian Stan Lee — pops up in his usual Hitchcockian cameo role."
"May 1, 2016",POSITIVE," Most superhero movies end with the kind of wanton destruction that leaves a queasy aftertaste: OK, so evil madman/ monster/giant lizard has bitten the dust but what about those caught in the crossfire and collapsing rubble of the audience-pleasing obliteration?  It never seems to trouble the filmmakers. Man Of Steel tried to posit Superman as a Christ-like saviour, which was rather at odds with the apocalyptic mayhem he unleashed as he took on General Zod. A hydrogen bomb would have caused less collateral damage. It was the same with Avengers Assemble (New York in smithereens) Captain America: Winter Soldier (Washington DC) and almost any Spider-Man or Batman movie you care to mention. Not so much superheroes, you might say, as grandstanding liabilities.  Wonder no more because it’s a question that is front and centre in Captain America: Civil War, a superhero cornucopia which forces its myriad costumed saviours to take sides on that very issue.  To be reigned in or not to be reigned in? That is the question when the world loses patience after a Captain America-led mission in Nigeria results in the deaths of innocent civilians; a spectacular sequence that opens the film as Cap and pals, such as Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Falcon (Anthony Mackie) chase terrorists. It’s the final straw after the ravaging of an entire country, the fictional Eastern European state of Sokovia, which formed the climax of last summer’s Avengers: Age Of Ultron, in which most of Civil War’s cast appeared, including Tony Stark, aka Iron Man ( Robert Downey Jnr), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), War Machine (Don Cheadle) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen).  Now the world wants the superheroes to come under the supervision of a UN panel, as orchestrated by US Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) who demands they sign up to the “Sokovia Accords”. It’s a complex moral issue in the same way that the previous Captain America film, The Winter Soldier, tackled state surveillance and the price of freedom. In that film Captain America (Chris Evans), once the poor man’s Superman, proved himself quite the bad boy by going rogue and refusing to play ball with the government’s intrusive new defence programme. As character rebranding goes, the complex new Captain America, once a square-jawed anachronism, must rank as one of the most successful reinventions in the history of comic book movies, indicative of Marvel Comics’ effortless brilliance at refreshing their properties. The other, of course, is Iron Man, once a minor superhero character and now a colossus of the comic book world, thanks to Downey Jr’s quicksilver wit and charisma.  Here, interestingly, it’s “bad boy” Tony Stark who wants to play by the rules. “We need to be put in check,” admits the vainglorious tycoon, teeing up a bruising and potentially catastrophic confrontation between Team Cap and Team Iron Man. Unlike the self-important and horribly tedious Batman vs Superman, which managed to combine earnestness with absurdity, Civil War tackles weighty themes with a light touch and huge sense of fun as the characters are drawn into conflict. There are so many superheroes in the mix it is, to all intents and purposes, another Avengers movie with the heroes battling each other rather than a supervillain, although there is a dastardly brain at work in the wings, the interestingly understated Helmut Zemo (Daniel Bruhl) whose motives are cleverly concealed until the very end. Directed by Winter Soldier’s Anthony and Joe Russo, the picture’s great achievement is the adept balancing of so many characters. It never feels overstuffed and everyone has their moment and purpose while several new heroes are introduced. Most entertainingly we meet the new Spider-Man played delightfully by young Briton Tom Holland as a starry-eyed chatterbox in thrall to Iron Man, plus African prince Black Panther, played by a brooding Chadwick Boseman, both of whom will be having their own movies soon. At 146 minutes, the picture occasionally flags and the action relies rather too heavily on the superheroes duffing each other up, even if done so very amusingly thanks to the likes of Ant-Man (a scene stealing Paul Rudd). It’s not as thrilling or taut as Winter Soldier but it builds to an intriguing climax – one that does not, for once, involve a city being laid to waste. Son Of Saul is an astonishing Hungarian film set in Auschwitz which won this year’s Best Foreign Language film Oscar, directed by debut filmmaker Laszlo Nemes. Filmed entirely from the claustrophobic perspective of the main character, Saul (Geza Rohrig), a member of the camp’s Jewish “Sonderkommando” unit charged with working in the gas chambers. It’s a disorientating and unsparing descent into hell, shot through with a sliver of hope as Saul attempts to give a proper Jewish burial to a dead boy who may or may not be his son; a symbolic act of defiance that might just reclaim his soul. It’s unsettling and unforgettable. After Dallas Buyers Club and Wild director Jean-Marc Vallee delivers a dud with Demolition starring Jake Gyllenhaal, an actor always on the verge of irritating who here goes the full irritant.  He plays an emotionally constipated banker, Davis Mitchell, who doesn’t know how to grieve following the death of his wife and starts smashing things up, including his flash home, as some kind of spurious metaphor for examining the detail of his life and putting it back together.  Is he completely heartless, in some kind of catatonic trauma or just stupid? It’s never clear but you certainly sympathise with his aggrieved father-in-law (Chris Cooper), the only character you’ll care about amid a sorry collection of lost souls."
"May 1, 2016",POSITIVE," That is the question causing sleepless nights for Robert Downey Jr’s Iron Man in Captain America: Civil War, a comic book epic in which the visual spectacle and mass destruction are matched by ideological conflict and guilty consciences. The plot eventually transforms natural allies into sworn enemies in much the same manner as the recent Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice but with a lighter touch. The Marvel version of events is a wittier, more thrilling prospect and it also continues to build the Marvel empire with the addition of new recruits Tom Holland as Spider-Man and Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther. The heart of the film is the souring friendship between Iron Man and Captain America (Chris Evans). Following the deaths of innocent civilians during a battle in Lagos, politicians decide The Avengers can no longer be allowed to operate independently. US Secretary Of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) proposes an accord, signed by the nations of the world, making The Avengers accountable to the United Nations. A weary, guilt-ridden Iron Man is in full agreement but Captain America is more wary. His loyalties are tested even further when his old wartime buddy Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) is accused of bombing a UN gathering. Does he stay loyal to Bucky, aka The Winter Soldier, and defy his fellow superheroes or abandon the friendship and instincts that have served him well for decades? It is only a matter of time before the lines are drawn and everyone from Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) to Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) are forced to take sides in what becomes a war for the soul of the superhero movement. Brothers Anthony and Joe Russo jointly directed Captain America: The Winter Soldier and are growing in confidence with the latest chapter in the Marvel saga. Tom Holland’s arrival as a high-spirited, geeky Spider-Man is joyous and bodes well for the forthcoming Spider-Man: Homecoming. Anthony Mackie’s Falcon and Jeremy Renner’s Hawkeye continue to make an impression and Ant-Man has one of the best moments in the entire film. Two-and-a-half hours pass in an instant and when the battles commence they carry more emotional weight because we have been on a journey with these characters for the past eight years. In many respects this is the Marvel movies’ finest hour.  Jake Gyllenhaal adds to his gallery of compelling performances in Demolition. He plays Davis, a handsome, hugely successful investment banker who has the world on a string until the day his wife dies in a car crash. Everyone expects Davis to be grief-stricken and inconsolable but he feels nothing. In the middle of all the chaos he writes a firm letter of complaint to a vending machine company after their machine fails to cough up a packet of M&Ms. He has given them his money and received nothing in return. The correspondence escalates, bringing him to the attention of customer services rep Karen (Naomi Watts). The two form an unlikely connection that grows to include Karen’s son Chris (Judah Lewis). Possible salvation arrives when Davis takes to heart father-in-law Phil’s (Chris Cooper) advice the only way to rebuild is by demolishing the life he once knew and Davis takes this literally. Demolition may not be the most subtle film but it is funny, smoothly executed and Gyllenhaal makes Davis a very sympathetic misfit.  You may think you have seen every aspect of the Holocaust that cinema could possibly depict but Son Of Saul will make you think again. Laszlo Nemes’s extraordinary debut focuses on Saul (Geza Rohrig), a Hungarian Jew in a Nazi death camp towards the end of the Second World War. Saul is a Sonderkommando, which means that he assists the guards in return for a few precious privileges and the chance to postpone the inevitability of his own demise. Plunged into his daily nightmare, we are assaulted by the sights and sounds of mass extermination as orders are barked, prisoners are gathered and ushered naked into “shower” rooms then bodies are removed so the process can start all over again. Saul has surrendered his humanity in return for survival but that slowly changes when he encounters a young boy who may be his son. His desire to give the boy a proper burial becomes an act of salvation played out as a thrilling race against impossible odds. No good deed goes unpunished in Hard Tide, an ambitious and stylish attempt to bring something fresh to the familiar ingredients of the gritty, violent British crime thriller. Based on true events, it unfolds in a weary world of grim housing estates and ruthless drug dealers. Small-time crook Jake (Nathanael Wiseman) may be mean and moody but he takes a shine to Jade (Alexandra Newick), a neglected nine-year-old full of innocence and curiosity. When bullets start flying, the unlikely duo are forced on the run. Miguel Gomes’ epic trilogy on the poverty and heartache of austerity-ridden Portugal continues to entrance in this second volume. The tales include that of mass murderer Simao “Without Bowels” who becomes a folk hero and there is a stern magistrate who presides over an alfresco courtroom. A weird but strangely wonderful film."
"May 1, 2016",POSITIVE," With his propaganda-poster jawline and air of unimpeachable nobility, Captain America (Chris Evans) has always been one of the duller members of the Marvel universe. Which is probably why, although this latest Avengers outing bears his name, the film-makers have press-ganged (almost) every spare ounce of Marvel muscle to back him up. The Hulk-sized gap in the lineup is filled by an engagingly geeky Spider-Man (Tom Holland, a promising taster for the stand-alone Spider-Movie next year). And while memorising who is in which of the colour-coded, armour-plated exoskeletons (and who is punching who in the head) can be challenging, the sheer force of so much superpowered personality on screen makes for a blast of a movie. Following an explosive but raggedly edited opening sequence in Nigeria, the Avengers are forced to confront the human cost of their ambitious action set pieces. Guilt over collateral damage is what prompts some of them – Tony Stark, Natasha Romanoff – to sign an accord ceding responsibility for their actions to the UN. But Steve Rogers, AKA Captain America, demurs. The freedom to deploy a spot of unilateral ass-kicking where needed is what makes the Captain, and by extension America, great. The scene is set for an internecine Avengers smackdown; the plot – hooked on an undercooked vengeful grudge – is of secondary importance to the opportunity to watch them knock titanium alloy spots off each other. Fortunately, the zinging screenplay, by Marvel regulars Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, hits home almost as frequently as the punches."
"Apr 30, 2016",POSITIVE," Thankfully, Marvel’s latest Avengers flick, pitting Team Iron Man against Team Captain America, has all the ingredients that were sorely missing in the previous showdown. This film’s big tear-up – a multi-hero brawl in a Berlin airport – is spectacular, unpredictable and dramatically justified. Most importantly, it’s also a bit of a laugh. After all, you really need a sense of humour when grown-ups dressed in animal costumes start laying into each other. Holland’s schoolboy Spidey – far better company than Andrew Garfield’s angst-ridden snapper – is just one of the welcome surprises in this crowd-pleasing blockbuster. In this single sequence, new recruit Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) delivers more laughs than he did in his entire origins movie. Cinemagoers also get a first look at Marvel’s most ridiculously-attired hero. Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) is no civil rights militant but an acrobatic African king who vents his grief over the death of his dad by squeezing into a cat suit adorned with pointy ears and retractable claws. If you want to peek into his palace you’ll have to sit through the end credits. It’s an impressive gaff, although I don’t envy the flunky tasked with emptying the litter tray. Riddled with guilt, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) agrees to closet his iron suit until the next resolution and persuades Vision (Paul Bettany), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and War Machine (Don Cheadle) to join him on the sidelines. But after falling victim to corrupt 21st Century politicians in his excellent last solo movie, World War Two hero Captain America (Chris Evans) is in no hurry to sign up. And when the UN’s first move is to order a hit on his school-chum-turned-brainwashed-assassin Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) he and four others – Falcon, Ant-Man, Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) go rogue. That’s a lot of characters to juggle even in a film that runs close to two-and-a-half hours. The Captain gets most of the screen time followed by Iron Man, but the rest of it is doled out equally amongst the supporting players. It’s not perfect. The film’s villain Zemo (Daniel Brühl) doesn’t quite come to life and his convoluted plan doesn’t make a whole lot of a sense. There’s a frustrating feeling of incompleteness too. Franchise obligations mean the finale doubles-up as a teaser for the next Avengers movie – the two part Infinity War due in 2018. But this is still a great superhero flick, a near-perfect blend of humour, drama and action. The Cap might not have the best powers, but he always seems to get the best movies."

"Apr 29, 2016",POSITIVE,"Captain America: Civil War is very good, but the connective tissue between the powerful scenes, felt like chewy gristle in a great cut of steak."
"Apr 29, 2016",POSITIVE,"The Russos have taken a leaf out of Joss Whedon's playbook, remembering that as cool as they are in costume, the most character development happens when these superheroes are in civvies."
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL," Midway through the press screening of Captain America: Civil War, I found myself envying a tightly-knit group to my right who seemed to be having a much better time than I was. They were Marvel fanboys, no doubt, that much maligned species of super-enthusiast that lives for these Avengers-related events, and must find the long gaps between film releases intolerable. While I found myself wondering how much this cinematic fireworks display had cost, and how much longer it was all going to last, they gasped and chortled as though witnessing some miraculous mash-up of Raiders of the Lost Ark and Citizen Kane. They seemed positively transported: if only I could have joined them. This is, to get our facts straight, the third Captain America film, and the 13th instalment in the Marvel cinematic universe. Captain America is of course an Avenger, and has also appeared alongside Thor, Hulk and Iron Man in two massively successful action spin-offs. I rather liked the first Captain America film, First Avenger, which explored Steve Rogers' origins as a seven-stone 1940s weakling who's turned into a chemically enhanced superhero after submitting to a secret government experiment. He kicked Nazi butt before getting cryogenically frozen. In Winter Soldier, he woke up in the present day (imagine his confusion - what is a Kardashian?) to do battle with a brainwashed Soviet sleeper assassin, and joined forces with the Avengers to save the world at least twice. But in Civil War, trouble's brewing. Cap (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) are in Lagos hunting down a gang of super villains when their operation goes wrong, leading to numerous civilian casualties. The Avengers (not all of them - Hulk and Thor appeared to have previous engagements) are summoned by US Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt), who insists that change is necessary. The Avengers must now agree to sign an accord submitting themselves to UN oversight: they will henceforth only engage after being given a UN mandate, and their combat actions will be subject to scrutiny. While Iron Man (Robert Downey), Black Widow, War Machine (Don Cheadle) and Vision (Paul Bettany) are in favour of the agreement, Captain America believes the Avengers should remain autonomous, and is backed by Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Falcon, Scarlet Witch and the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan). A nasty spat seems inevitable, and things get worse when a terrorist bomb kills dozens at the Avengers' treaty signing ceremony in Vienna, and Winter Soldier appears to be the culprit. Captain America: Civil War rumbles busily towards a confrontation between Cap and Iron Man, but that fistfight is perhaps the least interesting bit of this frenetic, hyperactive and intermittently enjoyable film. You can't say it's badly made: in fact the special effects, character arcs and one-liners are interwoven so skilfully that they purr at times like the pistons of a Rolls Royce engine. Cap himself is a bit of a bore, an upright stiff who's totally upstaged by Robert Downey's mouthy and staggeringly arrogant Tony Stark. In the film's funniest scene, Stark pays a visit to Peter Parker, (Spider-Man), and makes fun of his arachnid ""onesie"". It's slick alright, but also soulless: worst of all, it is not a standalone movie. Fans of the Marvel universe have dressed up the interconnected nature of these films as ""long-form storytelling"", but that's just a fancy way of saying that none of these stories ever actually ends. There's always a teaser for the next film, always a link to the last, and that means it's not really possible to sit down and watch this without having seen all the others. So it's not really cinema at all, just huge screen episodic television."
"Apr 29, 2016",POSITIVE," What is the best way to deploy vastly superior abilities against less capable but nevertheless still very dangerous bad guys? How best to minimize collateral damage — of both the human and the infrastructure kind — when those vastly superior abilities are put to their use? What happens when people of good conscience, all of whom genuinely want nothing more than to increase net happiness and general well-being in the world, disagree over the answers to these questions? And who should get the final say: politicians sitting at desks thousands of miles away from the fields of battle, or the soldiers fighting those battles? There’s a recent movie that Captain America: Civil War feels a helluva lot like, in tone and in objective, and it’s not Batman v Superman, though the two do bear some superficial similarities. No, it’s Eye in the Sky, the superb drama thriller about drone warfare. The philosophies of both films go way beyond the mantra of “With great power comes great responsibility”; they take that as a given as they explore what, precisely, that responsibility means and how it gets expressed. I predicted in my review of the previous Captain America movie, The Winter Soldier, that public opinion regarding the Avengers was bound to turn more condemning in the wake of yet another city — in Soldier, Washington DC — wrecked by one of their battles with bad guys… and that was before what happened in the most recent Avengers movie, Age of Ultron, when the capital city of the (fictional) Eastern European nation of Sokovia was, well, “destroyed” barely begins to cover it. And all that was before the opening sequence ofCivil War, in which a battle set in the very real city of Lagos (though it wasn’t shot there) ends with a terrible mistake by the telekinetic Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen: Godzilla, In Secret), aka Scarlet Witch, that results in the deaths of many innocents. Now, the world has had enough, and the UN proposes that the Avengers come under the umbrella of an international oversight panel that will decide where they go, what they do, and also where they shouldn’t go and what they shouldn’t do. But the gang cannot all agree to these limitations, with the two factions aligning behind either Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.: The Judge, Chef), aka Iron Man, who believes they need some reigning in — I like to think this is because he’s still feeling guilty over how he became an accidental mad-scientist villain in Ultron — or Steve Rogers (Chris Evans: Snowpiercer, The Iceman), aka Captain America, who doesn’t want to hand over his autonomy to a governmental body, probably because he hasn’t had the best experiences in the past as a tool of politicians. (His early life as a supersoldier in WWII, after all, was all about political propaganda: looking good, not doing good.) Now, this is almost an Avengers movie in its own right, with so many familiar faces here: Natasha Romanoff the kickass spy Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson: The Jungle Book, Hail, Caesar!); Sam Wilson the flying Falcon (Anthony Mackie: Triple 9, The Night Before); James Rhodes, who wears Iron Man-esque powered armor as War Machine (Don Cheadle: Miles Ahead, Flight); archer Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner: Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, Kill the Messenger). And they are joined by some newcomers: Scott Lang (Paul Rudd: They Came Together, Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues) is recruited when his Ant-Man skills will be useful; Peter Parker (Tom Holland: In the Heart of the Sea, Locke) joins in when Stark decides his Spider-Man schtick is pretty cool but needs some honing; and — most excitingly — Prince T’Challa (an absolutely electrifying Chadwick Boseman: Get on Up) of the (fictional) African nation of Wakanda, who is secretly the badass Black Panther. (That there are multiple women, including one significant other whose presence I won’t spoil, and three black men among this cast, all with stories of their own, is beyond delicious. Diversity isn’t a buzzword: it brings genuine freshness to what is too often, across the genre, insipidly monotone storytelling.) When the two factions meet in a spectacular battle over the UN issue, it’s thrilling and often amusing not only because they’re all pulling their punches — none of them actually wants to hurt their friends — but also because we witness them combining their powers in weird, intriguing, and effective ways across a grand canvas. It’s superhero action on a scale we haven’t seen before, and even better, it’s a superhero ballet, not a bloodbath; it’s fantastic. (Ironic that the battle to decide how the Avengers will respond to public opinion turning against them will likely result in even more bad PR for them. This is a major airport, and it gets trashed. It’s gonna cost a fortune to repair.) The brother directing team of Joe and Anthony Russo, returning from Winter Soldier, and writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely — who wrote both Soldier and the first Captain America flick, The First Avenger — ensure that all the action sequences are magnificent, innovative, and, perhaps most importantly, do not drag on past the point at which you’ve had enough. But this most definitely is not an Avengers movie. When the US Secretary of State (William Hurt: Winter’s Tale, The Host), who brings the UN’s not-really-optional oversight proposal before the group asks a question — “Where are Thor and Hulk?” — that works as both a snarky joke about their noteworthy onscreen absence and as commentary about why some think oversight of the Avengers is needed: No, really, who knows where they are or what they are up to? And this is primarily a very personal story about Rogers and his friendship with Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan: The Martian, Ricki and the Flash), aka the Winter Soldier, who looks to have committed another terrible and very public crime as a result of his Soviet conditioning as a supersoldier and is now being hunted by police worldwide. Rogers believes in Barnes’s innocence, and his siding with Earth’s most wanted combined with his rejection of the UN proposal makes Rogers an outlaw, too. But is Rogers deluded about his old friend? Rogers’s supersoldier treatment was targeted only at his body and not at his mind, but Bucky’s brain was messed with. Is there any coming back from that? How do you trust a guy that you don’t know you can trust? How far can faith alone in someone take you? Aren’t some safeguards a good thing? These are the unspoken questions that hang over everything going on in Civil War, between the world and the Avengers, and among the Avengers and their hangers-on themselves. (I cannot decide if I am #TeamCap or #TeamIronMan… and that’s a marvelous thing.) There’s barely a villain here at all, just unanswerable questions: What legal framework are superhumans best placed in, or can they be placed in one at all? What is the morality of using superpowers even by undoubtedly good people? More than one of these superhumans flirt with the Dark Side here, which never causes us to doubt their basic goodness but instead only highlights their humanity: rage and grief can make almost anyone do irrational things that they’ll regret later. And we all understand that we have to live with the consequences of our actions… or inactions. But rage and regret and consequences are radically different the more powerful you are. And that’s true whether your power comes from a gun or a drone-fired missile or a spiderbite. One of the things that has made the Avengers movies work so well is that all these characters feel like real people: they are never cartoonish, and, ironically, they feel like they are at their most human when they are behaving in superhuman ways. That’s never been more true than in Civil War. And that’s what makes the questions it asks impossible to dismiss as simple, “mere” fantasy. This is one superhero series that only keeps getting more relevant, more pertinent, and more necessary. Beautiful review. Well written, thoroughly thought through, and your bias towards the MCU allows for some very astute analysis which evades the average reviewer.
I agree that it’s just shy of a perfect score (the tonal shift in the rather cartoony airport battle is what takes it down half a peg for myself), but it’s damn well near the closest thing we have to the perfect superhero movie. Looking forward to this.  The Civil War comics were an exciting premise that fell apart partway through, mainly due to a lot of out-of-character bits and heavy-handed moralizing that didn’t really fit the world.  It sounds like they’ve taken the core concept and done something different with it.  Also, the MCU appreciates consequences more than the 616 universe- trying to reset the status quo after something like this doesn’t work, and I’m hoping the future movies feel the impact of this one. Great review. I thoroughly enjoyed the film. I liked that the airport battle was ‘pulling punches’ because it gave the directors the chance to have the final showdown to have a lot more ‘edge’ to it. This only made the stakes and involvement and drama even greater. I was relieved that the film still felt that it was connected to Cap and did him proud. He is my favourite character in the films because of his nobility and goodness. This being wonderfully reminded in his stoic line ‘I can do this all day’ and the letter that he wrote to Tony. Only Cap would write a letter. Cue the MRA activists and Snyderites: “How much did Disney pay you for this article, MaryAnn?!” Seriously, though: this is an extraordinarily well-written review, and I’m beyond excited for this movie. Damn this review! I had just about convinced myself not to start with a film that is about to branch out into 17 other films over the coming years.  But no-o-o-o-o. You and many others I respect are all but forcing me to see it. And then I will be trapped, forced to travel into the Marvel Multiverse time and time again.  Thanks a lot!! Not quite as entertaining as Winter Solider, but significantly more interesting, rewatchable, and comicbookish.  As a fan of HK action flicks, I’ve always appreciated that the fight scenes in CA films are mostly martial arts based and less about explosions and special effects. There were a couple of moments when the quick cut, shaky cam was unintentionally disorienting and I lost of track of the relative positions of the fighters, but most of the choreography was on point and struck a nice balance between visceral realism and balletic fantasy – very difficult to pull off when so many people and powers are involved. Unlike, Avengers 2, the film balances a huge cast perfectly, giving each their moment to shine.  There was a brief stretch when it felt as if Black Widow was being a comforting BFF to several characters in a row which was slightly repetitive and out of character.  There’s a Scarlet Witch/Vision interaction that goes downhill bizarrely quickly, but they’re both weirdos so its understandable.  Other than that, motivations are clear and everyone has something unique to contribute.  As with the action choreography, the overarching conflicts are ultimately personal and human-sized rather than being about armies of robots, gods, and aliens trying to take over the world. More than any other recent big budget superhero movie, this is morally nuanced – that goes for the heroes as well as the “villains.”  It truly feels like a superhero comic brought to life – intricate, character-driven, melodramatic, unpredictable, unresolved, fanservicey in a good way.  This is about as close as it gets.  In order to improve further (and I hope they do) Marvel tentpole films will have to transcend their source material. I’m with you on the Spider Man reboot, though I was thoroughly (and unexpectedly) entertained by Mr. Holland’s performance and the young fanboy tone of this incarnation. I hope that if they do another Spider Man feature, they first develop him as a secondary character ala Hawkeye or War Machine, so that when that feature comes we can just hit the ground running without another origin story. I felt pummeled after this movie ended. Wasn’t a good kind of pummeled either. There’s a lot of wonderful highlights that you excellently pointed out in your review, but it didn’t gel together in my eyes.  For me, there’s too many characters that detract from the Steve/Tony/Bucky A-plot. Some of them are necessary because they serve as plot devices or a key part of the airport fight (very fun!), but getting sidetracked affects the pacing. And it feels incomplete, even with the two stingers during and after the credits roll. i enjoyed the movie on the whole, and really enjoyed it in some parts, appreciated the moral dilemma that steve and tony were in, but have to agree with the “too many characters” and how it gets distracting.  i was glad that the hulk and even thor were missing, and thought that would whittle stuff down a bit, but adding spiderman and ant man (not my favorite) got very distracting.  and sorry to say, i still find the fight scenes go on way too long. – Spoilers – Great review. Although some others in the comments might disagree, I didn’t think the film was overstuffed at all; thanks to the careful world-building in the MCU, these are all characters I care about and want to spend time with, and their little side-plots didn’t come across as distractions to me but as stories I could enjoy in their own right. Even more impressive was how much care the film took to introduce characters who could easily feel shoved-in — particularly T’Challah, who amazingly has his own hero’s arc and ends up being the one who recognizes the futility of vengeance and forswears it. Between his appearance here and the very promising new Black Panther comics being written by Ta-Nehisi Coates, he’s well on the way to becoming one of my new favorite characters. This is still very much Cap’s movie. What strikes me, now that I think of it, is how much Steve and Bucky’s friendship serves as the core of all the Cap films. True, they’re all thematically different, with First Avenger exploring the nature of patriotism, Winter Soldier contrasting old-school virtues with murkier modern political realities, and Civil War asking questions about power and accountability. But at the heart of all of them is the story of a guy trying to save, protect, and be true to his best friend. I think that’s pretty awesome. Also, I loved seeing this in a New York theater, where the audience cheered and applauded when Spidey says he’s from Queens and Cap says he’s from Brooklyn. Local boys made good! I very much enjoyed it. It’s definitely the second best CA movie (after Winter Soldier, which remains my favorite MCU movie), and probably the second best Avengers movie, even missing two key Avengers. But there are some, well I don’t want to say missteps, but definitely some missed opportunities in the script that keep it from greatness. The movie works best in the aspects that make it a direct sequel to Winter Soldier. The Civil War story arc was always kind of half-baked, even in the comics. Here, it’s basically inconsequential, at least in this film. Protecting Bucky is more than enough motivation for Steve Rogers to go against the Avengers, and he’ certainly have allies in that choice. Meanwhile, in yet another example of MCU writers not picking up plot threads left them by other MCU writers, Tony’s desire to keep the Avengers together can continue to stem frrom the vision Wanda gave him in Age of Ultron. No need to contrive some sort of guilt-based motivation for him. Alternatively, they could have chosen not to save Tony’s discovery as the big reveal at the end, setting up a natural, movie-long conflict. Meanwhile, and probably under the supervision of Kevin Feige and the Marvel suits, the script insisted on starting Steve and Tony on the wrong sides of the Sokovia Accords issue. Lawful Good Steve Rogers is the one who, initially, would see some oversight as valuable, especially given the havoc and death wrought when individual Avengers (himself included) have operated independently. (I’ll grant the MCU has tried to shift Steve into a more antiauthoritarian mode, but even in Winter Soldier, it turned out it was Hydra all along, so it doesn’t really fly.) Chaotic Good Tony on the other hand doesn’t like people telling him what to do. This set up would have yielded an even more compelling story: the situation changes drastically from here, putting both Steve and Tony into positions where they have to swap sides on the Accords issue, creating both internal and external conflict for both characters. The story also tries to hinge emotionally on the collapse of the friendship between Steve and Tony. This never works, because in the MCU, Steve and Tony were never friends. Steve doesn’t trust Tony’s arrogance and recklessness. Meanwhile, Steve represents the ideals and accomplishments of Tony’s father, against whom Tony is still rebelling. Which would have made the fight between against Steven and Bucky a chance for Tony to both avenge and excise his father’s ghost. Also, while it’s nice for Disney/Marvel that they have the rights to the character back, I’ve decided I just don’t like Spider-Man. He’s a non-factor in the plot, overpowered, and obnoxious more than charming. Also too, Marisa Tomei is a fine actress who deserves much more work, the entire concept of “hot aunt May” creeps me out. While Ross’s question about the locations of Thor and Banner is pointed one, the script missed the chance at a great dig at him, and a good inside joke: Thor of course is  pince of Asgard, and can’t be made beholden to anyone on Midgard, no matter how many countries sign a paper; and someone should have asked ol’ “Thunderbolt” Ross on how to find Bruce Banner, that being his life’s work for a time. So, I was wrong about Cap. This is kind of old, but if you haven’t read it, do so immediately: http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2013/10/steven-attewell-steve-rogers-isnt-just-any-hero
I still think they had to contrive a way to put Tony Stark on the authority side, and that having both characters switch sides would have been much more dramatic, and that there’s a general problem that Rogers and Stark were never friends. But I seem to have this image in my head-cannon of Captain America as a very, well, conservative hero. Which I think comes from a couple of things: 1) he was kind of that way when I was growing up in the ’70s and ’80s; 2) it says something about my relationship with the concept of “patriotic”. I might compare the ending of Kubo to the new Harry Potter play: If you live your life being told that you’re a certain type of person, do you try to live up to an idealized image,* or do you rebel against it? Maybe a little of both. I disagree, but there’s plenty of other baiting, too. I’m not sure it’s possible to be Harry Potter fan without creating your own head canon and shipper pairings, queer or otherwise. This isn’t about what a fan may imagine; it’s about the storyteller actually giving strong indications that a relationship (Albus and Scorpio’s) is queer — i.e. if they were different sexes, there would be no question that it’s a romantic bond — and then pulling a “no homo” at the end. That’s queerbaiting; gay relationships are always subtext, never text. And coming from Rowling — who outed Dumbledore off the page, but in whose entire textual Harry Potter universe there isn’t a single explicitly LGBT character — it comes across as yet another missed chance to make Harry Potter’s world as openly diverse and representative as she seems to want it to be. I hadn’t heard the term “queerbaiting” until now, and it strikes me as an odd phrase. It sounds a bit like Rowling is maliciously teasing her fans, as though she’s deliberately hinting at a queer relationship and then taking the possibility away. Our culture makes it very easy to take for granted that cisgender relationships are the norm. So I suspect that Rowling wrote the story as a straight romance and didn’t notice the blatant queer subtext, even though it was screamingly obvious to many of her fans. That’s a serious problem. An author writing in 2016 shouldn’t overlook the many LGBT people in the world. And it’s particularly sad that an author who’s as committed to diversity as Rowling keeps writing such uninclusive stories. (Her depiction of native peoples certainly deserves the criticism it’s received.) But the Vox article makes it sound as though she went out of her way to erase LGBT characters from the story, as though she thought, “These characters are coming across as gay. I’d better fix that before sales go down.” This is a missed opportunity, and a huge one, but never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity. I’d first heard the term “queerbaiting” with regard to The Legend of Korra, and how simultaneously joyous and flabbergasted the show’s fans were (me included) that a key relationship turned out NOT to be queerbaiting, but actual, confirmed queer representation. I didn’t interpret the Vox article as accusing Rowling and her collaborators of deliberate malice — merely of deeply ingrained heteronormative sensibilities and frustratingly willful naivete, after years of criticism and the culture’s increasingly sophisticated awareness of queer subtexts and lack of representation. But in any case, I think the term “queerbaiting” is a necessary description and critique of the act itself, regardless of the author’s intention. If she keeps writing such uninclusive stories, maybe we should rethink how committed to diversity we think she is. Or at least of how aware she is of how short she falls of her own professed ideals. It sucks, because Rowling’s instincts aren’t flat-out terrible. She clearly has heart and compassion, and deals with themes like friendship and longing and loss and parenthood with great sensitivity and powerful insight. Which makes it all the more screamingly frustrating to see how huge her blind spots are. It’s a testament to her that her fans CARE enough about her stories to be upset at their shortcomings. We love what she’s made. We want it to be better. I try to be forgiving of her blind spots, because I have so many of my own. (People on this site have helped make me more aware of them, for which I’m thankful.) I also try to remember that, during some of the worst culture wars in recent memory, gay marriage became legal in the U.S., so maybe progress is possible even with blind spots. I’m not condemning her as a person; I’m critiquing the work, and whatever attitudes she reveals through her work. It’s Harry Potter, it’s undeniably a huge influence on pop culture, it’s a story that millions worldwide pay attention to, and so it deserves scrutiny. And if it marginalizes or excludes a group of people, whether through malice or ignorance, it deserves to be called out for that. Absolutely nothing. Danielm80 compared it to the new HP play, so I thought I’d get in a dig about the HP play. Sorry for the thread derailment."
"Apr 29, 2016",POSITIVE," ★★★★☆Are you #TeamCap or #TeamIronMan? If this question makes any sense to you — indeed, if you have been torn asunder for weeks deciding whether to support Chris Evans’s Captain America or Robert Downey Jr’s Iron Man — then Captain America: Civil War and its superb action sequences will bring you untold joy. If, on the other hand, you are not a team player and have never worn superhero pyjamas, the movie is a trickier sell. It does, however, raise some significant moral conundrums. 1) Should superhero operations be overseen by the United Nations? And 2) Should superheroes take responsibility for collateral damage caused by their actions?"

"Apr 29, 2016",POSITIVE," ¿América o Chivas? ¿Lennon o McCartney? ¿Marvel o DC? Quién soy yo para otorgar una respuesta correcta, no soy un tirano que se aferra a un bando por completo, pero puedo observar cierta constante: la división parece presentarse como un elemento potenciador del entretenimiento. Inevitablemente, la segmentación me ha invadido como espectador y al ver la más reciente producción de los hermanos Russo (décima tercera entrega del Universo Cinematográfico Marvel) me resulta imposible no compararla con otras franquicias intentando competir con un monstruo. Dicho esto puedo atreverme a decir: nadie hace películas como Marvel. Lo que antes me resultaba excesivo, ahora puedo digerirlo y comprender que se está redefiniendo el lenguaje visual y narrativo. Con esto no quiero decir que esto sea correcto o que se esté realizando de modo impecable, si no que la única casa que muestra una creciente evolución y entendimiento de su mercado es aquella que aloja a grandes héroes como al Capitán América y Iron Man. De forma gradual, Marvel parece estar aprendiendo factores como el balance de apariciones de personajes en pantalla, el ritmo perfecto de secuencias de acción (puedo afirmar que esta película posee los mejores 20 minutos de batalla en la historia de los super héroes del celuloide) y sobre todo, el manejo de una marca con una perspectiva de mercado infinita. Si bien, el número de actores es elevado, de cierta forma el guión logra darle su debido peso y retribución a cada individuo. Espero que como sociedad consumidora del “Cine del Super Poder” hayamos llegado a una etapa de comprensión en la que tomar como canon un cómic o novela gráfica para llevarlo a la pantalla grande no significa que pueda realizarse al pie de la letra. Aunque, resulta engañoso utilizar el título “Civil War” y vender una película de los Vengadores más que de Steve Rodgers. Cuyo personaje principal parece perderse en la trama junto con su carisma y motivaciones un tanto melosas en contraposición a la problemática del cuadro en su totalidad. Lo anterior mencionado puede observarse bajo una lupa esquizofrénica, en la que ante una división tanto social como política, las posturas que defienden a las garantías individuales se ven opacádas por las reglas de superioridad impuestas por el estado, no sé, tal vez me equivoqué de ensayo. A final de cuentas, Marvel pone el ejemplo y entrega lo que consideraría una de las mejores piezas (con sus debidas tribulaciones) en su línea de tiempo hasta ahora. Invitándonos a comenzar a desprendernos del pasado y abrazar lo que está por venir a manos de elementos nuevos y brillantes, sin importar que se trate de un adolescente araña o un joven príncipe vestido de pantera."
"Apr 29, 2016",POSITIVE," Después de la batalla de Nueva York, la destrucción de Sokovia, los atentados en Lagos y otras numerosas catástrofes indirectamente causadas ​​por los Vengadores, el Consejo de Seguridad de Estados Unidos –comandado por el Secretario de Estado, Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt)– decide presentar el Acuerdo de Sokovia, un documento redactado por la ONU para ejercer control sobre los superhéroes y que éstos se apeguen a un marco legal donde el máximo organismo de seguridad será el encargado de decidir cuándo y cómo pueden intervenir los Vengadores en los conflictos armados. Mientras Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), cansado de la guerra, respalda el documento, Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) se opone a la medida. Esto provoca que el resto de los integrantes del grupo –incluyendo a Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), War Machine (Don Cheadle), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) y Vision (Paul Bettany)– decidan a quién unirse: ¿Iron Man o Capitán América? Mientras aumentan las tensiones al interior de los Vengadores, un misterioso exsoldado, Helmut Zemo (Daniel Brühl), busca desentrañar una red de secretos encubiertos durante la operación de 1991 asociados al Soldado de Invierno (Sebastian Stan). Si bien es cierto que los combates, las persecuciones y las explosiones tienen un lugar preponderante en este filme, existen guiños sutiles y básicos, poco profundos, pero sugestivos, respecto a la política internacional. Los hermanos Anthony y Joe Russo (Capitán América y el Soldado de Invierno, 2014) ponen sobre el terreno de juego un par de atractivas discusiones alrededor de cómo resolver los conflictos internacionales desde el contraste que existe entre el totalitarismo y el liberalismo. Los dos protagonistas del filme, tanto Iron Man como el Capitán América, se ven obligados a hacer una revisión de sus ideales con el objetivo de no perjudicar al grupo que han conformado. El multimillonario Tony Stark, que en el pasado era un entusiasta de las empresas privadas y prefería mantenerse alejado del gobierno, opta por el marco legal (aquel que ofrece las normas y condiciones determinantes para el actuar de los superhéroes). Por su parte, Steve Rogers –aquel soldado que fue creado por el gobierno de Estados Unidos durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial– prefiere la perspectiva histórica (aquella que mediante la observación y conocimiento de los sucesos históricos del pasado determina los modos de comportamiento de las sociedades actuales). Los directores navegan con mucho éxito por las convenciones del género de acción; las coreografías de los combates insertas en extensas persecuciones y frenéticas secuencias son acompañadas por el virtuosismo de los efectos visuales elaborados por el equipo que encabeza Ian Abbott (Ex Machina, 2015; Spectre, 2015). A pesar de la vocación, a veces exagerada, por parte de Marvel para esbozar personajes que sólo son motivados por la culpa, el sacrificio y la venganza, el filme posee ocurrentes pinceladas de humor ligero y enérgico encauzadas de manera irónica por Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) y de forma carismática por un joven Spider-Man (Tom Holland), cuya primera aparición en este universo es pertinente y notable. Además, los Russo se toman la libertad de recurrir a algunos elementos del thriller político y del relato de espías –que exploraron satisfactoriamente en el filme anterior de Capitán América– para crear una serie de pautas que rompen con el exacerbado despliegue de espectacularidad visual y otorgan instantes de intriga necesarios para el desarrollo del relato."
"Apr 29, 2016",POSITIVE,Civil War is one of the best Marvel movies and superhero movies overall. [Full review n Spanish]
"Apr 29, 2016",POSITIVE," At two points in Captain America: Civil War there's some unconvincing CGI. One is a rubber character model falling like a ragdoll and the other is some iffy greenscreen during a key scene. And that's it. That is literally the biggest criticism I can muster about Marvel's magnum opus. To call Cap 3 the best film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is to sell it short. It is borderline perfect, a thrilling, character-driven blockbuster that stands above the rest of the superhero genre, from classics like Superman: The Movie through genre stalwarts like Spider-Man 2, and even out-thrills The Avengers; it is second (or rather fourth) only to Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight Trilogy (and actually better if you view it from a purely comic book metric). After the mid-rangeMCU outings last year, and 2016 so far offering up the entertaining-but-formulaic Deadpool and the frankly disastrous film-that-shall-not-be-named, I was almost tempted to write off superheroes as something so financially important it had become artistically cumbersome. Instead, Civil War has exceeded all expectations and pushed the whole genre forward. Let's look at the ten biggest reasons why it's such a success."

"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL," Since then we’ve seen sequels, spin-offs and stand-alone stories, with Thor, Ant-Man and Captain America helping the studio amass a box office tally in the billions. But the Captain’s third outing, following 2014’s terrific Winter Soldier, turns out to be one of Marvel’s rare missteps, lacking the joy, excitement and sense of anything being possible that’s always been the studio’s hallmark. And it really isn’t overstating things to say that this lumbering great bore is even less enjoyable than this month’s other superhero stinker, Batman v Superman. In a plot that becomes more and more complicated – and less and less interesting – we catch up with Captain America (Chris Evans) and the rest of the Avengers superheroes attempting to retrieve a bioweapon from terrorists in Central Africa. But joining forces with fellow rebels Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Falcon (Anthony Mackie) puts him on a collision course with those happy to come under UN control. These include Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), War Machine (Don Cheadle), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and the red-skinned android Vision (Paul Bettany). Things become more complicated with the reappearance of the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) who seems to be behind a terrorist attack and then there’s the shadowy Zemo (Daniel Bruhl) pulling all kinds of nasty levers in the background. Despite its electrifying opening on the streets of Lagos, the action takes an extended break for the next hour and a half as we’re weighed down by dull political machinations and a dour battle of wills between Cap and Iron Man. It’s not until way past the halfway mark that the film recaptures your attention, with a terrific superhero battle at an airport."

Com: Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Don Cheadle, Paul Bettany, Chadwick Boseman, Anthony Mackie, Jeremy Renner, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Rudd, Tom Holland, Marisa Tomei, Emily VanCamp, Daniel Brühl, William Hurt, Martin Freeman, John Kani, John Slattery, Alfre Woodard, Jim Rash, Hope Davis. Entre hangares e aviões, uma dúzia de indivíduos dotados de superpoderes avançam uns contra os outros. Golpes potentes são disparados, objetos são arremessados apenas com o uso de gestos, combatentes voadores se engalfinham no ar e destroços acabam espalhados por todos os lados. Por si só, a ideia de super-heróis se enfrentando numa batalha desesperada já desperta interesse, obviamente, mas o que torna esta sequência – presente em Capitão América: Guerra Civil – tão impactante e dramática é o fato de compreendermos as motivações dos personagens envolvidos e nos preocuparmos com estes. Sem isto, o embate central do longa seria mera pirotecnia. Claro que, para compreender completamente o que leva cada um a estar ali, é preciso assistir a uma penca de filmes produzidos pela Marvel ao longo dos últimos dez anos – a maioria deles eficiente, mas longe de alcançar o brilhantismo. Sim, o primeiro Homem de Ferro seguia como o melhor do grupo, ao passo que o terceiro apresentava-se como o pior, mas entre estes a qualidade artística se mantinha estável no nível “ok, gostei, mas não creio que um dia sentirei o impulso irresistível de revê-los” (estou falando de Homem de Ferro 2, Thor, Thor 2, Os Vingadores, Os Vingadores: Era de Ultron, Homem-Formiga, Capitão América: O Primeiro Vingador e Capitão América: O Soldado Invernal). Ainda assim, ao ver Guerra Civil, fiquei grato por ter acompanhado os capítulos anteriores, já que isto permitiu que, ao reencontrar aqueles personagens atirados uns contra os outros, suas reações ressoassem com mais vigor graças a tudo que viera antes, conferindo maior peso à narrativa. Ao mesmo tempo, este trabalho dirigido pelos irmãos Anthony e Joe Russo e roteirizado por Christopher Markus e Stephen McFeely jamais esquece que é, afinal de contas, uma fantasia protagonizada por seres essencialmente mágicos (imaginem se os poderes de Harry Potter viessem não de sua varinha, mas da picada de uma aranha radioativa) – e, assim, mesmo com toda a seriedade de sua trama, o longa jamais abandona uma certa (e importante) leveza mais do que apropriada a uma história envolvendo indivíduos que se vestem com uniformes coloridos e trocam piadinhas em meio a lutas sangrentas. Neste sentido, os irmãos Russo compreendem algo que aparentemente escapou a Zack Snyder em seu Batman vs Superman: ser “sério” não significa não ter vida. Com isso, percebemos e sentimos a dor de Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) e da Feiticeira Escarlate (Olsen) sem que seja necessário que a fotografia invista num filtro cinza que remova praticamente todas as cores durante toda a projeção. (Aqui cabe uma observação, já que apenas recentemente descobri haver uma rivalidade imensa entre fãs da DC e da Marvel: como não tenho o hábito de ler HQs, não faço qualquer distinção entre os dois universos em termos de preferência pessoal – e elogiei fartamente a trilogia comandada por Christopher Nolan, por exemplo. Assim sendo, deixem de lado quaisquer teorias de conspiração; podem me chamar de “o isentão dos filmes de super-heróis”.) Adotando o senso de humor de maneira bem mais eficaz do que em Os Vingadores, que investia insistentemente em piadinhas bobas em momentos nos quais deveria estar focado em outras prioridades narrativas, Guerra Civil emprega o humor de forma pontual e precisa, usando as tiradas de forma orgânica, provocando um riso que funciona como alívio cômico em vez de como motor da trama e seguindo em frente sem sacrificar a seriedade da história. Além disso, o filme tampouco força a mão ao tentar comunicar elementos mais dramáticos, realizando a tarefa visualmente e de forma sutil, por exemplo, ao ilustrar a tentativa de Visão (Bettany) de se ajustar a uma existência mais humana ao vestir pulôveres cinza-azulados que soam absurdos em seu corpo colorido ou ao trazer Stark sentado a certa distância da mesa na qual os Vingadores se reúnem para ouvir o parecer do Secretário de Estado Thaddeus Ross (Hurt), demonstrando, com isso, a típica natureza rebelde que irá se contrapor à sua decisão de submeter o grupo ao controle da ONU. Para completar, em diversos instantes a obra descarta qualquer diálogo para pontuar a decepção ou a apreensão de um personagem com relação às atitudes de outro, optando, em vez disso, por tentar apresentá-las através dos olhares e da expressão corporal do elenco competente. Neste aspecto, vale apontar, cada intérprete acaba ganhando a oportunidade de desenvolver aspectos interessantes da personalidade do herói que vive: Chris Evans, por exemplo, ilustra o apego emocional do Capitão América a Bucky/Soldado Invernal (Stan), que se torna ainda maior por este ser o último remanescente de sua época original. Da mesma forma, esta amizade obviamente acaba por cegá-lo para outros fatos que deveriam ser considerados antes de qualquer atitude impensada, o que o leva a adotar uma postura arrogante – e, sim, autoritária – que torna o autocontrole de Stark ainda mais surpreendente. Robert Downey Jr., por sinal, finalmente volta a ter a oportunidade de demonstrar sua versatilidade como ator depois de passar a última década preso aos maneirismos de Stark – e, aqui, ele consegue evocar muitíssimo bem as dúvidas do bilionário e principalmente sua dor em um momento-chave da projeção. Por outro lado, Scarlett Johansson se destaca pela fisicalidade da Viúva Negra, que, ao seu próprio modo, se estabelece como – e me perdoem a expressão, mas não há outra mais apropriada – a mais foda entre todos, já que, mesmo sem qualquer superpoder, jamais se submete ao papel de “mocinha em perigo”, enfrentando os inimigos com a mesma segurança que o Superman teria ao confrontar batedores de carteira. (“Como você se atreve a fazer uma comparação usando personagens de universos diferentes?!?!” Shhh, acalme-se: já falei que sou isentão.) (Se você estiver lendo este texto em 2030 e não compreender o que quero dizer com “isentão”, uma rápida explicação: no surreal período de 2015-2016, este termo passou a ser usado para se referir pejorativamente a qualquer pessoa racional que tente ponderar os fatos em vez de se entregar a discursos baseados em agressividade e subjetividade.) Mas, claro, Stark, Capitão América e Viúva Negra são apenas três dos vários personagens presentes em Guerra Civil e, assim, em vez de analisar um por um, prefiro destacar mais três deles: o Pantera Negra, que é encarnado por Chadwick Boseman com uma formalidade mais do que apropriada que o posiciona como o mais sério e “adulto” dos heróis; o Homem-Aranha de Tom Holland, cujo espírito apropriadamente juvenil rivaliza apenas com sua empolgação diante do novo mundo que descobre graças aos seus poderes (e que já prometem torná-lo a melhor versão cinematográfica de Peter Parker); e, finalmente, o Homem-Formiga, que, graças ao timing cômico de Paul Rudd, praticamente rouba todas as cenas das quais participa. Impecável também na condução das sequências de ação, Guerra Civil demonstra uma clara evolução por parte dos irmãos Russo, que coreografam bem a longa perseguição envolvendo carros e motos no segundo ato, o confronto que discuti no início deste texto (e durante a qual sempre compreendemos como cada superpoder é empregado em conjunção ou em resposta aos demais) e, principalmente, a luta que ocorre no clímax e que, além de brutal, encontra tempo para enfocar as reações emocionais dos três homens envolvidos. (Em contrapartida, se tropeçaram com a ponta desnecessária de Danny Pudi em Soldado Invernal, desta vez a ponte com Community - da qual participaram como diretores de alguns episódios – é feita através da ponta também desnecessária de Jim Rash.) Dramaticamente complexo ao criar conflitos nos quais todos agem por motivos nobres e que jamais facilitam o posicionamento do espectador através de alguma revelação que dê mais razão a este ou aquele personagem, Guerra Civil é memorável justamente ao demonstrar que, muitas vezes, não há um lado “certo” ou “errado” em uma guerra, apenas visões diferentes que deveriam ter sido conciliadas através do diálogo em vez de apelar para confrontos que só trarão mais dores e complicarão tudo (e, neste aspecto, é fascinante que até mesmo a motivação do vilão vivido por Daniel Brühl seja compreensível – e, para mim, a mais dolorosa). Certamente se estabelecendo como o melhor entre todos os longas produzidos pela Marvel até agora, Capitão América: Guerra Civil é divertido sem ser inconsequente, sério a respeito de seus temas sem ser artificialmente sombrio e – não menos importante - um belo espetáculo de ação sem jamais sacrificar o desenvolvimento de seus personagens."
"Apr 28, 2016",NEUTRAL," Captain America makes this defiant grumble in the 24th issue of his solo comic book run, the second of The Drums of War trilogy that addressed the Marvel universe crossover event Civil War. The issue saw Cap, Iron Man and respectively cordoned-off cells of the Avengers come to loggerheads over legislation forcing them to turn their identities over to the government. Cap’s statement in the midst of the battle was as much a pledge by the freedom fighter not to falter in his own hero duties as it was for writer Ed Brubaker, who had worked with collaborators since November 2004 to bring Steve Rogers’ world of espionage to life in meticulous style. Even if this company-mandated stunt had their wing-capped Avenger at its centre, they would make him pull an all-nighter to keep to the course they had been laying out for months. Fast-forward 12 years to Marvel Studios’ cinematic adaptation of the storyline, Captain America: Civil War, and we have no such luck. It might begin as Joe and Anthony Russo’s continuation of the conspiracy thriller antics they enacted in 2014’s The Winter Soldier, but the directors eventually steer their Chris Evans-played Steve Rogers off course and into a bramble of past and future plotlines. The resulting film is wracked by as much of an identity crisis as a certain other recent superhero brawl, however fitfully enjoyable. The first hour is mostly dedicated to the mystery of the various enemy attacks that have the Avengers shackled to United Nations-approved oversight, with the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) framed for a deadly explosion that destroys a UN peacekeeping council and Rogers having to track him down with the help of the Falcon (Anthony Mackie). Subtitles and country names flash onscreen in blunt style, while action sequences, like an opening sting operation in Nigeria, are shot at a high shutter speed. They carry the air of a dull 24 episode long before a torture sequence involving an overflowing sink and Daniel Brühl’s remarkably non-superpowered antagonist Helmut Zemo enters the picture. The arrival of the big, trailer-teased airport fight brings the film alive with the same sitcom-y quips and inventive set-piecing that powered both Avengers instalments, but it throws a wrench in the works of what came before—the very thing that set Cap’s adventures apart from his allies. The denouement introduces psychological thriller trappings and pays off clumsy establishing scenes from earlier (a 1991 flashback prologue, an MIT presentation where Tony Stark revisits the last time he saw his parents), which has effect of both delighting through clever scenarios and frustrating through the discordant way it’s presented. It’s doubly frustrating since the script, credited again to Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, hasn’t lost any of their panache, with smart characterisation and a metric tonne of witty dialogue flowing through the perfunctory aesthetic of dim hues. The vastly expanded cast, which now includes the roster of heroes introduced in last year’s The Avengers: Age of Ultron, are as well-served as they’ve ever been; which is to say that Robert Downey jr’s Iron Man is as charming/irritating as you remember, Evans as taciturn, Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow as ice cold, and Jeremy Renner’s Hawkeye just as cocky. (Chris Hemsworth’s Thor and Mark Ruffalo’s Hulk are smartly relegated to next year’s Thor sequel).1 Paul Bettany’s Vision and Elizabeth Olsen’s Scarlet Witch make the jump from Ultron without over-stacking the deck, generating warmth around the latter’s house arrest and teasing an oddball romance, and Don Cheadle’s War Machine fares well, even when he lands on the wrong end of an especially-painful scuffle between Steve and Tony. Not so lucky in returning is William Hurt, who heads the legislation as a nerfed iteration of his military general character from The Incredible Hulk; worse-off still is Emily VanCamp’s Agent 13, who continues to be a baffling addition to the Captain series with barely five minutes of screentime.2 Of the new arrivals, the most impressive is undoubtedly Chadwick Boseman’s Black Panther, who puts a face to the international diplomacy that Cap and his friends are jeopardising and lends credence to the push-pull debate even as it slowly turns into raw psychological conflict. Meanwhile, hyphenated insect fighters Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and Spider-Man (Tom Holland) are dropped into the ensemble as goofy-but-effective stocking fillers, and while Rudd has the same bright charms that saw his frenetic 2015 debut scrape by, Holland is positively luminous in his first ever appearance as both Parker and the web-slinger — his twenty-or-so minutes of screentime are a hilarious treat.3 Even as the story couching them severely chops and changes tone—Rudd, in particular, comes to embody the giant tonal tipping point that people initially feared with this enterprise—the dynamics of their conversations are, in and of themselves, pitched perfectly, which is the one thing that these Marvel Studios can be counted on to do well. Many have called out these isolated character interactions in their praise of the movie, but what fixating on them misses is how incoherent the wider picture is, and how needless they make it in an era where YouTube will host character-specific highlight reels in six months. It’s a maddening experience, see-sawing between relishing the interplay of that gargantuan cast and lamenting the lack of a throughline, especially considering this has the studio’s best-staged action set pieces (muddying digital aesthetic notwithstanding) and the most interesting antagonist yet—however steeped in franchise lore his reveal is. The result of this absence of connective tissue or summative satisfaction is that it all feels shudderingly hollow; a stack of briefs filled to a fault by a pair of journeyman directors. Even roundly-denigrated MCU efforts have a more consistent MO—Thor: The Dark World and The Incredible Hulk only try to be fun romps, for instance, and whatever stick Age of Ultron might get in some circles, it remains both a distinctly Joss Whedon affair and a story that requires only the first Avengers as set-up. Civil War requires the first two Captains, Ultron, Iron Man 3 and more to hang together, which is not so hard to follow when Wikipedia can catch you up but is hard to enjoy when it’s a symptom of a film thematically and tonally stretched in too many directions. Captain America: Civil War doesn’t quite warrant calls for a collapse of the “superhero economy”, because Kevin Feige and co are just as capable of delivering on auteur-like talent as they are of chasing it away, and even if they weren’t, there’d be another factory-line fad ready to take its place once people were bored (probably also funded by Disney). It’s simply a bum note in a business output that attracts some great talent, especially when considering that this is the last installment in Cap’s own saga for the foreseeable future. What Joe Johnston started with such distinctive fun and fervour in 2011’s The First Avenger is a distant memory, and thanks to forces out of his control, the Man Out of Time’s solo tour of duty has been put to an unfocused, disappointing end. In first drafting this sentence, I was surprised to realise that I hadn’t put Evans’ name first. I’ll leave it and the telling irony alone. This is a particularly sore point considering how heavily the character factors into the Drums of War miniseries in the comics. Sure, she goes on to be manipulated and traumatised in a fashion that’s shockingly typical for female mainstays, but it’s at least more significant than the vague helper/love interest role she has here. I suspect the real reason for Spidey’s inclusion is to steady the inertia of the second reboot scheduled for next year, with a younger Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) appearing likewise."
"Apr 28, 2016",POSITIVE," Something remarkable takes place in Captain America: Civil War. Or rather, it doesn't. For this is a superhero movie in which not a single building falls. Not one. No skyscrapers tumble, no factories collapse, not even a tiny workman's shed lists slightly to one side and crushes some petunias. In a cinematic world now so inured to (and bored by) the sight of 9/11-esque dust clouds chasing hapless citizens through crumbling streets, Civil War doesn't just eschew this trend, it centres its entire story on the consequences of those kind of destructive nightmares. That's not to say there isn't any action. Quite the opposite. Civil War features some of the most exhilarating chase sequences and fight scenes in recent memory, choreographed with a balletic-like precision in which the emphasis is on small, considered flourishes rather than sheer brute force. Every punch, block, shot, weave and parry has been painstakingly conceived to reflect the personalities of each character involved. We see Cap (Chris Evans) bouncing his shield off walls like Ronnie O'Sullivan on a 147 break; Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr) dispatching villains with scientific swagger; and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) trapping explosions instead of creating them. It's exactly the opposite of the kind of 'mindless violence' of which superhero flicks are so often accused, and it's as refreshing as it is electrifying. The other key feature of Captain America: Civil War is its story, in part because it actually has one. There's no fighting for fighting's sake here. Indeed most of the action is driven by a determination to stop the violence. As with its previous instalment The Winter Soldier, this is a film about oversight and accountability – acknowledging the terrifying (and unchecked) power of the Avengers, then seeking to control, regulate and restrict it by way of a UN accord. The world knows it owes an unpayable debt to these heroes, but collateral damage and civilian casualties can only be excused for so long.Here lies the conflict at the heart of the so-called civil war. Self-determination versus oversight. Freedom versus control. Team Cap versus Team Iron Man. It's a compelling and plausible fissure along which the line in the sand is drawn. And as with any great story, neither side is entirely in the right. Marvel, to its credit, knows its tone better than perhaps any other franchise, and here again we find its signature combination of edge-of-the-seat action and laugh out loud comedy. The performances teem with an emotional complexity rarely found in blockbusters, and the new character additions – whether they be previous Marvel Universe ring-ins like Spidey (Tom Holland) and Ant Man (Paul Rudd), or totally fresh inclusions like the outstanding Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) – ensure that no single actor commands too much screen time. Plot driven, fast-paced and terrifically funny, Captain America: Civil War is an outstanding film and the most fun you'll likely have in the cinema this year."

"Apr 28, 2016",POSITIVE," The Marvel Cinema Universe™ juggernaut rolls on in this 147-minute playground game of Who Would Win in a Fight Between…? The story parallels Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice, from the rival Warners/DC stable of superheroes. Again, a villain reasons he can’t beat the superheroes he hates but that they can beat each other and pulls strings (some very clever) to arrange what boils down to Iron Man v Captain America. Marvel have established these takes on their flagship (indeed, flag-draped) characters in earlier Iron Man, Captain America and Avengers movies. Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr now inhabit their roles so well there’s little need to rehash too much backstory (William Hurt’s Thaddeus Ross, unseen since The Incredible Hulk, hosts a highlights reel of super-scuffle carnage) before getting down to business. In theory, DC has an edge over Marvel in that their big heroes crossed over into mass popular culture in the 1940s and are recognisable to audiences who can’t distinguish Cap’s armoured black ally (Anthony Mackie as the Falcon) from Iron Man’s armoured black ally (Don Cheadle as War Machine) or the colour-coded hot fighting chick on Steve Rogers’ side (Elizabeth Olsen as Scarlet Witch) from the colour-coded hot fighting chick on Tony Stark’s side (Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow). It’s not much of an achievement that co-directors Anthony and Joe Russo (held over from Captain America the Winter Soldier) make a better film than Zack Snyder… but it’s worth noting that Marvel (corporation as auteur) have nurtured their characters (even in weaker films like Iron Man 2) to the point when they carry more screen weight than lasting icons Batman and Superman. However, repetition sets in and the escalation of set pieces reaches some sort of a peak here: there are good-to-great action, chase and fight scenes (Bryan Singer’s X-Men films still have an edge on depicting superpowers) but there’s also a limit to the number of times people can be kicked through walls before the scraps start to feel samey. There are two big choreographed face-offs: a mid-film battle on a German airport runway with 12 differently-aligned combatants, and a climactic, more intimate (and genuinely painful) struggle which is more about character than gimmicks. Comics writer Mark Millar’s Civil War storyline is only lightly referenced by screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. Millar’s US Superpowers Registration Act is dropped in favour of the United Nations’ ‘Sokovia Accords’ that the real-life US (which doesn’t recognise the International Court of Justice, for instance) would never sign. Rather than debate individual responsibility, gun control, American domestic and foreign policy and civil disobedience (as Millar did), it all comes down to Cap doing everything he can to help his incredibly guilty-seeming best friend. Building a plot around this issue means there’s an odd absence from this particular Captain America movie. Millar’s story is all about America, but this isn’t – most of it takes place outside the United States. The idea – inherent in the very concept of Captain America – that superheroes represent an American solution to problems that the rest of the world would find hard to live with is downplayed. Timeouts allow for updates on simmering sub-plots like the developing relationship between Vision and Scarlet Witch (Paul Bettany and Elizabeth Olsen get more to do than in Avengers Age of Ultron) and the literally expanding powers of Ant-Man (Paul Rudd, a bit subdued). Other characters are brought on and primed for spin-offs: Tom Holland’s Spider-Man, the second big-screen reboot of Spidey this century, impresses in a chattery cameo; Chadwick Boseman’s Black Panther (a black character who isn’t primarily someone’s second best friend) is fluid in action and stiff out of costume in a potentially interesting way. A persistent MCU problem is a lack of first-rank villains. Crossbones (Frank Grillo), one of the franchise’s few double-dyed bastards, gets an early look-in but is benched in favour of Zemo (Daniel Brühl) – who’s a typical MCU baddie in that he’s more grounded than his comic-book equivalent but considerably less interesting."
"Apr 28, 2016",POSITIVE,"Civil War, for all of its fanboy shout-outs, continues The Winter Soldier's sense of mystery and intrigue, using the shady shenanigans to drive action sequences that rarely feel forced."
"Apr 28, 2016",NEGATIVE,"The political allegories are mostly abandoned and swapped for character motivation, as if we should never have bothered to contemplate a second meaning in the first place."
"Apr 28, 2016",POSITIVE," Los daños colaterales de toda acción superheroica, encarnados en sucesivos balances de indeseadas bajas civiles, han sido un tema recurrente en las historietas del género desde que este entró en una fase autorreflexiva –a veces irreverente, a veces respetuosa con el canon- a partir de la década de los 80 del pasado siglo. En 2006, la Marvel levantó uno de sus acontecimientos editoriales totalizadores a partir de esa idea con la serie limitada Civil War, con guion de Mark Millar y dibujo de Steve McNiven: siete comic books de protagonismo colectivo, cuyo relato iba a afectar a todas las series en curso. La serie planteaba el dilema político de seguir perpetuando la figura del justiciero por cuenta propia o reglamentar al sector en una suerte de funcionariado bajo estricto control gubernamental. El resultado fue una espectacular superproducción dibujada, trufada de incesantes guiños para iniciados, en la que el guionista Millar jugaba con toda una mitología heredada, como un niño hooligan con un surtido repertorio de muñecos articulados, de los que, al final, acababa rompiendo pocos (Millar, por si alguien lo dudaba, no es Alan Moore). Las películas Marvel mantienen una singular relación con las historietas en las que se inspiran: no las adaptan obsesivamente, sino que más bien se diría que las sueñan, reflejando los momentos clave de esa mitología, pero de otra manera. A menudo parecen soñadas por ejecutivos. En otros casos, por aficionados a los que se ha concedido acceso al tren eléctrico más caro del mundo. Nunca soñadas por locos, visionarios o poetas, lo que no es del todo malo si el resultado son revisiones tan bien musculadas como este Capitán América: Civil War, donde los hermanos Anthony y Joe Russo y los guionistas Christopher Markus y Stephen McFeely se empeñan en recordar únicamente que Civil War era esa serie donde Iron Man y el Capitán América se enfrentaban propiciando un cisma superheroico. Capitán América: Civil War mezcla esa fractura en el Universo Marvel con sendas prolongaciones narrativas de Capitán América: el soldado de invierno (2014) y Los Vengadores: la era de Ultrón (2015), sustituyendo el subtexto político por lo emocional. Un ocurrente y falso flash-back de Tony Stark, la introducción y reformulación de Spiderman y la brillante escena del combate en el aeropuerto son los picos sorpresivos de esta película, cuyo dilatado metraje no pesa, mientras los detalles de caracterización refuerzan los lazos de complicidad con los aficionados."
"Apr 28, 2016",POSITIVE,"A mix of genres that appeals not just to comic book fans, but also to a broader audience looking for stories full of emotion and intrigue that are able to hold their own. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Apr 28, 2016",POSITIVE," This rousing instalment from the Marvel universe shares self-evident similarities with Batman vs Superman, the latest effort from their DC rivals. In both films we see superheroes at loggerheads, and in each case it's because they find themselves in a changing world where it's no longer acceptable for super-beings to roam around the planet leaving massive swathes of collateral damage in their wake. But what this latest Captain America has, which the DC flick sorely lacks, is – despite episodes of incredible violence and emotional anguish – exuberance, exhilaration, humour and even joy. It's 150 minutes long, but leaves you thirsting for more. Like the previous Captain America outing, The Winter Soldier, this was directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, and they've done a superb job of marshalling a horde of Avengers characters while keeping a coherent grip on the narrative. The fuse for the action is lit in a thunderous sequence where the Captain (Chris Evans) and his team are trying to prevent heavily-armed terrorists from stealing a germ warfare agent from a laboratory in Lagos, Nigeria. A huge explosion rips the building apart, and instead of virtuous defenders of humanity, the Avengers are suddenly cast as reckless instigators of massed civilian casualties (above, Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow with Emily VanCamp, Anthony Mackie and Chris Evans). The full weight of governmental officialdom descends upon them in the august personage of Secretary of State General Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt). He tells them it's the end of the line for old the romp-and-stomp, shake-and-bake Avengers. Their operations must be brought under UN oversight, via an authentically bureaucratic-sounding international agreement called the Sokovia Accord (after an earlier catrastrophic incident in Sokovia – see Avengers: Age of Ultron for further details). Captain America flatly refuses to countenance the Avengers having their hands tied in this way, but a chastened Tony ""Iron Man"" Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) agrees that their wings must be clipped for their own good. Thus the lines are drawn and the Avengers split into two camps, but against this broad backdrop there are numerous subplots and personal stories being played out. Chief among them is Captain America's relationship with Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), his childhood buddy and former World War Two comrade, yet now the brainwashed Winter Soldier reponsible for countless assassinations and heinous black ops. But there are signs that traces of the real Bucky still remain (just as long as nobody triggers his killer programming by reciting the Manchurian Candidate-style code words), and since he's the Captain's last tenuous link with the 1940s world he used to know, he's desperate not to give up on him (below, Iron Man tends to a crashed War Machine).It all comes to a head in a climax of fist-clenching tension, where Tony Stark's tortured memories of his dead parents run slap into the Captain's impossible dream that you can wash away the bad and just keep the parts you like. There's a sudden surge of poignancy, too, when the Captain is forced to reassess his past with Peggy Carter. Behind the scenes, the Avengers' internecine struggle is stoked by the mysterious Zemo (Daniel Brühl), another legacy of the Sokovia affair. His cause is convincing because it's rooted in plausible human emotions, rather than cliched cackling megalomania. Even if none of this other stuff was going on, it would be worth turning up just for the climactic clash between the opposed Avengers squads at an airfield in Germany. It's a riot of special-effects choreography and deft character interplay, the Russos somehow managing to give every Avenger sparks of individual identity among the outlandish combat manoeuvres. Much mirth is extracted from the addition of a very young Spiderman (Tom Holland). Having initially protested that he had too much school homework to join Iron Man's team, when he finds himself hand-to-hand with the likes of Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) or Falcon (Anthony Mackie), he subsides into fan-boy exclamations of how cool it all is. There's also a surprise star turn from Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), who does an outsized party piece (""Okay, tiny dude is huge now,"" reports Don Cheadle's War Machine). I would suggest changing the last line there, the one referencing War Machine's quote, as it may be considered a pretty big spoiler for a lot of readers."
"Apr 28, 2016",POSITIVE," After a mission goes horribly wrong, the Avengers are confronted with a new resolution signed by most of the world's countries that would put them at the control of the United Nations. With Captain America and Iron Man already on opposite sides as to whether to go along with the will of the UN or not, tensions reach a boiling point with the return of the Winter Soldier: a dangerous killer and Cap's oldest friend.  It's hard not to compare Captain America: Civil War with Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice, both because of the fact that the two feature similar themes and that they both revolve around a showdown between their respective universe's biggest heroes, battling it out for the soul of (super)heroism. They're also both nearly two-and-a-half hours long and are the linchpins on which a great many other sequels and spin-offs revolve.  Here's the thing, though, even mentioning the two films in the same sentence seems like a hideous insult to Marvel's latest – and best – film because, while Batman V Superman was a flat-out terrible movie that fundamentally betrayed everything great about the iconic heroes at its center, Civil War is a masterclass in blockbuster filmmaking that uses the “shared universe” of Marvel Studio's dozen-odd films and at least as many characters to create a truly compelling character-driven narrative that is as organic as it is nuanced as it is believable.  Based very, very loosely off Mark Millar and Steve McNiven's comic book of the same name (with more from Ed Brubaker's Captain America run thrown in for good measure), Civil War eschews much of the Marvel formula – when not brilliantly undermining it outright – by turning its attention to weightier and more intimate matters as our heroes come to blows over their roles as, well, superheroes. Brilliantly, the fact that superheroes don't exist in the real world doesn't actually change both the intellectual and emotional heft of the film's central conflict.  I mentioned in my review of the first Avengers film that all of that film's action and fantastical plot machinations was basically just a front for writer/ director Joss Whedon to explore the character dynamics between a group of widely disparate individuals. Civil War takes a similar approach but on a much larger scale. By this point we know these characters inside and out and the Russo brothers, working off a sharp, witty script by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, use this to their advantage to tell an allegorical tale about the use of power to make the world a batter place (a phrase that echoes throughout the film), while further exploring these characters and the dynamics between them. Unlike the Distinguished Competition, though, all of this is done in the most entertaining way possible, with some beautifully choreographed (if a wee bit too Paul Greengrass-y for my tastes) action scenes, wonderful character beats, the obligatory Stan Lee cameo and – though this is easily the most serious Marvel movie to date – sprinklings of laugh-out-loud humour. It also largely refrains from having the various character interactions devolve into boring speechifying by keeping the focus squarely on the characters and their relationships, both old (Steve and Tony, Clint and Natasha) and new (Wanda Maximoff and the Vision) - to the point that it's not even surprising that Steve Rogers and Tony Stark fall on the sides that they do, even though on paper it seems like their positions should be reversed.  Speaking of characters, another minor miracle that the film manages to seemingly so easily pull off is the way it balances its dozens of major characters. By keeping the focus squarely on Steve and Tony (there's a reason why the words “Captain America” appear before the colon in the film's title, after all), the Russo's are free to weave the existing Avengers (minus Thor and Hulk), along with “new” heroes like Black Panther, Ant Man and a certain web-slinger, into a story where everyone gets a chance to shine, no matter how large or small their screen-time. It also keeps the film's antagonists, primarily General Ross (William Hurt) - making his first appearance in the MCU since the Incredible Hulk - and Baron Zemo (Daniel Bruhl) as agents of chaos and reflections of the heroes themselves, rather than your typical mustache-twirling baddies, which, once again, ensures that most of the attention remains on the characters that really matter.  Captain America: Civil War is, on the one hand, simply yet another tremendously successful instalment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (at this point do I even need to mention how wonderful this cast is or how perfect they are in these roles?) but it's also a major step forward in terms of sophistication, ambition and mold-breaking that stands, quite possibly, as the greatest superhero film to date. And, with the Russos at the helm of the upcoming Avengers movies, despite my lifelong status as a DC Comics fan, it's impossible not sign off in the proud tradition of Marvel Comics' letter hacks: Make Mine Marvel!"

Captain America: Civil War is proof that the best superhero films are those with relatable crises. Grief, anguish, revenge. All of these, when rendered onto the canvas of a well-rounded character, are so much more potent than the sight of a city crashing into another city or a looming CGI spaceship drawing ever nearer to its fatal destination. I’m referring, of course, to what bad superhero films do. They often nail the aesthetic, but don’t bother filling in the details with plot, character development and heart. But when Marvel movies in particular are done right (I’m thinking the first Avengers, Winter Soldier and Guardians of the Galaxy in particular), they’re gut-burstingly wonderful. They make you remember why you loved heroes in the first place. That’s why Captain America (Chris Evans, a man so handsome he’s all over my dreams right now) is such a great character in the Marvel cinematic universe. He’s basically indestructible, sure, but the poor guy has seen so much loss. He’s incredibly human, as are all the cast of Civil War — even the bad guys. Civil War picks up with the current iteration of the Avengers hunting down Crossbones, one of the bad guys from Winter Soldier. There’s some hefty collateral damage, and in response, the world lays down a treaty of sorts: sign up as what amounts to a sanctioned military wing of the UN or retire. This happens at the exact time that Cap’s old war buddy, The Winter Soldier, resurfaces under less than ideal circumstances. Things get very complicated very fast, before spiraling completely out of control in what makes for over two hours of superbly paced, heartbreaking and compelling viewing. This is an opera of titanic proportions. Each fight is laden with backstory and undercurrents and motives; everyone is throwing themselves into the fray for a very personal reason. This means that when the film does plunge headfirst into action and spectacle, they’ve earned it. They’ve put in the hard work, which means everyone in the cinema is personally invested in every blow traded, every barbed quip exchanged. Incidentally, this is the exact opposite of Zack Snyder’s latest cinematic prolapse, Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice, in which completely bungled, two-dimensional heroes make a litany of completely logic-free choices while joylessly pounding the crap out of each other. Their problems are utterly hollow, and their reasoning is devoid of even the slightest hint of thought. Batman and Superman are basically just action figures being smashed against each other by a brat with too much money. Whats more, I would argue that the entire premise of Civil War works better in movie format than it ever did in the comics. In the title-spanning Civil War event, Marvel basically threw freedom (Captain America) against restraint (Iron Man), with crushing results. Hundreds of heroes and villains butted heads, every Marvel title was affected (to get the whole story you had to suddenly gobble up runs of The Punisher, Spider Man, Fantastic Four, you name it), and people died. Lots of people died. Some of them key players. There’s some brilliant stuff in the comics — usually revolving around Iron Man and Captain America having heated debates about the nature of freedom — but there’s incredible bloat as well. In this filmic version, the Russo brothers have somehow managed to boil everything down to its most vital ingredients without losing any of the potency. You’ll see Robert Downey Jr.’s charming yet cynical Tony Stark butt heads (literally) with Chris Evans’ eternally optimistic Steve Rogers. You’ll see ludicrous moments like when Captain America is holding onto a helicopter to stop it flying away, flexing like a madman, before switching the position of his arm for maximum swoonage. You’ll see Avengers pitted against Avengers, and yes, you’ll see a bunch of new faces. But it’s all very deliberate. “Because it looks cool” is no reason to have a fight scene, but if you’ve slaved away pummelling characters into fully-realised people over eight years worth of feature films, and if you can use a cool-looking fight to hammer a story point home, then go nuts. And that’s what Civil War does in spades. While Civil War is packed with all this complex drama and tragedy, it also throws you some great laughs. Directors Anthony and Jo Russo — who cut their teeth on Arrested Development and Community before moving into the Marvel-verse — have a deft understanding of comic timing and what’s more, they know how to use understated comedy to make those dramatic moments hit twice as hard. The Russo brothers’ use of light and shade is ultimately what makes Civil War pop; two former teammates using humour to mask how pissed and confused and hurt they are about their current state of affairs buoys up the stakes. Levity cuts through the grim-dark dirge of gravelly-voiced gods facing off on the field of battle and turns it into a thoroughly human ordeal. Paul Rudd’s Ant Man — a loveable ex-thief whose standalone film had a surprising amount of heart — had the entire cinema in fits of laughter during some of the most tense parts of the movie. And woah, we need to talk about Spidey. Yes, this film marks the debut of our new Spider Man, played by an actual teenager this time! Tom Holland is brilliant as Peter Parker. Just brilliant. He’s charming, understated and completely believable; no skateboarding, no Coldplay, no creepy emo dance vignettes. He’s just a kid in a mask trying to do the right thing. Watching him get excited about Tony Stark appearing in his apartment or hearing him geek out over Winter Soldier’s metal arm while in the heat of battle might even make him the truest cinematic Spiderman we’ve ever had. What you have here is, frankly, the Avengers film we deserved when Age of Ultron staggered out of wherever Joss Whedon lets his films gestate nowadays. It’s proof that a superhero ensemble film can kick unfeasible quantities of arse. It’s proof that no matter how many explosions you throw into a film, the real way to make the climax of a story hit home is to make the motivations of the characters deeply personal and human. And it’s proof that no matter what cynics — or completely reasonable people who were justifiably appalled by Batman V Superman — might think, the superhero genre is still capable of churning out stunning popcorn cinema. Civil War might be the best thing to ever come out of Marvel, and everyone involved should be punching the air right now. And not each other.

"Apr 28, 2016",POSITIVE," ¿Qué se puede decir de las películas de Marvel que no se haya dicho ya? Una de las dos grandes productoras de películas de superhéroes tiene el camino bastante definido hace tiempo, por lo cual es difícil encontrar sorpresas. De hecho es conocida la planificación que hay detrás de todos sus proyectos, unidos entre sí y con un estilo de hacer cine bastante reconocible y transversal a todas sus películas. “Capitán América: Civil War” sigue derecho por ese camino trazado hace años sin salirse un centímetro de la fórmula. Tal vez la única diferencia es que, debido a la temática, hacia el clímax se vuelve un poco más oscura que la mayoría de las cintas de la factoría. Pero antes de continuar con el análisis, repasemos rápidamente la trama: Después de cada una de las actuaciones de los Vengadores siempre queda detrás un manto de destrucción. Por más que los héroes se esfuercen, siempre mueren personas y hay destrozos por doquier. Debido a esto, la ONU les propone firmar el Acuerdo de Sokovia, bajo el cual los Vengadores se comprometen a trabajar bajo la tutela de Naciones Unidas. Tony Stark está de acuerdo con la medida; piensa que tienen demasiado poder y es bueno que haya un ente regulador tras ellos. El Capitán América en cambio no confía en el tratado, pues piensa que serán controlados por burócratas y que los enviarán donde a los Gobiernos más les convenga y no donde son más necesarios. Mientras se ponen de acuerdo, ocurre un atentado del cual es culpado Bucky (el Soldado del invierno y mejor amigo del Capitán), con lo cual llegar a un consenso se hará más difícil… hasta que el equipo termina por romperse en dos. Debido a esta conjunción de personajes que hay en el universo Marvel, “Civil War” no es solo la película del Capitán América, sino que podría ser perfectamente la tercera parte de “Los Vengadores”, incluso aún sin Hulk ni Thor (que no se echan para nada de menos), pues además se incorporan nuevos personajes. Entre estos, el que definitivamente se roba la película es el Hombre araña, un joven Tom Holland que se adueña de la esencia del personaje, lo hace cercano y querible, un héroe juvenil que se ve en medio de una batalla que apenas comprende. Es él quien pone gran parte del humor en la cinta y protagoniza las mejores secuencias de batalla. Junto a él, otro personaje que aporta mucho, en especial a las escenas de acción es AntMan. Vale decir que no viene al caso comparar la película con el cómic que la inspira, ya que el filme básicamente toma el argumento base de la historieta pero en lo demás la trama difiere bastante de la original. Todo parte con una pelea entre dos bandos de héroes, uno liderado por Steve Rogers y el otro por Tony Stark, pero en la versión en papel hay muchísimos más personajes y temas que en la versión fílmica no existen, y que afortunadamente no están porque solo habrían complicado inútilmente la historia. La película es todo lo que se puede esperar de una cinta de superhéroes. Tiene tremendas secuencias de lucha, un guión no perfecto pero sin vacíos argumentales, y que maneja bastante bien los ritmos entre la acción y las escenas dramáticas. Curiosamente además, la cinta ocupa algunos recursos similares a “Batman vs Superman”, aunque aquí se ocupan de forma más coherente y efectiva. No se trata de ser “Marvel lover” como dicen algunos, pues creo que tanto en DC como en Marvel hay productos notables y otros más débiles. Lo que sucede es que la comparación se hace inevitable considerando que las dos películas están en cartelera y, al menos en este caso, la cinta del Capitán América y compañía es mucho más redonda que su competidora de DC. De hecho es una de las mejores cintas de superhéroes que se han hecho hasta ahora. A “Civil War” solo se le puede reprochar, y esto es siendo muy purista, algunos conceptos que fueron ajustados para que la película funcionara. Como ejemplo, sabemos que Iron Man (con la armadura) es mucho más fuerte y tiene muchos más recursos que el Capitán América, por lo cual no deja de ser extraña la igualdad de condiciones que hay en los combates mano a mano entre ellos. Sin embargo creo que es bueno entender que esto es una película fantástica y que muchas veces se toman estas licencias los guionistas en pos de intensificar el drama."
"Apr 28, 2016",POSITIVE," THIRTEEN films in and Marvel continue to find new ways to dazzle and amaze as they expand their superhero universe. Captain America: Civil War may have a lot to cram in but Joe and Anthony Russo, picking up where they left off with Winter Soldier, have delivered a movie that could just standout as the pinnacle of Marvel’s achievements to date. Clocking in at a seemingly patience-testing two and a half hours, and built around the somewhat beleaguered concept of yet another superhero smack-down, Civil War deftly finds ways to seem fresh and exciting, fun yet serious-minded and even emotionally involving. It’s an event movie that has everything and one that leaves you breathlessly anticipating what may still lie in store. And it’s certainly a film that demands repeat viewing. Unlike a certain other superhero tussle (are you paying attention, Batman vs Superman), Civil War sets good guy against ultra good guy in coherent, believable fashion. And while doing so, it leaves you torn between who should win, even expanding its remit to real world concerns that lend the film a surprising contemporary resonance. Picking up in the wake of the fallout from Avengers: Age of Ultron, the film starts out in Lagos as Captain America/Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) leads an ill-fated mission against another former nemesis that results in a catastrophic intervention from Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), causing more civilian deaths. With calls for the Avengers to be held more accountable for their actions, a political summit is set up in Vienna which Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr) is keen to get behind. But the proposed treaty is unthinkable to Rogers, who fears for the lack of autonomy that will surely follow. As both men come to loggerheads trying to win their argument, a new blow is dealt by the detonation of a bomb at the Vienna summit, the apparent blame for which lies with The Winter Soldier, aka Rogers’ former friend and ally Bucky (Sebastian Stan). Hence, while Rogers and his team go rogue attempting to find and prove Bucky’s innocence, Stark and his warriors unite to try and apprehend The Winter Soldier, while in the shadows a mysterious German doctor (Daniel Bruhl) sets into play his own plan for all parties concerned. One of the most striking things about Civil War is the way in which it expertly juggles so many elements so successfully. It’s intelligent in the way that it uses its central moral dilemma (when and how to use superheroes) as an allegory for the current debate surrounding drones and the collateral damage they cause; it’s suitably serious and involving when dealing with the emotional complexity of the superhero guilt that follows each mission and the subsequent strains it places on long-term friendships; but it’s also immense fun in the way that it draws on humour – some of it laugh-out-loud – to punctuate proceedings every so often. And it’s sure to balance the often stunning action with worthwhile insights into the various characters, whether furthering the nuances in both the Rogers and Stark characters, or introducing new ones in the form of Chadwick Boseman’s Black Panther and Tom Holland’s Spider-Man – both of whom make huge first impressions. Sure, some characters do get a little left behind, such as Jeremy Renner’s Hawkeye (fun, but under-used), but it’s a small price to pay given how well everything else is handled. And the Russo brothers do deserve a huge amount of credit for the way in which they restore faith in the superhero genre given the manner in which they find new ways to keep you entertained and even overcome the limitations of so many like-minded films. For while this is most certainly about a smack-down between two superhero titans, the humanity at play almost makes Civil War feel the least superhero-like movie of the Marvel back catalogue to date. For the most part, scenes of city-wide devastation are kept to a minimum, making this feel surprisingly intimate and yet still big.  When it comes, the long-awaited six-on-six battle is something to marvel over. It’s ingenuity is staggering. There’s brilliant use of the Spider-Man and Ant-Man characters, comedy and tragedy jostling for position with one another, and surprising turns of events that keep viewers on their toes. It’s an exhilarating high-point of a film not short on them in the first place. But even then the Russo’s aren’t done. There’s a sting in the tale that leads to a heart-breaking final act… one that brings closure of sorts to this particular story, while setting up fascinating new possibilities for future instalments.  And therein lies another of the movie’s master-strokes – to leave you thirsting for more at a time when fatigue could [and maybe even should] have long set in. Captain America: Civil War is therefore a stunning achievement: one that far exceeds expectations to deliver one of the most thrilling superhero experiences you are ever likely to see."
"Apr 28, 2016",POSITIVE," If nothing else, Captain America: Civil War stands as something of a corrective to this spring’s other superheroes-bludgeoning-each-other opus, Batman v Superman. While that film was severe and downcast, Civil War is expansive, at times even light. BvS strove to redefine its superheroes to fit newer, darker, borderline-sociopathic molds; Civil War finds conflict in its characters’ more ennobling qualities: Captain America’s idealism, Iron Man’s pragmatism, Black Widow’s resourcefulness. Zack Snyder’s film was stylized to a fault, with its slo-mo shots and pirouetting camera moves; the Russo Brothers’ is functional, un-showy — maybe even a little drab. Batman v Superman was larded with ominous aphorisms and loaded dialogue about power and humanity and guilt and loyalty and duty; Civil War is… well, OK, it’s got a ton of those, too. The story feels similar as well. After a big fight in Lagos leaves civilians dead, the Avengers are left to mull the consequences and collateral damage of their world-saving. Tony Stark, a/k/a Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), confronted by a mother who lost her son during the events of Avengers: Age of Ultron, tries to get his superhero cohort to join him in signing the Sokovia Accords, which will bring our heroes under the control of an outside governing body. Steve Rogers, a/k/a Captain America (Chris Evans), an earnest believer in American individualism and liberty, bristles at the idea. The heroes start to take sides — Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and War Machine (Don Cheadle) cast their lot with Iron Man, while Falcon (Anthony Mackie) goes with Captain America. The situation becomes more personal with the bombing of the ceremonial signing of those accords. The culprit appears to be the Winter Soldier, a/k/a Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), who was Steve Rogers’s best friend back in the 1940s but was revealed in the last Captain America movie to be a brainwashed super-soldier working for the bad guys. But the Winter Soldier had started to regain his identity by the finale of that film, and Cap isn’t convinced his bud Bucky would do something like this — and Bucky claims innocence. The bombing also kills the king of the small African nation of Wakanda, prompting a vow of revenge from his son, T’Challa, a/k/a Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman). Cap believes his pal, Iron Man believes the government, Black Panther doesn’t believe anybody, and, as other heroes join in the fight (most notably, Paul Rudd’s Ant-Man and newly christened Spider-Man Tom Holland), the movie becomes Avengers 3: Avengers v. Avengers. Civil War treats the idea of internecine superhero combat as some kind of amazing novelty, when in fact that’s what they do in so many of the other movies, too. (Remember Hulk v. Thor in Avengers? Ant-Man v. Falcon in Ant-Man?) Still, the climactic battle in Leipzig Airport is Civil War‘s high point: fast, inventive, and funny. It also finds suspense, and even some pathos, in the idea of superhumans pulling their punches; they’re explicitly trying not to kill each other, and it turns out that’s sort of hard. That airport face-off also highlights the film’s most compelling elements, the newer heroes: Black Panther, with his drive for revenge; Spider-Man, with his eager-beaver witticisms; Ant-Man, with his aw-shucks ordinariness; Falcon, with his jaded sarcasm. At times, I wondered if Civil War might have worked better if it had played out strictly from the perspective of one of them. But Marvel’s schedule calls for a Captain America movie, this one about the collective guilt of the Avengers across all the earlier films. Maybe that’s the problem here: For these characters, this sense of responsibility for the consequences of their actions feels both overdue and out of place. The filmmakers want to bring these costumed fictions into the real world… but it’s all happening in a universe that’s already too invested in the supernatural and the galactic. This is where style might have helped. While the ornate, overbearing aestheticism of Batman v Superman was maybe too much, superhero movies should have visual panache, some sense of otherworldly wonder. Winter Soldier, also directed by the Russo Brothers, managed that by giving us a political thriller that wasn’t afraid to escalate into the realm of exotic childhood fantasy — vast, decades-old conspiracies and surreal images of ginormous heli-carriers doing battle in the skies over Washington, D.C. In trying to ground its characters in something resembling the ordinary, Civil War overcorrects. Gone are the wide-eyed sense of derring-do that characterized the first Captain America movie and the paranoid tension that defined Winter Soldier; there isn’t even the slapstick of Ant-Man or the witty abandon of the better Iron Mans. But we watch anyway. Why? I’m not sure. Call it the confident caress of corporate continuity. It’s odd to think that a generation of viewers may not remember a time when interlocking superhero epics didn’t command such swaths of the mainstream moviegoing firmament. These films no longer have to delight and surprise us; no, their job now is to manage the brand, not screw anything up too royally, and keep us hooked for the next installment. Civil War pulls all that off mostly well. It skips all around the world (Siberia! Nigeria! Vienna! London! Leipzig! Queens!), anxiously maneuvering plot points into place, and audiences know to trust that it’ll all add up to something, because these things usually do. But I never found myself genuinely wondering what was going to happen next; the moves are too familiar. Even the big fight, entertaining as it is, feels like it’s there not because of dramatic inevitability, but because somebody behind a desk decided it had to be. It’s just a bunch of stuff."
"Apr 28, 2016",POSITIVE," Tras ver Captain America: Civil War sabemos por qué Disney confió en Joe y Anthony Russo para dirigir la película de Avengers Infinity War 1 & 2, la tercera película del Capitán Steve Rogers tiene todos los elementos que caracterizan a un sólido blockbuster de verano. No existirá nunca una adaptación fiel a la obra original, ni siquiera cuando el creador de la historia participa en ambas (desde un Frank Miller con Sin City: A Dame to Kill For hasta una Gillian Flynn con Perdida), por lo que de entrada no se puede juzgar Civil War por no ser una obra fiel al papel, eso no. Sin embargo, los Russo lograron conjuntar a la perfección todos los elementos que habíamos visto en la Fase 2 de Marvel, desde Iron Man 3 pasando por Avengers: La era de Ultrón hasta, obviamente Capitán América: El soldado de invierno, y no sólo eso, sino que ayudan a sentar las bases de una forma magistral y sin forzar las cosas para la Fase 3. Civil War podría ser la historia de dos bandos, unos que apoyan al gobierno (Team Iron Man) y aquellos que desean ser libres (Team Cap), pero incluso va más allá, tomando psicologías y estatus similares para cada grupo. Por un lado tenemos a los “ricos”: un multimillonario entrepreneur, el rey de Wakanda, un cuasi-dios con una inteligencia suprema poseedor de una gema del infinito, una espía y un piloto de la fuerza aérea; mientras que del otro lado tenemos a un supersoldado desempleado, un piloto jubilado, una bruja ilegal, un exasesino buscado por la ley, un agente retirado y un ladrón que ha estado varias veces en la cárcel. La acción está a la orden desde sus primeros minutos, pero decir que “desde el minuto cero nunca se detiene” también sería entrar en un cliché tan desgastado como el traje del Capitán, no todo tiene que ser acción, los Russo van construyendo la historia de forma meticulosa, con un ritmo con el que trabajaron en El soldado de invierno, este mundo de espionaje pero ahora centrado en alianzas y fuerzas políticas, pero la gracia de los hermanos directores es que esto nunca conlleva a eternas escenas de diálogos infumables en congresos por la paz, porque cuando parece que eso va a suceder, siempre hay una sorpresa. El 3D por momentos es imperceptible aunque hay secuencias donde es muy aprovechado, especialmente con Ant-Man, quien en lo personal se lleva uno de los mejores momentos no sólo de la cinta sino del Marvel Cinematic Universe. De todas formas, cada avenger que aparece en Civil War tiene el peso y la importancia necesaria en la trama, sin mencionar la presentación de Black Panther cuya participación está total y absolutamente ligada a su cinta en solitario, pero nunca con presencia gratuita en la trama. Esto sin mencionar que deben esperar por las dos secuencias post-créditos que valen la pena. Naturalmente está otra de las estrellas de la película y un parteaguas también en la historia de “derechos legales sobre un personaje” donde Sony y Marvel/Disney presentan lo que será el tercer Hombre Araña en la historia del cine en menos de 15 años, logrando un Peter Parker mucho más creíble como estudiante de preparatoria. Tom Holland se desenvuelve fácilmente, como si ya lo hubiera hecho por años, sin embargo también es muy pronto para decir que es «el mejor Spider-Man que ha habido”… hay que esperar a su película. La música de Henry Jackman sigue estando a la altura de las circunstancias, con los temas de los personajes Winter Soldier y Capitán América gozando ya de un protagonismo, mientras que las secuencias de acción las combina también con el drama que implica ver a los héroes golpeándose los unos a los otros, porque al final Jackman no olvida que la pelea es ahora más personal y por lo tanto es más dramático golpear a quien es tu amigo. Y es que esa es una de las virtudes de Capitán América: Civil War, la humanidad con la que desarrolla, sin caer en sentimentalismos, la problemática que traen Steve Rogers, Bucky y Tony Stark es más profunda de lo que parece y es de recalcar que sirvió a la perfección para darle a los protagonistas motivos de sobra para pelearse como se pelean, porque mientras Stark es fiel a un ideal político y de conducta, Rogers siempre peleará por lo que él cree que es lo correcto. Para algunos podrá parecer que tiene un inicio pausado, que ya quieren ver a Spider-Man, pero hasta la construcción tipográfica de los títulos de las diferentes ciudades en las que se desarrolla la historia está cuidada, a ese detalle nos llevan los Russo. Civil War no podría ser mejor alegoría que el de una montaña rusa, porque para llegar a la primer gran bajada debemos de subir, y esa es la parte donde debemos contemplar el paisaje, debemos contemplar las piezas que se van acomodando para uno de los más emocionantes viajes de Marvel Studios.

"Apr 27, 2016",POSITIVE," El crossover ""Civil War"" de Mark Millar (guión) y Steve McNiven (dibujo) marcó un antes y un después en la historia de Marvel Cómics. Los años noventa no fueron especialmente brillantes en la Casa de las Ideas: el barroquismo estético, la fuga (o despido) de guionistas clave, las tramas melifluas (cuando no directamente confusas) que desembocaban en finales acelerados y la resituación de personajes históricos acabó por marcar un mínimo histórico tanto artístico como industrial (las ventas eran desastrosas). Marvel necesitaba una revolución, la cual empezó con el fichaje de Grant Morrison para llevar la Patrulla X y dar libertad absoluta a Brian Michael Bendis a la hora de resucitar a los Vengadores -de él fue la idea de incluir en dicha liga a personajes como Spider-Man, Lobezno o Luke Cage-. Pero el verdadero puñetazo en la mesa lo dio el escocés Mark Millar -quién casi al mismo tiempo se inventó los Ultimates: básicamente, la línea de Vengadores (alternativos) más cañera del siglo XXI- quién buscando crear un paralelismo con las leyes antiterroristas post 11-S, enfrentó a los Vengadores en una lucha fratricida tomando como base el ""Acta de Registro"" que obligaba a todos los superhéroes a dar a conocer su identidad pública (y, de paso, ser controlados por SHIELD y el gobierno americano). A un lado se posicionó el bando de Tony Stark (que tomó decisiones de supervillano, como crear una cárcel en una dimensión paralela creada por Reed Richards) y al otro el Capitán América que, defensor de la libertad, se vio obligado a esconderse (junto a los suyos) como un proscrito. En definitiva, una saga que dejaría heridas abiertas que tardarían años en cerrarse y que dejó momentos memorables como la confesión de la identidad de Peter Parker, el asesinato del hombre Gigante (a manos de un clon de Thor) o el trágico fin del Capitán América (otro gran fichaje de la época se hizo cargo de la linea del capi: Ed Brubaker).   Pero basta ya de hablar de cómics (me apetecía, siento el rollo introductorio) y centrémonos en este nuevo hit del UCM. Los hermanos Russo, que ya nos entregaran uno de los mejores films del pack -su Capitán América: El soldado de invierno, perfecta en su cruce de thriller de espionaje como manda el canon y la action movie superheroica-, vuelven a desafiar nuestro sentido para aprehender el espectáculo mediante una formula de lo más festiva: acción a raudales, humor desenfrenado (recordemos que ambos estaban detrás de dos cúspides de la comedia televisiva contemporánea: Arrested Development y Community) y la mayor cantidad de superhéroes en plano que uno haya visto nunca. ¡Y funciona! Es decir, ¿puede una película contar con diez protagonistas de peso (mínimo) y que eso no afecte a la narración? (Zack Snyder no ha sido capaz ni de congeniar a tres en su Batman v Superman). Para los hermanos Russo es pan comido: no sólo no hay embotellamiento narrativo, sino que además este fluye sin parar, ya sea punteado por las estilizadas secuencias de tortas, por la base dramática que asienta la cinta o por el caudal de chistes garabateados en un guión que busca no dejar nada en el tintero. Ni siquiera Joss Whedon consiguió ese engrasado perfecto en su Vengadores: La era de Ultrón.  El Acta de Registro se convierte aquí en los Tratados de Sokovia, un acuerdo internacional donde los Vengadores deben aceptar someterse a la disciplina de la ONU para seguir operando (un cambio lógico dado que en el UCM prácticamente todas las identidades son públicas). Los Russo aposentan su epicentro dramático en la figura del Soldado de Invierno, el talón de Aquiles de Steve Rogers, suavizando el carácter conservador de Tony Stark y equilibrando la balanza entre ambos bandos. La rivalidad consiguiente no es tanto deriva de un posicionamiento político sino de una catarsis moral. Con lo que es más complejo diferenciar el bien del mal, así como tomar partida por ninguno de los bandos enfrentados.  Sentada las bases del conflicto toca disfrutar del enfrentamiento. Y he aquí lo mejor de la cinta: la larguísima (para bien: ¡ojalá durara aún más!) pelea en el aeropuerto entre ambos equipos es absolutamente increíble, tanto por la dimensión épica que alcanza como por lo tremendamente divertida que resulta. Y sorprende, ojo. Porque a estas alturas en las que nos estamos comiendo diez películas de superhéroes al año, ¿cómo no nos vamos a aburrir en una nueva pelea con gente que vuela, tira rallos (o flechas) y encaja golpes titánicos como quien hace una guerra de almohadas? Los Russo lo tenían claro: el golpe de efecto que representa incluir en dicha batalla a los nuevos fichajes para el team (Spider-Man, Ant-Man, Pantera Negra) eleva la temperatura del disfrutómetro hasta hacerlo reventar. Normal que se viva el visionado de dicho enfrentamiento como una fiesta sin fin, donde el cariz dramático sea solo la excusa para poder echarnos unas risas que tienen tanto de complicidad con los autores como de relajamiento frente a la absurdidad de la normalidad imperante en la vida real. ¿Teníamos miedo de que nos íbamos a cansar del cine de superhéroes?

"Apr 27, 2016",POSITIVE," REVIEW: When Captain America: Civil War was called “the best Marvel movie yet”, we thought it was an exaggeration. But this film lives up to the hype. After all, this is a franchise with huge critical and box office hits, whose lowest Rotten Tomato score is 66 per cent (for Thor: The Dark World) — that’s an impressive slate to beat. And hot off the heels of the disaster that was DC’s Batman v Superman, audiences could be understandably wary of comic book franchises. Well, prepared to have your faith restored. Captain America: Civil War is a reminder of exactly what makes Marvel movies work, and what DC’s efforts have been severely lacking. Civil War is joyful and fun, even in the darker moments. Plus it has emotional resonance, characters you can genuinely invest in and one narrative arc that is coherent and disciplined, despite the formidable challenge of servicing 12 superheroes. Like the comic book event it borrows from, Civil War finds Captain America (Chris Evans) and Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) on opposite sides in a battle that is a hard one to settle — both men are right and wrong, and both believe they’re doing the noble thing. After yet another incident with unintended civilian deaths, Iron Man agrees to accept UN oversight, while Captain America sees that option as merely shifting the blame, to give someone else the power to decide when and where the Avengers can save the world. While the conflict begins as a squaring off between high-minded ideals like freedom, choice and responsibility, it increasingly becomes personal as the overriding themes of friendship and loyalty take centre stage, with Cap’s old friend and Manchurian Candidate-d assassin Bucky/Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) the linchpin of the story. Friends and allies are forced to take sides, and their choices are significant because these are characters audiences have known for years. They bring well-established baggage and relationships with them. Marvel is banking on the fact that most people flocking to see Civil War will have already seen most if not all of the 12 preceding movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).  Newcomers may miss the finer points of what it really means to have Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) on opposite sides of the same war. Two new heroes are introduced in this instalment, and a lot of fuss has been made about the third Spider-Man reboot in 14 years. Tom Holland confidently debuts as the dumpster-diving, banter-loving awkward teen who’s as concerned about his homework and hiding his identity from Aunt May as he is about saving the world. What a delight to see Spidey deftly swing from place to place in the middle of an epic battle. Also making his first appearance in the MCU is Black Panther/T’Challa, who will get his own movie in 2018. Chadwick Boseman has considerable presence and more than holds his own in a jam-packed cast of superheroes as he pounces and glides across the screen with swiftness and grace in Civil War’s genuinely thrilling action sequences. Because it’s a comic book franchise with powered people, you of course expect some hi-tech and fantastical displays of strength. But something else really stands out: the beautifully choreographed hand-to-hand combat scenes. Unlike in Avengers: Age of Ultron, there’s enough variety in the action to sustain at least four major arrangements without resorting to more boom, smash and bam. For a two-and-a-half hour movie, everything’s surprisingly well-paced, a cinematic art form that is, unfortunately, becoming increasingly rare. The big showdown teased in the trailers is spectacularly entertaining, if maybe a little crowded. It’s easily one of the best action scenes in the MCU as you see familiar characters fight each other instead of generic bad guy #43, with every punch, body slam and truck thrown by mind control from one superhero landing against another superhero. Even though it is grand in scale, there’s still an intimacy to the battle. But you’d best avoid the 3D sessions, as some of the shaky-cam action scenes border on video game-esque and can blur in the extra dimension. Save yourself the extra five bucks and the headache. What rescues Civil War from being Avengers 2.5 is that Cap has the most important, rich character journey and is clearly the driving force of the film, more so than in Captain America: Winter Soldier. Conversely, MCU fans may feel cheated of their personal favourites (which also include Scarlet Witch, War Machine, Ant-Man, Vision and Falcon) who all show up, have their moment and then slink back into the background (with the exception of Iron Man). It’s a teaser that leaves you wanting more, like say, another Avengers movie — which, after all, is Marvel’s raison d’etre. Civil War does benefit from not getting too bogged down in laying groundwork for future MCU movies. There are hints here and there of what’s to come, like the question of Vision’s (Paul Bettany) control of that Infinity Stone embedded in his head but, for the most part, the film is focused on the present story. And what a relief to see directors Anthony and Joe Russo up their game from their last effort, the excellent Winter Soldier. The MCU hasn’t had the best track record on the second outings from its directors — Jon Favreau’s Iron Man 2 was a mess and Joss Whedon’s Avengers: Age of Ultron was a let-down. The Russos’ success bodes well for James Gunn and Peyton Reed, who are directing their follow-ups to Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man, respectively. The Russo brothers are also signed up for Avengers: Infinity War Parts 1 and 2 — cementing themselves as the new MCU directorial standard bearers in the franchise after Whedon’s departure post-Ultron. They’ve brilliantly balanced the Marvel signature of combining humour, warmth and oh-so-many quips with the serious business of kicking arse. The future of the MCU is looking bright. In her own words and photographed by her daughter Sunday Rose, Nicole Kidman reflects on her iconic roles, as she prepares to be the first Australian to receive a prestigious Hollywood award."

"Apr 27, 2016",NEUTRAL," Recurring as regularly as the seasons, the Marvel superhero blockbusters nowadays hardly feel like movies at all: they're more like instalments of a long-running, goofy TV series with impossibly lavish fight scenes. As filmmakers, the brothers Anthony and Joe Russo are strictly hired hands, far less distinctive than their Marvel colleague Joss Whedon. But having made their reputation corralling the casts of sitcoms like Community and Arrested Development, they're well-equipped to balance the many demands of Captain America: Civil War, an ensemble piece that's basically another Avengers sequel. Scaling down the philosophical ambitions of Joss Whedon's Avengers: Age of Ultron, the script by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely has a clear thematic thrust grounded in blunt political allegory. Quite simply, the Avengers here stand for the US military, and the plot turns on the collateral damage of their involvement in other people's wars. When an agreement is mooted that would place the Avengers under the control of the United Nations, it leads to a schism in the group, with clean-cut individualist Captain America (Chris Evans) insisting on his right to choose when and where to intervene. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr), otherwise known as Iron Man, rather surprisingly takes the opposite view, setting aside his libertarian leanings to argue that the team needs to be put in check. Things start to heat up when the Cap's old foe and fellow super-soldier Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) reappears on the scene, in tandem with a mysterious new villain played by Daniel Bruhl. Team Cap: From left, Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Captain America (Chris Evans), Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) prepare to take on Team Iron Man. Given whose name is in the title, it might seem fair to assume that the Cap's assertion of independence will ultimately be justified. But to their credit, the Russos and their writers leave room for debate. The super-intelligent android Vision (Paul Bettany) points out that the rise of the Avengers has been paralleled by a spike in world-threatening events - and while correlation is not cause, he makes a strong case that the dawn of the superhero era is, at best, a mixed blessing for the planet. Earnest as all this sounds, it's also the pretext for a big, splashy battle sequence on an airport runway that ups the ante on Batman V Superman by pitting most of the key Marvel personnel against each other (minus Mark Ruffalo's Hulk, still on his well-earned break). There's Iron Man zipping around in his suit, Antman (Paul Rudd) shrinking and expanding, and Spiderman (Tom Holland) – yes, he's in here – shooting goo from his fingertips to paralyse his foes. This is good ridiculous fun, with a steady stream of wisecracks to accompany the fan-pleasing one-on-one match-ups (""There's not usually this much talking,"" Spiderman is warned). The Russos are hardly the most visually elegant of action directors, but they manage to make the impossible seem relatable, using whip pans and other shaky camera moves to suggest realism even as live action gives way to digital cartooning. Typically for a big Marvel production, there's an abundance of activity on the sidelines, including the return of Elizabeth Olsen's Scarlet Witch and the introduction of Chadwick Boseman's Black Panther, currently being groomed for a vehicle of his own. All of this helps distract attention from the fact that Evans remains among the blandest of Marvel's regular featured players. It's baffling that the studio have so far devoted three films to the Cap and none to Scarlett Johansson's more charismatic Black Widow, who here plays the central yet thankless role of mediator between opposing camps. As for Downey, he appears to be channelling some of his boredom with the whole enterprise into his performance, but still has no trouble stealing scenes from the nominal star."

More so than any of the previous episodes in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, “Civil War” is a soap opera in spandex. In part, that’s because of the film’s refreshing (if not fully realized) emphasis on emotional turmoil rather than global destruction; while plenty of buildings blow up, most of the collateral damage is caused by the good guys as they argue with each other and threaten to go their separate ways. This isn’t just about killing time before the Infinity Wars, it’s about fulfilling the ultimate goal of the MCU: A film franchise so immense and self-perpetuating that a plot’s greatest possible conflict is no longer the end of the world, but rather the end of the brand. 
The story begins, as most Marvel movies do, wherever the hell it wants. The profound sense of guilt that began to fester inside Tony Stark (still Robert Downey, Jr.) after the attacks on New York City has been intensified by the death toll from the fight against Ultron in Sokovia. And Stark isn’t the only one who’s afraid to look in the mirror. Early in the film, Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) is devastated when a brawl in Lagos claims a handful of innocent bystanders. With various world governments on edge about the continued existence of the Avengers — whose formation seems to have invited a never-ending series of calamities upon the Earth —  U.S. Secretary of State Thaddeus “Thunderbolt” Ross (William Hurt) draws up the Sokovia Accords, which would essentially put the superhero task force under the command of the United Nations.  
Stark, an Oppenheimer type who’s desperate to share the burden of guilt, is ready to sign. Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), a product of WWII who believes that the Avengers are capable of policing the planet on their own, is not. Stark thinks that they need regulations; Rogers thinks that they are the regulations. While the MCU is largely inspired by story arcs that were drawn long before the 21st Century, these movies have nevertheless used 9/11 as their north star, and “Civil War” is a natural choice of narratives for a saga that’s so preoccupied with the United States’ evolving role on the world stage. The philosophical differences between the two Avengers are enflamed when a bomb detonates during the signing of the Accords, killing the king of Wakanda (a fictional African nation). All signs point to Bucky Barnes as the culprit, but Rogers refuses to believe that his old pal is capable of such evil. 
The villain is clear from the start, and he’s far more innocuous than you might think. In fact, for the first time in a Marvel movie, the main antagonist is just some dude. Sure, he’s hatched from comic book mythos, but he doesn’t have a super-suit or electric whips or a menacing red face — his name is Helmut Zemo, and he’s pretty much just Daniel Brühl. Zemo’s most ominous characteristics are his German accent and his penchant for eating bacon — and only bacon — for breakfast. He could just as easily be the villain from a mid-’90s thriller starring Clint Eastwood. His scheme is to agitate the Avengers into fighting each other, and it works.  Stomping on the carcass of its competition can only get a film so far, but it goes without saying that the rift between these two superheroes is considerably more nuanced and better-developed than that between Batman and Superman. Iron Man and Captain America have some serious shit to work out, and their disagreements aren’t resolved out of convenience or in order to rally together against a common foe. In fact, the Russo brothers are so invested in the ideas that bond their characters together (and tear them apart) that Zemo becomes an afterthought, the most forgettable villain in a franchise whose antagonists include Dark Elves and several different bald white men. What makes “Civil War” so emblematic of the MCU is that it cuts to the heart of what the brand is all about: humanity. “Spider-Man 2” predates the dawn of the MCU, but these movies have never forgotten that film’s bittersweet parting thought: Compassion is both our greatest strength, and our greatest liability. On the flip-side of that coin, ideology is the MCU’s most consistent foil (hence the series’ dramatically stultifying preoccupation with mind-control, which reaches a painful nadir in “Civil War”).  The tension between the potential generosity of strength and the corruptive nature of power also explains why so many of the jokes in these movies — and almost all of the unfunny ones in “Civil War” — boil down to “Superheroes: they’re just like us!” So far as Marvel is concerned, they are and always will be.  
Rogers and Stark are two sticks of old dynamite wrapped around a single fuse, and all Zemo has to do is light a match. He recognizes that the Avengers’ individual guilt is pushing them towards the blind comforts of ideology, just as he recognizes that ideology never leaves much wiggle room. As Rogers puts it: “Compromise where you can. And where you can’t, don’t.” “Civil War,” bursting with fun characters and drawing from a rich mythology, is also the most convincing proof yet that the MCU can compromise just about everywhere. For Marvel, a studio that essentially uses the same score on every movie and fired Edgar Wright from “Ant-Man” because his creative vision deviated from party lines, compromise has become an aesthetic unto itself. That’s never been more evident than it is in “Civil War,” especially during the fight scenes. Marvel has always excelled at expressing character through action, and so it stands to reason that the characters suffer if the action becomes less expressive. The combat in “Civil War” is so clumsy that it actually undercuts the drama. The justification behind many of the film’s tiffs are hard to believe as it is, but only when the characters actually drop the gloves does it get hard to remember why they’re fighting. Watching “Civil War,” it’s easy to understand why the MCU is so hung up on the fight in New York — it’s the franchise’s only great action sequence. Joss Whedon’s visceral understanding of cinematic geometry and his symphonic flair for choreographing movement allowed that marquee set-piece to galvanize the separate threads of the Marvel Cinematic Universe into a unified whole. On the contrary, every action beat in “Civil War” is such a discrete hodgepodge of close-ups and medium shots that they might as well exist in a vacuum — at times, this feels like the first movie ever made entirely out of gifs. The problem becomes gallingly clear during a battle royale in which more than a dozen different superheroes square off on an airport tarmac.  
Not only does the flabbergasting lack of wide shots completely diminish the scale of the fight — it’s like the Russo brothers forgot half of their lenses at homes — but it also limits the action to one plane at a time. It doesn’t help that the factions feel so arbitrarily determined. Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) gets to have a handful of great moments, but not even he seems to know why he’s trying to make life difficult for Tony Stark. On the other hand, it makes perfect sense that teenage Spider-Man (Tom Holland) is so endearingly overeager just to be there. But the Russo brothers can’t juggle two slivers of parallel action — 100% of their attention is focused on the foreground at all times — let alone smoothly re-introduce an iconic Marvel character in the middle of a massive brawl. Holland’s precocious zip makes him a wonderful Spidey, just as Chadwick Boseman’s stoic strength suggests that his Black Panther will have no trouble carrying his own movie, but just because these new characters feel right in this world doesn’t mean that they’re provided a proper place in this movie. When the action cuts to either one of them, Captain America and Iron Man suddenly feel a million miles away, and “Civil War” dissolves into nothing more than an advertisement for the MCU’s next round of spin-offs. There’s no room for context in these shots, just bodies. It’s hard to believe that Tony Stark is being eaten up by something that happened in a different movie if you can’t connect two things that happen in the same scene. It’s all just empty talk, and “Civil War” becomes a civic lesson that’s punctuated by one-liners and explosions. The bigger these movies become, the smaller they feel. The more aggressively they reach for greatness, the more clearly they prove that its beyond their grasp. Marvel movies don’t get much better than this. The trouble is, they don’t want to.

"Apr 27, 2016",POSITIVE,A large demonstration that Marvel can go much further. [Full review in Spanish]
"Apr 27, 2016",POSITIVE,"...a bright, vivid, compelling cocktail..."
"Apr 27, 2016",NEUTRAL," Let us be frank. After the loose stool that was Batman V Superman, the latest Marvel film merely had to turn up to win the summer's critical death match. If Captain America spent two hours impersonating farmyard animals, the picture would still seem like a breath of fresh air. I'm happy to relate that, like its predecessors in the Marvel Comics Universe, the disingenuously titled Captain America: Civil War hammers forward like a well-maintained locomotive. There isn't much here for those not already committed to the saga. Hanging threads from earlier episodes are tied on to further threads that then do their own dangling. At least two new sequences are launched with admirable concision and efficiency. Indeed, the film is so tightly bound within the expanding universe that it plays more like an extravagant TV episode than a motion picture. Fair enough. Marvel has made the rules and devotees are content to play by them. Influenced by a limited-series comic that ran in the middle of the last decade, Civil War dares to pitch one cadre of the superhero community against another (despite the absence of Thor and The Hulk, this is an Avengers film in all but name). Whereas the dispute between Batman and Superman made less sense than the average pre-kebab pub brawl, the writers of the Marvel film dare to build their split around key conflicts in global politics. Concerned about the Avengers’ ever escalating power, the United Nations proposes a regulatory process that will determine when the gang is called in to international disasters. There’s something of the Patriot Act to the legislation. Equally, you might argue that the UN is attempting to register the superheroes in the way that handguns aren’t in the US. Either way, the dispute is between security and freedom. It makes a kind of sense that Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), the corporate wonk whose life revolves around complex technological systems, should side with the UN and that Captain America (Chris Evans), the symbol of US manifest destiny, should err on the side of liberty. At any rate, after a great many preambles, the two teams find themselves going at it like Cavaliers (Iron Man’s side, I guess) and Roundheads (the non-conformist Cap and crew). Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Vision (Paul Bettany) stand for the Crown; Scarlett Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Falcon (Anthony Mackie) turn out for Parliament. I can’t remember what teams Bananaman and Danger Mouse choose. Okay, that’s a cheap shot. But the overcrowding does strip away any remaining sense of wonder at the heroes’ prodigious abilities. When everybody can vault buildings with a single leap, then vaulting buildings ceases to hold much interest. Indeed, it proves hard to keep track of who can do what during the busiest conflagrations. The Vision’s powers seem limitless. War Machine (Don Cheadle) does much the same as his pal Iron Man. Black Widow looks to be little more than a physically fit person who’s good with a firearm. And then there’s poor old Hawkeye. Once again playing the charisma vacuum with a bow and arrow, Jeremy Renner turns up late like the boring cousin we thought we’d remembered not to invite. You’d think a cull was in order. As it happens, Marvel is adding more players to the team. Chadwick Boseman smoulders as the Black Panther. Introduced during a very amusing, very speedy visit to Queens, Tom Holland looks to have the right clean-cheeked sass for Spider-Man. (Readers who, like your current reviewer, are about the same age as Marisa Tomei may be relieved to hear that Tony Stark seems to fancy this livelier, less flattened Aunt May.) It is during those scenes with Spider-Man that Marvel Studios demonstrates its greatest strength: a certainty of tone. In earlier episodes, the quips have come just a little too quickly. Civil War feels light on its feet, but also manages to engage with issues that matter. We really should avoid the temptation to make another unfavourable comparison with The Other Film."
"Apr 26, 2016",NEGATIVE,"  Part of the fun of Marvel’s Avengers movies to date has been having a front-row seat to the super-powered posse fast-balling quippy, barbed insults at one another. When they’re not squaring off against doomsday villains like Loki and the ho-hum Ultron, they seem to get off on taking each other down a notch. They’re a family, sure. But you got the sense that, like most families, they didn’t always like one another. Despite its stars-and-stripes title, Marvel’s latest billion-dollar-blockbuster-to-be, Captain America: Civil War, is essentially a third Avengers movie — it’s also the best one yet. With a couple of exceptions, the gang’s all here (plus a few new faces). And the hook this time around is that the tension isn’t just verbal anymore. They beat the crap out of each other, too. It’s like a family reunion gone violent.
  Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo — who turned the last Captain America outing, Winter Soldier, into a surprisingly heady meditation on Citizenfour-style government surveillance — the film is another timely parable smack dab in the middle of our current election season, where the U.S. electorate is as scarily divided as it’s ever been. The main philosophical rift is between Chris Evans’ Steve Rogers (aka Captain America) and Robert Downey, Jr.’s Tony Stark (Iron Man), which shouldn’t come as any surprise since those two are also the heroes of the franchise’s best stand-alone movies and its most interesting and multifaceted characters.
  After a casualty-heavy volley of destruction in Lagos, Nigeria, at the opening of the film (coming on top of Age of Ultron‘s levitating heap of collateral-damage rubble in the fictional Sokovia), the world’s governments want to rein in the rogue crimefighters and put them under the oversight of the U.N. This set-up may sound awfully familiar to anyone who forked over ten bucks to see Spectre just six months ago, but Civil War writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely goose the hand-me-down premise with airtight logic and freshness — not to mention a sense of fun and joy missing from that other recent superhero smackdown, Batman v Superman.
  Riddled with guilt, Stark somewhat surprisingly agrees to go along with the U.N.’s leash-tightening plan (the so-called “Sokovia Accords”), while Rogers regards it as a betrayal of the supergroup’s M.O. With the doctrinal lines drawn, the rest of the Avengers are forced to choose sides: Paul Bettany’s Vision and Don Cheadle’s War Machine line up with Stark; Anthony Mackie’s Falcon, Jeremy Renner’s Hawkeye, Paul Rudd’s Ant Man, Elizabeth Olsen’s Scarlet Witch, and Sebastian Stan’s Winter Soldier (now good guy Bucky Barnes) saddle up with Rogers. Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow is stuck somewhere in between. Lest things get too bleakly black and white, Markus and McFeely throw in a couple of newcomers — Tom Holland’s Spider-Man and Chadwick Boseman’s Black Panther — to spice up the super-sibling schism, adding welcome doses of gravitas and light.

"Apr 26, 2016",POSITIVE," With X-Men: Apocalypse on the horizon, the storming success of Deadpool ensuring it's already got a sequel and even the lacklustre Batman v Superman not preventing Batfleck getting another go in tights, superhero fatigue is in serious danger of setting in. Indeed, there's at least nine more films planned from Marvel in its 'Phase 3' alone, with another nine on the way from DC, too. Yet somehow Marvel's first Phase 3 outing, Captain America: Civil War, has managed to reinvent the comic book movie once again, creating a film that's thoughtful, mature and moving at the same time as being a thrilling ensemble romp. If Avengers: Age Of Ultron was a horror movie in comic clothes, and Captain America: The Winter Soldier an espionage actioner then Civil War, with its big themes, high stakes and global scale, looks like a war epic. But it's also an emotional drama about relationships, both personal and political. We begin with a flashback to 1991 with Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) – aka The Winter Soldier – enduring his Hydra programming and being brainwashed for a key mission. Flash-forward to present day and the 'new Avengers' are tackling a terrorist attack threatening to unleash a deadly biohazard on mankind. Slick and in sync, the team band together to avert disaster, and yet, as with New York in Avengers Assemble and Sokovia in Age Of Ultron, the human collateral damage is high and someone needs to be held accountable. Iron Man and Cap come to blows. Of course they do – and those who've come to see a spectacular 6-a-side face-off wont be disappointed. But when these titans clash it's not with hate, but hurt.  Joining Team Stark is Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa, a reluctantly-crowned king dressed claws and all as Black Panther. He takes on the new role with panache, a counterpoint to Anthony Mackie's Falcon: cat vs bird. Tom Holland as Spider-Man is a breath of fresh air and generates new hope for the Homecoming reboot - he's funny, young, fresh and cool, but not, you know, too cool (ahem, Andrew Garfield), lifting every scene he's in with a new vitality. Paul Rudd's Ant-Man delivers too, an underestimated fanboy opposite the old-school super-team who comes into his own massively. It's a film of parallels and duality. The Vision and Scarlett Witch, Hawkeye and Black Widow and of course the big guns, Cap and Iron Man with their besties Rhodey and Bucky filling out the sides. But it's never as simple as that. Characters are well-rounded and complex. Relationships tested and strained. When Cap professes ""he's a friend"" of Bucky in a third act showdown and Stark howls ""so was I"", it's heart breaking. Then there's the big bad – no spoilers – but he's neither a criminal mastermind nor an egomaniac evil genius, and remains refreshingly relatable until the end. The fights are epic (and far cleaner than Age Of Ultron's messy scraps), and the team all get their moments to shine. But this is still a Captain America movie. If he was ever accused of being boring for his Boy Scout-ish tendencies then no more, for the first time Steve Rogers is given a truly satisfying arc - flaws, vulnerabilities and all. The Russos have made an intelligent drama which also happens to be a funny, thrilling, cool superhero movie and it's upped the game for all comic book movies to come. It's not about Team Cap or Team Iron Man. We're Team Russo. ©2024 Hearst UK is the trading name of the National Magazine Company Ltd, 30 Panton Street, Leicester Square, London, SW1Y 4AJ.

"Apr 26, 2016",POSITIVE," Sometimes people claim that Superman is inherently boring, that you need a tortured Batman-like figure to generate any complexity onscreen. The film career of Steve ""Captain America"" Rogers suggests otherwise. Marvel's best character is a nice guy who consciously jettisons unhelpful emotional baggage and who always tries to do the right thing no matter the cost. And it turns out that all you need to do to make such a guy fascinating is to put him in a situation with no right answer. In The Winter Soldier, that required him to take down SHIELD. in order to save it from the enemy within. Now he’s caught fighting his own friends and team mates in Marvel’s Civil War. We rejoin the action as Chris Evans' Cap tries to round up some Hydra operatives, along with Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson). But an international agreement is approaching that will put all these ‘enhanced’ figures under the control of a UN committee. Tony Stark / Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) is ready to sign up, guilt-ridden by his failures in Avengers: Age Of Ultron, and encourages the Avengers to do the same. Cap, however, has no issues to work out and serious, fairly sensible reservations after his last experience working for a large, untrustworthy organisation. A stand-off develops, before the the reappearance of Cap’s long-lost bestie, Bucky (Sebastian Stan), brainwashed to become assassin the Winter Soldier, turns the cold war into a live-fire fight. The key difference between this and certain other superhero clashes in recent memory is that the conflict here flows seamlessly from the characters, and the violence is at least as much emotional as physical. Steve Rogers is caught between two friends with diametrically opposed needs, between the world’s demands and his own conscience. He’s bound up neatly, and the film never offers him an easy out. Tony Stark, meanwhile, (Downey’s best performance yet in the role) is hungry for forgiveness and virtually begging Steve to join him in a hair shirt and penance. You can come out of this thinking that Steve and Tony were both in the right, or neither, but you can’t dismiss the viewpoint of either out of hand. This film also has the enormous good sense to show intelligent characters trying to talk things out before they get to the super-punching – and sometimes even during. The punching, incidentally, features some of the best action scenes of the superhero genre. If you’re going to bend, break or otherwise abuse the laws of physics, you should strive to be this inventive and thrilling. And if you’re going to recruit a full 12 superheroes for your clash, it’s good to see a range of powers, abilities and characteristics as wide as those on display here. As well as those already mentioned, we get Don Cheadle’s dutiful War Machine, Jeremy Renner’s maverick Hawkeye, Paul Rudd’s nervy Ant-Man and Paul Bettany’s serene, super-powerful Vision returning. And amid all these established giants, two newcomers  are thrown in to try to make an impression. Chadwick Boseman authoritatively lays the groundwork for a solo outing as Black Panther, the African royal who’s also a super-warrior. But the real scene-stealer is the third Spider-Man, introduced here, with British actor Tom Holland taking the role and running with it. A motor-mouth teen with a Tony Stark hero complex, Holland’s Peter Parker nabs the funniest lines and injects some welcome lightness into the biggest fight scene. The film – like Age of Ultron – verges on being over-stuffed, and there are times when you can see the gears strain in the attempt to tie together previous films and set up at least four upcoming chapters in the Marvel universe. But thanks to the extraordinary engineering work of screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely and directors Anthony and Joe Russo, this film keeps moving, never losing its sense of purpose. There, it’s like Cap himself. When you know you’re on the right track, you don’t swerve for anyone."
"Apr 26, 2016",POSITIVE," For a while, Captain America: Civil War and Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice were scheduled to release on the same day. In the end, DC blinked first and moved Zack Snyder’s film to March, where it opened to lavish box office figures and mostly poor reviews. 2016’s second superhero smackdown comes courtesy of Marvel Studios, and is the third film in the Captain America series, although in reality it also functions as a sequel to Avengers: Age of Ultron. Anthony and Joe Russo, the sibling directors of the second Captain America film, Winter Soldier, return here after being rewarded for their work by being handed the reins to Marvel’s ultimate, two-part cinematic showdown, Avengers: Infinity War, which begins next year. This project feels like a rehearsal for that one, in that it gathers together a huge amount of larger-than-life characters, most of whom we’ve seen on screen already. The Russo’s job – as it was Joss Whedon’s before them – is to cram a whole load of stuff into a cohesive, entertaining film. On this evidence, Marvel may have put their gargantuan series in two pairs of safe hands. This film adapts a much-liked storyline from the comics, updating it for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, in which Captain America/Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) and Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) are pitted against each other by a moral quandary. In this version, the divisive factor is the Sokovia Accords, a document signed by 117 countries which calls for the Avengers to be brought under the stewardship of the United Nations. Various elements of plot are introduced or resurrected in order to establish the basic setup: Iron Man wants to sign, and Captain America does not. After the scene is set, following on from an action-packed introduction, the film enters a protracted period of calm, taking its time to establish the plot strands that will come together in the final third. And, of course, a massive punch-up between two teams of five superheroes. The problem all directors and screenwriters must get around with Marvel films is how to fit all the constituent elements together in a way that not only makes sense, but is entertaining and feels like it’s going somewhere. Inevitably, some of the pieces are served better than others, but what the Russo brothers have done – and indeed the screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely – is carefully pick and choose their moments. As directors, the Russos clearly have a flair for action – that much was clear in the previous Cap film – and that flair is ramped up here, but the action is not the only positive. They also seem able to tap into that now-familiar Marvel tone – one of complete seriousness interspersed with tongue-in-cheek silliness. It’s that lightness of touch that many feel separates these films from their murkier DC equivalents. Civil War’s tone lies somewhere between the more considered parts of Winter Soldier and the free-wheeling fun of the Avengers films. When the main players are on screen, the film tends to be more serious (Tony Stark’s quick wit is mostly reined in here) but it allows itself a sense of fun, too, primarily when the supporting cast are assembled. The central showdown, for instance, comes after that rather long establishing section. Just as the film is beginning to feel too heavy for its own good, along come Paul Rudd (as Ant Man) and Tom Holland as the new Spiderman (both great), and their presence acts as a catalyst for the film to throw off its shackles and become deliriously entertaining. Just don’t think too hard about the mechanics of what’s going on – the film even makes a joke (through Spiderman) about how silly it all is. Where the film struggles a little is in defining the allegiances and enmities running through its massive cast of characters. It does a fairly decent, if not entirely convincing, job of building a conflict between its two central players, and actually there is some depth in the film’s discussion of responsibility and guilt. The rest of the cast are competing for screen time and, when the fighting starts, the motivations of some of the minor players are thinly sketched at best. Tom Holland is great as the new Spiderman (something I really didn’t expect to be saying, given how well covered the character has been) but his introduction is a weak structural element. The other main new addition to the cast is Chadwick Boseman as Blank Panther, whose storyline is central to the setup of the film, and who handles his role well. The rest of supporting cast are all on good form, even if most of them are reduced to action sidekicks in this narrative. Sebastian Stan has a difficult role as the Winter Soldier, aka Steve Rogers’ old war buddy, but makes it work – particularly through one great line of dialogue. The development of characters such as Scarlett Witch and Vision, for instance, will have to wait until the next Avengers film. As a whole, Civil War is a success. Though it has flaws in its structure and struggles to make all of its characters feel vital, it nevertheless provides a romping action adventure with enough depth and heart to make it feel like an essential part of this ongoing mythology. Thankfully, Marvel has thought about how to vary its action sequences up – nothing falls from the sky and no cities explode in the final third – and the drama in Civil War comes not just from clashing fists, but from an interesting conflict of opinions. It even manages to introduce two new heroes, one of whom the cinema-going audience probably thought it was sick of, and as a bonus has Daniel Bruhl as an underdeveloped but effective third-party villain. In the 2016 battle for superhero supremacy, Marvel has unquestionably delivered the knock-out blow. FAN THE FIRE is a digital magazine about lifestyle and creative culture.

"Apr 25, 2016",POSITIVE,"There is real maturity in a story of guilt, revenge, torn loyalties and tragic revelations - between the fights, explosions, chases and general awesomeness."
"Apr 25, 2016",POSITIVE,"Heroes or vigilantes is the question raised in this highly inventive, full-throttle adventure... An agile mind is required to keep up with the never-ending plot twists and leaps; it is refreshing to find genuine originality and flair"
"Apr 23, 2016",POSITIVE," Captain America by name, Avengers by nature. This latest Marvel movie may be a third solo adventure for the all-American hero Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), but he’s anything but alone. Reuniting all of those spandex-wearing superheroes, bar Thor and the Hulk, for a story that pits Cap against Iron Man (Robert Downey Jnr), it’s an impressive feat of narrative juggling from screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely and sibling co-directors Anthony and Joe Russo. All four collaborated on 2014’s Captain America: The Winter Soldier and will return for the massive two-part The Avengers: Infinity War, due in 2018 and 2019. On this evidence, that double-header is in safe hands. Unlike last year’s Avengers outing Age of Ultron from Joss Whedon, this is leaner and more low-key. It’s less about citywide destruction or alien hordes being repelled than it is mistrust and internal divisions. With a motion put forward to have The Avengers controlled by the UN, it leaves the group divided. Iron Man’s Tony Stark, War Machine’s James Rhodes (Don Cheadle), red-headed android Vision (Paul Bettany) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) are all for it. “We need to be put in check,” argues Stark. And in the blue corner? Freedom fighters Captain America, Scarlett Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Falcon (Anthony Mackie). If you were being cynical, you could argue the whole of Civil War is a set-up for further solo outings. Barnes suddenly finds himself facing off with T’Challa, prince of Wakanda (Chadwick Boseman), whose monarch father was one of the bomb victims. Better known to Marvel fans as the Black Panther, his standalone movie is due in 2018. Fortunately, Boseman, so brilliant as James Brown in 2014’s Get on Up, is an elegant addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. If there’s a disappointment – aside from the returning sharpshooter Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) still with little to do – it’s with the film’s de facto villain. Daniel Brühl, as the mysterious Zemo, has his sights set on Bucky Barnes and The Avengers, but is rather overshadowed by all this superhero ego-bashing. Still, with a third-act twist that gets Iron Man all misty-eyed, Captain America: Civil War is a film that puts characters before carnage. Alongside Joss Whedon’s first Avengers, it’s the best Marvel movie yet."
"Apr 22, 2016",POSITIVE," Since the beginning of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I’ve been delighted by the exploits of Tony Stark, a.k.a. Iron Man, but I’ve been really invested in the story of  Captain America. Both  The First Avenger and  The Winter Soldier were my favorite films in their respective phases, and Steve Rogers, as played by  Chris Evans, has been the standout centerpiece of the whole heroic venture. Following  Avengers: Age of Ultron, the MCU felt like it was getting overfilled with characters and over-complicated in plot, so I went into  Captain America: Civil War with a bit of a “show me what you got” attitude. Not only is it another stellar Cap movie, it’s maybe my favorite Tony Stark movie, and it also proves how you put a million heroes in the same movie effectively. Damn. Twelve movies into the MCU, you’d think there’d be some level of coasting going on in Civil War. But at every turn, the movie feels the need to pull out the stops. The action is incredibly impressive, the cinematography is frenetic and visceral, and each of the heroes gets to shine in his or her own way—even the ones who aren’t in it that much. But the biggest achievement of directors Joe and Anthony Russo and screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely is that they made sure the the story is contingent on characters almost exclusively. The plot itself is deceptively simple, but it’s the way each of the very different characters reacts to it that causes the titular war of Iron aggression. The story begins with Cap, Falcon ( Anthony Mackie), Black Widow ( Scarlett Johansson), and Scarlet Witch ( Elizabeth Olsen) on a mission to track down a villain from a previous movie. Things don’t end up going well—while many innocents are saved, not everyone is. Elsewhere, Tony Stark ( Robert Downey Jr.) is finding it especially hard to live with his mistakes. He and Secretary of State Ross ( William Hurt) come up with an accord that will make the Avengers accountable to the United Nations and not an independent organization any longer. Some of the Avengers sign off—Tony, Widow, Rhodey ( Don Cheadle), and Vision ( Paul Bettany)—but the others don’t, believing they need to stand alone, not beholden to any committee. Meanwhile, someone is very successfully trying to frame Bucky Barnes, the Winter Soldier ( Sebastian Stan), for a bomb that killed the King of Wakanda. The King’s son T’Challa ( Chadwick Boseman) wants revenge, while Cap just wants to bring his friend in alive. Cap believes there’s something fishy going on, but does not want to play by the new rules to figure it out. This inevitably leads to the big centerpiece of the film, in which heroes battle heroes, and we get to meet Spider-Man ( Tom Holland), get acquainted with Ant-Man ( Paul Rudd), and say hello again to Hawkeye ( Jeremy Renner). This scene is easily the best in the movie; it manages to feel dangerous and fun at the same time, a feat in and of itself. Captain America: Civil War feels very refreshing because there isn’t some massive alien entity or evil industrialist or Hydra-guided conspiracy to contend with. It’s the machinations of a small group that culminates in a big, enormous battle with friends fighting friends because of a difference of belief, a shifting of ideals. If Age of Ultron began the fissure between Cap and Tony, this movie changes it into a deep chasm, the likes of which maybe neither of them can handle. Everybody has the right idea about something, but there’s no agreement, no harmony. It’s painful to watch these friends literally come to blows, but it’s to the movie’s credit that you don’t inherently take one’s side over the other. While I still think The Winter Soldier is the best Captain America movie, and by extension my favorite Marvel movie, Civil War is the kind of character drama you don’t normally see in a massive budget superhero movie. It’s got heart, it’s got humor, it’s got genuine emotions, and it allows everybody to have some fantastic scenes with each other. Welcome to the show, Black Panther and young kid Spider-Man. Can’t wait to spend more time with you."
"Apr 21, 2016",POSITIVE," The Russo brothers’ follow-up to Captain America: the Winter Soldier (2014) has been called Avengers 2.5, there are so many of Marvel’s premier superteam on parade here. Indeed, only Thor, Hulk and Nick Fury are missing from action. Using the plot from 2006 Marvel comic-book series Civil War as a basis, the first film of Phase Three of the Marvel movie franchise sees Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) on a mission with Avengers teammates Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) to stop Cap villain Crossbones (Frank Grillo) from causing chaos in Lagos. Unfortunately for the team, the consequences of that confrontation are the last straw for government bigwig General Ross (William Hurt, reprising his role from 2008’s The Incredible Hulk) and it’s decided that all heroes must now register as part of a UN task force… or else. This doesn’t sit well with Evans’s Sentinel of Liberty while Robert Downey Jr’s Iron Man is all for Cap and his team to sign up. Cue a philosophical debate that’s been brewing for a few films now, and allows the two stars to flex some acting muscles for a change, as their characters argue the toss while hoping to save a rapidly fraying friendship. However, verbal disagreements soon turn physical when Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), Cap’s war buddy-turned-brainwashed Hydra assassin the Winter Soldier, appears on the scene and is accused of a terrorist atrocity. The gloves come off and the heroes are forced to take a side. The thumping action then comes thick and fast, as Cap and the Falcon try to save Bucky from capture by the police and the mysterious Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), a new costumed hero with his own very personal reasons for bringing the Winter Soldier down. Inevitably, mixed loyalties result in an epic face-off for Team Cap and Team Iron Man at a (mercifully) deserted airport. It has to be one of the best fight scenes in any Marvel movie as a multitude of superheroes, new recruits (Spider-Man) and old (Hawkeye), are drawn into punch-ups with each other (Cap v Black Panther, Hawkeye v Widow, Cap v Spidey) with one hero undergoing a massive transformation. However, this clash of the titans is a mere prelude to a breathtakingly brutal climax when the physical and emotional toll on the combatants is something to behold. As usual, Downey Jr provides much of the humour (have a guess who he calls “Manchurian Candidate”?), though the nature of this story means he has to exhibit serious chops, too. Evans stoically matches him all the way while newer characters like the Vision (Paul Bettany) and the Scarlet Witch have their moments and offer hints of future storylines. The much-vaunted debut of yet another Spider-Man (Tom Holland is the third Peter Parker in ten years) is actually good fun, thanks to Downey Jr quipping his way through the introduction of the young webslinger to the movie Marvel Universe. The villainous mastermind behind events is a tad anodyne compared to the likes of Loki or Ultron. But this is a minor quibble when the Russos deliver the goods once again and prove to have a safe pair of hands when it comes to pacey, well-choreographed action and accommodating a large starry cast. A good job, too, as they will direct the next two Avengers films (The Infinity Wars) and those epics will contain so many heroes, it will make this stupendous slugfest look like a chamber piece."
"Apr 21, 2016",POSITIVE,"It's a magnificent action film, it's a wonderful character piece, it's big, brash, bursting with confidence and brio; it's Marvel firing on all cylinders just when, by rights, we might be expecting the law of diminishing returns to set in."
"Apr 21, 2016",NEUTRAL," The story: Some months after the events of Avengers: Age Of Ultron, an incident causes the world's governments to demand that the Avengers come under political oversight. A group led by Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) agrees, while another led by Captain America (Chris Evans) refuses. Tensions rise between the two. Meanwhile, a new menace emerges. There is a glimmer of self-awareness in this movie when one character mockingly asks Captain America, on the eve of yet another battle: ""Are you gonna punch your way out of this one too?"" Well yes, he is - that is the point of the movie. And the point of most other superhero flicks, where the spectacle of immovable barrier meeting unbeatable force has become their raison d'etre. And in the Avengers films - which this is in all but name - the emphasis is on team mayhem, on tearing up a city - or in this case, an airport - in the least recyclable way possible. To its credit, the villain is not a deus ex machina alien baddie with powers written to thwart their combined strengths, but a human with a cunning plan. That story takes a while to get its engine revved up, and in a movie two-and-a-half hours long, that first act can feel like an eternity. But once the plot kicks in, things chug along nicely, though action scenes are blighted by shaky camera syndrome. Directors Joe and Anthony Russo do a fine job of the inevitable fan service elements, a job which these days includes lengthy insider references to Marvel books, films and television shows, as well as easing new characters into the ever-expanding universe. The only completely new character would be Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman). The others are new to the Avengers films, including Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and Spider-Man (Tom Holland). It's clear the writers have a ball writing for quip-ready Ant-Man and Spider-Man - the energy level lifts the moment they appear and falls drastically when they leave. Still, as the poster suggests, there is a climactic face-off between Teams Cap and Team Iron Man over the issue of whether the Avengers should remain vigilantes or submit to lawful oversight. Given how much collateral damage their battles cause, it's a wonder why they still need to debate the value of state-sanctioned insurance coverage and medical claims."
"Apr 21, 2016",POSITIVE," The time
has come to pick a side. Either you’re
with me – and you agree that the third installment of the “Captain America”
film series is the second-best movie yet in the Marvel Cinematic Universe – or
you’re against me. Regardless
of which side you’re on, I think we can all agree that “Civil War” is certainly
the biggest, the boldest and the most ambitious movie yet to come from Marvel
Studios since it launched as a stand-alone production entity with the first
“Iron Man” in 2008. But it’s also
bloated, uneven and lacks the focus that defined its superior predecessor,
2014’s “Captain America: Winter Soldier,” which still is the best movie yet in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. That’s
not to say that there isn’t a lot to love about “Civil War,” because there most
definitely is. For one thing, it features
more costumed superheroes than any other Marvel movie to date, including both
“Avengers” films. And it all comes to a
head in one exciting 17-minute showdown at an airport that easily stands as the
best fight scene ever depicted in a comic book-based movie. It also
introduces the cinematic incarnations of not just one, but two new Marvel
superheroes – well, sort of. In addition
to the Black Panther, played by Chadwick Boseman, “Civil War” also introduces
the latest big-screen version of Spider-Man in advance of his stand-alone
reboot (due in 2017), and as perfectly depicted with youthful vigor by newcomer
Tom Holland (“The Impossible”), he virtually swings off with the whole movie. As for
why a civil war has broken out among the Avengers in the first place, it all
comes down to political pressure. Sure,
the Avengers saved the world (twice, actually), but they did so at the expense
of too much collateral damage. Now the
government wants to control them and hold them accountable for their actions –
a move supported, to everyone’s surprise, by Tony Stark, a.k.a. Iron Man
(Robert Downey Jr.). But Steve Rogers,
a.k.a. Captain America (Chris Evans), believes that the team should remain free
to operate without government interference, forcing the rest of the Avengers to
pick a side. Complicating matters
further is the presence of Zemo (Daniel Bruhl), a mysterious villain who has
been pulling the strings on the cataclysmic events leading up to their internal
conflict. While the
prospect of costumed heroes being held accountable for their actions was
recently depicted to a rather underwhelming effect in the disappointing DC
offering “Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice,” there’s no question that the
results are more effective in “Civil War.” That’s because returning screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen
McFeely depict both sides with equal measure, which increases the stakes of
their gripping moral dilemma. But the
strain shows on the efforts of the writers and returning directors Joe and
Anthony Russo to continue the momentum they started on “Winter Soldier” while
expanding the scope – and the cast of characters. The scene where Tony Stark recruits young
Peter Parker (Spider-Man) to join the team is a rousing highlight of the movie,
but the plot device feels somewhat contrived, and the playful tone is a stark
contrast to the sluggish pace of the first hour that preceded it. The
filmmakers fare better when it comes to justifying the presence of characters
like Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), the Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Vision
(Paul Bettany) and the Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen). And after toplining his own hit film from
last summer, Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) adds some fun comic relief to the proceedings,
while the Black Panther has a strong backstory that sets the stage for his
stand-alone film (due in 2018). But as
with previous Marvel entries, Jeremy Renner’s Hawkeye once again misses the
bulls-eye for an effective storyline, while Don Cheadle’s War Machine feels
woefully underutilized. “Civil
War” marks the beginning of Phase 3 for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and it’s
off to a great start. There’s no
question that Marvel threw in everything – including the kitchen sink – to make
it stand out as their biggest movie yet, and they certainly succeeded. But it’s
not the best, and as for where you stand, either you agree and you’re with me,
or you’re against me.  The time has come
to pick a side."
"Apr 21, 2016",POSITIVE," The pressure on Captain America: Civil War lessened a little when it turned out that its main competition, Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice, really wasn’t that great. But even before that, if Marvel was at all worried then it needn’t have been. It seems strange that a Captain America sequel would feel bigger and better than an Avengers team-up, but it really does. Before, our heroes were uniting to take down a common enemy. This time they are dividing to take down each other, and everything is a lot more dramatic because of it. From a technical viewpoint, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has always been above par when it comes to action. That has never been in question; the best the likes of Iron Man, Thor and Captain America have got to give always comes in the form of a boss battle of epic proportions. Marvel Studios is used to taking a swing and aiming for the stars. But things feel a little different in Civil War. Suddenly, the action is brighter, cleverer and far more entertaining. There’s a lot more fighting than there usually is, but it’s not overloaded or repetitive. It’s just insanely fun. Whether it’s a high-speed chase, hand-to-hand combat or a citywide battle, everything this throws at us fight-wise is magnificent. It’s difficult to pick out the cause of the action sequences’ sudden rise in quality, but it could have something to do with the fact that we’re also being bombarded with characters we’re unfamiliar with, namely T’Challa (Chadwick Boseman), aka the Black Panther; Daniel Bruhl’s villainous Helmut Zemo and Peter Parker (Tom Holland), who happens to go by the moniker of Spider-Man. Obviously, everyone knows who Parker is (if you don’t then you need to sort that out), but this shiny, younger version appears to breathe quite a lot of new life into the MCU. Even after only a couple of scenes with him, Marvel’s next phase – which will introduce characters like Doctor Strange, Captain Marvel and the Inhumans to the movie-going audience – feels more within reach than it has ever been. The inclusion of T’Challa also goes a long way towards keeping things fresh and unpredictable. Boseman himself is intriguing and extremely charismatic in the role, and he quickly proves to be complex, freaking awesome and a fantastic subject for a Marvel blockbuster. With all the extra characters that have been brought in from every corner of the MCU, Civil War often relies heavily on gimmicks, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. It’s easy to get fed up of the in-world references and Easter eggs, but it’s easier still to get caught up in a whirlwind of excitement at the sheer magnitude of the world that has been created here. The film’s tone and themes feel a tiny bit darker and a lot more grown-up than usual, but the reaction it provokes is still one of giddy, childlike joy. The combination of directorial duo the Russos’ eye for style and scenes of an epic nature and writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely’s stunning script – character development, superhero quips and all – has resulted in something wonderful here. It’s big, flashy and extremely loud, but it’s also thoughtful, passionate and quite emotional in places. It doesn’t hold back at all. It knows the story it wants to tell, and it tells it wonderfully with characters you can understand, feel for and stand united behind."
"Apr 21, 2016",POSITIVE," Our superheroes have suddenly developed a guilty conscience. After years of gleefully topping skyscrapers, blasting craters into city streets; only now the burden of their destruction drifts into the spotlight. Now is the time for consequences.  Though eternally pitched against each other by the pop culture consciousness in their own personal brand of civil war, Marvel and DC share equally in this new grasped sentiment; almost as if both sensed an abrupt change in the air. Maybe we’re all just suffering from spectacle fatigue, or maybe our collective morality is finally catching up with us: but both Captain America: Civil War and Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice sought to put their own heroes on trial.  Yet, for Marvel, Civil War’s thematic shift plays entirely into the studio’s core identity. This is everything Marvel’s about: the shift, the mutation. It’s deft surfing of each wave whilst always in search of the next. There’s something organic to its strategies here: as Thor’s Shakespearean air falls into Guardians of the Galaxy’s space opera, which falls into Captain America: Winter Soldier’s Cold War thriller.  For Civil War, every lesson learnt in its eight-year history comes to a head; it’s a film so responsive to its past, and that’s why it feels like such a triumph for the studio. Marvel’s learnt from its mistakes; how The Avengers: Age of Ultron felt like a milder entry because it’s straining need to surpass the momentous quality of its predecessor left the levitating city of Sokovia feeling like an empty set piece. Or how Ant-Man’s delights were occasionally cut short with the increasingly obsessive need to advance the cinematic universe’s grander narratives.  Eject the unnecessary, directors Anthony and Joe Russo declared; Civil War needs only to be about two things: character and consequence. Instead of attempting to up the stakes, Civil War’s climactic final battle turns surprisingly intimate; yet, each punch between its sparring heroes is delivered with such emotional force it lands with the weight of an 18-story building.  Even its all-in, airport brawl is one driven almost entirely by its characters’ motivations and personalities, which in turn actually makes it Marvel’s strongest singular sequence yet; it’s nothing short of spectacular whilst saving the need to destroy half a capital city in the process, taking the simple premise of ‘who would win in a fight between X and X’ and running an entire marathon with it. Witty, smart, and inventive; it’s a set piece which lets each character be exactly as audiences want them to be. Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) is pure Ant-Man, Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) is pure Winter Soldier, and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) is pure Black Widow. It’s true, Civil War benefits greatly from the fact we’ve already deeply bonded with these characters; it’s the only reason the Russo brothers could ever hope to achieve the wild task of balance approximately 20,000 main characters in a 2.5-hour film. With the task of defining their core characteristics already played out in length in previous instalments, Civil War needs only drop Captain America (Chris Evans) and Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) into this pre-prepared conflict and watch how those characters would naturally react. Indeed, when the weight of culpability for the Avengers caused civilian causalities comes calling; each character’s reactions and motivations slip so easily into place.  Then, there are the new players: Spider-Man (Tom Holland) and Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman). Civil War has its most fun with the former and his monumental Marvel homecoming, playfully acknowledging how this “new” character is hardly a first introduction to cinematic audiences. Black Panther, meanwhile, is introduced only by his most essential elements. One: he’s royalty, with all the brooding nobility that comes with that mantle. Two: he’s got razor-sharp claws, and they will turn your face into a scratching post if you dare to cross him.  Civil War will certainly be the new favourite Marvel movie of some; others may still prefer the tighter, more contained storytelling of the likes of Guardians of the Galaxy. Its sheer monumental quality was always going to weigh Civil War down to some aspect, and it’s hard to avoid the feeling the film’s designated villain (Daniel Brühl) might as well have been walking around with the words “I’m advancing the plot” branded into his forehead.  Imperfections, however, don’t seem quite as weighty in the face of all that Civil War actually achieves; creating a blockbuster so much more epic in its increased intimacy, becoming more spectacular by reducing its need for spectacle. If Captain America: Civil War is the true herald of Marvel’s Phrase Three and its carefully planned future; maybe it doesn't actually feel so bad that we’ll be getting these movies every year until the Earth collapses in on itself.

"Apr 21, 2016",POSITIVE," 
	The catastrophe earlier this year of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice seemed to bode ill for the state of comic book movies, as well as putting the mockers on further accounts of inter-superhero discord. 
	After the poison, though, comes the antidote. Or Captain America: Civil War, as we shall call it. Take one before bedtime and the outlook will be brighter by morning. 
	Marvel Studios has put a lot of time and energy into creating the Marvel Cinematic Universe, or MCU. (I always get it confused with ICU, which is where the majority of superhero screenplays belong.) 
	In the MCU, characters and storylines from different movies intersect freely and no one stops to ask Iron Man or Black Widow what the devil they think they’re doing in a picture bearing Captain America’s name. 
	Each film aims to function both as a standalone work and a continuation of the ongoing Marvel narrative. This extends even to the in-jokes: a passing reference in this new movie to The Empire Strikes Back reminds us that Lucasfilm, which makes the Star Wars series, is now owned, like Marvel, by Disney. 
	Nothing will ever make this MCU business sound like anything other than the multi-platforming, omni-branding corporate wet dream that it is. But Captain America: Civil War supplies the first indication that what quickens pulses among shareholders may translate equally well into excitement in the stalls. 
	Anyone not up to speed on their comic book folklore will need telling that the Avengers – as showcased in Avengers Assemble and last year’s Avengers: Age of Ultron – are a band of superheroes who have joined together to protect mankind. 
	Thor and the Hulk are on the bench for the new film, but present and correct are Captain America (Chris Evans), with his costume still betraying endearing signs of hand-stitching and his sensibility dependably homespun, Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), whose real superpower is not his sleek tin suit and rocket boosters but his wiseacre banter, and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), who can deliver 100 roundhouse kicks in the time it takes her opponent to notice that she has just emerged from a bombed building without so much as a speck of plaster in her unruffled hair. 
	Extra support comes from Falcon (Anthony Mackie), who is very touchy about having his costume referred to as a “bird suit”, Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), who deploys telekinetic powers, and the Vision (Paul Bettany), who has a red leather face and puts an amused, Jeeves-like spin on lines such as: “My amygdala is synthetic.” 
	As Captain America: Civil War begins, there is an air of disharmony about the casualties and chaos incurred during spectacular superhero rescue missions. With no structure for accountability, it is proposed to the Avengers by the US Secretary of State (William Hurt) that they should sign the Sokovia Accords, which will make them answerable to the UN. 
	Iron Man is heading the “Yes” camp: he’s feeling the guilt after being berated by a woman whose son he accidentally killed. Without limitations on their powers, he argues, the Avengers are no better than the bad guys. But Captain America is resisting. What if the UN were to dispatch the Avengers on missions with which they did not agree, or refuse to send them to places where they were desperately needed? 
	This escalates from a difference of opinion to a full-on slugfest when Captain America’s old pal Bucky, aka the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), enters the fray. He’s an engaging enough chap under normal circumstances. But in the hands of anyone who discovers the incantation that triggers him into action, he becomes an unstoppable killing machine. Well, we’ve all got our flaws. 
	Unfortunately, a shadowy figure (Daniel Brühl) with vengeance on his mind gains access to the Winter Soldier. Now it’s going to take a bit more to placate Iron Man than Captain America claiming that ol’ Bucky is really a stand-up guy once you get to know him. 
	The plot is so satisfyingly worked out, and the foundations for the hostilities in the second half of the film so carefully prepared, that you want to take aside the makers of Batman v Superman (who thought it was motivation enough just to have one superhero mistakenly believe that the other was running amok) and say to them: See? This is how it’s done. It’s not so hard, is it? 
	It helps also that there is nuance and colour here. The characters are multi-layered, crammed full of old allegiances and grudges and irritations. They have personalities. Remember those? 
	The pleasure of the Avengers films was always in the dialogue – those movies tend to go to pot once the banging and the crashing begins – but in Captain America: Civil War there’s a sharper feel for the tempo and shading required in a film of such scale. The directors Joe and Anthony Russo don’t neglect detail, even when things get hectic. 
	Each battle looks different, down to the lighting and production design. The clear highlight is the central showdown between all the superheroes on an airstrip. This long fight sequence hits lots of contrasting notes, with comic relief provided by Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and a rejuvenating debut outing from the new Spider-Man, played by the 19-year-old British actor Tom Holland. He’s a nerdy chatterbox even in action (“I don’t know if you’ve been in a fight before, but there’s not usually this much talking,” Falcon chides him, mid-combat). 
	And he gets a choice speech about the superhero calling: “If you can do the things I do and you don’t, and then the bad things happen – then it’s because of you.” Not as snappy, perhaps, as “With great power comes great responsibility” but certainly less portentous. 
	Putting him slap-bang in the middle of this movie is yet another instance of the Marvel PR engine in overdrive: his appearance here is essentially an inbuilt trailer for the forthcoming Spider-Man reboot. But what can I say? I didn’t want to see the next Spider-Man and now I do. It worked. 
	There is still the sense, as there was with Batman v Superman, that all this fretting and fallout over the negative side of superheroes was dealt with perfectly adequately more than a decade ago in Pixar’s The Incredibles. That film showed how easily the public could turn against those who protected them: a man whose suicide attempt was foiled by a superhero, for example, then brought a lawsuit against the superhero for injuries incurred during that intervention. 
	That’s old ground. And there was never going to be a wealth of peril in a movie that is basically two franchises having a dust-up. Marvel wouldn’t dare slaughter any of its cash cows – not while they’re still calves. 
	But at least Captain America: Civil War shows that a blockbuster need not be flatfooted in its pursuit of serious subjects. It can still soar – and probe. Watching Iron Man and Captain America flail and kick and jab in the dirt, drawn into a cyclone of potentially infinite revenge, it becomes apparent that it’s not really about them at all. It’s about us."
"Apr 21, 2016",POSITIVE,"There are still imperfections to be found in this Marvel offering, but when the highs are this good, it's hard not to temporarily give in to our new insect overlords."

Does any of this sound familiar? Two iconic heroes duking it out over two-and-a-half epic hours… Angsty agonising over the collateral damage that ensues… Cameos from multiple costumed crusaders, just to make sure we’re suitably hyped for the next ten movies. But luckily, ‘Captain America: Civil War’ is packed to bursting with the one ingredient its rival superhero smackdown ‘Batman v Superman’ lacked: joy. Which isn’t to say ‘Civil War’ is threat-free and happy-clappy. This is a film about the violent end of a friendship and the moral questions that come with free will, so it’s hardly a party. No, this is the kind of joy that comes with crafting characters people can relate to, with designing action scenes that spring and spin and bound off the screen, with picking just the right moment for a tension-breaking gag, a pause for reflection or a rousing speech. It's the joy of making a movie for and about people. We find our heroes at a crossroads. The earth-shattering events of ‘Avengers: Age of Ultron’ have left the authorities – and many of the Avengers – questioning their role in world affairs. Enter William Hurt’s politician with an ultimatum: submit to UN oversight, or cease all crimefighting activities. Ridden with guilt, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) agrees. But Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) isn’t sold, especially as the first order of business is to eliminate his childhood friend-turned-crazed assassin, Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan). None of this is especially original – the ‘Watchmen’ comics covered similar ground three decades ago. But it’s rich pickings for character conflict, and that’s what ‘Civil War’ cares most about: not just between Cap and Iron Man, but between dimension-benders Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision (Paul Bettany), between old friends Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), and between newcomer Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and basically everyone. But fear not, there’s also some light relief in the form of Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and a nerdy teenage Spider-Man (Tom Holland). Directors Joe and Anthony Russo juggle all these elements impressively: for every awkward franchise requirement (like Martin Freeman’s here-and-gone-again military man), there’s another that slots effortlessly into place – Holland’s introduction as Peter Parker is one of the sweetest scenes in the series. A nagging sense of incompleteness means that ‘Civil War’ isn’t quite as satisfying as the first ‘Avengers’ (it’s all building up to the ‘Infinity War’ two-parter in 2018). But overall, this is Marvel at their best: a pacey, intelligent super-sized blockbuster and a roaringly fun night out.

"Apr 20, 2016",NEUTRAL," The Russo brothers return with Captain America: Civil War, pitting two of Marvel’s favourite sons against each other – but are you #TeamCap or #TeamIronman? Swathes of superheroes go at it and action abounds, but at the core of this film is not the light-hearted frolics of Joss Whedon’s Avengers outings. Instead, this is something a little more confused, overly-long, but nevertheless an entertaining blockbuster with a few surprising decisions thrown in. Following the Battle of New York, the destruction of Sokovia and numerous other catastrophes indirectly caused by the Avengers, it is decided by the world’s governments that these heroes need to be brought into check.The UN and US Secretary of State General Ross (William Hurt) step forward as the ones to do it with a brick of a document dubbed The Sokovia Accord, backed by a war-weary Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.). Captain America (Chris Evans) is immediately suspicious, primarily because he has seen what corrupt powers-that-be can do with super-weapons, namely his war buddy James “Bucky” Barnes (Sebastian Stan). Each hero picks their side. Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and the aforementioned Winter Solider decide to go rogue after the discovery of a mysterious plot by a former Sokovian solider, Helmut Zemo (Daniel Brühl), to unearth a mysterious covert-op that took place in 1991. Meanwhile, Stark and his loyal band – War Machine (Don Cheadle), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Vision (Paul Bettany) and new addition Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) – decide that Cap and comrades need to be brought into check. The pitch is simple enough – liberalism or totalitarianism, heroes or vigilantes – and it has more than a whiff of American imperialism on both sides of the coin. The Russo brothers manage to navigate the territory to the level the genre demands, bringing back the spy-thriller movie credentials demonstrated in The Winter Soldier. It’s this that holds our attention rather than the bombast of the fight scenes. Civil War truly shines when we get extended dialogues, best of all when they include Downey Jr., who again brings his always reliable level of depth to Iron-Man. A particularly fine moment of sees Stark decide that he needs backup in the form of everyone’s friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man (Tom Holland), who gives a brief yet highly entertaining turn as the web-slinger. The two compare notes on why they took up the superhero mantle and Stark leaves assured that Spidey is his Spider-homey. No origin stories here, thankfully. There are also some credible ‘real-world’ issues thrown in along the way by screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeel. The problem then, perhaps, is that the Russo brothers – now locked in for two more Avengers: Infinity War sequels – insist on far too many samey Bourne-style chase-chat-fight scenes, padding out Civil War to a whopping two-and-a-half hours (including credits). There’s a certain bloatedness to much of the first half, while the film in general lacks the balance of humour to hard-hitting found in Shane Black’s superb Iron Man 3 and/or Whedon’s two Avengers outings. Fortunately, unlike the abysmal Batman v Superman, Captain America: Civil War just about gets away with its flaws with through sheer swagger alone, in no doubt that it’s the superhero showdown fans have so keenly awaited."
"Apr 20, 2016",POSITIVE,Puts a certain other superhero vs superhero movie to shame.
"Apr 20, 2016",NEUTRAL," Let’s just assume for one short second that Captain America is supposed to represent his namesake – the good ol’ USA. What he does and the decisions he makes are hardwired back to some ineluctable founding father ideals, ideals so rocksteady that even Honest Abe would be tipping his stovepipe in accordance. In Anthony and Joe Russo’s Captain America: Civil War, our eponymous hero forgoes sanctions that would see his “enhanced”, snap-talkin’, pain-bringin’ crew answer to some higher power. Complying with legislated protocol would mean they wouldn’t be allowed to foil evil as and when they choose or bring peace to the world on their own timetable. A major bungle during a routine mission in Lagos leaves gurning, hockey-masked bad dudes stiff in a box, but there’s a fair amount of human collateral damage too, which looks bad in the papers. This is a film about the mouse that roared. It’s about one of those ticked-off bystanders who witnesses these rippling emissaries of justice doing their thing and thinks, ‘This ain’t right.’ But maybe the death of innocents is mere political martyrdom – a necessary sacrifice for the greater good. Can we do anything valuable in this world without it having some kind of negative fallout? So yes, we’re right back to Superhero 101 with this one – is vigilantism a valid method of policing? Should a wider system of ethics be in place? Should the energies of these vigilantes be guided by the will of a democratically elected global coalition? The big problem at the end of it all is that everyone has a different definition of “good”. Which is bad. Instead of mithering and dithering, Captain America says a long and loud, “No!” For him, it’s all about doing what’s right for the people, so long as it’s what he decides is right for the people. Evil will be gauged by his own personal metric, and he won’t be swayed by the decisions of others. This prevents him from becoming a weapon; the unfortunate fate of his war buddy and brainwashed Ruskie assassin, Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan). It’s not his fault he is able to do what he does. And it’s not his fault that he is physically unable to let tyranny go unpunished. So here we have a superhero who uses brute force to apply his iron will… hmm, sounds a little fishy to us. But isn’t this the endgame for every superhero movie? Is it even possible to have a superhero film which isn’t implicitly fascistic? The spoiler-title tells you exactly which party you should be backing. Ethically and politically, the film has a lot to answer for (unless you happen to love totalitarianism). But at least it stridently endorses something and doesn’t just throw out a load of half-hearted hypotheticals to give the illusion of depth. Captain America isn’t a fascist in the historical sense, but he does display certain… tendencies. It’s weird that no-one in the room is able to step up and tell him, ‘Dude, I think what you’re espousing is, like, totally undemocratic.’ It’s also handy that Robert Downey Jr’s “hyperverbal” Tony Stark doesn’t go there, as we might otherwise never have witnessed one of the most cogent and beautifully choreographed fight sequences in the superhero genre. That it occurs in the light, airy environs of an Eastern European landing strip on a crisp morn makes it all the more enticing and balletic. It’s like watching a perfectly matched game of football, with both teams on the offensive. There are a lot of characters, and many get their moment to shine. But not everyone is so lucky. Don Cheadle’s War Machine is the lame duck of the pack, beaten to a sorry pulp at every moment where it really matters. Bucky has a big metal arm in place of charisma, which is a shame. Cap is a hunk of seething self-righteousness with an enviable jawbone. Unlike Batman, he’s entirely comfortable with his creed of savage diplomacy, which actually makes him come across as a psychopath. The female characters (Scarlet Johansson’s Black Widow and Elizabeth Olsen’s Scarlet Witch) get a little time in the limelight before being hastily sidelined for the grand finale. Chadwick Boseman is introduced as Black Panther, whose special power is that he has little tiny nails to scratch you with. Extended cameos from Spider-Man and Ant-Man are bundled in as inter-episode liveners. In terms of character, dialogue and story, this is same ol’, same ol’. Calling this “the best Marvel movie” is equivalent to proclaiming “this is the best Dorito I’ve ever tasted.” But the Russos do make some wise decisions. Time is given over to lengthy sequences in which characters just talk. And they don’t talk directly about the themes of the film, or what’s going to happen in the next scene, but they subtly couch these ideas within semi-interesting conversations which have the perfume of realism to them. Which is big. The film is also content with the fact that the external threat doesn’t have to be as big or as mean or as threatening as the internal one. The “Civil War” nomenclature isn’t a sell out (paging Batman V Superman!) as the film explores a rift that can’t be instantly healed with the diversion of a common foe. But what the film ends up being about isn’t a choice between democracy and fascism, but between having Marvel movies and not having Marvel movies. If these characters suddenly accept that they should be fully accountable for their actions, they are accepting that they no longer want to be superheroes, but bureaucrats. Captain America isn’t fighting for freedom – he’s fighting for the franchise. So #VoteCap.

"Apr 20, 2016",POSITIVE," Twelve films and a sniff over $9 billion in box-office receipts later, it can be hard to remember a time when the prospect of a Marvel Cinematic Universe felt like a gamble. But back in 2008, Iron Man was more or less exactly that: a mid-budget blockbuster from an untested studio, starring an actor of then-uncertain pulling power, and centring on a character with then-untested mass-market appeal. In short, it was exactly the kind of risk that Hollywood almost never takes any more. Why not? Because it’s too busy making films like Iron Man. Eight years on from that initial bet, Captain America: Civil War is the point at which the Kilimanjaro of chips Marvel has accrued since are triumphantly cashed in. Civil War isn’t just the 13th and latest Marvel Studios film, but the franchise’s long-quested-for peak. Joe and Anthony Russo’s film asks you not just to thrill to the escapades of its 12-strong superhero ensemble, but to invest in them as deeply as you would the leads in a long-form serial drama. In doing so, it draws on entire films’-worth of groundwork, detonating emotional time-bombs you didn’t even know had been rigged.  If you’ve been following the story so far, but still doubt you could get misty-eyed over Captain America/Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) and Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) knocking CGI stuffing out of one another in a Siberian bunker – well, here is the film to prove you wrong. The extensively trailed Cap vs Iron Man title fight is prompted by an ideological split at Avengers HQ. The UN wants to bring our heroes under control – and one six-strong faction, led by Stark, and including Scarlett Johansson’s now-indispensable Black Widow, readily signs up. But half a dozen more – Rogers, Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) – go rogue, sensing malign forces at work. Naturally, they’re right: a mysterious doctor (Daniel Brühl) is digging into Bucky’s past as a Hydra assassin, and particularly a 1991 mission, which the film revisits in fog-wreathed flashbacks. Discord is part of the plan. Newcomers will be hopelessly lost, but that’s part of the clubby fun. The time for introductions was years ago: when the new Spider-Man (a scene-stealing Tom Holland) shows up, he excitedly starts to recount his now-threadbare origin story, only to be cut off by Downey Jr before he gets to the radioactive bite.  All the background the film gives you to cheer on franchise newcomer Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) – and it’s more than enough – comes in two taut scenes between the Wakandan warrior prince and his father (John Kani). Boseman delivers his dialogue in a coiled East African purr that rounds out his character as quickly and evocatively as Stark’s garrulous Manhattan twang. The film may be two-and-a-half hours long, but it’s surprising how little time is wasted. Throughout, the control of tone is pin-precise. The film’s centrepiece action sequence – a six-on-six battle royale on a German airfield – feels like the lavishly enjoyable last word on a thousand ""who would win in a fight between…"" playground arguments, while Downey Jr and Evans’s climactic battle, though it deploys much of the same computer-generated whizz-bang, is startlingly heavy with heartbreak. At the root of that is Civil War’s greatest strength – and the reason it makes all thought of the recent Batman v Superman debacle evaporate on contact. The Russos’ film has an unshakeable faith in these decades-old characters: they’re not wrangled into standing for anything other than who they are, with no gloss or reinterpretation or reach for epic significance required. This is the cinematic superhero showdown you’ve dreamt of since childhood, precisely because that’s everything – and all – it wants to be. "
"Apr 19, 2016",POSITIVE," Should the Avengers be nationalised? This is the explosively controversial idea that ignites a “civil war” among their ranks in this exciting superhero extravaganza. It’s crazily surreal, engaging and funny in the best Marvel tradition, building to a whiplash-twist reveal that sports with the ever-present idea of duplicity and betrayal within the Avengers’ ranks themselves. The innumerable civilian deaths and collateral damage that always follow the Avengers’ spectacular city-pulverising showdowns have become impossible to ignore – and now the Avengers are faced with having to submit to UN political oversight and control. After a catastrophic Avengers action in Lagos that resulted in Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) inadvertently trashing part of a building and killing innocent people, a political summit in Vienna is convened in which the Avengers must sign away their superheroic independence. It’s an unthinkable humiliation – the superhero equivalent of the Treaty of Versailles. And some of them aren’t having it. Captain America (Chris Evans) makes a stand for the Avengers’ autonomy. Lining up behind him are the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Scarlet Witch. But ranged against him, deciding to go along with the new political reality, is Tony Stark, otherwise known as Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), and joining him are War Machine (Don Cheadle), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Vision (Paul Bettany). But wait. However real these divisive issues are, might they have been deliberately triggered by a sinister German agent, persuasively played by Daniel Brühl, who sets out to exploit the dangerous, destructive potential within Winter Soldier – a dark secret dating back to a 1991 Russian military experiment revealed in flashback? And just to make things even more lively, and even more confusing, there are two late team entries – Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and also Spider-Man, in which role Tom Holland makes his bow, and they are seductively high-spirited and hilarious, their essential absurdity and gaiety an essential part of the Marvel alchemy that somehow feeds into the Avengers’ intense seriousness and idealism. The final punch-up is of course spectacular, its collisions and detonations greeted with some outrageous one-liners. So what is the political significance of the Avengers’ civil war? Is Captain America’s team the face of the libertarian right, scorning the dead hand of big government and the nanny state? Are Iron Man’s crew the standard bearers of centrist social democracy? How strange that Captain America, a military man from the FDR era, should scorn hierarchical control. How curious that Tony Stark, that fearless entrepreneur and risk-taker, should submit to bureaucracy. And there is incidentally not much to be gained from analysing the two teams’ identity politics. The gender balance is the same in both cases, although with twice as many African-Americans, Iron Man’s team has the edge in diversity.  No, what is obvious that there really is no real ideological difference between them. Even when they are bashing and thrashing each other – this time in an environment where there will be no collateral damage – what is all too clear is that their profound love and Avenger-y fellowship is undamaged. And no one much cares for the idea of state control and those boring, besuited politicians and functionaries, here played by William Hurt and Martin Freeman.  The best scene comes in the middle where Tony Stark has to recruit Spider-Man – a long, sarcastic chat, in which Stark drolly derides Peter Parker’s arachnid “onesie”. The civil war is not one that anyone expects to be “won” in any permanent sense although the title might lead you to expect that Captain America will emerge as the most important combatant: it is, after all, supposed to be his movie. In fact, Chris Evans’s relative lack of charisma is still a (minor) problem. He gets upstaged by Downey, and almost everyone else. But not by much. It’s a huge aspartame rush of a film: a giant irresistible snack, not nutritious, but very tasty. "
"Apr 15, 2016",NEGATIVE," Before I have this incredibly difficult conversation with Marvel, let me get something straight. I am, and always will be, a defender of superhero movies. You’ll never see me writing a thinkpiece about how the genre is decaying, or how all of these movies are the same. In fact, I found Captain America: The Winter Soldier to be not just the greatest superhero film of the past decade, but one of the greatest films in any genre. At their best, these movies are absolutely monumental, and Marvel has been at the eye of this hurricane of quality for quite some time. Nobody had more faith than me in directors Joe and Anthony Russo (who return from Winter Soldier) to take on Civil War, perhaps the most emotionally dense and powerful Marvel story. Which is why as I drove home from my energetic, cheer-filled screening, it took me about an hour to realize just how let down this movie made me feel. The film picks up with the events of the cataclysmic Sokovia battle from Age of Ultron still fresh in everyone’s mind. Even so, Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie), Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johanson), and Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olson) are still carrying out Avengers missions. That is until a disastrous mistake by Wanda causes a deadly building explosion. Now, the government wants to get involved, putting forth a new law called the Sokovia Accords, that would only allow superheroes to act under government supervision. At the forefront of this new order is none other than Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), which starts to create great tension between not only those two, but all of The Avengers as they start to choose sides. Meanwhile, Rogers’s quest to find Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) finally comes to a head, as he finds himself acting outside the law in order to help him. This makes him a fugitive from not only the government, but from T’Challa (Chadwick Boseman), a prince/warrior from a country called Wakanda, who believes that Bucky murdered his father. This is a movie that much like its characters splits itself between two identities. One is a carefree summer blockbuster, and the other is a legitimate film that is trying to tell a real story. As a blockbuster, the film largely succeeds. In many ways, this is the closest Marvel has come yet to recapturing the childlike energy of The Avengers. The Russo Brothers showed a keen eye for action last time around, and here they get to take that eye to the next level with plenty of new toys to play with. We still get a bit the very Bourne-like chases and close quarter scuffles of Winter Soldier, but the real centerpiece here is an incredible mid-film rumble between all of our favorite characters. If you’re a superhero fan, there’s no way to over-hype this scene, and on its own terms, it’s one of the coolest comic book set-pieces ever put on film. It certainly helps that Paul Rudd’s Ant-Man and a brand spanking new Spider-Man played with geeky (if slightly grating) charm by Tom Holland are essentially thrown into the film just to pump this sequence up. For many, this will be worth the price of admission alone, and I cannot blame anybody in the slightest for that. However, the film falls incredibly short both in the execution of the story and the tone. This was supposed to be the film that breaks the entire Marvel universe, but so rarely actually goes to the places that promise suggests. In fact, the majority of the movie is very light on its feet and more concerned with getting us to the next action sequence or joke than with giving us something to chew on. The conflicts that arise between these characters for the most part just feel so jovial and cartoonish that it’s impossible to take things seriously. Sure, these people are friends, but that should be the most painful part of this whole thing, not the most fun. In fact, the film is so light on story that you could almost forget there is one if you’re not paying attention. Sure, we’ve got a threatening villain pulling the strings in Baron Zemo (who is chillingly played by Daniel Bruhl), but he so rarely appears that he essentially comes off as an extra. For the most part, the cast seems to be on autopilot here. Evans frankly looks a little bored, as Steve is borderline uninvested in anything but his friendship with Bucky the whole time, which makes his rift with Stark fall incredibly flat. The supporting players are basically all hitting one note; Mackie, Holland, Renner and Rudd are the quippers, while Don Cheadle, Johansson and Olsen are the more dour sticks in the mud. These aren’t characters; they’re action figures (especially the two bug men). Only two performances really stand out from the pack. Downey Jr. gives us his most vulnerable turn as Tony Stark yet, really playing into the pain that this conflict makes him feel. Problem is, he’s only in about a third of the movie, as it is a Captain America movie after all, making the moral quandary feel incredibly one sided. The other is Boseman, who introduces us to an incredible character in his Black Panther. This is an excellently skilled warrior unconcerned with the politics and friendships of everybody else, solely concerned with avenging his father and protecting his kingdom. However, what does it say about the movie that the character most identifiable is the one that does not care about what is going on in the story? Most annoyingly, the little darkness that does rear its head in the film ends up being a complete smoke and mirrors act. This movie is so toothless that you’ll probably pay for your ticket in a paper cup on the side of the road. When it finally decides to become the emotional story it should have been the entire time in the last fifteen minutes, it chickens out of delivering a legitimate emotional gut punch. Everything just fizzes to a stop, essentially losing all of the momentum that it builds up just by the sheer force of its energy. However, it’s so concerned with keeping everything in line for future movies that it ultimately takes no risks, and I’m just about done giving rewards for that. Captain America: Civil War is in many ways a well assembled summer movie. The action and humor really sing, and the film goes at such a fast pace that its flaws simply may not matter to some. I genuinely wish I could be one of those people, but this time, I just can’t. This was the film that was supposed to change everything, and it changes absolutely nothing. It only occasionally will bring out the human touch that makes for the best of the Marvel films, which is borderline unforgivable in a story that was so clearly supposed to be fueled by emotion. Ultimately, this is the movie that feels like it was made by the directors of You, Me, and Dupree. Going into the film I was emphatically team Cap; now I’m team nobody.

"Apr 15, 2016",POSITIVE," In  2014 Captain America: The Winter Soldier was released and changed the game for Marvel films. Anthony and Joe Russo directed a film that felt different from any of its predecessors. Gone were the superhero cliches, evil super villains and played out story lines. Instead the Russo Brothers chose to create an espionage thriller dealing with current event issues with a backdrop of an incredibly compelling relationship between the hero and the villain. What resulted was perhaps the most complete and refreshing entry into the Marvel collection and an overwhelming response for the Russo Brothers. They were asked to direct the next two Avengers films and also revisit the world of Captain America with the latest entry into the franchise; Captain America: Civil War.  Captain America Civil War is completely different from any other comic book movie. The storyline of the film is something far greater than good vs evil. Both deal with very serious moral issues that are not black and white and there is no clear wrong or right side.  Winter Soldier dealt with the use of unlimited power. The main question that film raised was if the government had the potential to prevent any terrorist attack or threat to our safety should we allow that? Or would the access to that power become a threat to all of our well being? In Civil War the question that the Russo Brothers film brings up is how much power should the Avengers be trusted with? Should they have complete unlimited power? And does their power to protect us instead become a threat to all of us? Civil War works so well because of an incredible script and solid, imaginative direction, but it would be nothing without its cast. The stellar writing of this film allow the actors to be people with emotions instead of walking, talking costumes with superpowers. The incredible additions to the cast shows the credibility of the script. Adding amazing talents of new and old such as William Hurt, Martin Freeman, Daniel Bruhl and the fantastic Chadwick Boseman. There also is the clever and incredibly hilarious addition of Spider-Man played by Tom Holland.  It is hard to think of anything this film does wrong. But there is one thing this film does better than any film I can ever remember.  
The line between good and evil is usually something so clearly drawn out in any film one goes to see. There is typically right and wrong and the audience usually has a shared interest and a clear nudge in who and what to root for. In Civil War that is completely thrown out. The Marvel franchise has done such a beautiful job in creating so many characters we know and love; they make us cheer, they make us laugh and they can make us truly care for them. In perhaps the greatest scene in any Marvel film ever these characters square off against each other in a battle for what both sides believe is right and good.  It is an incredible test of emotions for the viewer. These are all people we love who are attacking the other people we love. It is hard to imagine a similar moment in film where this was handled so eloquently and so well. Zack Snyder could have learned so much from every frame of this film. Captain America: Civil War is the best comic book film since The Dark Knight. This is due to the filmmakers choosing not to just make a great superhero movie, but instead make a great film that blurs the line of what the world expects from them. While The Dark Knight was an incredibly heavy film that felt more like a Scorsese gangster classic with a man dressed as a bat, Civil War feels like a genre clash of all that is good. It has moments that are very dark, but it is so quick to follow up with fun surprises, huge laughs and thrilling action sequences. It’s nearly a perfect comic book film.  The Russo Brothers are continuing to raise the bar for the Avengers, Marvel and themselves. It was hard to expect a better film than Winter Soldier and they somehow pulled it off. Over the next three years they will direct both additions to the Avengers franchise with Infinity War Part I and Part II. Have they set the bar too high? Perhaps, but if there was any two people to trust with taking the Marvel franchise to an even higher high, it is. Anthony and Joe Russo."
"Apr 14, 2016",POSITIVE," Summer 
box
 office season officially kicks off May 6th, when the biggest genre in the world sees the arrival of what could turn out to be its absolute biggest entry to date. Marvel will attempt to prove the superhero genre isn't remotely in danger of suffering from audience ""fatigue,"" and that the Marvel Cinematic Universe is prepared to elevate the genre's fortunes to a whole new level when Captain America: Civil War storms into theaters the first weekend of May. How high it climbs, and what that means for superhero cinema as a whole, depends on several factors -- all of which seem to lean heavily in Civil War's favor. Let me take a moment to offer an unfortunately necessary note here: I've been accused repeatedly and falsely in recent weeks of being ""biased"" in favor of Zack Snyder and DC Comics, of being ""paid"" to give good reviews and defend Batman v Superman, and all sorts of other ignorant, rude nonsense. I take my work and my work ethics very seriously, and so I'm not amused when some angry and resentful person makes false, absurd, uninformed accusations of that sort simply because I (gasp!) dare to like a movie they dislike. Luckily for me, many of you readers were kind enough to defend my integrity against those ridiculous accusations, and many of you shared my love of the film Batman v Superman. So I would ask all of you who defended me, and who rightly denounced the ugly accusations that I was ""paid"" to give a positive review to that film, to remember how it feels when you see such negative attacks on films you love and on reviews you agree with, and to avoid doing the same sort of thing toward reviews about Civil War. My assessment and review here are based on my firm beliefs and analysis, and my personal feelings about the film and its box office chances, plain and simple, as are all of my reviews. Anyone who thinks I'm biased is right -- I'm biased in favor of good films, good ideas, good acting, and good storytelling. I am also certainly biased in favor of superhero genre movies in general, since I love this genre and the medium it adapts, and I don't remotely apologize for that bias. Nor should I, nor should any of you who are biased in favor of comics or superhero films, or in favor of whatever particular tastes you have. We should all remember that, and apply those standards not only for ourselves, but for everyone else. Including, by the way, when it's hard to do so -- if we want to elevate the discourse, to move beyond petty insults and squabbling among fans about one company or the other, and if we want people to respect our own preferences and tastes and treat them seriously, then we have to behave the way we want everyone else to behave, even when the other people aren't doing so. That's the only way things change, and the only way we deserve respectful treatment ourselves. If we don't, and if we get down into the mud to wrestle and argue and insult other companies and groups of fans with accusations and claims that reviews are ""paid for"" and so on, then we have no business being angry if our favorite films and our opinions are treated in the same negative fashion. I think it's very possible Civil War will wind up with the largest opening weekend gross in Marvel Studios history. North of $200 million is likely, and I'd not be surprised by something in the $220 million neighborhood. I expect the final worldwide cume will almost certainly approach Avengers levels or exceed them, but at the very least we should expect a minimum performance (if in theory it got only average reviews and okay but not stellar audience reactions) of maybe $800-900 million and more likely -- get ready, here comes that number again -- $1 billion. But here's the big call, are you ready? I'm going out on a limb to say Civil War might possibly become the first Marvel movie to do as much as $2 billion. Yes, this is a Captain America movie and a sequel to The Winter Soldier. That film did $714 million two years ago with an April release date, and received widespread critical and audience acclaim to the tune of a Rotten Tomatoes score of 89% and a Cinemascore of ""A."" The same creative team return for Civil War, and deliver a film even better and more emotionally resonant than the previous one, so that alone should give it a bump above the prior box office tally. However, as much as it's a sequel to a Captain America movie, this is undeniably also an Avengers film -- literally, because it's about the Avengers and has the Avengers in it, in a story linked directly to the events of Avengers: Age of Ultron; and figuratively, because the ensemble cast, marketing, and concept all add up to a loud-and-clear message that audience can and should expect this to play as an Avengers sequel as well as a Captain America sequel. In that regard, Civil War feels very much like all of the fun, re-watchability, and large-scale summer ""event"" blockbuster of 2012's The Avengers, distilled through the filmmaking sensibilities of The Winter Soldier. So take the good will and coattails of Cap's previous sequel movie, and imagine how that would translate into box office bang for an Avengers sequel that is the true heir to The Avengers' throne. Now add in the finest big-screen adaptation of Spider-Man to date, one instantly capable of making you forget all of the previous Spider-Man movies (which are great, don't get me wrong here). Spider-Man sells more merchandise annually than Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman combined. He is a massive global brand, even when his cinematic shine has lost some luster in the eyes of the public -- and to put it bluntly, $700+ million is the worst-case of what it looked like when Spider-Man ""loses some of his luster."" So putting him into an Avengers-Winter Soldier sequel mashup will pay huge dividends. Even without him, Civil War was going to have a strong chance at hitting revenue levels on par with Avengers, so with Spider-Man I think the odds strongly favor a final worldwide box office total of $1.5+ billion, the ceiling being $2 billion (surely a sky-high prediction, but this is the first time I think such a number is even possible to contemplate for a superhero film). Make no mistake, if it takes anything north of $750-800 million, then it's still obviously a huge success. If it does $1 billion, then it's a new era for expectations at Marvel when it comes to their solo franchises. And if it winds up taking less than Age of Ultron -- say, for example, maybe $1.3 billion -- then it still becomes a gigantic hit with few peers in the genre. So $1.5 billion isn't a bar for success, it's just the level I firmly believe this movie will play at and in fact exceed if everything lines up right for it. Part of things lining up will be getting strong critical praise, and I think that's a given. The film might wind up with the best overall critical reviews of the MCU releases, although Iron Man's 94% at Rotten Tomatoes from 2008 will be tough to beat since even The Avengers fell a tad shy of the mark with its 92% score. So far, Civil War enjoys a 100% rating, though that's destined to fall as at least a few negative reviews are presumably inevitable. The final score will probably be in the 90+% range, and I cannot fathom a score lower than perhaps 85-89% as the lowest end of realistic estimates. And I do not remotely believe audience will give it anything less than an ""A-,"" and more likely an ""A"" or ""A+."" That's the sort of buzz and positive word of mouth that points to a massive opening weekend and long legs, which is precisely why I think it will finish in the Avengers tier of box office performance. But does the film live up to those expectations and buzz? Read on for my full review and find out! Eight years and twelve previous films have provided a foundation of serialized storytelling, expansive world-building, deep character development, and widespread familiarity for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. So culturally significant are these stories, the new films can reference past events and even prior conversations from years ago with just a simple line or image, and we all immediately understand. And when it happens, we don't just recognize it -- we relate to it, we feel it, and we react emotionally. Captain America: Civil War is more than just the payoff for Phase Two of the MCU. It's more than a game-changing setup for Phase Three of the MCU. Civil War is the inevitable culmination of all of the superhero decisions and events for these past eight years, an unavoidable fate brought about due to the implications of unilateral actions -- good and bad -- by the Avengers and each individual member. It was always going to come down to this, a choice that defines how each hero sees themselves and how they see the world around them. So it's striking and brilliant that the choice made by each hero today, in this film, is in no small measure a contradiction of their previous perception of themselves and their world. Ask these same questions, put this same force in front of them eight years ago, and almost all of them would've made a decidedly different choice. Yet here they are now, the same and so familiar to us, so well-defined and so consistent, and at the same time entirely evolved and utterly changed by the things they've seen and done. Tony Stark and Steve Rogers stood toe to toe before, over the simple issue of agreeing to be part of a team and follow orders like a good soldier who trusts those in charge to do the right thing and give honest information to the heroes expected to fight the battles. Except then, four years ago, it was Captain America preaching a need to surrender individual mandates and decisions to the leadership, and Tony Stark who didn't like being told to play by someone else's rules. Tony had already gone before Congress and told them he'd ""privatized world peace"" and that the government was not welcome to his armor nor welcome to pass judgment on how he used his armor to protect the world. Steve meanwhile was a soldier who needed to be part of a team, needed to feel he was doing his duty and upholding the rule of law as an agent of the government -- his very name implied military status and chain of command. Captain America was a collectivist, so to speak, born of the FDR era amid a Great Depression and World War that required society to band together for protection and salvation; Iron Man was an individualist, born to privilege and trusting only his own judgment and to solve problems for everyone else, skeptical of power outside of his own hands. Those differences are what repeatedly pitted them against one another, Steve always critical of Tony's hubris and reliance on external sources of ""power"" while Tony was critical of Steve's idealism and reliance on internal ""power"" derived from external sources. Yet their differences ultimately drew them together not merely because of how those aspects of personality and power complimented each other in a team dynamic, but also because of something much more personal and self-reflective. Tony once told Steve that everything special about him came out of a bottle, a remark Tony learned wasn't true at all -- everything remarkable about Steve already resided within him, and his physical enhancement merely made it possible for Steve to better act upon his true inner nature. Likewise, Steve once suggested that the Iron Man armor shielded Tony from scrutiny that would reveal the man underneath as shallow and without substance or courage -- now, Steve knows the suit is merely a reflection of Tony's greater self, and empowers him in the same way Steve's enhancements empower his own inner nature. That's the core of their friendship, those differences born of similarities and similarities born of differences. So it's tragic that it's also what winds up tearing them apart. Because both men changed over time, switching positions as they influenced one another's worldviews amid conflict and destructive events. Captain America no longer trusts the government or agencies, is no longer willing to follow orders, and is in fact inclined to instinctively distrust institutions of power -- particularly when they seek to exert their will through use of force in the name of peace and security. Iron Man no longer accepts the legitimacy of outside agents enforcing their own will through use of force in the name of peace and security without any oversight besides their own consciences and personal agendas. Captain America saw his idealism dragged into the harsh light of day in the modern world, saw his faith in country and the American Dream shaken by the corruption of country and American reality. He fought for S.H.I.E.L.D. only to discover they were the enemy after all, and his actions may at times have aided their evil goals. Iron Man pursued his notions of the superiority of his own agenda and perspective time and again, building and designing his way toward what he thought was a safer world, only to realize his judgment cannot be trusted because it gave the world Ultron and near-extinction. He is aware of the extreme, other-worldly dangers facing humanity and is now convinced that his own flaws and skewed vision is a problem shared by the entire team of Avengers. The world cannot indefinitely place its fate in their hands and trust them to make the right calls when so often they've failed to do so, in other words. Captain America the outsider going rogue, Iron Man the government agent following the letter of the law. This, then, is the reversal that twists the team into such knots it pits them all against one another. They've each become a reflection of the other's prior self, a self they reject and which represents to them their worst failures and most dangerous mistakes. Tony's guilt and self-loathing for his previous behavior and perspective is now projected onto Steve, who has come to represent everything Tony rejects about himself, and the same is true for how Steve reacts to Tony now. This is heavy stuff, folks. Nobody has any business trying to imply it's cookie-cutter or shallow popcorn entertainment. [I'll just offer a quick friendly reminder that if you appreciated and agreed with my review of Batman v Superman then I hope you'll take my analysis here as seriously as you did for that film, and so whether you like Civil War or not you shouldn't resort to dismissing it or resenting it. Likewise, if you like this review and appreciate my analysis, then I hope you will grant my review of Batman v Superman equal respect and appreciation as well.] There is fascinating, complicated, painful character development and subtext coursing through this film's veins, and it gains great nuance and impact precisely because we've spent the last eight years with these people and watched their transformations and relationships steadily move toward this moment. Emotional and compelling, it earns every character moment. We see just about everybody interact with each other person at some point, and there are so many excellent little details and honesty to it. A standout example is Black Window showing up on a sad day for Captain America, and when he asks if she's come to change his mind about something, she simply explains that she just didn't want him to have to be alone on that sad day. It's not done with excessive dialogue or melodrama, it's just a quick remark and a hug. Yet it carries so much weight, because it's the sort of little moment between friends that feels genuine precisely because we know them so well and the story lets them be who they are. The cast's exceptional work sells it completely, as in that scene where Scarlett Johansson and Chris Evans exhibit the relaxed air of two close friends who've been through hell and back together. They're all invested in their relationships with one another, and we're invested in them. So when everything comes to a head and the friendships rupture, it hurts. We feel it in our guts and in our hearts. Captain America's perspective is already shifted, as I explained, but it becomes even more askew due to his emotional ties to Bucky (aka the Winter Soldier). Cap knows what it means to be an unwitting coconspirator with Hydra, and to have taken actions that leave innocent people dead (that's the point of this entire film, after all). So beyond his direct and obvious relationship with Bucky as a motivation for his actions, Captain America is driven by another deeper level of investment in saving and redeeming Bucky. But for Iron Man, Bucky represents exactly the opposite, and his lack of ill intent doesn't recuse him from being held responsible -- a reflection of Tony holding himself responsible and putting his own wishes at the mercy of this new global regulation of superheroes. Tony bends his own will to that of the Sokovia Accords, so he expects and demands everyone else do the same. However, there is a crucial and less obvious truth underlying all of this subtext and evolution of each character's perspective -- they are still actually driven by the same personality traits and behavior as before, it's just in service to a different, new ideological claim arising from their internal self-image and need to seek redemption. Tony no longer says he knows what's best and will act on his own accord; he now says he thinks the Sokovia Accords are the right way forward after all, and so he expects everyone to do what he says or he'll make them comply. Notice, then, he has simply redirected his absolutist self-certainty in a different direction, and the danger that he's mistaken -- and thus that the outcome could have dangerous consequences for everybody -- still exist. Steve meanwhile has his ideals and still follows them with a blind certainty that sometimes prevents him from seeing obvious truths and dangers. The difference is, whereas he used to feel those ideals were represented by government or some organizational hierarchy who fight against external threats to the ideals, now he just adds the government and all organizations to the list of potential external threats to the ideals. They've changed, yet remained the same, because they've yet to overcome whatever fundamental aspect of their personality drives them to be superheroes in the first place, and those are the things that both make them succeed and make them fail. The dialogue in Civil War is wonderful. The MCU films that most touch my heart and inspire me are the Captain America films, and all three of them were written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. This is their first time also writing Iron Man's character, and I'm a huge fan of the Iron Man films but here I believe we get a whole new and deeper glimpse into Tony Stark. The result is Robert Downey Jr.'s best performance so far in the role (and, alongside the underrated emotional gut-punch The Judge, among his very best of the past decade), bringing everything we already know and love about the character while adding far more drama and desperation to the mix. Likewise, Chris Evans continues to own the role of Captain America all the way to his bones. Sebastian Stan hits a career high-water mark with this performance, working so well not just in dramatic scenes with Evans and Downey but also demonstrating deft comedic timing with Anthony Mackie. The rest of the cast are all great, with Paul Rudd doing his typical job of stealing every scene he's in (and having some of the best lines of the picture) as Ant-Man. The conversations and personal moments between Elizabeth Olsen's Scarlet Witch and Paul Bettany's Vision are superb, and we clearly see the hints of emerging emotions behind their eyes and words. Chadwick Boseman as the Black Panther stands out as one of the greatest new additions to the Marvel lineup, and everyone's going to walk out of the theater eager to see his solo film. That film will include other Avengers alongside Black Panther, but frankly it wouldn't need to in order to seem compelling and enjoy lots of excited buzz, because Boseman kicks so much butt and exudes such hyper-coolness -- not to mention sports a great costume translated so well to film. The Black Panther's own arc is part of what propels the story forward, and it puts him on a similar collision course with Captain America and Iron Man. Where it leads, and how it intersects in crucial emotional ways that surprise and then lead him in a different direction, just adds to the already-strong narrative of the film. He will become a key moral conscience for the MCU moving forward, and anyone who thought a solo Black Panther movie was going to be a harder sell can put that concern back in its box and stow it away, trust me. Get ready, fans -- here comes Spider-Man! I love Sam Raimi's trilogy of films, and even appreciate Spider-Man 3 for the parts that work (and admittedly, there's a lot that doesn't, but Sandman is pretty rocking). I'm also a big fan of the more recent Amazing Spider-Man series of movies -- I'm even a fan of the much-maligned The Amazing Spider-Man 2, despite it's flaws. But nothing that came before compares to what we get with this new MCU Spider-Man. They've gotten close before, but never spot-on from start to finish in every way like they do in Captain America: Civil War. This really highlights the difference between casting 25-30 year old actors as high school kids, and casting actual teenagers to portray teenagers. The result is a hilarious, awkward, chatterbox Spider-Man who needs only a few scenes to capture the essence of the character in and out of costume. Tom Holland was the right choice for the role, and within minutes of his introduction he makes you forget everything that came before. Any fear that it was too soon, that audiences would suffer a hangover from the recent Spider-Man reboot, are out the window. As with Captain America: The Winter Solider, the fight sequences are awesome to behold in Civil War, with choreography that's some of the finest of any action movies you'll find. And when the film ratchets up the action to serious blockbuster spectacle levels, the result is a sequence destined to remain famous as the genre's single most mind-blowing superhero action scene put to film. You'll hear this same refrain from other reviews and lots of audience members in the coming weeks, but I assure you it's not simply hype -- believe it, it's that good. If you've waited to see multiple splash-page action translated to live-action cinema in a way perfectly adapting the potential of the comic book medium for the big screen, you're wait is over. This sequence alone is worth the price of admission. It's full of eye-popping visual effects that make it all look totally real, while the characters fight and argue and plead and joke depending on who they're facing at a given moment. And they manage to surprise you with some twists and surprises just when you think it couldn't get any better. This will become the standard of excellence for the genre going forward, I assure you -- every superhero film from now on will feel inherently challenged to deliver as perfectly and effectively as this scene does. No, scratch that -- as perfectly and effectively as this entire movie does. Because that's what it all boils down to, dear readers; This is the best Marvel yet, with the greatest superhero action on film. It's immense, marvelous action-packed fun, but with a fantastically detailed and emotionally powerful character-driven story matched by equally fabulous performances. The Marvel heroes have never been better than they are in Captain America: Civil War, and after two viewings with time in between to consider what I saw and compare it to other films, I am left feeling certain about Captain America: Civil War replacing The Avengers atop my ""pure superhero films"" list, because Civil War is the single greatest superhero movie ever made. I realize this will be a controversial claim to some readers, but let me make a simple pitch to you. Putting aside any personal biases about characters or publication preferences etc, fans of the genre must understand we're talking about a movie starring more than a dozen masked superheroes and another half-dozen significant supporting characters and many more smaller roles as well, in a story that takes place all around the world and involves reversals on top of reversals, with five major action set pieces, all while resolving eight years of mounting overarching narrative to tie together events from several different films and imply consequences for the entire existence of superheroes in the world. The film never feels crowded, never stumbles over anyone's feet getting all of these people and events and themes together into the room, and pulls it all off with ridiculously entertaining, compelling, and emotionally resonant results. Artistically, it sports some of the best performances of the genre; stunning visual effects that bring comic book action to vivid life; fight choreography unequaled in the genre; emotional depth as complex and nuanced as high-quality ""serious"" films you expect to see during awards season; attention to movement, space, and visual construction of shots that demonstrates keep appreciation for cinematic storytelling far superior to what we see in most traditional action blockbusters; and an embrace of the simple fact that being ""fun"" does not remotely mean ""simplistic"" or otherwise impugn the artistic merits of the film nor undermine the ""serious"" and weighty drama of the story and character arcs. So whether you like this or that character or not, whether you prefer one publishing company or another, and regardless of what some fan on some message board or 
Twitter
 said to you that made you mad, none of that matters -- if you want fair and honest, appreciative reviews of the films you personally prefer and love, then you need to be able to apply those same standards and expectations to other people and to reviews of all films, period. Captain America: Civil War is a great film -- not just great popcorn entertainment, but rather also great art and great storytelling. And hopefully you can see why it succeeds and why it earns its good reviews, and hopefully you can accept that without being angry or resenting it. On the flip side, if you do realize how great Civil War is and are happy to see such deeper analysis of the artistic merits and storytelling, then you should be as willing to accept the same degree of appreciation and analysis for other films as well. We all win when superhero films are this good, and when they are greeted by widespread acclaim and success. It means the public loves the genre and wants more, and that studios will feel compelled to keep raising the bar to deliver the best quality superhero movies. And meanwhile, your own enjoyment and love of these films shouldn't depend on what anyone else says about them or whether anyone else agrees with you. We live in a golden age of superhero cinema -- enjoy it, embrace it, be happy for petesake, and don't get dragged down into pointless, meaningless trench warfare against other fans where neither side stops lobbing grenades because the other side is still responding in kind. If you don't help elevate the discourse, then the films you personally love will never be spared from the degraded level of discussion, and you'll just be part of the same problem you complain about. We can all be better, and we should start trying a lot harder -- and not make it conditional on whether the person next to us is trying or not, because first and foremost we are responsible for our own actions and our own reactions to the world around us. That's a lesson and idea relevant to both Batman v Superman and Civil War, and fans of both should pay attention if the films and characters mean so much to them."
"Apr 13, 2016",NEGATIVE," Remarkably outshining both ‘Avengers‘ films in its deployment of superhero pyrotechnics and credible, amped-up character conflict, “Captain America: Civil War” is finally the fully realized team-up movie Marvel has been striving to make all these years. Following their efforts on “Captain America: The Winter Soldier,” directors Joe and Anthony Russo exhibit a rock-steady hand as they guide the Avengers through a stripped-down plot pitting former allies Captain America (Chris Evans) and Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) against one another. With other heroes rallying around those two poles, the characters face the consequences of their super-powered actions and ultimately examine how their own personal histories influence their heroics. Somehow managing time to introduce both Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and a new version of Spider-Man (Tom Holland) without overstuffing the plot, the filmmakers maintain a consistent focus on their own particular exploration of the “with great power comes great responsibility” concept and craft one of the few satisfying end-game battles in Marvel’s cinematic canon so far. ‘Civil War’ features none of Marvel’s galactic digressions. Like ‘The Winter Soldier,’ it is firmly grounded on Earth. With a dozen costumed characters, a villain, and at least three major supporting characters to push the story forward, this sequel could easily fall prey to the same overwrought bulge that has troubled other ensemble superhero films. But despite all those moving parts, this third Captain America movie is relatively lean, driving forward from an introductory sequence melding action and the film’s central moral imperative. Setting up this strong foundation quickly, the movie then sets in motion an espionage-tinged manhunt that becomes much more than a basic excuse for these heroes to punch each other. Credit the Russos, Marvel’s Kevin Feige, and screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely for designing a story with shark-like forward momentum. An opening action sequence pits the Avengers against the scarred mercenary Crossbones (Frank Grillo), and shows off the team’s coordination and teamwork, but also their fallibility. A protective maneuver gone wrong leads to innocent deaths, which becomes the breaking point for world governments increasingly uneasy about the unrestrained power of the Avengers after major battles in New York (“The Avengers”) and Sokovia (‘Age of Ultron’). A United Nations resolution proposes the meta-humans submit to “voluntary” oversight, but not every Avenger is ready to yield. Idealogical lines are quickly drawn. Tony Stark, driven by guilt for designing Ultron, advocates for the UN’s demands, while Captain America’s suspicions of modern government, born during ‘The Winter Soldier,’ grows a fiercely independent streak and refuses to adhere the so-called “Sokovia Accords.” Complications multiply when the legislation signing is marred by terrorist violence, apparently set off by Cap’s old pal Bucky (Sebastian Stan), now known as the mentally-programmed Winter Soldier. This draws the Black Panther, aka T’challa, prince of the isolated African nation Wakanda, into the fray, focused on taking down Bucky for his terrorist action. With so many characters in the mix, the plot sounds more complex than it really is. But simplicity is the film’s chief asset; with the major scenario sketched in the characters are free to bounce around within its relatively confined parameters. More often than not their collisions are physically violent, but the battle between Cap and Iron Man, these friends and teammates whose political affiliations have become irretrievably tied to their personae, is also an emotional one. Just as the film avoids galactic complications, the climax remains local, with no world engines or Earth-threatening alien. It would be a stretch to call this third Captain America film a drama, but far more than most comic book films, this is a story of conflict between people, building on the history of Marvel’s cinematic universe. And the old affection between the two heroes amplifies their new enmity which only further draws the audience in. While the villain Baron Zemo, ably played by Daniel Brühl, drives a wedge into the film’s schism, he is primarily taking advantage of existing cracks in the Avengers’ foundation. Battles are not exclusively emotional, however. “It always ends in a fight,” as Bucky grimly notes. The Russos and their various fight choreographers and visual effects leads design fight sequences with a fluidity that would please Bruce Lee. One sequence featuring Captain America, Bucky, and a host of government agents, plays like a scale version of “The Raid” with impressive use of vertical space and consistent character beats which define the action and each hero’s relationship to it. A battle at the Berlin airport acts as the film’s marquee centerpiece, with Ant-Man and Spider-Man joining the fray for a seventeen-minute feast of super-powered action dominated by Marvel’s first in-house realization of Spidey’s acrobatic prowess. As Iron Man’s team (Vision, Black Widow, Spider-Man, War Machine, and Black Panther) attempts to capture Bucky and Cap, the heroes on Cap’s side (Falcon, Scarlet Witch, Ant-Man, and Hawkeye) engage in constantly-shifting engagements to display every power in the collective arsenal and a good many we hadn’t seen yet. Spider-Man stands out from the pack not only by virtue of the unique deal that brings him back into Marvel’s fold, but because Tom Holland plays the character as a kid — this is the youngest Spider-Man we’ve seen on the big screen, wide-eyed, not quite in control of his skills, and thus closest to the classic version of the character. In extended dialogue with Robert Downey Jr., Holland nails Peter Parker’s combination of eager adolescence and emerging confidence, while the battle sequence shows off just how agile, energetic, and quippy the character can be. It’s too early to call Holland the best silver screen Spider-Man (let’s see him anchor his own film first) but the young actor is a delight who embodies the character perfectly. Throughout this big fight and all the film’s other battles, those character quirks are front and center. We’ve seen other superhero movies stumble as characters seemingly cast off their personalities in combat. The Russos, however, use fisticuffs as a method to draw out aspects of each individual, whether it be the evolving independence of Scarlet Witch, the moral quandary faced by Black Widow, or the determined and canny mind of Black Panther. Chadwick Boseman plays Panther as a regal leader, intelligent and physically powerful, with all the confidence of a man who has earned his place in the world. As a new presence in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Black Panther is distinguished as a unique character informed by the best examples of his long comic book history. However, Boseman does employ a distractingly exaggerated accent that is the one down side to the character."
"Apr 13, 2016",POSITIVE," It’s almost easier to say what isn’t in Captain America: Civil War, since the latest Marvel movie features deaths, bad feelings all around, alliances formed and broken, two guys with bug names, a kiss and the best superhero battle put to film yet. Tear away the powers, abilities and egos, though, and the third Captain America movie (***½ out of four; rated PG-13; in theaters May 6) is at its core a deep exploration of friendship and family and what sacrifices should be made to hold onto both. And while it’s not the greatest Marvel effort — that honor goes to the previous Captain America: The Winter Soldier — Civil War does pull outstanding performances from its two franchise faces, Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. Evans’ Steve Rogers is faced with struggles on all sides: Cap’s childhood best pal Bucky (Sebastian Stan), who has been brainwashed into being the assassin Winter Soldier, is framed for a terrorist incident in Vienna. Making matters worse, Captain America is already dealing with his Avengers supergroup crumbling around him when a new law places the heroes under United Nations jurisdiction after too many international incidents with catastrophic collateral damage. He’s against the move, his buddy Tony Stark (again played by Downey, doing great stuff outside the Iron Man armor) is for it, and civil discourse between the two isn’t happening, at all. “Sometimes I want to punch you in your perfect teeth,” Stark hisses. Under the direction of Winter Soldier’s Anthony and Joe Russo, Civil War is the most epic Avengers movie so far, even though it’s not an Avengers movie. The divided team allows many character moments for the android Vision (Paul Bettany), newer heroes Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Falcon (Anthony Mackie), and mainstays Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and War Machine (Don Cheadle). The movie also features the impressive introductions of Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), a Wakandan prince bearing claws and a grudge, and a new Spider-Man (Tom Holland). Previous movies have had issues balancing the youthful banter and scientific confidence of the comic-book wallcrawler, but Holland nails the role in every aspect. Both those guys and many more are involved in the aforementioned big brawl, a massive airport throwdown between the bickering heroes. It’s a brilliantly crafted affair featuring new team-ups and fabulous dialogue (credit to screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely) ultimately heisted by surprising scene-stealers Spidey and Ant-Man (Paul Rudd). Between the political issues, explosive battles and a nefarious plot by new villain-on-the-scene Helmut Zemo (Daniel Brühl), Civil War is overflowing with story. It's a gold mine for Marvel nerds that may be dizzying for the rest. Yet the central conflict between superfriends Steve and Tony stays in focus, even escalating in a real and tragic way as the plot progresses and weaves in Winter Soldier’s history of breaking bad to tear them apart even further. Rather than rooting for the fisticuffs, it hurts to watch these men, brothers in a sense, punch and blast each other into oblivion — a testament to two actors totally on their game but also to audiences’ investment in these characters paying off in dramatic fashion."
"Apr 13, 2016",POSITIVE,Civil War isn't great despite being the third Captain America and thirteenth overall Marvel movie - it's great because of those things.
"Apr 13, 2016",POSITIVE," In matters of global conflict, who is held accountable for destruction? Which lives matter? How is death redeemed by more death? And when is the loss of innocent life acceptable? The complexity of those questions is the reason diplomats from every nation work overtime to minimize the headlong rush into war. It’s also the reason most of the Avengers (Hulk and Thor are on sabbatical) spend the bulk of “Captain America: Civil War” fighting among themselves. For audiences feeling burned by the superhero brawling in “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,” just hang on — it’s not what you’re thinking. Unlike DC’s recent franchise brick, a film that spent an inordinate amount of time mulling over issues of personal enmity against an incoherently darkened landscape, and that offered little more than lip service to the matter of collateral damage, “Civil War” is an addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe that, yes, moves its good guys to battle each other, but does so in the service of establishing a future of superhero responsibility. After the loss of innocent life in Sokovia in “Avengers: Age of Ultron” and a first-act fight here that kills even more bystanders in Lagos, Nigeria, the Avengers face the condemnation of the global community, moving the United Nations to create the Sokovia Accords. Their purpose: regulate superhero meddling in international turmoil. Vision (Paul Bettany) sees the logic in this process, explaining to the others that the emergence of more and more “enhanced” humans has meant a concurrent rise in planet-threatening emergencies, and that the Avengers’ very existence is, possibly, an inciting event. Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) refuses to sign the accord, convinced that the Avengers’ independence is the only way to address trouble before it becomes catastrophic. As lines are drawn, and team members choose sides, Bucky Barnes/The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) returns, as does a man named Zemo (Daniel Brühl), who has more than a passing interest in Barnes’ activities. Zemo’s agenda necessarily involves the upstanding Cap and his decades-long loyalty to Barnes, in scenarios that threaten to turn the man with the vibranium shield into the very kind of vigilante he is not. More emergencies, more complications and more new characters pop up — all of which may or may not be surprises, depending on how deeply immersed you are in the teasing, hyperactive, pre-release dispensing of information nuggets — and the Civil War is on. Corporate filmmaking with an enormous economic investment at stake has the power to force creative people to operate within the art-destroying prison walls of a marketing strategy. But the Marvel Cinematic Universe, an empire building itself on a foundation that roughly amounts to a house style, tends to stay relatively on balance. Screenwriting team Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (responsible for the previous two “Captain America” films) efficiently move plot blocks into place and check off interlocking points of order, but they do so while never forgetting that their characters are more than brands to build. These enhanced humans are still human and have relationships with one another that exist beyond the boundaries of global crisis. Given permission to be more than objects resisting other objects against a green screen, the cast members give themselves to each other, their screen clan generously expanding to include newer characters like Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen). And Evans’ performance — it’s his character’s film, after all — is the center; his story line is the one most beset by internal conflict, and his empathy for the torn loyalties of Cap is moving in ways that don’t derail the action’s urgency or pull focus from the otherwise ensemble nature of the larger project. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo (“Captain America: The Winter Soldier”) continue to mine their experience with television comedies like “Community,” “Arrested Development” and “Happy Endings,” juggling all the members of their superhero family with a playful touch that both informs character interaction and delivers vital breathing room in between battles. Cinematographer Trent Opaloch (who collaborated with the Russos on “Winter Soldier”) and editors Jeffrey Ford and Matthew Schmidt (“Avengers: Age of Ultron”) create spaces for hurtling bodies that are coherent and uncluttered; nothing gets lost to the fight-blur that plagues bad action direction and editing. Technical matters in capable hands allow “Captain America: Civil War” to delve into territory that “Winter Soldier” began working through, questions of principle and morality, and the blackened morass of consequences involved — as Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.) puts it here — in “doing what has to be done to stave off something worse.” The film tangles itself up with fears of endless war and the annihilation of innocent humanity, and in doing so it continues to validate the ongoing series. It’s a fact of movie history that films are created as both a response to, and a product of, the larger world. And superhero movies, which are the current cinema’s site of obsession over anxiety-making issues of global safety, must continue to address the unthinkable if they’re to be more valuable to culture than mere moneymaking products on an assembly line, or retreats into childhood nostalgia that only pretend to be making sense of the environment that produces them."
"Apr 13, 2016",POSITIVE," The superhero slugfest this summer deserved. The emotional stakes couldn’t be higher, the big fight delivers in every conceivable way and Tom Holland’s amazing Spider-Man steals the show. Up there with the best of Marvel. Why you can trust GamesRadar+ 


Our experts review games, movies and tech over countless hours, so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about our reviews policy. It’s all been building to this. From the three-way forest throw-downs and Hulk-shaped sucker punches of Avengers Assemble to Civil War’s savvy, hashtag-powered marketing campaign prompting True Believers to pick a side, the prospect of Marvel's mightiest going toe to toe in a superhuman dust-up has been irresistibly enticing. That it arrives in cinemas little more than a month after DC’s own clash of the titans failed to land a knockout blow feels all the sweeter because, rest assured, Civil War delivers on the promise of that title in a major way. Part Captain America threequel, part Avengers 2.5, part cinematic intro to two of the MCU’s most intriguing new faces (more on those later), Civil War is a miraculous juggling act. The globetrotting plot kicks off in Lagos, where Cap and the new-look Avengers are on a mission to take down Winter Soldier survivor Crossbones. If 2011’s The First Avenger was a war movie, and its 2014 sequel a paranoia-fuelled thriller, Civil War starts as a muscular crime movie in the mould of Michael Mann's Heat, the Russo brothers significantly upping their game in terms of high-impact, shield-slinging action. The mission is a bust – the latest in a laundry list of collateral-damage catastrophes from the battle of New York to the near-apocalypse in Sokovia. “Compromise, reassurance, that's how the world works,” says secretary of state Thaddeus ‘Thunderbolt’ Ross (William Hurt, reprising his 2008 Incredible Hulk role) leading to the creation of the Sokovia Accords, a decree to put the super crew on ice (metaphorically) unless an international governing body gives the green light. Having lived through oppressive times, Cap takes a stance against the agreement; Tony Stark, wracked with guilt over the creation of Ultron, sides with Ross and the Accords. Battle lines drawn, matters are further complicated by Bucky Barnes, who’s implicated in a terrorist attack that puts both sides, and a certain Wakandan prince, on the Winter Soldier’s tail. In many ways, Civil War is the Marvel team-up sequel Age of Ultron should have been. If The Winter Soldier was about SHIELD being ripped apart from the inside, Civil War pulls the same trick with the Avengers themselves, screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely carving out satisfying character arcs, or at the very least moments, for every major player (minus the MIA Thor and Hulk). Crucially, despite the colossal cast of characters and sprawling runtime, the oft-repeated assertion that this isn't just Avengers 2.5 holds true – it's also a Captain America movie through and through, further exploring The Winter Soldier’s major theme – the cost of freedom – while Bucky is even more integral to the plot than he was in the film that bore his own name. As you might expect, it's one of the MCU’s more serious entries, tonally a world away from the party-time antics of Age of Ultron. But that doesn’t mean it’s humourless; far from it. Anthony Mackie’s Sam Wilson can be relied upon for laugh-out-loud one-liners whenever he’s on screen, the Vision’s stylish new wardrobe is comedy gold and Paul Rudd’s Scott Lang is huge fun in a relatively brief appearance – utterly enamoured by Steve Rogers and overjoyed just to have been invited along. As a piece of superhero storytelling, it doesn’t bring anything particularly innovative to the table either – the idea of a thin line between heroes and vigilantes is invoked again, for example. But importantly, given the callous loss of life going on in other comic-book movies, the human cost of the Avengers’ actions is keenly felt and addressed in a meaningful way. It makes DC’s efforts to tackle the same idea with Batman v Superman seem thunderously dunderheaded in comparison. “It always ends in a fight,” says Bucky. Of course it does. And Civil War builds to an unforgettable main event. After waiting a good 90 minutes for each side to suit up you can’t help but brace for a mammoth letdown, but the airport-set Battle Royale ranks among the most inventive and fun scraps ever committed to superhero celluloid. Everyone gets a moment to shine, not least of which Tom Holland’s friendly neighbourhood wall-crawler and Rudd’s amazing miniature man who run away with the lion’s share of the battle’s memorable moments, the super-barney consistently surprising with deliriously gleeful beats. The characters may be pulling their punches – after all they’re the good guys, and with one key exception they don’t want to see each other dead – but a later, three-way fight massively raises the emotional stakes, because after eight years and 12 films you can’t help but care about the people on each side of the divide. Chris Evans is dependably superb as Steve Rogers – the stoic heart and soul of the MCU. And though he doesn’t have as much to chew on here as he did in The Winter Soldier, there's little doubt why anyone would risk being branded a fugitive to follow him into battle. Even better is Robert Downey Jr, who shows a different side to Tony Stark. “You're being surprisingly non-hyper-verbal,” Black widow quips. It's a wittier riposte than anything Tony musters in the entire film. He’s less the swaggering snark merchant of movies past here and more the elder statesman, reflecting on the consequences of his actions and looking to make amends. “I’m trying to keep you from tearing the Avengers apart,” he pleads. The brilliance of Downey Jr’s sympathetic performance is that even if you’re staunchly Team Cap you still feel for him. As for the other players: Bucky is more tortured soul than Terminator this time round, and though he can still feel more MaGuffin than character at times, you buy why he’s worth saving because Sebastian Stan and Chris Evans sell their life-long friendship so well. Daniel Bruhl’s shadowy Zemo is the film's Lex Luthor – the master manipulator pulling the strings from behind the scenes – but unlike Jesse Eisenberg’s aggressively annoying braniac, Bruhl gives Zemo gravitas and pathos. Scarlet Witch struggles to deal with the implications of her immense power; Hawkeye comes out of retirement in a satisfying continuation of his Age Of Ultron arc; Black Widow has fun playing both sides, even if there's none of the joyful frisson with Cap this time around; Falcon gets to show off what those wings can really do; and War Machine takes the hardest line for the Accords, ever the iron patriot. More importantly: how do the MCU’s new supers stack up? Chadwick Boseman’s Black Panther has a bigger role than you might expect. Arriving fully formed, Boseman plays the prince of Wakanda with regal airs, charm and forceful determination. For Very Important Story Reasons he's quite sullen in Civil War (hopefully he’ll lighten up for the standalone Panther flick) but in his vibranium suit T'Challa is just as capable and acrobatically dazzling as any of the MCU's super-folk, with a set of razor-sharp claws that even Cap's shield can’t withstand. “Dude shows up dressed like a cat and you don’t want to know more?” exclaims Falcon after their first run-in. On the basis of Civil War, we’re champing at the bit. Better yet is Marvel’s all-new Spider-Man. In a surprisingly substantial appearance, 19-year-old Tom Holland not only makes a case for being the best screen Spidey so far, but also threatens to steal the entire film. His Peter Parker is perfect – nervy, goofy and instantly endearing. In the airport fight however he's truly spectacular, holding his own against the best the MCU has to offer, using his webs in entertaining and creative ways, while his motor-mouthed (and charmingly naive) wisecracking couldn’t be better. “There’s usually not this much talk,” says Falcon. You’ll be grateful there is, and desperate to see more of Holland’s sensational web-slinger the moment you leave the cinema. That epic runtime is the only problem. It's generally well-paced, but there's one too many plot swerves as you wait for the gang to suit up and throw down. There’s also a slightly icky and completely unnecessary romantic beat that torpedoes the MCU’s best love story, and it’s a shame that the trailers (and LEGO) gave away quite so many of the film's surprises. If there’s a risk of the Marvel ‘formula’ becoming stale, there isn’t any evidence of that here. Civil War isn’t just a damn-near-perfect popcorn crowd-pleaser; it doesn’t offer any easy answers for its combatants, or the world going forward. Team Cap or Team Iron Man?

"Apr 13, 2016",POSITIVE," Featuring what's arguably the best ever screen depiction of Spider-Man as well as a cool new hero in Black Panther, Captain America: Civil War can't quite recapture the emotional and cerebral strengths of its predecessor, The Winter Soldier. Its central villain is ultimately lackluster and its final act, while dramatic, lacks the energy and effectiveness of the central action set-piece that assembles the Avengers in instant-classic fashion."
"Apr 13, 2016",POSITIVE,"A gargantuan entertainment that finds room for a little emotional resonance underneath the sterling spectacle, ""Captain America: Civil War"" is a well-paced, thoroughly satisfying, completely overstuffed action-thriller."
"Apr 13, 2016",NEUTRAL," Captain America: Civil War opens overseas starting on April 27th in advance of its May 6th debut in America and China (among other territories). It is the thirteenth film in the ongoing Marvel Cinematic Universe, the third Captain America film, the fifth film to feature Chris Evans as Steve Rogers in a lead/supporting role, and the sixth film likewise for Robert Downey Jr.’s Tony Stark. Oh, and it’s the fifth film to feature Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow in a supporting role. So yeah, I can’t imagine a single soul clicking on this review not knowing what this movie is and what’s at stake. Actually, there isn’t much at stake because there is little chance this film won’t pop here and abroad. The reviews are going to be strong, and Disney knows this hence the two-weeks-early embargo drop. The worst-case scenario for this one is it plays like Captain America 3, whereby it plays off the audience goodwill of the much-liked The Winter Soldier ($259 million domestic/$714m worldwide) and further benefits from being the summer kick-off movie. The best-case scenario is that its character-packed story, which features the various MCU superheroes fighting each other, plays like a would-be Avengers 2.5. Honestly, it’s a coin toss at this point as to which scenario comes about, but either way, this is going to be one of the bigger movies of the summer, if not the year. So yeah, I’ve been writing about this film’s would-be financial performance for over two years. Let’s get onto the review, shall we? Captain America: Civil War is a classic case of having your cake and eating it too. There is lots to love and much to appreciate in its thoughtful and deeply personal narrative. At its best, it acts as a repudiation of the MCU playbook. Oh sure, it is as much a table-setter as a stand-alone movie, and there are moments of unabashed fanservice that don’t really serve the film, but it takes its story to its natural endpoint with minimal compromise. If that sounds like a spoiler, it’s not. Because if anything this film relishes the opportunity to rub our noses in our own preordained expectations. After a grim prologue that arguably tips its hand a little early (I’d almost advise you to walk in a few minutes late if not for the inconvenience for you and other moviegoers), we get a thrilling action sequence that sees our new Avengers (Captain America, Black Widow, Scarlett Witch, the Falcon) acting less like outward action heroes and more like covert spies. It’s a fun new dynamic that works like a solid Mission: Impossible caper, and there is a frightening urgency when the mission goes to hell and civilians are endangered. The overseas adventure doesn’t have a happy ending, which leads to the world’s governments stepping in to somewhat rein in these off-the-books superheroes. Tony Stark helps lead the charge for governmental oversight, haunted as he is by his reckless actions in Iron Man 3 and his whole “I created a world-destroying robot that killed a bunch of civilians and came really close to wiping out humanity” stint in Age of Ultron. Just as The Winter Soldier retroactively improved Iron Man 2, Civil War deals with the fallout of Age of Ultron in a way that retroactively improves that movie just a bit. The past-and-present Avengers are divided over the whole checks-and-balances thing, and the film initially goes out of its way to make neither side seem unreasonable or villainous. Since this is a Steve Rogers movie that merely features a supporting role for Tony Stark, it is Rogers who takes center-stage when an additional act of violence brings Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) out of hiding. Captain America is still stinging from both a tragic mission failure and a devastating personal loss, so it is not unexpected that he goes out of his way to protect the only link to his past that he has left. As Rogers (and an all-too-willing Sam Wilson/Falcon) go rogue in trying to bring in Bucky in a way that won’t kill him, a deeper mystery comes into play that divides our old friends and introduces a few new ones into the mix. It is here that the film threatens to go off the rails and becomes something of a “man on the run” thriller, with Bucky seemingly framed for a crime and those who believe he is guilty determined to bring him down with lethal force. But, in a manner surprisingly similar to (of all things) Taken 3, the rightful authorities solve the mystery either right alongside Steve Rogers or before Rogers puts together the clues. So the whole “going rogue” act is rendered tragically unnecessary. And moreover, the middle act of the film becomes oddly redundant as we get two extended action scenes of “the same thing happening twice” mostly for the purpose of seeing Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) making an ass-kicking debut in the second one, which he does. It is understandable that Rogers would go above-and-beyond to save his friend, whom he genuinely believes to be innocent of the crime in question. And it’s not beyond the pale to suggest that Steve Rogers is acting irrationally as a result of the circumstances in question. But it is frustrating to watch from a narrative point-of-view, especially when his actions do have real consequences for characters we know and like. This includes the big second act battle royale that is worth a healthy $200 million worldwide in box office alone but is (mostly) dramatically unnecessary. The sequence, which features friends facing off against each other, is the biggest and baddest superhero battle since the finale of The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn II (okay, it’s better, even if it lacks the copious decapitations). The scene, which is filled with crowd-pleasing super-powered action beats and applause-worthy gags, is a delight in the moment, even as you realize that (again) characters we know and like are endangered and imperiled because Steve couldn’t pick up a phone at the right time and because Tony had to rush in with a broadsword instead of a scalpel. Now to be fair, I’m the only one who will care about this stuff. I’m still going to see the movie again so I can see that Avengers vs. Avengers battle in its intended IMAX format. The actors are all in fine form, and even William Hurt looks happier to be here than he did back in 2008. Scarlett Johansson suffers comparatively due to the sheer number of characters, but her genuine friendship with Rogers shines through without a hint of anything romantic. Chadwick Boseman is a towering delight as the Black Panther, and you’ll be ever-so-psyched for his stand-alone movie. As for Tom Holland, while it’s obvious that Spider-Man was shoe-horned in, he gets just enough screen time (as Peter Parker and as Spider-Man) to make a great impression. I am a little surprised that they made him into a Hydra agent and then killed him off. The only loser in the bunch is poor Emily VanCamp, who is arguably there to briefly make out with Steve Rogers and undo the Steve/Bucky slash-fic talk. There really are too many characters, especially when the only point of having so many is for that big action sequence. It’s a little ironic that the film goes out of its way to justify a giant Avengers vs. Avengers battle mostly for sport, yet in other ways acts in stark contrast to what would be considered fan service. I won’t give away the end or reveal the villain’s scheme, but I will say that the film does not end with a giant mid-air battle with the world in mortal peril nor does it end with crashing airships, destroyed cities or conspiracies which threaten the very fabric of our civilization. In his own way, Baron Zemo’s arc is every bit as much a meta-commentary on comic book supervillains and real-world horrors as was Iron Man 3’s Mandarin. Daniel Brühl doesn’t get very many flashy moments, but he is great in his few big scenes. There is a mild climactic reveal that won’t be surprising to anyone playing along, but since the drama lies in how our characters react it works anyway. The overall arc plays into the idea that this film is something of a culmination of the “What have we wrought?” narrative creeping through all of Phase 2, even as it’s something of a false notion since eventually the Avengers are going to have to save the universe from Thanos. Oh, and by the way, Robert Downey Jr. is as good as he has ever been here, and at some point we are going to have to acknowledge that the best performances in these comic book movies or fantasy action films are just as worthy of praise as those in would-be respectable dramas. There is so much that works, and so much that goes against the grain in terms of what we expect from the MCU and from superhero movies in general, that the lapses in storytelling and the hoops that must be jumped through to get to that big second-act climax and deal with its aftermath are all the most exasperating. Even the Sokovia Accords (the checks-and-balances proposal that started this family feud named after the city that the Avengers destroyed last year) is rendered basically irrelevant by the end. To be fair, the film ends up not a metaphor for the American Civil War but the so-called Great War (or World War I). Look, there is nothing so wrong with this film that I would ever dissuade anyone from seeing it. The Russo Brothers have offered a number of terrific action sequences and strong performances with a screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely that mostly plays fair even with its logical lapses. Like The Winter Soldier, the first act is so bloody spectacular that I am more down on the rest of it than I otherwise should be. Like The Winter Soldier, it gets less engrossing the bigger it becomes, although again it ends on a comparatively smaller scale than (for example) Age of Ultron. Captain America: Civil War is a good movie, one worth enjoying on the biggest screen you can find, and one that will entertain the hell out of lots of people even as it goes against the grain in some surprising ways. But the film is periodically an exercise in long-form frustration, one which flirts with “The Idiot Plot” more often than it should. I’m not sure if this counts as a major problem, but I was shocked at how often I found myself siding with Tony Stark over Steve Rogers. But, in the end, I’m on #TeamHulk, since Dr. Banner was among the only ones smart enough to stay out of it."
"Apr 13, 2016",POSITIVE," When the Avengers first assembled four years ago, it felt like a grand culmination, the ultimate Marvel superhero event: its Big Four characters united (well, eventually) against a colossal planetary threat. Since then, the studio’s ever-expanding Cinematic Universe has delivered sequels of varying quality and introduced new heroes in stand-alone movies (well, as close to stand-alone as Marvel can ever get), but it’s never quite matched the ensemble-balancing finesse and Earth-quaking action scale of Joss Whedon’s initial assembling. Certainly not in his clunkier, team-gathering follow up, Age Of Ultron. Not until now. Captain America: Civil War is the best Marvel Studios movie yet. There, we said it. First, and most importantly, it does what the best Marvel films do: juggling multiple characters so each is allowed its moment in a story that pushes forward the series’ overall continuity, while also forming and concluding its own cogent plot. So here Scarlet Witch (Elisabeth Olsen) wrestles with the consequences of her immense power; Vision (Paul Bettany) starts getting to grips with being ‘human’; Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) finds herself torn when the battle line is drawn; and supposed retiree Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) just can’t stay out of the fight. Then there are the new recruits: Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman, playing it gravelly and furrow-browed), nimble protector of a secretive African nation who has his own beef with Bucky; and a quippy kid from Queens (Tom Holland) who crawls up walls in a red-and-blue outfit and can shoot webs at people. His introduction to the action is resoundingly joyous, the reboot the character truly deserves. (“I don’t know if you’ve been in a fight before,” he’s told by one opponent, “but there’s not usually this much talk.”) Even Paul Rudd’s Ant-Man receives more than a tokenistic ‘hey it’s him!’ cameo, and in spectacle terms at least, is given the film’s biggest scene. At its not-so-soft-and-gooey centre, though, is the friendship between Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) and Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), two war buddies out of time, one of them out of his mind. Stan remains, for the most part, as blank and frosty as he was in The Winter Soldier, allowing only the occasional warm glint of ’40s sidekick Bucky. Evans, meanwhile, further hones a role he’s effortlessly owned for five movies now, pushing Steve to impressive new depths and reminding us that his straight arrow still has a dangerous edge. The Steve/Bucky thread stretches back to the first Captain America, and is what makes this Cap Three rather than Avengers Two-and-a-half. But built around that is the bigger conflict that, despite the title, does place it as a direct sequel to Age Of Ultron. In a similar way that Zack Snyder’s DC-world reacted to Superman’s ascension and the emergence of its “metahumans” — though here it is more lightly and elegantly handled — the world of the Avengers has had enough of these “enhanced” agents wreaking collateral havoc and decided, not unreasonably, to bring them to account. So US Secretary Of State William Ross (reappearing for the first time since he was just a monster-chasing General in The Incredible Hulk) presents the Sokovia Accord, signed by 117 countries, which states the Avengers should be answerable to the United Nations. Wracked with guilt over his Ultron faux-pas, Tony Stark’s all for it, and Robert Downey Jr burdens the still occasionally glib hero with a weight-of-the-world weariness that is well matched by his own MCU mileage. But stubborn Steve, distrustful of the post-war world’s version of ‘authority’, refuses to sign on the dotted line. It’s bold of writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely to place their title hero in the most obviously dubious position. If the Avengers don’t answer to the UN, who should they answer to? And Steve’s defence of Bucky is questionable: he may be his childhood friend, but now he’s a lethal, robot-armed killing machine forever in danger of being reactivated. It’s fair enough that he should be brought to heel, right? Then again, there are flaws in Tony’s arguments, too, especially the problematic evidence on which he rests them. Who the audience should agree with is hardly a clear-cut matter. It’s even bolder that the conflict at the film’s heart doesn’t pander to genre convention and become sidetracked by a grandstanding supervillain plot. And this is the second way Civil War earns our ‘Greatest Marvel Yet’ accolade: by rising above the series’ greatest weakness. Too often, the snappy writing and slick action in these films is undermined by flimsy big bads and formulaic final acts. Yet there is no Loki or Ultron (or, for that matter, Lex Luthor) equivalent this time. Not a whiff of Thanos, or any more of those forgettable Marvel sub-baddies with ‘The’ for a middle name. There is a meddling manipulator — of course there is — but, interestingly, their agenda is as blurred as Steve’s and Tony’s. Arguably just as sympathetic, too. Directors Joe and Anthony Russo don’t just want to rocket your heart into your mouth with their action sequences, which have the tight choreography of a Greengrass Bourne, and the brutal flair of a Gareth Evans rumble; they want to keep your brain firmly engaged, too. Who needs a villain when you have Steve and Tony? Both protagonists. Both antagonists. And drawing other power-people to their cause in surprising ways. The clashes go far beyond the set-up squabbles of Avengers Assemble. Or even that other big 2016 superhero showdown. Forget Batman v Superman. Here you get Ant-Man v Spider-Man, Hawkeye v Black Widow, Scarlet Witch v Vision, The Winter Soldier v Black Panther and (well, duh) Captain America v Iron Man, all rolled into one. And that is what you call the ultimate Marvel superhero event."
"Apr 13, 2016",POSITIVE," 
	As the third Captain America film jump-starts the summer movie season, and something called Phase 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, its box-office muscle is beyond question. 
	After a brief prologue set in 1991, the film dives headlong into action overkill on the streets of Lagos, where the Avengers chase down a group of murderous mercenaries. But overkill turns out to be the heart of the matter, or at least a key plot engine. The heroes foil the criminals, but not before the energy-projecting Wanda “Scarlet Witch” Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) inadvertently sets a high-rise on fire, resulting in many civilian casualties. 
	Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), shaken by a confrontation with the mother of someone killed in Sokovia (a sharp cameo by Alfre Woodard), is ready to be “put in check.” But Rogers (Chris Evans), who is, after all, a frozen and revivified member of the Greatest Generation, still in his youthful prime, sees giving in to the demands as giving up. And so the lines are drawn, with charmer Sam “The Falcon” Wilson (Anthony Mackie) the first to join Team Cap. Natasha “Black Widow” Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson), War Machine (Don Cheadle) and the nonhuman, purple-visaged Vision (Paul Bettany) side with Iron Man, which soon puts them in the position of policing their former colleagues. 
	In many ways the movie’s red-blue divide (the color distinctions are based on Judianna Makovsky’s stellar superhero outfits) is far more nuanced than the split in U.S. electoral politics. But the screenplay’s angsting over the ethics of being a crime-stopper is also, finally, an excuse for more pummeling clashes. There’s the complicating matter of a ruthless villain, Zemo (Daniel Bruhl), and the race to stop him. And, not least, there’s the necessity of world-colliding skirmishes between Team Cap and Team Iron Man, their superpowers on showstopping display in a spectacular sequence at the Leipzig airport that benefits from flashes of humor and self-awareness, as well as Trent Opaloch’s dynamic camerawork. 
	The movie’s center does hold, though, in the well-played contrast between Steve Rogers and Tony Stark. Rogers’ anachronistic aspects are no longer the source of punchlines, and Evans persuasively conveys his decency without overstating the matter. Through their contained performances, he and Sebastian Stan, as Bucky Barnes (aka the Winter Soldier), give emotional heft to their characters’ friendship, a crucial element of the story. Just as crucial, Evans leaves room for doubt about whether Rogers is right to resist outside rules, even as the film clearly sides with him. 
	Downey, whose ace timing and effortless snark make him the movie’s chief comic relief, also provides pivotal emotional chords. In a well-earned twist that revolves around Stark, past and present converge in wrenching ways. The revelation adds extra oomph to a striking early scene — reportedly one of the most CGI-labor-intensive pieces of the pic — in which billionaire Stark uses technology to revisit a traumatic moment. In addition to cameos by John Slattery and Hope Davis, the segment features a digitally de-aged Downey playing Stark’s younger self. 
	Yet another cross-brand introduction, however transparent, takes shape as a comic set piece in Civil War. The terrific sequence involves Stark’s recruitment of a certain New Yorker named Peter Parker, and Tom Holland’s agile performance bodes well for next year’s Spider-Man reboot. That scene is tipped by the appearance of the screen title “Queens” — itself a nice joke after the film’s succession of globe-hopping locales. From that Forest Hills apartment to Tony Stark’s modernist lair to the cold metallic grunge of a floating prison, Owen Paterson’s assured production design, enhanced by the effects team’s polished work, gives vivid form to the Avengers’ world, whether they’re saving it or leaving it in a bit of a mess."
"Apr 13, 2016",POSITIVE," The shaming of “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice” will continue apace — or better still, be forgotten entirely — in the wake of “Captain America: Civil War,” a decisively superior hero-vs.-hero extravaganza that also ranks as the most mature and substantive picture to have yet emerged from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Very much an “Avengers” movie in scope and ambition if not title (the conspicuous absence of Thor and Hulk notwithstanding), this chronicle of an epic clash between two equally noble factions, led by Captain America and Iron Man, proves as remarkable for its dramatic coherence and thematic unity as for its dizzyingly inventive action sequences; viewers who have grown weary of seeing cities blow up ad nauseam will scarcely believe their luck at the relative restraint and ingenuity on display. Buoyed by hearty critical support, 3D ticket premiums and enormous fan-ticipation, Disney’s May 6 release should have little trouble outperforming 2014’s “Captain America: The Winter Soldier” ($714 million worldwide) and could land in roughly the same commercial arena as the “Avengers” pics, both of which earned north of $1 billion globally. As directed with escalating confidence by sibling filmmakers Joe and Anthony Russo (who helmed “The Winter Soldier”), and intricately scripted by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (who have been with the series since 2011’s “Captain America: The First Avenger”), “Civil War” is nothing if not a testament to the benefits of continuity; this is the rare Marvel sequel that feels like not just a continuation but a culmination. You can sense the movie plumbing the depths of its own history with a 1991-set opening flashback, in which James “Bucky” Buchanan (the brooding Sebastian Stan) is sprung from cryogenic deep-freeze by Russian soldiers, who proceed to activate the cold-blooded, metal-armed killing machine lurking within known as the Winter Soldier. The nature of his first assignment is a mystery to which the picture occasionally alludes but leaves chillingly unresolved until the end. Back in the present day, Bucky’s estranged old buddy Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), aka Captain America, finds himself on a routine mission in Lagos with his team, which includes the fierce Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), the telekinetically gifted Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), and the high-flying Sam Wilson/Falcon (Anthony Mackie). But the ensuing battle has tragically unforeseen consequences, and the U.S. secretary of state (William Hurt), fed up with the fiery trail of fatalities and mass destruction the Avengers have left behind them, encourages them to agree to the Sokovia Accords, which will place them under the jurisdiction of the United Nations. Haunted by his own role in the civilian deaths that occurred during the big-bang climax of “Avengers: Age of Ultron,” Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) wholeheartedly supports this solution, which is also backed by his faithful No. 2, Lt. James Rhodes/War Machine (Don Cheadle), and the otherworldly humanoid philosopher-freak known as the Vision (Paul Bettany). But while Natasha and Wanda both understand the logic of Tony’s decision, Rogers is having none of it: To submit to the U.N., he feels, would deal too great a blow to their autonomy and effectively destroy their ability to mobilize and act as needed. Captain America’s defiance only intensifies when yet another deadly attack occurs, this time in Vienna, and the Winter Soldier is clearly implicated. As far as Iron Man is concerned, the Buck stops here, but Rogers, like the audience, knows there’s more to the story than meets the eye. Not every globe-trotting action movie is self-critical enough to acknowledge the many lives that are presumably lost when buildings blow up and cars flip over. And while the idea of collateral damage was certainly central to the conflict in “Batman v Superman,” that film ultimately banished any sense of ethical responsibility — and any lingering audience goodwill — with its bombastic and incoherent end-of-the-world climax. Whatever apocalyptic associations its title may generate, “Captain America: Civil War” turns out to be an infinitely smarter piece of multiplex mythmaking, blessed as it is with a new villain (played with unnerving subtlety by Daniel Bruhl) who has more on his mind than blowing human civilization to smithereens. And the sides-taking showdown between Team Captain America and Team Iron Man, far from numbing the viewer with still more callous acts of destruction, is likely to leave you admiring its creativity. This is probably the point at which a spoiler warning should be interjected, mainly for those readers perceptive enough to detect spoilers in paragraph breaks and pop-up ads. Not that it will come as much of a surprise to anyone with a degree in MCU studies that “Civil War’s” roster of fighters includes the first big-screen incarnation of T’Challa/Black Panther (a striking Chadwick Boseman), as well as the latest incarnation of Spider-Man, with the plucky young British actor Tom Holland (“The Impossible,” “In the Heart of the Sea”) donning the nervous, nerdy mien of Peter Parker to terrifically scene-stealing effect. We may be watching a series of trailers for these characters’ stand-alone projects, but they’re damn good trailers, and they dutifully uphold the playful egalitarian spirit that defines the Marvel comic-book universe. “Everyone’s got a gimmick,” one guy notes wearily as the battle gets under way, but for a deliriously entertaining stretch, “Captain America: Civil War” delights in showing us what happens when those gimmicks collide. Under the supervision of the crack visual-effects team at Industrial Light & Magic, the laws of physics are upheld and gloriously flouted at will; it’s surprising how effectively a Spidey web holds up against even the Winter Soldier’s superhuman strength, or just how much trouble Ant-Man (Paul Rudd, earning one of the movie’s biggest applause moments) can cause when the inspiration seizes him. (The one character whose contribution feels superfluous here is Jeremy Renner’s Hawkeye, who continues to register with all the commitment and charisma of a junior-high archery instructor.) The Russos handle the action with growing assurance and impressive range, shooting the early fight scenes with an almost “Bourne”-style handheld intensity, in contrast with the more classically framed skirmishes that follow. Even more impressively, the film feels sincerely invested in the questions it raises about freedom vs. responsibility, heroism vs. vigilantism, and what those distinctions say about the individuals making them. In assembling this Marvel male weepie, scribes Markus and McFeely show a rare talent for spinning cliches into artful motifs: The pain of deep, irrecoverable loss recurs throughout the narrative, and for both Iron Man and Captain America, the bonds of friendship are shown to run deeper than any commitment to the greater good. The back-slapping happy ending toward which the movie seems to be making a beeline somehow fails, at the last minute, to materialize. Evans has never been the most charismatic or interesting figure even in his own franchise, and while that remains true here, the opportunity to take an unpopular stand for what he believes in lends this sturdily old-fashioned character a more compelling edge. Notably, “Civil War” doesn’t play Captain America for laughs or treat him as a genial anachronism in the way that the earlier films did; its most crucial flashback to the guy’s pre-coma existence (which occasions a brief, impressive turn by Emily VanCamp) exists mainly so that we can hear his inner determination put into words: “Compromise where you can. And where you can’t, don’t.” While their resolve is every bit as firm as their abs and biceps, to say nothing of their titanium suits and vibranium shields, one senses the growing schism between Captain America and Iron Man will be healed in the long run (though perhaps not until after the two-part “Avengers: Infinity War,” which the Russos are set to direct). But for the purposes of this surprisingly fleet-footed 146-minute entertainment, Evans and especially Downey invest their characters’ ideological divide with a potent sense of conviction, which helps offset the generally two-dimensional feel of the many other characters squeezed into the margins. In the almost-too-smooth fashion that has come to define even Marvel’s non-Joss Whedon-directed entries, a steady undercurrent of droll, wisecracking humor punctures the tension at key intervals, to continually amusing if somewhat ingratiating effect; it’s a bit deflating when Iron Man at one point actually invokes “The Manchurian Candidate,” rather than simply allowing the obvious reference to speak for itself. All of which is to say that this clean-burning cinematic engine may qualify as a peak Marvel experience, but it isn’t a transcendent one; transcendence simply doesn’t factor into the calculations of a franchise dedicated more to its long-term survival strategy than to the quality of any individual chapter. “Captain America: Civil War” doesn’t break the mold; it burnishes the brand, and sets a high but not insurmountable bar. Let the games continue."
"Apr 13, 2016",POSITIVE," Captain America: Civil War marks a watershed moment in the vaunted annals of comic book cinema: Finally, a big budget superhero sequel that manages to be both effortlessly entertaining and utterly sobering, instead of just one of those things—or, as we’ve endured too frequently in the past, neither of them. (Looking at you, Batman v Superman.) You might argue that other films that have come before Marvel’s Captain America threequel have achieved such equilibrium, but let’s be real, you’d be lying to yourself. Not even Disney’s Marvel machine has yet been able to shake off formula or self-seriousness in service of spandexed superhero franchising. There’s just been too much tiresome worldbuilding and origin storytelling to do anything more than watch heroes wrestle with their great powers and their great responsibilities while saving humankind from the baddies who emerge from the skies, or the laboratories, or the fanatical paramilitary terrorist cells bent on world domination. But in Civil War, the groundwork has already been laid—or rather, destroyed. A year after Tony Stark and his Avengers saved the world from Ultron but, oops, left the third-world nation of Sokovia in ruins, the collateral cost of superhero peacekeeping is still making the world deservedly nervous. So when the gang tracks old S.H.I.E.L.D. turncoat Crossbones (Frank Grillo) to Lagos and an otherwise routine mission goes horribly awry, leaving dozens dead, the Avengers find themselves directly on the hook for the loss of innocent lives. The high-profile international incident sparks a philosophical divide within and outside of the team as the leaders of the world call for the Avengers to sign the pointedly named Sokovia Accord and submit themselves to global government oversight. To Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), who’s getting old and has begun to question the price of his superhero lifestyle, it’s a wake-up call the Avengers should answer. But Steve Rogers, aka Captain America (Chris Evans), disagrees. As the super-serumed product of U.S. military might, he’s wary of being used as a pawn by politicians whose shadowy agendas might shift at any moment. Shit happens when you’re trying to save lives, he argues. And besides, it is his movie. When Cap’s BFF Bucky Barnes aka The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) is suspected of a devastating terrorist act in the wake of Lagos, he defies Stark to aid and abet his old pal. Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) join him. Meanwhile, Rhodey aka War Machine (Don Cheadle), Vision (Paul Bettany), and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) stick by Iron Man. They’re joined by Wakandan royal T’Challa (Chadwick Boseman), who dons his razor-clawed Black Panther suit when tragedy hits close to home, and the civil war within the Avengers is game on. Screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely do an outstanding job of ignoring the imperatives of intergalactic interlopers (Thanos is somewhere out there, planning his visit to Earth) in order to focus inward, where a far more complex dialogue is to be had. As the Avengers pick their sides behind Iron Man and Captain America, each with his or her own reason, Civil War underscores the ramifications of personal superhero politics: Are they Earth’s Mightiest Heroes or America’s? Vigilantes or peacekeepers? Should they schedule psych evaluations every time they save the world, maybe before they loosen the spandex and go for celebratory beers and post-battle shawarma? It’s most unfortunate for Warner Bros. that, at its core, Civil War explores the same existential themes as Batman v Superman—only far better articulated, and with fewer mommy issues (spoiler: No Marthas die on the Avengers’ watch… that we know of). Instead of two lone superman-children trading blows in the rain, Civil War’s ensemble is made up of grown people wrestling with grown-people problems in the light of day, negotiating their conflicting worldviews in the name of living and working together. Civil War is a movie about infighting families and what happens when maybe no one is absolutely right. In an election year, it’s the blockbuster equivalent to a heated debate over politics and civil liberties waged across the dinner table, writ large. It’s not hard to see why Bernie bros would get behind Captain America. Technically he’s a senior citizen who’s all for government accountability and isn’t afraid of going against the status quo. If Cap is Bernie then Iron Man is Hillary, the team leader with a spotty record on war asking people to get behind his vision of a reasoned new future. If there is a Trump, it’s Daniel Bruhl’s Zemo, a man of murky agenda lurking in the shadows with personal investment in the mayhem. And Civil War comes close to matching the first Iron Man’s sense of balance between delivering winking superhero shenanigans and comprehending how much more those antics mean, and should mean, in a post-9/11 world. Here, more than we’ve seen in previous MCU installments, every bit of action has not only real-world weight, but also consequences for its characters. Joe and Anthony Russo, who helmed 2014’s Captain America: The Winter Soldier and are also onboard for the two-part Avengers: Infinity War pics, direct some of Marvel’s best action to date—starting with a quickfire sequence in Lagos, where the Avengers tangle with Crossbones and his heavily armed goons in a crowded marketplace. There’s a remarkably visceral kineticism to the fight choreography and camera work reminiscent of ’90s Hong Kong John Woo with a dash of more recent martial art showcases like The Raid. This might be the first time a superhero movie has captured what superheroes should look like in hand-to-hand combat—not floating on wires or clouds of pixels, but delivering crushing blows and super-powered punches that remind us these are superbeings on Earth and not cartoon characters in a video game. Another standout set piece sees Bucky, now looking like a bionic long-haired European backpacker, fighting his way out of an apartment building with Captain America as the fuzz close in with orders to kill him on sight. It’s one of the more complex, character-driven action sequences in recent memory even before it turns into a four-way hero fight when Falcon and Black Panther join the party. Civil War excels when it brings the split Avengers together in battle, and when it gives its new characters screen time to shine. As T’Challa, Boseman conveys a deep-rooted sense of justice that translates into leonine muscularity as Black Panther. Paul Rudd’s Ant-Man, who’s in line for a sequel of his own, charms his way through his cameo in the big ensemble brawl and steals the movie with a hugely crowd-pleasing moment. But the real discovery of Civil War is also the film’s biggest coup: Spider-Man. Landing the rights to the character that’s become synonymous with Sony’s superhero interests was in itself a huge win for Marvel and Disney, and MCU newcomer Tom Holland manages to wipe every previous version of Spider-Man off the books. Recruited by Tony Stark in a superbly crackling introductory scene, he swings his way into the group dynamic, bringing a welcome breath of levity along with him. Like Boseman’s Black Panther and Rudd’s Ant-Man, Holland’s effervescent Spidey not only makes you understand who he is and how he fits into the Avengersverse—more importantly to Marvel maestro Kevin Feige’s grand scheme, he makes you actually want to see him lead his own stand-alone adventure. (Which is good news for Marvel, because that’s coming next summer.) It’s a good sign for Marvel’s Phase 3 that Captain America: Civil War manages to strike a perfect tonal balance while exploring more sobering real-world parallels. A feeling of urgency permeates the proceedings, as if the Avengers are reckoning with a moral debate that will determine who they are and how they act in the coming films. It’s time our superhero movies thoughtfully questioned the casualties of war and peace, what happens when emotion and ego overshadow the big picture, and the lasting ripple effect of grief and how we never really get over the loss of loved ones. Sure, it took Marvel 13 movies to express its most considered moral exploration of superhero figures as fallible agents of global security while at the same time delivering jokes about the bodily emissions of Spider-Man’s web-shooters and deliciously gratuitous moments of lingering Chris Evans biceps porn. And yes, Disney has 10 more tentpoles coming from the MCU in the next three years alone. WB and DC certainly have a great deal of catching up to do after their BvS box office disappointment, but every studio in the superhero game benefits from how well Civil War staves off the spandex fatigue—at least, for now. "
"Apr 13, 2016",POSITIVE," About midway through Captain America: Civil War, Steve Rogers (played again by Chris Evans) is involved in an impromptu make-out session on the side of a German highway. (I won’t say with whom, as to avoid those dreaded spoilers.) After, he looks back at the beat-up Volkswagen Beetle he’s been driving. Inside of the VW are his friends, Sam Wilson (a.k.a. Falcon, played by Anthony Mackie) and Bucky Barnes (a.k.a. The Winter Soldier, played by Sebastian Stan). Sam and Bucky don’t get along too well – Sam and Bucky had just been bickering about the legroom in the car – but both stop long enough to give Steve that “Oh, yeah” look of approval. Everyone in the audience I saw it with laughed. Sure, Marvel is marketing Captain America: Civil War as “dark,” but it’s not “dark.” “Dark” is boring. Everyone thinks they want a dark film because the word “dark” sounds cool. So pretty much every movie that falls into the nerd genre will be marked as dark. Go back and look it up for any movie. “Oh, it will be dark.” That’s pretty much every director or cast member talking about his or her next superhero film. The trick is not actually releasing a “dark” movie. Hey, I’ll hand it to Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, it’s kind of a dark movie. It’s so dark I almost fell asleep. The go-to “dark” movie is The Empire Strikes Back. (Which is referenced in Captain America: Civil War in the best possible way, which made me very happy.) The Empire Strikes Back isn’t “dark,” it’s just “good.” There’s plenty of humor. And then bad things happen to characters we care about. I wish we could ban the word “dark.” It’s a crutch. Do you want to watch something “dark?” Stare at this for the next two hours. Knock yourself out. There is a lot going on in Captain America: Civil War, but, as a viewer, you don’t really notice any of that until it’s over. After I saw the movie, I sat at a bar with a colleague for two hours going over the plot. After that two hours, we both decided it made sense. Things said early in the movie have huge repercussions late in the movie. (Here’s a hint: Pay attention to everything Daniel Brühl’s character says.) Early in the film, Captain America, Falcon, Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) are on a mission in Africa. Things go well, until they don’t. Yet again, innocent people have died because of something the Avengers are directly involved with and the governments around the world have had enough. Accords are drawn up – spearheaded by Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt… it’s kind of fun to see characters from The Incredible Hulk. Remember that movie?) – that all the Avengers are expected to sign. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr. … ha, like you didn’t know!), who had been confronted earlier by a woman (Alfre Woodard) whose son died in Sokovia during the events of Avengers: Age of Ultron – is in support of signing these accords. I don’t think learning about an innocent person’s death changes Tony, but it feels more like “the final straw.” This isn’t a “dark” (there’s that stupid word again!) or evil Tony Stark in Civil War. It’s more a Tony Stark we’ve seen build to this moment. It’s a Tony Stark who, in the first Iron Man movie, had an epiphany and decided Stark Industries would no longer sell military weapons. Now, it seems like he looks at the Avengers the same way: Something he once saw as “good” or, at the very least, “business,” is now something that should be kept in check. Remember, it’s Tony’s fault that Ultron was unleashed on the world. This is a guy with a lot of guilt. Tony isn’t different, he’s just become jaded – jaded at how and why this group does what they do. Batman and Superman fight because, well, that sounds like a cool movie. Iron Man and Captain America fight because this is the 13th movie and, after some time, everyone will get in arguments about something. Only in this case, the people with a disagreement either have super powers or they have a super suit. (Without giving too much away, the accords spark a disagreement, but “other things” factor in that truly make Tony and Steve hate each other. I will not reveal what that is, but it’s earned.) Oh, yes, “the big fight between all of the Avengers.” This scene is cinematic joy. I found myself laughing a lot, even though what I was watching wasn’t that funny. But it made me happy, and I like being happy. Even though here are all the Avengers (plus Black Panther and Spider-Man and Ant-Man), turned against each other, it’s still handled in a way that is mostly fun. Good gracious, is it fun. Why are they fighting? Again, it’s not really the accords. A bomb goes off near a United Nations meeting in Vienna while the accords were being signed. The world blames Bucky Barnes. T’Challa (a.k.a. The Black Panther, played by Chadwick Boseman), who was at the UN when the explosion goes off, really blames Bucky. The world wants Bucky Barnes dead. Captain America won’t let anyone harm Bucky. This is what sets up the major conflict in the film. (Again, hint: Pay attention to everything Daniel Brühl’s character says.) I’ve probably written too much already. I am really trying to be careful not to give too much away. But this movie is a delight, though dense. People will love Tom Holland’s Spider-Man, who is in the movie a lot more than I thought he’d be. People will love Chadwick Boseman’s Black Panther. Even those who missed Ant-Man will love Paul Rudd’s starstruck superhero who can’t believe he’s meeting Captain America. Good grief, I still haven’t even mentioned Paul Bettany’s now-domesticated Vision, who looks like he shops at The Gap – which so much reminds me of those mid-‘80s Avengers comics. I also haven’t mentioned Don Cheadle’s Rhodey, who has a scene that ignites an entire narrative. I also haven’t mentioned Jeremy Renner’s Hawkeye, who probably has the smallest role of the major players, yet still has an arc. Even Emily VanCamp’s Sharon Carter has a much bigger role than she did in The Winter Soldier. There are so many characters in this movie… I give up. It’s a minor miracle this movie not only makes any sense, but is also good. Captain America: Civil War feels like a pinnacle for Marvel. Like, I can’t imagine their movies getting any better. This feels like the crescendo. This feels like the movie this series has been building towards for eight years. After all these movies, Marvel earned this fight. This is the best Marvel movie so far. This is not hyperbole. I have my doubts they can make anything better. This is as close as things come to “superhero movie perfection.” This movie made me really happy.

"Apr 13, 2016",POSITIVE," At this point, the team-up film is Marvel Studios’ bread and butter. They set the world on fire back in 2012 with Joss Whedon’s The Avengers, and in the years since then have repeatedly orchestrated creative groupings and pairings that continue to demonstrate the tremendous fun and inventiveness that comes from bringing engaging, interesting characters together. They repeatedly set a high bar in this area, and are not only constantly reaching for it with each new project, but basically have the entire industry doing it, too. Now, however, we have Joe and Anthony Russo’s Captain America: Civil War, which succeeds in raising the bar higher than you’d think it could go. Functioning as both a sequel to Captain America: The Winter Solider and The Avengers: Age of Ultron, the film is the most comprehensive Marvel Cinematic Universe chapter to date, and while that put a great deal on the plate of writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the movie soars because the challenge is accepted and responded to in brilliant and entertaining fashion. Bringing together tremendous character dynamics; bold structure; an emotional narrative earned after years of story work; and spell-binding, fun action sequences, it’s everything a blockbuster should be. Loosely based on the 2006-2007 Marvel Comics event series with which it partially shares a title, Captain America: Civil War picks up with its titular character (Chris Evans) working with his Avengers teammates – Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), Vision (Paul Bettany), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and War Machine (Don Cheadle) – to stop terror around the globe. After a mission in Africa winds up causing a tremendous deal of collateral damage, however, the team suddenly finds itself under scrutiny and the subject of controversy. In order to put the Earth’s Mightiest Heroes in check, Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) presents the team – as well as former members Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) and Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) – the opportunity to sign the Sokovia Accords: a document named after the destroyed city from The Avengers: Age of Ultron that would force The Avengers to work under a United Nations panel that would determine exactly when and where the team would go into action. This idea is supported by some, including Tony, Vision, Black Widow and War Machine, but Captain America, Falcon and Scarlet Witch are not shy about their resentfulness of the idea. The Sokovia Accords are the powder keg, and it winds up being Bucky Barnes/The Winter Solider (Sebastian Stan) who lights the fuse. A terrorist attack is pinned on Captain America’s best-friend-turned-assassin, and while Cap is instructed to leave the situation alone, it’s an order that he rebels against – turning him into a fugitive. All the while, a mysterious man named Helmut Zemo (Daniel Bruhl) operates in the shadows, searching for key information tied to Bucky’s past. Captain America: Civil War features what is unquestionably the largest ensemble we’ve seen yet in a Marvel Studios movie, and while the narrative isn’t quite as strong as Captain America: The Winter Soldier, where the film makes up for it is in its tremendous character work – both in its understanding of who these pop culture figures are at their core, and having them play off of each other. There’s no better example of the former in the film than Chadwick Boseman as the newly introduced T’challa, a.k.a. Black Panther, who is every bit as regal, intelligent, bold and passionate as the hero is on the page. And while they don’t have as much screen time as some of the other Avengers characters, there is nobody in their right mind who will walk away from the blockbuster not loving the absolutely brilliant return of Paul Rudd as Scott Lang/Ant-Man, and the long-awaited arrival of Tom Holland as Peter Parker/Spider-Man (who in just a handful of scenes fully encapsulates everything we love about the spectacular web-slinger and overwhelms us with excitement about the future of this iteration). This film isn’t just about singular impressive performances, however: it’s an opportunity to see how these heroes both relate to each other and act when they are at odds, and the work done by the Russo brothers and Markus and McFeely is stunning. The headliner, of course, is the key conflict between Captain America and Iron Man - whose emotional battle will tear at the heartstrings of every fan like they’re watching their own parents go through a messy divorce – but the truth is that this is a feature where you can throw a rock and hit amazing character dynamics. As best friends of Cap, teammates, and former opponents, Falcon and Bucky have one of the most complex relationships in the movie, and it actually translates into a ton of laughs whenever they’re paired up. On the more serious side of the story, Wanda and Vision are wonderfully brought together, not only because of their relationship in the comics but also because there is a bond between them as “newborns” in the superhero realm. Somehow, everybody gets a moment with everybody, and yet Civil War has zero fat and never swings too far away from the central plot. All of this couldn’t be pulled off within the basic superhero movie structure (heroes meet villain; heroes get beaten by villain; heroes recuperate; heroes defeat villain in large-scale showdown), so it’s a good thing that Captain America: Civil War burns that book in favor of a much more unconventional and risky approach. Without giving anything away, the film trades out a big, splashy, blockbuster finale (putting that sequence in the second act) in favor of something much more intimate and personal that works because it’s been earned over the last eight years of Marvel Studios storytelling, and the audience really cares about the characters. The movie takes some big swings, but that’s just how it’s able to knock it out of the park. It’s easy to respect Captain America: Civil War because of the emotional and thoughtful approach it takes towards its characters instead of just having them punching and kicking each other – but the punching and kicking happens to be pretty phenomenal as well. In terms of action sequences, Marvel features have come a long way since the mediocre final battle in the original Iron Man, and while Joe and Anthony Russo blew us away with battles and set pieces in Captain America: The Winter Solider, their sequel ups the ante in every away. From the Avengers’ explosive mission at the start of the film to Cap and Winter Soldier’s attempt to escape from a building teeming with cops, it’s all intricately crafted and incredibly memorable. It should be noted, however, that every scene in the movie pales in comparison to the airport-set hero vs. hero battle in the second act – which I do not hesitate to call the greatest scene in the history of the comic book movie genre. The Marvel Cinematic Universe on the whole is filled with great films and blockbuster gems, but between The First Avenger, The Winter Solider and now Civil War, it’s been firmly proven that they have a better grip on Captain America than any of their heroes, and it can be said with confidence that the three movies come together to create the greatest superhero trilogy of all time. The new movie is equally thrilling, fun, engaging, emotional, smart, and thought-provoking, and really everything you want from summer entertainment.
