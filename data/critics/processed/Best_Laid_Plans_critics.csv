"Feb 5, 2012"," The title, a misquotation from the most famous line of Robert Burns's poem ""To a Mouse"", directs us to John Steinbeck's novella, and indeed this modest movie is an urban reworking of Of Mice and Men in present day Nottingham. The kind-hearted mentally handicapped Lennie (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) becomes the gentle black giant Joseph. His devoted protector George (Stephen Graham) is turned into Danny, a petty Scouse crook, who's forced to hire out his friend as a bare-knuckle boxer to local gang boss (David O'Hara) to settle a debt. The film is a cut above recent British low-life crime pictures and finds suitable girlfriends for both men while ignoring the third of Nelson Algren's rules for life – never sleep with a woman whose problems are worse than your own.",POSITIVE

"Feb 2, 2012"," There are some good intentions in this movie – based loosely on John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men – and a good cast. But it really is a treacly slice of sentimental social-realism, bordering on self-parody. Stephen Graham is a small-time crook living in Nottingham with his best mate, Joseph (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), a gentle, childlike giant of a man with learning difficulties, fierce in his loyalties and handy with his fists. Danny is a drinker and a cokehead who owes a lot of money to a local gangster called Curtis (David O'Hara). Some muddled plotting takes us to a resolution whereby Curtis will forgive Danny's debts if he forces poor Joseph to take part in his illegal and dangerous cage-fighting ring; meanwhile Joseph has fallen in love with Isabel (Maxine Peake), who also has learning difficulties. The tear-jerking story is never convincing for a single moment: this is Britfilm world, filled with geezer cliches and confected grittiness. A waste of a decent cast.",NEUTRAL
