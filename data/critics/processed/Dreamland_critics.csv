Two attractive young people on the run from the law is a movie journey many of us have long loved to sign up to. All aboard with Bonnie and Clyde, Thelma and Louise and countless others, from the heroes on the other side of the law in True Romance to A Bout de Souffle to Read My Lips.  Earlier this year Queen & Slim brought the '""lovers on the run"" formula into the present with its two black American leads in a blend of romance, road movie and crime thriller. Dreamland is set in the mid-1930s, the era when two memorable movie outlaws, Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow, were of course on the loose too. Who can forget the chutzpah that Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty brought to their characters in the 1967 classic Bonnie and Clyde? Or the slow motion, blood-spattered finale when the pair were gunned down by police? We don't believe we've heard of the main characters in Dreamland before, Allison Wells and Eugene Evans. They are played by Australian actor Margot Robbie, one of the producers, and British actor Finn Cole (from TV's Peaky Blinders).  The camera always loves Robbie, who is of course the star, but Cole is touching as the impressionable young man who falls for her despite the price on her head after she was involved in a bank robbery that left five people dead. Eugene joins the bounty hunters and searches high and low. If he found Allison Wells and won the $10,000 price on her head, he would leave Texas behind. There isn't much for him there and he isn't happy at home on the farm with his mother, young half-sister and step-father. Rural Texas in the 1930s Great Depression was a pitiless place. Over-grazing and severe drought had degraded the great South Plains region, the agricultural heartland, and brought it to its knees.  It is a handy spot to draw attention to, and when she asks Eugene to help her take it out and treat the wound, the wide-eyed young man can hardly say no. The seductive fugitive has the attributes and the wiles of a femme fatale, when she puts her mind to it, and she needs help to get out of her predicament.  Even though Allison had turned up in the maw of the law, that is the barn of Eugene's step-dad, Deputy Sheriff George Evans, she can talk her way out of it.  The film's villain, the pugnacious deputy sheriff, is played by Travis Fimmel, another Australian. He sports a brutal pudding-bowl haircut and reads the riot act to Eugene while skinning a rabbit.  It's an engaging but too familiar exercise despite the strong performances and the insights into another time and place when people wore masks and the land ""turned on them"". There is a lot to like about the cinematography by Lyle Vincent, from the interesting drone shots, camera angles and subjective images framed like the old box camera.  The location shots of mountainous dust storms billowing above the dustbowl look just like photographs of the 1930s dust storm events themselves. They are not the product of the filmmakers' imagination.  The story is bookended and intermittently narrated by folksy voiceover from Eugene's younger sister Phoebe, when she is all grown up. She is seen here played by Darby Camp, another good performance.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 28, 2022"," The fourth film produced by Margot Robbie for her Lucky Chap Production company, the Aussie A-lister also stars in this drama set during the Great Depression.  Finn Cole plays Eugene, a young man living with his family in a small rural American town. His humdrum life is turned upside down when he finds Allison (Robbie), a bank robber on the run, hiding in his parents’ barn. He agrees to help her escape in exchange for a big payoff, but soon becomes smitten with Allison, seeing her as a path to a more exciting life.  The film has some interesting ideas, but can never seem to quite thread everything together. It’s refreshing to see a story where it’s a young man getting swept off his feet by a charming female criminal, with Allison often having the emotional power over her would-be accomplice. Robbie is powerful in the lead, morphing into whatever she needs to be to get a mile further away from capture. One of those personas is the girl of Eugene’s dreams, a façade he buys into happily. The enigmatic qualities of Robbie’s performance mean we’re never quite sure if she genuinely grows to love him on the way or, as she puts it, she’d “rather be scared with you than alone”.  Equally as intriguing is the setting of a dust bowl town. A broken Dreamland where once everyone came in search of fortune, but now families leave in droves having given up hope. There’s a glimpse of this desperation in George (Travis Fimmel), Eugene’s step-father, a sheriff obsessed with pursuing Allison who perhaps sees some personal redemption in her capture. Outside of the leads, he has the most to do, becoming the cop on their tail who is hoodwinked by his own child.  While these are all interesting ideas, a lack of development means they remain sketches rather than portraits. An ever-present narration from Eugene’s sister tries to fill in the gaps, but the loose ends dangle in the breeze. Sub-plots such as Allison’s relationship with her deceased partner (Garrett Hedlund) and the fate of Eugene’s father don’t really go anywhere. A bathroom love scene feels sudden and awkward. It’s a thin story, told slowly, ensuring that any remanence of tension disappears.  Margot Robbie puts Dreamland on her back and makes something from very little. While this confirms her as a star you can rely on, there are better uses for her talents than this undercooked chase movie. ",NEUTRAL
"Jun 5, 2021"," Set during the Great Depression and amidst the dusty storms of small-town Texas, Miles Joris-Peyrafitte’s sophomore effort Dreamland opens with intoxicating narration courtesy of the half-sister of the film’s youthful outlaw protagonist. “Eugene left me with something more important than any of the facts. Now, first thing people get wrong about his story is the beginning.” Phoebe, that half-sister grown-up, conjures a historical milieu for us, her Malickian voiceover accompanying and commanding an impressive series of human portraits and geographical landscapes, stretching from the time of their parents’ venture into homesteading to Eugene Evans (Finn Cole) as a young man. His father left when he was five and sent him a postcard of Mexico, the “eye of God”; his stepfather, a sheriff’s deputy, shackles him to a restless state of discipline and mundanity. A clandestine reader of pulp fiction, Eugene longs for adventure: Mexico, Mozambique, anywhere away from the arid and meager prospects of subsistence farming. Such is his obsession with the gun-toting outlaws from his dreams that when one of them appears — first in the news, and then before his eyes — he plots not to take them into custody and claim a bounty that would put his family in financial comfort for the rest of his life, but to join them. Allison Wells (Margot Robbie), the outlaw in question and wanted for murder after a bank shoot-out, holds both subversive charm and sexual allure for Eugene; wounded from the shoot-out and recuperating inside the Evans’ barnyard, she recounts her misfortunes to the starstruck adolescent, desperate to impress upon him the severity of her situation and his pivotal role in transforming it. Naturally, concupiscence conquers its master, conservatism; with little but a loving mother and lovable sister to lose, and a whole life (potentially alongside Allison) to gain, Eugene sets out to chronicle the latter as his own. The gorgeous if somewhat generic expositions in Dreamland’s first half soon give way to a compelling odyssey of two souls on the lam. Joris-Peyrafitte, as if anticipating criticism of the initial stretch’s plodding aping of greater classics and their memorable world-building, soon changes gears and veers into storytelling proper, inflating his Bonnie and Clyde with a mythos befitting of legends. A wild-goose chase for dreamland finds itself outpaced by the sheriff’s team, Eugene’s stepfather included. Allison, unmoored from Eugene’s naïve buoyancy, tries to caution the boy: in one of the film’s most striking shots, the camera lingers on Eugene for the longest time in the shower as he strips and wrestles with this irreversible transition. We glimpse Allison only in the periphery, and not until he affirms their shared destiny does she come into frame, and their visages — previously cut off — emerge, united. Dreamland concludes with a running off into the great, unknown expanse of fiction; more important, sometimes, than any of the facts.",POSITIVE
"Jun 3, 2021"," Miles Joris-Peyrafitte, at 27 years old, shows now signs of slowing down and whose latest feature “Dreamland” loves old fashion romances. Saddled with admirable performances, and nods to cinematic gems like “Bonnie and Clyde,” Margot Robbie plays Allison, a gorgeous bank robber on the run and Finn Cole is Eugene, an innocent farm boy who becomes her savior. A familiar but contrived premise that begins earnestly before stalling at the finish line, minus a staggering final shot.  Unspooled through voiceover by Lola Kirke as Eugene’s younger sister, Phoebe, looks back on the past 20 years, specifically 1935 when she was a child during The Great Depression and dust storms ravaged Texas. This narration isn’t consistent, however, delivered in spurts to remind audiences whose guiding the journey. Aside from polished art direction, Lyle Vincent’s cinematography is brilliant at capturing fractured rural landscapes, including the lonely farm and a town on the brink of decimation. But when Eugene stumbles upon Allison, a fugitive on the run following a deadly robbery gone haywire, with a bullet wound inside the family’s barn, he’s suddenly found purpose. What follows is a predictable love triangle that, history dictates, can only end one way. At least they’re answers to Allison’s story: she claims to have killed no one in the robbery and lover boy Eugene decides to follow his heart over instincts. For his part, Cole does an exceptional job understanding the predicament his character is struggling with, especially with stepfather (Travis Fimmel) - a local Sheriff on the prowl for Allison’s $10,000 bounty - sniffing around asking questions. Despite Margot Robbie being covered in dirt smudges she’s still Margot Robbie of which no amount of dust could hide the fact. She’s a talented starlet and is basically this generation's Marilyn Monroe.  Joris-Peyrafitte’s creative choices are unique in that flashback sequences shift aspect ratios and the camera lingers on Eugene making tough, life changing, decisions. While this gives “Dreamland” a realm of believability, countless melodramatic cliches about life, urban legends, and those who tell our stories undermines Robbie and Cole’s electric chemistry. That alone saves “Dreamland” from being another lofty romance floating in the wind but it could use more luster.",NEGATIVE
"Jun 3, 2021"," This weird cinematic year enters its final month with the release of one of the best films of 2020. That you’ll probably watch it on Netflix rather in a theater seems emblematic given that streaming was the way most of us went to “the movies” this year. “Mank”: Why is it that one of today’s best filmmakers has never won an Oscar? From “Fight Club” to “The Social Network,” David Fincher has delivered provocative entertainment with intelligence and style. Here he dips into the creative genius of “Citizen Kane’s” alcoholic screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz (Gary Oldman) and his eventful relationship with director Orson Welles (Tom Burke), newspaper titan William Randolph Hearst (an impeccable Charles Dance) and Hearst’s actress-mistress Marion Davies (Amanda Seyfried, in one of her best performances yet). Shot in striking B&W and featuring an era-defining score from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, “Mank” ranks as one of Fincher’s finest as well as one of Oldman’s best performances. The screenplay from Jack Fincher — the filmmaker’s late father — deserves awards consideration. This is masterful filmmaking about Old Hollywood that reflects on this year’s tangled election. Details: 4 stars out of 4; in select theaters, available to stream Dec. 4 on Netflix. “Sound of Metal”: British actor and rapper Riz Ahmed astonishes with his electrifying portrayal of a heavy metal drummer who suddenly loses his hearing. Director and co-screenwriter Darius Marder, helming his first fiction feature film, immerses us into this compelling drama, giving it a lived-it feel through the use of muffled sound design and creative camera work. He focuses on the tentative steps Ahmed’s recovering addict takes to understand and adapt to his new life. Ahmed simply must get an Oscar nomination. It’s a beautiful tale about recovery and moving forward. Details: 3½ stars; in select theaters, available to stream Dec. 4 on Amazon Prime. “Godmothered”: Following in the footsteps of “Enchanted,” this new Disney+ charmer is a fractured fable in which a storybook fairy godmother gets plunked down into a contemporary setting, where she makes a mess of things. It’s hardly an original concept, but “Godmothered” benefits from Jillian Bell, who gives a champagne sparkly performance as an upbeat godmother wannabe deigned to perk up a cynical single-mom journalist (Isla Fisher) by forcing a love connection with a potential Prince Charming. Sharon Maguire’s holiday heartwarmer subverts conventions, adding a dash of feminism and a sprinkling of strong supporting performances from Jane Curtin and June Squibb. Details: 3 stars; available Dec. 4 on Disney+. “Black Bear”: Lawrence Michael Levine’s satire is a discomforting experience and features bravura performances from Aubrey Plaza and Christopher Abbott. Too bad it’s so smug about its cleverness.The first 30 minutes make for a claustrophobic and intense probe into a three-pronged relationship that plays out over a night spent in a cabin in the woods. A narrative seismic change gives Plaza, Abbott and Sarah Gadon more dramatic terrain to explore, but “Bear” trods too-familiar turf. Details: 2½ stars; begins steaming Dec. 4 on multiple platforms. “Red, White and Blue”: “12 Years a Slave” filmmaker Steve McQueen hits another home run with the third release in his remarkable Small Axe anthology, which vividly depicts what life was like in the late-‘60s to mid-‘80s for London’s West Indian community. Like “Mangrove,” another Small Axe offering, this film reflects on police racism with a story inspired by real-life events. “Red, White and Blue” follows the story of Leroy Logan (John Boyega, of the “Star Wars” series), who enlisted in the London Metropolitan Police department with the intention of addressing its racist ways. The screenplay by Courttia Newland and McQueen shows the implicit and explicit racism that Logan encounters. McQueen focuses on Boyega’s facial reactions as racist comments spew from the mouths of his superiors. It’s chilling, heartbreaking and maddening to watch. Boyega is excellent, and a “Star Wars” reference helps lighten up the mood. Details: 3½ stars; available Dec. 4 on Amazon Prime. “Superintelligence”: It’s frustrating when a film begins with a promise and then settles on doing the same old, same old. That’s the crime of Melissa McCarthy’s latest bland dud with her husband and director Ben Falcone, a partnership on film that does neither any favors. McCarthy is immensely likeable as the “ordinary” Carol, a do-gooder possessing unexpected strengths that might save the world from a fickle AI (voice of James Corden). The initial scenes with Carol going out on lame job interviews are funny, but then the screenplay blows a gasket and drags the film into a crummy rom-com landscape that’s forced and forgettable. What a shame since Carol’s ex is played by Bobby Cannavale. Even his mega-charisma can’t breathe life into a stock character. I’m baffled why someone didn’t scream “rewrite” at least a dozen times during the filming. Details: 2 stars; available on HBO Max. “Dreamland’: It’s rare to complain about a film’s brevity, but this Dust Bowl-era Bonnie & Clyde-style piece needed to pack more meat on its bones. Margot Robbie is the draw, and she’s quite good as a bank robber cooped up in a barn where she fires up the hormones of a comic-book-lovin’ young man (Finn Cole, a standout). When the kid’s strict sheriff stepdaddy (Travis Fimmel) gets a clue on what’s going down, trouble ensues. The stylized direction along with Cole’s and Robbie’s performances make this worthwhile, but the screenplay needed to flesh out the attraction between the two leads. Details: 2½ stars; now streaming on various platforms. “Survival Skills”: A police rookie (ideally cast Vayu O’Donnell) sees his innocence lost and sanity tested in writer/director Quinn Armstrong’s first feature. Armstrong cleverly frames Jim’s disintegration in the form of a VHS training tape with Stacy Keach (a scream) warbling on about the “proper” methods of police work. “Survival Skills” is a head trip that shoots off into unexpected and topical directions. Details: 3½ stars; available beginning Dec. 4 on various platforms. “Disrupted”: A rich guy with secrets, an unsolved murder in Oakland and a middle-aged man handcuffed to his past collide in director/writer Andre Welsh’s wickedly clever film noir homage, filmed mostly in Oakland and near Lake Tahoe. It’s hilarious in spots, gory in others, and keeps you on edge throughout. Details: 3 stars; available on multiple platforms.",POSITIVE
"Jun 3, 2021"," Thriller starring Finn Cole and Margot Robbie. Life is tough for Eugene, a young man living with his family on a dusty, struggling farm in Depression-era Texas. When he discovers fugitive bank robber Allison hiding in a barn, Eugene is thrilled by her tales of outlaw life and joins her on the run, hoping for a way out of his desolate situation. The lean times of the Great Depression are evoked in this action-fuelled period drama starring Margot Robbie as a femme fatale who lures lovestruck teenager Finn Cole into a life of crime. Allison and Eugene are on the run from the law (including the latter's deputy sheriff stepfather) after a series of robberies, and the pursuit intensifies following the death of a bystander in the crossfire between cops and culprits. Director Miles Joris-Peyrafitte's film contains familiar tropes from such outlaw classics as Bonnie and Clyde and Badlands, but Dreamland flips the notion on its head by having the female as the chief manipulator. The leads are perfectly cast, with Cole especially good as the lonely misfit who dreams of a happy-ever-after future for the couple in Mexico, and the heists are executed with a suitably dreamlike visual flair.",POSITIVE
"Jun 3, 2021"," It’s a pretty crazy week for new releases as I mentioned a few times over the past couple weeks, but it’s bound to happen as we get closer to the holiday movie season, which this year won’t include many movies in theaters, even though movie theaters are still open in many areas of the country… and closing in others. Sigh. Besides a few high-profile Netflix theatrical release, we also get movies starring Vince Vaughn, Margot Robbie, Kate Winslet, Saoirse Ronan, Mel Gibson and more offerings. In fact, I’ve somehow managed to write 12 (!!!!) reviews this week… yikes. Before we get to the new movies, let’s look at a few series/festivals starting this week, including the always great documentary festival, DOC-NYC, which runs from November 11 through 19. A few of the docs I’ve already seen are (probably not surprisingly, if you know me) some of the music docs in the “Sonic Cinema” section, including Oliver Murray’s Ronnie’s, a film about legendary jazz musician and tenor sax player Ronnie Scott, whose London club Ronnie Scott’s Jazz Club has been one of the central cores for British jazz fans for many decades. Alex Winter’s Zappa is a much more satisfying portrait of the avant-garde rocker than the doc Frank Zappa: In His Own Words from a few years back, but I was even more surprised by how much I enjoyed Julien Temple’s Crock of Gold: A Few Rounds with Shane MacGowan, because I’ve never really been a Pogues fan, but it’s highly entertaining as we learn about the chronically-soused frontman of the popular Irish band. I haven’t seen Robert Yapkowitz and Richard Peete’s in My Own Time: A Portrait of Karen Dalton, a portrait of the blues and folk singer, yet, nor have I watched Marcia Jarmel and Ken Schneider’s Los Hermanos/The Brothers about two brother musicians separated from childhood after leaving their native Cuba, but I’ll try to get to both of them soon enough. Outside of the realm of music docs is Ilinca Calugareanu’s A Cops and Robbers Story, which follows Corey Pegues from being a drug dealer and gang member to a celebrated deputy inspector within the NYPD. There’s also Nancy (The Loving Story) Buirski’s A Crime on the Bayou, the third part of the filmmaker’s trilogy about brave individuals in the Civil Rights era, this one about 19-year-old New Orleans fisherman Gary Duncan who tries to break up a fight between white and black teens at an integrated school and is arrested for assaulting a minor when merely touching a white boy’s arm. Hao Wu’s 76 Days covers the length of Wuhan, China’s lockdown due to COVID-19, a very timely doc that will be released by MTV Documentary Films via virtual cinema on December 4. It’s one of DOC-NYC’s features on its annual Short List, which includes Boys State, Collective, The Fight, On the Record, and ten others that will vie for juried categories. IFC Films’ Dear Santa, the new film from Dana Nachman, director of the wonderful Pick of the Litter, will follow its Heartland Film Festival debut with a run at COD-NYC before its own December 4 release. The latter is about the USPS’s “Operation Santa” program that receives hundreds of thousands of letters to Santa every year and employees thousands of volunteers to help make the wishes of these kids come true. Basically, there’s a LOT of stuff to see at DOC-NYC, and while most of the movies haven’t been released publicly outside festivals yet, a lot of these movies will be part of the doc conversations of 2020. DOC-NYC gives the chance for people across the United States to see a lot of great docs months before anyone else, so take advantage of some of their ticket packs to save some money over the normal $12 per ticket price. The $199 price for an All Access Film Pass also isn’t a bad deal if you have enough time to watch the hundreds of DOC-NYC offerings. (Sadly, I never do, yet I’m still a little bummed to miss the 10Am press screenings at IFC Center that keeps me off the streets… or in this case, sitting on my ass at home.) Not to be outdone by the presence of DOC-NYC, Film at Lincoln Center is kicking off its OWN seventh annual “Art of the Real” doc series, which has a bit of overlap by running from November 13 to 26. I really don’t know a lot about the documentaries being shown as part of this program, presented with Mubi and The New York Times, but check this out. For just 50 bucks, you can get an all-access pass to all 17 films, which you can casually watch at home over the two weeks of the fest. Okay, let’s get to some theatrical releases, and the one I’ve been anticipating the most (also the one getting the widest release) is Christopher Landon’s FREAKY from Blumhouse and Universal Pictures. It stars Kathryn Newton as Millie Kessler, a high school outcast who is constantly picked on, but one night, she ends up encountering the serial killer known as the “Blissfield Butcher” (Vince Vaughn), but instead of dying when she’s stabbed with a ritual blade. The next morning Millie and the Butcher wake up to discover that they’ve been transported into the body of the other. Oh, it’s Friday the 13th… oh, now I get it… Freaky Friday! Landon is best known for writing many of the Paranormal Activity sequels and directing Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones. Msore importantly, he directed Happy Death Day and its sequel Happy Death Day 2 U, two of my favorite Blumhouse movies, because they so successfully mix horror with comedy, which is so hard to do. That’s what Freaky is all about, too, and it’s even harder this time even though Freaky has way more gruesome and gory kills than anything in Landon’s other films. Heck, many of the kills are gorier than the most recent Halloween from Blumhouse, and it’s a little shocking when you’re laughing so hard at times. Landon does some clever things with what’s essentially a one-joke premise of a killer in a teen girl’s body and vice versa, but like the Lindsay Lohan-Jamie Lee Curtis remake from 2003, it’s all about the talent of the two main actors to pull off the rather intricate nature of playing humor without losing the seriousness of the horror element. It may not be too surprising with Vaughn, who made a ton of dramas and thrillers before turning to comedy. (Does everyone remember that he played Norman Bates in Gus Van Sant’s remake of Psycho and also starred in thrillers The Cell and Domestic Disturbance?) Newton is a bit more of an unknown quantity, but as soon as Tillie dawns the red leather jacket, you know that she can use her newly found homicidal attitude to get some revenge on those who have been terrible to her.  In some ways, the comedy aspects of Freaky win out over the horror but no horror fan will be disappointed by the amount of gory kills and how well the laughs emerge from a decent horror flick. Freaky seems like the kind of movie that Wes Craven would have loved. I’m delighted to say that this week’s “Featured Flick” is Michael Angelo Covino and Kyle Marvin’s indie comedy THE CLIMB (Sony Pictures Classics), a movie that I have seen no less than three times this year, first when it was playing Sundance, a few months later when it was supposed to open in March… and then again last week! And you know what? I enjoyed it just as much every single time. It’s an amazing two-hander that stars Covino and Marvin as best friends Mike and Kyle, who have a falling out over the former sleeping with the latter’s fiancé, and it just gets funnier and funnier as the friends fight and Kyle gets engaged to Marisa (Gayle Rankin from GLOW) who hates Mike. Can this friendship possibly survive? I really had no idea what to expect the first time I saw The Climb at the Sony Screening Room, but it was obviously going to be a very different movie for Sony Pictures Classics, who had started out the year with so many great films before theaters shut down. (Unfortunately, they may have waited too long on this one as theaters seem to be shutting down again even while NYC and L.A. have yet to reopen them. Still, I think this would be just as much fun in a drive-in.) The movie starts with a long, extended scene of the two leads riding bikes on a steep mountain in France, talking to each other as Kyle (once the athlete of the duo) has fallen out of shape. During the conversation, Mike admits to having slept with Kyle’s fiancé Ava (Judith Godréche) and things turn hostile between the two. We then get the first big jump in time as we’re now at the funeral for Ava, who actually had been married to Mike. Kyle eventually moves on and begins a relationship with his high school sweetheart Marisa, who we meet at the Thanksgiving gathering for Kyle’s extended family. In both these cases, we see how the relationship between Mike and Kyle has changed/evolved as Mike has now fallen on hard times. It’s a little hard to explain why what’s essentially a “slice of life” movie can be so funny. On one hand, The Climb might be the type of movie we might see from Mike Leigh, but Covino and Marvin find a way to make everything funny and also quite eccentric in terms of how some of the segments begin and end.  Technically, it’s also an impressive feat with the number of amazing single shot sequences and how smooth some of the transitions work. It’s actually interesting to see when and how the filmmakers decide to return to the lives of their subjects – think of it a bit like Michael Apted’s “Up” series of docs but covering a lot shorter span in time.  Most importantly, The Climb has such a unique tone and feel to other indie dramedies we’ve seen, as the duo seem to be influenced more by European cinema than American indies. Personally, I think a better title for The Climb might have been “Frenemied,” but even with the movie’s fairly innocuous title, you will not forget the experience watching this entertaining film anytime soon. Maybe this should be called “Netflix week,” because the streamer is releasing a number of high-profile movies into theaters and on the streaming service. Definitely one of the more anticipated movies of the year is David Fincher’s MANK, which will get a theatrical release this week and then stream on Netflix starting December 4. It stars Gary Oldman as Herman Mankiewicz, the Hollywood screenwriter who has allowed himself to succumb to alcoholism but has been hired by Orson Welles (Tom Burke) to write his next movie, Citizen Kane, working with a personal secretary Rita Alexander (played by Lily Collins). His story is told through his interactions with media mogul William Hearst (Charles Dance) and relationship with actress and Hearst ingenue and mistress, Marion Davies (Amanda Seyfried). It I were asked to pick one director who is my absolute favorite, Fincher would probably be in my top 5 because he’s had such an illustrious and varied career of movie styles, and Mank continues that tradition as Fincher pays tribute to old Hollywood and specifically the work of Orson Welles in every frame of this biopic that’s actually more about the troubled writer of Citizen Kane who was able to absorb everything happening in his own Hollywood circles and apply them to the script. The film perfectly captures the dynamic of the time and place as Mank is frequently the only honest voice in a sea of brown nosers and yes-men. Maybe I would have enjoyed Oldman’s performance more if everything that comes out of Mankiewicz’s mouth wasn’t an all-too-clever quip. The film really hits a high point after a friend of Mank’s commits suicide and how that adds to the writer’s woes about not being able to save him. The film’s last act involves Mank dealing with the repercussions after the word gets out that Citizen Kane is indeed about Hearst. Overall, Mank is a movie that’s hard to really dig into, and like some of Fincher’s previous work, it tends to be devoid of emotion. Even Fincher’s decision to be clever by including cigarette burns to represent Mank’s “reels” – something explained by Brad Pitt in Fight Club – just drives home the point that Mank is deliberately Fincher’s most meta movie to date. Ron Howard’s adaptation of JD Vance’s bestselling memoir HILLBILLY ELEGY will be released by Netflix into theaters ahead of its streaming debut on November 24. It stars Amy Adams and Glenn Close, but in honesty, it’s about JD Vance, you know, the guy who wrote the memoir.  The film follows his younger years (as played by Owen Asztalos) while dealing with a dysfunctional white trash family in Middletown, Ohio, dealing with his headstrong Mamaw (Close) and abusive mother dealing with drug addiction (Adams).  Later in life, while studying at Yale (and played by Gabriel Basso), he has to return to his Ohio roots to deal with his mother’s growing addiction that forces him to come to terms with his past. I’m a bit of a Ron Howard stan – some might even say “an apologist” – and there’s no denying that Hillbilly Elegy puts him the closest to A Beautiful Mind territory than he’s been in quite some time. That doesn’t mean that this movie is perfect, nor that I would consider it one of his better movies, though. I went into the movie not knowing a thing about JD Vance or his memoir but after the first reviews came out, I was a little shocked how many of them immediately went political, because there’s absolutely nothing resembling politics in the film.  It is essentially an adaptation of a memoir, dealing with JD Vance’s childhood but then also the past that led his mother and grandmother down the paths that made his family so dysfunctional. I particularly enjoyed the relationship between the older Vance and his future wife Usha (as played by Freida Pinto) earlier in their relationship as they’re both going to Yale and Vance is trying to move past his family history to succeed in the realm of law. It might be a no-brainer why Adams and Close are being given so much of the attention for their performances. They are two of the best. Close is particularly amusing as the cantankerous Mamaw, who veers between cussing and crying, but also has some great scenes both with Adams and the younger Vance. The amazing special make-up FX used to change her appearance often makes you forget you’re watching Close. I wish I could say the same for Adams, who gives such an overwrought and over-the-top performance that it’s very hard to feel much emotionally for her character as she goes down a seemingly endless vortex of drug addiction. It’s a performance that leads to some absolute craziness. (It’s also odd seeing Adams in basically the Christian Bale role in The Fighter, although Basso should get more credit about what he brings out in their scenes together.) Hillbilly Elegy does have a number of duller moments, and I’m not quite sure anyone not already a fan of Vance’s book would really have much interest in these characters. I certainly have had issues with movies about people some may consider “Southern White Trash,” but it’s something I’ve worked on myself to overcome. It’s actually quite respectable for a movie to try to show characters outside the normal circles of those who tend to write reviews, and I wouldn’t be surprised if the movie might be able to connect with people in rural areas that rarely get to see themselves on screen. Hillbilly Elegy has its issues, but it feels like a successful adaptation of a novel that may have been difficult to keep an audience invested in with all its flashbacks and jumps in time. Netflix is also streaming the Italian drama THE LIFE AHEAD, directed by Edoardo Ponti, starring Oscar-winning actress Sophia Loren, who happens to also be the filmmaker’s mother. She plays Madame Rosa, a Holocaust survivor in Italy who takes a stubborn young street kid named Momo (Ibrahima Gueye), much to both their chagrin.  I’ll be shocked if Italy doesn’t submit Ponti’s film as their choice for the Oscar’s International Film category, because it has all of the elements that would appeal to Oscar voters. In that sense, I also found it to be quite traditional and formulaic.  Loren is quite amazing, as to be expected, and I was just as impressed with young Ibrahima Gueye who seems to be able to hold his own in what’s apparently his first movie. There’s others in the cast that also add to the experience including a trans hooker named Lola, but it’s really the relationship between the two main characters that keeps you invested in the movie. I only wish I didn’t spend much of the movie feeling like I knew exactly where it’s going in terms of Rosa doing something to save the young boy and giving him a chance at a good life. I hate to be cynical, but at times, this is so by the books, as if Ponti watched every Oscar movie and made one that had all the right elements to appeal to Oscar voters and wokesters alike. That aside, it does such a good job tugging at heartstrings that you might forgive how obviously formulaic it is. Netflix is also premiering the fourth season of The Crown this week, starring Olivia Colman as Queen Elizabeth and bringing on board Gillian Anderson as Margaret Thatcher, Emma Corin, Helena Bonham Carter, Tobis Menzies, Marion Bailey and Charles Dancer. Quite a week for the streamer, indeed. Another movie that may be in the conversation for Awards season is AMMONITE (NEON), the new film from Francis Lee (God’s Own Country), a drama set in 1840s England where Kate Winslet plays Mary Anning, a fossil hunter,  tasked to look after melancholic young bride, Charlotte Murcheson (Saoirse Ronan), sent to the sea to get better only for them to get into a far more intimate relationship. I had been looking forward to this film, having heard almost unanimous raves from out of Toronto a few months back. Maybe my expectations were too high, because while this is a well-made film with two strong actors, it’s also rather dreary and not something I necessarily would watch for pleasure. The comparisons to last year’s Portrait of a Lady on Fire (also released by NEON) are so spot-on that it’s almost impossible to watch this movie without knowing exactly where it’s going from the very minute that the two main characters meet. Winslet isn’t bad in another glammed-down role where she can be particularly cantankerous, but knowing that the film would eventually take a sapphic turn made it somewhat predictable. Ronan seems to be playing her first outright adult role ever, and it’s a little strange to see her all grown-up after playing a teenager in so many movies.  The movie is just so contained to the one setting right up until the last 20 minutes when it actually lives the Lyme setting and lets us see the world outside Mary’s secluded lifestyle.  As much as I wanted to love Ammonite, it just comes off as so obvious and predictable – and certainly not helped by coming out so soon after Portrait of a Lady. There’s also something about Ammonite that just feels so drab and dreary and not something I’d necessarily need to sit through a second time. The animated film WOLFWALKERS (GKIds) is the latest from Tomm Moore and Ross Stewart, directors of the Oscar-nominated Secret of the Kells (Moore’s Song of the Sea also received an Oscar nomination a few years later.) It’s about a young Irish girl named Robyn (voiced Honor Kneafsey) who is learning to be hunter from her father (voiced by Sean Bean) to help him wipe out the last wolf pack. Roby then meets another girl (voiced by Eva Whittaker) who is part of a tribe rumored to transform into wolves by night.  I have to be honest that by the time I got around to start watching this, I was really burnt out and not in any mood to watch what I considered to look like a kiddie movie. It looks nice, but I’m sure I’d be able to enjoy it more in a different head (like watching first thing on a Saturday morning). Regardless, Wolfwalkers will be in theaters nationwide this Friday and over the weekend via Fathom Events as well as get full theatrical runs at drive-ins sponsored by the Landmark, Angelika and L.A.’s Vineland before it debuts on Apple TV+ on December 11. Maybe I’ll write a proper review for that column. You can get tickets for the Fathom Events at  WolfwalkersMovie.com. Next up is Miles Joris-Peyrafitte’s DREAMLAND (Paramount), starring Margot Robbie as Allison Wells, a bank-robbing criminal on the loose who encounters young man named Eugene Evans (Finn Cole) in rural Dust Bowl era North Dakota and convinces him to hide her and help her escape the authorities by taking her to Mexico. Another movie where I wasn’t expecting much, more due to the generic title and genre than anything else, but it’s a pretty basic story of a young man in a small town who dreams of leaving and also glamorizes the crime stories he read in pulps. Because of the Great Depression in the late ’20, the crime wave was spreading out across the land and affecting everyone, even in more remote locations like the one at the center of Dreamland. The sad truth is that there have been so many better movies about this era, including Warren Beatty’s Bonnie and Clyde, Lawless and many others. Because of that, this might not be bad but it’s definitely trying to follow movies that leave quite a long shadow. The innocent relationship between Eugene and Allison does add another level to the typical gangster story, but maybe that isn’t enough for Dreamland to really get past the fact that the romantic part of their relationship isn’t particularly believable. As much as this might have been fine as a two-hander, you two have Travis Fimmel as Eugene’s stepfather and another generic white guy in Garrett Hedlund playing Allison’s Clyde Barrow-like partner in crime in the flashbacks. Cole has enough trouble keeping on pace with Robbie but then you have Fimmel, who was just grossly miscast. The film’s score ended up being so overpowering and annoying I wasn’t even remotely surprised when I saw that Joris-Peyrafitte is credited with co-writing the film’s score.  Dreamland is fine, though it really needed to have a stronger and more original vision to stand out. It’s another classic case of an actor being far better than the material she’s been given. This is being given a very limited theatrical release before being on digital next Tuesday. This might have been Netflix week, but maybe it could have been “Saban Films Week,” since the distributor also has three new movies. Actually, only two, because I screwed up, and I missed the fact that André Øvredal’s MORTAL was released by Saban Films LAST week. Not entirely my fault because for some reason, I had it opening this week, and I only realized that I was wrong last Wednesday. Oh, well.  It stars Nate Wolff as Eric Bergeland, an American in Norway who seems to have some enigmatic powers, but after killing a young lad, he ends up on the lam with federal agent Christine (Iben Akerlie from Victoria). This is another movie I really wanted to like since I’ve been such a fan of Øvredal from back to his movie Trollhunter. Certainly the idea of him taking a dark look at superpowers through the lends of Norse mythology should be right up my alley. Even so, this darker and more serious take on superpowers – while it might be something relatively unique and new in movies – it’s something anyone who has read comics has seen many times before and often quite better. Wolff’s character is deliberately kept a mystery about where he comes from, and all we know is that he survived a fire at his farm, and we watched him kill a young man that’s part of a group of young bullies.  From there, it kind of turns into a procedural as the authorities and Akerlie’s character tries to find out where Eric came from and got his powers. It’s not necessarily a slow or talkie movie, because there are some impressive set pieces for sure, but it definitely feels more like Autopsy of Jane Doe than Trollhunters. Maybe my biggest is that this is a relatively drab and lifeless performance by Wolff, who I’ve seen be better in other films. Despite my issues, it doesn’t lessen my feelings about Øvredal as a filmmaker, because there’s good music and use of visual FX – no surprise if you’ve seen Trollhunters – but there’s still a really bad underlying feeling that you’re watching a lower budget version of an “X-Men” movie, and not necessarily one of the better ones.  Despite a decent (and kinda crazy) ending, Mortal never really pays off, and it’s such a slog to get to that ending that people might feel slightly underwhelmed. Seth Savoy’s ECHO BOOMERS (Saban Films) is a crime thriller based on a “true story if you believe in such things,” starring Patrick Schwarzenegger as Lance, a young art major, who falls in with a group of youths who break into rich people’s homes and trash them, also stealing some of the more valuable items for their leader Mel (Michael Shannon). There’s a lot about Echo Boomers that’s going to feel familiar if you’ve seen Sofia Coppola’s The Bling Ring or the heist movie American Animals from a few years back, but even with those similarities, Seth Savoy has a strong cast and vision to make more out of the fairly weak writing than another director might manage. Schwarzenegger, who seems to be pulling in quite a wide range of roles for basically being another generic white actor is only part of a decent ensemble that includes Alex Pettyfer as the group’s ersatz alpha male Ellis and Hayley Law (also great in the recent Spontaneous) as his girlfriend Allie, the only girl taking part in the heists and destruction. Those three actors alone are great, but then you add Shannon just doing typically fantastic work as more of a catalyst than an antagonist. You can probably expect there will be some dissension in the ranks, especially when the group’s “Fagan” Mel puts Lance in charge of keeping them in line and Allie forms a friendship with Lance. What holds the movie back is the decision to use a very traditional testimonial storytelling style where Lance and Allie narrate the story by relaying what happened to the authorities after their capture obviously. This doesn’t help take away from the general predictability of where the story goes either, because we’ve seen this type of thing going all the way back to The Usual Suspects. While Echo Boomers might be fairly derivative of far better movies at times, it also has a strong directorial vision and a compelling story that makes up enough for that fact. In theaters this Friday and then On Demand and Digital on November 24 is Eshom and Ian Nelms’ action-comedy FATMAN (Saban Films/Paramount), starring Mel Gibson as Santa Claus and Walton Goggins as the hired assassin sent to kill him by a spoiled rich boy named  Billy (Chance Hurstfield) who unhappy with the presents he’s being brought for Christmas. While we seem to be surrounded by high concept movies of all shapes and sizes, you can’t get much more high concept than having Mel Gibson playing a tough and cantankerous* Kris Kringle (*Is this the week’s actual theme?) who is struggling to survive with Mrs. Klaus (played by the wonderful Marianne Jean-Baptiste from  In Fabric) when they’re given the opportunity to produce military grade items for the army using his speedy elf workshop. Unbeknownst to the Kringles, the disgruntled hitman who also feels he’s been let down by Santa is on his way to the North Pole to fulfill his assignment. You’ll probably know whether you’ll like this movie or not since its snarkier comedic tone is introduced almost from the very beginning. This is actually a pretty decent role for Gibson that really plays up to his strengths, and it’s a shame that there wasn’t more to it than just a fairly obvious action movie that leads to a shoot-out. I probably should have enjoyed Goggins more in a full-on villainous role but having been watching a lot of him on CBS’ The Unicorn, it’s kind of hard to adjust to him playing this kind of role.  I did absolutely love Marianne Jean-Baptiste and the warmth she brought to a relatively snarky movie. I’m not sure if Fatman is the best showing of Eshom and Ian Nelms’ abilities as filmmakers, because they certainly have some, but any chance of being entertaining is tamped down by a feeling the filmmakers are constantly trying to play it safe. Because of this, Fatman has a few fun moments but a generally weak premise that never fully delivers. It would have thrived by being much crazier, but instead, it’s just far too mild. Malin Åkerman stars in Paul Leyden’s CHICK FIGHT (Quiver Distribution) as Anna, a woman unhappy with her life and inability to survive on the little money she makes at her failing coffee shop. When Anna’s lesbian traffic cop friend Charleen (Dulcé Sloan) takes her to an underground fight club, Anna her trepidation about joining in, because she has never been in a fight in her life.  Learning that her mother has a legacy at the club, Anna agrees to be trained by Alec Baldwin’s always-drunk Murphy in order to take on the challenges of the likes of Bella Thorne’s Olivia.  Another movie where I’m not sure where to begin other than the fact that I’m not sure I’ve seen a movie trying so hard to be fun and funny and failing miserably at both. Listen, I generally love Akerman, and I’m always hoping for her to get stronger material to match her talents, but this tries its best to be edgy without ever really delivering on the most important thing for any comedy: Laughs.  Sure, the filmmakers try their best and even shoehorn a bit of romance for Anna in the form of the ring doctor played by Kevin Connolly from Entourage, but it does little to help distinguish the movie’s identity. Listen, I’m not going to apologize for being a heterosexual male that finds Bella Thorne to be quite hot when she’s kicking ass in the ring. (I’m presuming that a lot of what we see in her scenes in the ring involves talented stuntwomen, but whoa! If that’s not the case.) Alec Baldwin seems to be in this movie merely as a favor to someone, possibly one of the producers, and when he disappears with no mention midway through the movie, you’re not particularly surprised. Another of trying too hard is having Anna’s father Ed (played by wrestler Kevin Nash) come out as gay and then use his every appearance to talk about his sex acts.  Others in the cast like Fortune Feimster seem to be there mainly for their bulk and believability as fighters. Ultimately, Chick Fight is a fairly lame and bland girl power movie written, directed and mostly produced by men. I’m not sure why anyone might be expecting more from it than being a poorly-executed comedy lacking laughs. And yet, that wasn’t the worst movie of the weekend. That would be Andrzej Bartkowiak’s DEAD RECKONING (Shout! Studios). Yes, the Polish cinematographer and filmmaker who once made the amazing Romeo is Bleeding, starring Gary Oldman and Lena Olin, has returned with a movie with the onus of a premise that reads “a thriller inspired by the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013.” No, I did not make that up. It mostly takes place in Nantucket, Massachusetts, which I guess is sort of close to Boston, but instead it focuses on the relationship between teens Niko (K.J. Apa) and Tillie (India Eisley), the latter whose parents died in a plane crash that might have been caused by a terrorist. It just so happens that Niko’s brother Marco (Scott Adkins) is an Albanian terrorist. Coincidence? I think not! Once you get past the most generic title ever, Dead Reckoning is just plain awful. I probably should have known what to expect when the movie opens with Eric “Never Turned Down a Job” Roberts, but also, I strong feel that Scott Adkins, better known for his martial arts skills, is easily one of the worst actors ever to be given lines to say in a movie. And yet, somehow, there are even worse actors in this movie. How is that even possible? Although this presumed action movie opens with one of three or four fight sequences, we’re soon hanging out on the beach with a bunch of annoying teenagers, including Tillie, who is drowning the sorrow of recently losing her parents by literally drinking constantly in almost every single scene. When she meets the handsome Eastern European Niko, we think there’s some chance of Tillie being saved, but it isn’t meant to be.  Part of what’s so weird is that Dead Reckoning begins in territory familiar to fans of Barkowiak’s movies like Exit Wounds, Cradle 2 the Grave and Maximum Impact but then quickly shifts gears to a soppy teen romance. It’s weird enough to throw you off when at a certain point, it returns to the main plot, which involves Adkins’ terrorist plot and the search by FBI Agent Cantrell (played by James Remar) to find the culprit who killed Tillie’s parents. Oh, the FBI agent is also Tillie’s godfather. Of course, he is. Beyond the fact that I spent much of the movie wondering what these teens in Nantucket have to do with the opening scene or the overall premise, this is a movie that anything that could be resembling talent or skill in Barkowiak’s filmmaking is long gone. Going past the horrendous writing – at one point, the exasperated and quite xenophobic Cantrell exclaims, “It’s been a nightmare since 9/11… who knows what’s next?” – or the inability of much of the cast to make it seem like anyone involved cares about making a good movie, the film is strangled by a score that wants to remind you it’s a thriller even as you watch people having fun on the beach on a sunny day. Eventually, it does get back to the action with a fight between Cantrell and Marco… and then Marco gets into a fight with Tillie’s nice aunt nurse Jennifer where she has a surprisingly amount of fighting skills. There’s also Nico’s best friend who is either British or gay or both, but he spends every one of his scenes acting so pretentious and annoying, you kind of hope he’ll be blown up by terrorists. Sadly, you have to wait until the last act before the surfboards are pulled out.  (Incidentally, filmmakers, please don’t call a character in your movie “Marco,” especially if that character’s name is going to be yelled out repeatedly, because it will just lead to someone in the audience to yell out “Polo!” This is Uwe Boll School of Bad Filmmaking 101!) The point is that the movie is just all over the place yet in a place that’s even remotely watchable. There even was a point when Tillie was watching the video of her parents dying in a car crash for the third or fourth time, and I just started laughing, since it’s such a slipshod scene. It’s very likely that Dead Reckoning will claim the honor of being the worst movie I’ve seen this year. Really, the only way to have any fun watching this disaster is to play a drinking game where you take a drink every time Eisley’s character takes a drink. Or better yet, just bail on the movie and hit the bottle, because I’m sure whoever funded this piece of crap is. Opening at New York’s Film Forum on Wednesday is Manfred Kirchheimer’s FREE TIME (Grasshopper/Cinema Conservancy), another wonderful doc from one of the kings of old school cinema verité documentary filmmaking, consisting of footage of New York City from 1960 that’s pieced together with a wonderful jazz score. Let me tell you that Kirschheimer’s work is very relaxing to watch and Free Time is no exception. Plus the hour-long movie will premiere in Film Forum’s Virtual Cinema, accompanied by Rudy Burckhardt’s 1953 film Under the Brooklyn Bridge which captures Brooklyn in the ‘50s. Also opening in Film Forum’s Virtual Cinema Friday is Hong Khaou’s MONSOON (Strand Releasing) starring Henry Golding (Crazy Rich Asians) as Kit, who returns to Ho Chi Minh City for the first time since his family fled after the Vietnam War when he was six. As he tries to make sense of it, he ends in a romance with Parker Sawyers’ American ex-pat and forms a friendship with a local student (Molly Harris). Unfortunately, I didn’t have the chance to watch this one before finishing up this column but hope to catch soon, because I do like Golding as an actor. I shared my thoughts on Werner Herzog and Clive Oppenheimer’s FIREBALL: VISITORS FROM DARK WORLDS, when it played at TIFF in September, but this weekend, it will debut on Apple TV+.  It’s another interesting and educational science doc from Herr Herzog, this time teaming with the younger Cambridge geoscientist and “volcanologist” to look at the evidence left behind by meteors that have arrived within the earth’s atmosphere, including the races that worship the falling space objects. Opening at the Metrograph this week (or rather on its website) is Shalini Kantayya’s documentary CODED BIAS, about the widespread  bias in facial recognition and the algorithms that affect us all, which debuted Weds night and will be available on a PPV basis and will be available through November 17. The French New Wave anthology Six In Paris will also be available as a ticketed movie ($8 for members/$12 for non-members) through April 13. Starting Thursday as part of the Metrograph’s “Live Screenings” is Steven Fischler and Joel Sucher’s Free Voice of Labor: The Jewish Anarchists from 1980. Fischler’s earlier doc Frame Up! The imprisonment of Martin Sostre from 1974 will also be available through Thursday night. By the way, if you read this week’s column and have bothered to read this far down, I think you’re very special and quite good-looking. Feel free to drop me some thoughts at Edward dot Douglas at Gmail dot Com or drop me a note or tweet on Twitter. I love hearing from readers … honest! ",POSITIVE
"Jun 3, 2021"," For almost the whole history of cinema, filmmakers have been telling stories about outlaw couples – one recent example being this year’s overlooked Queen and Slim, which reimagined the trope for the era of Black Lives Matter. Dreamland is less obviously topical. Indeed, reports indicate it was shot back in 2017 – when its director, Miles Joris-Peyrafitte, was still in his mid-twenties – and has been sitting on the shelf ever since. On balance it’s isn’t hard to see why, though Margot Robbie as an alluring Depression-era bank robber isn’t the worst starting point for a piece of entertainment. Robbie’s character Allison Wells is already a fugitive from justice at the start of the story, which is told from the viewpoint of Eugene Evans (Finn Cole), a mopey Texan farmboy at odds with his lawman stepdad (Travis Fimmel) and addicted to pulp magazines. When he stumbles upon the glamorously bloodstained Allison hiding out in the family barn, she might have well have fallen from the sky – and after joining her for a swim in the moonlight and listening to her rhapsodise about her idol Billy the Kid, he’s all in on the rebel dream. The title hints that Eugene is destined to learn a harsh lesson about the difference between fantasy and the real world. But whatever screenwriter Nicolaas Zwart originally had in mind, Joris-Peyrafitte’s flashy style has less to do with reality than with earlier movies, especially landmarks in the lovers-on-the-run genre. A robbery sequence filmed in a single take pays tribute to the hardboiled classic Gun Crazy, while the voiceover narration by Lola Kirke, as an adult version of Eugene’s younger sister Phoebe, has the flat wistfulness of Sissy Spacek in Badlands. More surprisingly, the squared-off framing and lateral tracking shots suggest a study of modern film school favourites like Wes Anderson and Bong Joon-ho. While all this might be taken to signal a facetious distance from the material, irony and cynicism are curiously absent. Allison has innocent blood on her hands, yet the film treats her more sympathetically than not, while vacillating on the question of whether she’s fundamentally broken or a force of nature living her best life. Robbie’s game (if never wholly successful) efforts to resolve the contradictions in this character are the main attraction of Dreamland – which she also co-produced, and which like several of her recent vehicles can be taken as a parable about her own stardom. Eugene is essentially Allison’s adoring fan, rather than an equal partner in crime. But even if we never quite credit her feelings for him, it’s entirely believable he’s smitten with her – and whether or not she’s to blame for manipulating the kid, we can hardly blame him for falling under her spell.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 3, 2021"," The first we see of Margot Robbie in Dreamland, Miles Joris-Peyrafitte’s Dust Bowl elegy, are those crystal-blue eyes. She arrives into the story, as one character describes, like “a bat outta hell”. Her character, Allison Wells, is a bank robber on the run, with a bounty of $10,000 on her head and tales of bloodshed snapping at her heels. Allison is a loose, fictional amalgamation of the most notorious female outlaws of the Depression era: Bonnie Parker, Vivian Chase, Eleanor Jarman, Edna Murray. She’s also a shimmering mirage, the promise of a life lived daringly – one that’s unexpectedly delivered into the hands of a young farmboy (Finn Cole’s Eugene). Allison, with a bullet in her leg, has escaped the police and hobbled her way into Eugene’s barn. He finds her there, bloodied but still glamorous. She offers him $20,000 if he’ll help her flee to Mexico. It’s fascinating to watch an actor like Robbie, who so consciously uses beauty as a tool to define the way her characters drift through the world – whether it’s Tonya Harding or The Wolf of Wall Street’s Naomi Lapaglia. Allison knows how easily she can bring this boy under her spell; she also sees the deadly end that temptation might lead to. Joris-Peyrafitte’s Dreamland is itself suspended somewhere in-between allurement and betrayal. It recognises that the myths America tells itself are just a string of romanticised falsehoods, but still finds itself falling head over heels for them. Eugene isn’t a fool – and Cole certainly never plays him that way. There’s a stillness and a sense of determination in his looks. Home has nothing to offer him. Here, the dust storms rise up like mountains, choking the life out of everything they pass. Eugene had to watch his father slowly wither away, before he packed up and left for Mexico. His mother (Kerry Condon) married another man, a sheriff’s deputy (Travis Fimmel), who made the house his personal kingdom. Eugene only has a single postcard to remember his father by – and a lingering promise that they will meet again. To pass the days, he loses himself in daydreams and in the pages of comic books, with all their tales of cops and gangsters. Allison’s arrival brings those reveries thrillingly close to reality. Dreamland, Joris-Peyrafitte’s second feature, is the work of a director confident in his vision, and able to blend influences in a way that feels experimental, rather than like a straight homage. The film’s narration, delivered by Eugene’s younger half-sister (Lola Kirke) decades after the events, seems borrowed from Terrence Malick’s Days of Heaven. The vivid colours tie the film to the American Regionalism art movement, where the yellow of the cornfields looked as radiant as the sun. The camera angles are harsh and expressive – a striking seduction scene sees Allison pushed almost entirely out of frame, so that we only see her delicate hands beckoning Eugene closer. There’s an obviousness to where Dreamland is headed, and Nicolaas Zwart’s script never forces Eugene to reckon with the flimsiness of his self-constructed fantasies. He simply accepts them, whatever the consequences may bring – just as the film’s own gorgeousness may make it easier to look past its flaws. ",NEUTRAL
"Mar 9, 2021"," Something delightful is happening in cinemas across the country. After months spent empty, with projectors silent, theatres bare and the smell of popcorn fading, Australian picture palaces are back in business — spanning both big chains and smaller independent sites in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. During COVID-19 lockdowns, no one was short on things to watch, of course. In fact, you probably feel like you've streamed every movie ever made, including new releases, comedies, music documentaries, Studio Ghibli's animated fare and Nicolas Cage-starring flicks. But, even if you've spent all your time of late glued to your small screen, we're betting you just can't wait to sit in a darkened room and soak up the splendour of the bigger version. Thankfully, plenty of new films are hitting cinemas so that you can do just that — and we've rounded up, watched and reviewed everything on offer this week. Playing a former couple who reconnect and reignite their spark, Melissa McCarthy and Bobby Cannavale have great chemistry together in Superintelligence. This isn't the first time they've featured in the same movie, thanks to 2015's Spy, but there's an energy to their work opposite each other here. She's Carol Peters, an ex-Yahoo executive who quit her job eight years ago with a dream of moving into philanthropy. He's George Churchill, a creative writing professor. Carol still thinks about George two years after their breakup and, when they re-meet-cute in a supermarket, he's happy to see her — although he is flying out to Ireland in three days to take up his dream academic job. There is enough to the concept just described to furnish a likeable albeit predictable rom-com that coasts by on McCarthy and Cannavale's charm and charismatic pairing. A film that simply followed the above story would be straightforward, but Superintelligence shows that it'd likely work. Alas, Superintelligence makes Carol and George's romantic antics the subplot in a movie that's actually about a sentient artificial intelligence that's trying to decide what to do about humanity, chooses Carol as an example of the most average person on earth, and pushes her to get back with George so it can observe, judge her actions and extrapolate what it might mean about people in general. Unsurprisingly, the tech side of the story crashes hard. As everything from Her and Ex Machina to the Terminator and Matrix franchises have shown, films about AI aren't new — and nor are movies about technology threatening to eradicate or enslave humanity — so a wealth of far better features have already traversed this territory. And while screenwriter Steve Mallory (The Boss) has come up with a twist on the idea that he seems to think is brilliant, it really isn't. How can it be when his killer concept just involves said artificial intelligence being voiced by James Corden, and that fact being recognised in the story because Carol is a big fan? If you're not as fond of Corden as she is (likely because you've seen Cats and The Prom), you won't be laughing. It wouldn't be funny even if you did like his work. It's a one-note gag, and a grating one at that. It also chews up far too much of Superintelligence's running time, when viewers would always rather be seeing McCarthy and Cannavale together without any silly gimmickry. The former's husband Ben Falcone directed the film, as he did with Tammy, The Boss and Life of the Party, but that can't explain why the movie squanders the best thing it has. McCarthy's career constantly swings from highs to lows (Can You Ever Forgive Me? and The Happytime Murders came out in the same year, for instance), but Superintelligence is both misguided and a missed opportunity. Back in 2013's The Wolf of Wall Street, Margot Robbie didn't simply hold her own against Leonardo DiCaprio. The Australian actor stole scenes from her then far-more-famous co-star — which, given that he put in a phenomenal performance, is no small task. Accordingly, the fact that she quickly rocketed from supporting player to the kind of lead that an entire film can hang from is hardly surprising. Her path from Suicide Squad to Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn) illustrates it perfectly, in fact. Still, even Robbie's ability to lift a movie has its limits, which Dreamland tests. She's both luminous and textured in the Great Depression-set thriller. Playing a bank robber on the run, she's the most absorbing and intriguing part of the film. She's meant to be, because that's how and why her character of Allison Wells draws in Texan farm boy Eugene Evans (Finn Cole, TV's Animal Kingdom) and gets him to help her. And, Robbie is clearly invested in the movie both on- and off-screen, as she not only stars but also produces. That said, very little about Dreamland other than her performance proves anything more than standard, and noticeably so. Director Miles Joris-Peyrafitte (As You Are) aims to follow in the footsteps of Badlands and Ain't Them Bodies Saints — and brings Bonnie and Clyde to mind, too — but flails in comparison to both. Dreamland does boast a gorgeously hazy, woozy aesthetic — through the hues that cinematographer Lyle Vincent (A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night) splashes across the screen, primarily — that gives it an enticing look and feel. In quick square-framed shots inserted to represent flashes of dreams of a life that could possibly come if everything goes Allison and Eugene's way, the film couldn't be more alluring. But, alongside Robbie's performance, that isn't enough to boost the routine storyline. Indeed, at times the movie's visual style even augments and bolsters Dreamland's been-there, done -hat air. The narrative doesn't need much help, though, with screenwriter Nicolaas Zwart (Riverdale) hitting as many recognisable beats as the cops pursuing Allison fire off shots. She's wanted in general, but also because her last stick-up with her now-dead partner saw a little girl get killed. Eugene's stern stepfather George (Travis Fimmel, Lean on Pete) is one of the deputies on her trail, so the teen's decision to let her hole up in his family's barn is instantly risky. The young man is also desperate to flee himself, to find the dad that abandoned him and his mother (Kerry Condon, Better Call Saul) years earlier on their dustbowl property, so he doesn't need much convincing to assist Allison in this all-too-familiar affair. Frontman for The Pogues since the early 80s, and a formidable music force in-between the Celtic punk band's stints together — until the 90s, and then from the early 00s to the mid 10s — Shane MacGowan is a rare beast in his chosen industry. He's a true individual that no one could ever emulate no matter how they tried. He's also a spikier, pricklier, far more recalcitrant figure than others who've earned that description (David Bowie and Prince, for example). He certainly has more stories to tell about smoking cigarettes and drinking booze as a child, then listening to his aunt teach him the gospels and sharing her religious fervour to such an extent that he even thought about turning his childhood beliefs into his life's work. Accordingly, to delve into MacGowan's existence beyond the easy-to-Google biographical details, the usual musician-worshipping documentary was never going to do him justice. So, seasoned director Julien Temple doesn't try to fit the usual mould. The filmmaker has ample experience in the genre, with Sex Pistols rockumentary The Filth and the Fury on his resume — plus Joe Strummer: The Future Is Unwritten and Glastonbury, too — and he's just adept at finding the right approach for the right subject. In Crock of Gold: A Few Rounds with Shane MacGowan, viewers hear the song that he's best known for more than once. The Pogues' 'Fairytale of New York' is an instrumental part of his story, after all. Although it was released in 1987, it's also the most popular Christmas song of the 21st century. Alongside the film's birth-to-now linear path, the use of well-known tune is the most standard part about this deep dive into MacGowan upbringing, fame and controversy. Case in point: MacGowan isn't an interviewee here in the traditional sense. Archival footage of him answering questions fits the expected mould, but in his more recent chats specifically for the doco, he talks with people he knows such as Johnny Depp, Primal Scream's Bobby Gillespie and former Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams. It's a canny and compelling approach, likely by necessity, and just how MacGowan changes depending on his company doesn't escape attention. In the process, and amidst animated sequences, family photos and videos, and deftly deployed stock imagery, Temple lets his audience see first-hand how a man with such a strong presence and infamous reputation is still a rolling, rambling bag of contradictions and complications — although MacGowan's words, offered over more than a few drinks as the lively film's title makes plain, easily paint that picture themselves.

"Dec 30, 2020"," Nomadland - Cinemas now *****Chinese-born filmmaker Chloé Zhao is big and is only going to get bigger. While critics and some of the biggest film festivals in the world almost instantly recognised the extraordinary qualities of her earlier films Songs My Brothers Taught Me (2015) and The Rider (2017) - both winning a slew of impressive awards in the U.S. and Europe especially - it is her most recent film, Nomadland, that no doubt will fulfil the wide assumption that Zhao is about to enter Oscars territory. This in itself is no mean feat, but with her eyebrow-raising foray into the Marvel Cinematic Universe set for release in late 2021 in Eternals (her highly anticipated adaptation of Jack Kirby's comics of the same name), Zhao is no doubt about to cross the threshold from the arthouse to the mainstream in a very big way.While one of the most striking features of Zhao's work is her breathtaking ability to work with amateur and untrained actors in her films, in Nomadland the seamless way she brings that segment of her cast together with her Oscar-winning star Frances McDormand will no doubt be a major drawcard for audience and Academy voters alike. In this deeply moving, low-key drama, McDormand plays Fern, a woman who has faced the double trauma of losing her husband and the brutal economic fallout of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. Now in her sixties, she hits the road in her RV which doubles both as a mode of transportation and her new home. As the title implies, she joins a growing community of ""nomads"" - others just like her who wander the United States, traveling where they can find work, and building a community of sorts amongst their peers as they come and go into each other's lives as they embark on their different, never ending journeys.Nomadland is a quiet film full of dignity, power and respect that in the hands of a lesser combination of director and lead actor could far too readily collapse into a patronising, tiresome social issues film. But Zhao and McDormand refuse here to do anything of the sort, and with their collaborators paint a captivating, immersive and deeply emotionally intelligent character portrait that hinges around a life so unfamiliar to so many of us Fern drives endlessly down those roads less taken.  Dreamland - Cinemas now *** ½There are, it could be said, two kinds of people: those who worship at the altar of Margot Robbie, and those who are wrong. Although her selection of roles may sometimes fall into the hit-and-miss category, Robbie's presence alone can make an ordinary film something extraordinary, which is precisely the case with Miles Joris-Peyrafitte's Dreamland. While joined by a perfectly serviceable support cast including Finn Cole, Travis Fimmel, Garrett Hedlund, Kerry Condon and Darby Camp, Dreamland belongs to Robbie and Robbie alone. She plays Allison Wells, a notorious, violent killer on the run from the law during the Depression when she rolls into the small town where Eugene Evans (Finn Cole) lives with his mother and younger sister, shaking his world upside down and changing his life forever. Narrated by his now all-grown-up-sister Phoebe (voiced by Lola Kirke), we largely see the story of Eugene's desperate mission to protect the morally ambiguous gangster-femme fatale Allison through the memories of his sibling when she was much younger, linking it with a less-than-subtle drumbeat to the obsessiveness of the father who abandoned Eugene and his mother when Eugene was a small boy. More than one critic has flagged Dreamland as a somewhat anaemic Bonnie and Clyde, but this feels unfair; this is not intended to be a fast-paced gangster film, and rather director Joris-Peyrafitte and screenwriter Nicolaas Zwart seem concerned with something far more ethereal, even poetic, which accounts for the lack of old-fashioned genre thrills the premise might on its surface offer. Without Robbie, Dreamland would be relatively forgettable, but with her - as with so much of her work - this otherwise milquetoast film becomes something if not memorable exactly, then certainly very enjoyable.  Ottolenghi and the Cakes of Versailles - Cinemas now ****Documentary filmmaker Laura Gabbert has struck (delicious) gold with her latest film, Ottolenghi and the Cakes of Versailles. For foodies and fans of reality TV cooking programmes, this is a no-brainer as the documentary follows some of the finest dessert chefs in the world as they combine their talents to put on an edible live art show at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art as part of their 2018 ""Visitors to Versailles"" exhibition, under the guidance of celebrated chef Yotam Ottolenghi.But for those of us who do not consider ourselves as a part of this particular demographic, with Ottolenghi and the Cakes of Versailles Gabbert has more than enough up her sleeve beyond the deadline-focused cooking countdown scenario so familiar to fans of that kind of television. Using the expanded time limit a feature-length film allows her, through the central figure of the charismatic and visionary Ottolenghi himself, Gabbert opens up an entire new way of thinking about these tasty little morsels that consciously - and at times very explicitly - frames the creations of desserts and pastries as a true art form.Spanning discussions about other forms of artistic production and creativity spanning from architecture to ballet, at the heart of the film lies the Met's framing of the broader social, cultural and historical significance of Versailles not just in European history, but its legacy around the world in terms of the kinds of excesses and opulence that have become synonymous with a certain kind of unrestrained wealth and power. While staunchly reminding us that Marie Antoinette's famous ""let them eat cake!"" declaration is broadly understood to be apocryphal - there is no evidence that she said this at all - Ottolenghi and the Cakes of Versailles shrewdly balances a careful juggling act between allowing us to celebrate the breathtaking edible artworks that the film documents, while simultaneously demanding we question the broader social, cultural and economic symbolism of such work, tied as they are to this infamous historical moment.

"Dec 21, 2020"," This confused and frustrating film, directed by and starring George Clooney, is a clunky mixture of two stories and several characters, none of which you truly get to know or understand. On Earth in 2049, heavily bearded astronomer Augustine Lofthouse (Clooney) is living alone in an abandoned observatory stat­ion in the Arctic after a mysterious global catastrophe. On the ship are the annoyingly squeaky-clean crew of Commander Tom (David Oyelowo), Sully (Felicity Jones), Maya (Tiffany Boone), Sanchez (Demian Bichir) and Mitchell (Kyle Chandler). Each of them has a back story that is touched on, but none of them is explored enough for the viewer to feel any warmth towards them. The selfless spaceship idiots have no idea what is going on in the world, and it is Lofthouse’s job to warn them not to return to Earth as it is now uninhabitable.  Luckily Lofthouse’s drink addiction magically disappears (not exactly how alcoholism works) but he does spiral into freezing cold madness, replicating Jack Nicholson in the maze in The Shining. WITH Margot Robbie as fugitive bank robber Allison and Peaky Blinders’ Finn Cole as young bounty hunter Eugene who falls under her seductive spell, this Great Depression drama certainly sounds dreamy. Among 1930s Texan farming communities ravaged by dust storms and drought, Eugene is a restless teen obsessed with pulp detective magazines and his absent father who left for Mexico. When he discovers beautiful “Wanted” poster bandit Allison hiding out in the family barn, the die is cast for the dullest Bonnie and Clyde tribute act of recent times to hit the road. It’s not clear if this wants to be a coming-of-age movie, a love story or a traditional outlaw tale with a twist. Less Dreamland, more snoozefest. Having had a growth removed from his vocal cords, his rehabilitation was so lengthy that Jones had to move back in with his parents in Wales, relying on a notepad to communicate.  There are clips of him as a precocious rock ’n’ roll wannabe, juxtaposed with the 46-year-old stoic of today, who has clearly been bruised by some of the blows life has dealt him.",NEUTRAL

"Dec 19, 2020"," Bonnie and Clyde were two of the most infamous criminals of the great depression era, and it’s almost shocking how little the two have actually been covered in film in the 8 decades since their blaze-of-glory-like demise; the most famous covering being 1967’s Bonnie and Clyde with Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway, whilst 1958’s The Bonnie Parker Story and the 2019 Netflix film The Highwaymen covered certain angles of the pair in a more indirect manner. Dreamland poses the notion of what would happen to Bonnie if she didn’t have her Clyde.  If she was just a wounded fugitive hiding from the law.  In Miles Jorris-Peyrafitte’s romantic drama, the Bonnie archetype is embodied in Margot Robbie’s Allison Wells, a bank robber in the 1930’s who is wanted in several states for a series of crimes, one of which unfortunately resulted in the slaying of a young child.  It’s this incident that separated her from her Clyde, Garrett Hedlund’s Perry. Fleeing on foot to a nearby farmhouse in the Dustbowl of America, Allison hopes a stray barn will keep her safe, only to be discovered by young Eugene Evans (Finn Cole), a fairly innocent (minus some petty shoplifting) teen who faces a moral dilemma upon finding her.  Knowing she’s worth a $10,000 bounty, Eugene’s first instinct is to turn her in, but such is the allure of Allison that she promises him double if he can get her safely to Mexico. Wanting his own escape from under the thumb of his stern stepfather, George (Travis Fimmel, the model-turned-actor’s piercing blue eyes only adding to his character’s intensity), Eugene agrees to Allison’s request, only if he can accompany her.  She’s understandably hesitant, and intent on making it known whatever romantic inclinations he has towards her are not reciprocated, but his support proves valuable. Having proven over her career thus far that she’s effortless at skewering our perceptions of an archetypal villain and transforming her characters into foundations of humanity and depth, Robbie’s take on Allison Wells is another prime example of the actress’ seductive quality.  As much as Allison has sinned, we understand just why Eugene would bend to her will, even when she makes it clear that any ideas of them running off into the sunset together won’t come to fruition. As much as Robbie elevates the film whenever she’s involved, it’s a shame that she so often feels sidelined.  Allison and Perry look to have quite a fascinating background, and the brief glimpses we see of them together suggest a Bonnie and Clyde-type venture about these two is what should have been focused on in Nicolaas Zwart’s uneven script.  Cole makes for a fine lead as the conflicted Eugene, and the blossoming relationship between himself and Allison is perfect film fodder, but Dreamland never quite lands its narrative strands with their relationship, the conflict with his stepfather, the bond with his young sister (a wonderful Darby Camp), and Allison’s own background all earning focus without complete commitment. With wonderful performances throughout, a breathtaking depiction of the isolated American landscape, and a final act that excitedly leans into the fugitive-on-the-run temperament the film so often teases, Dreamland is a product of so much promise.  It’s just a shame that its script fails to engage as much as it should, leaving what could have been a sweeping affair more an average fling that leaves little impression. Academy Award® nominee Margot Robbie (Once Upon a Time in Hollywood) “is fantastic” (Indiewire) in this “dazzling” (Hollywood Reporter) love story set amidst America’s struggle during the Great Depression. Eugene Evans (Finn Cole, “Peaky Blinders”) dreams of escaping his small Texas town when he discovers a wounded, fugitive bank robber Allison Wells (Robbie) hiding closer than he could ever imagine. Torn between claiming the bounty for her capture and his growing attraction to the seductive criminal, nothing is as it seems, and Eugene must make a decision that will forever affect the lives of everyone he’s ever loved. Travis Fimmel (Warcraft), Kerry Condon (Avengers: Infinity War) and Lola Kirke (American Made) also star in this “beautifully shot coming-of-age story” (Indiewire).",NEUTRAL
"Dec 15, 2020"," Australian Margot Robbie has come a long, long way.  She was still a teenager when she landed a recurring role on the forever-running soapie Neighbours and it earned her a Logie nomination for most popular new female talent (losing to Packed to the Rafters’ Jessica Marais).  Several years later, she came to the world’s attention in Martin Scorsese’s The Wolf of Wall Street and her career has continued on an upward trajectory ever since.  She’s now a 30-year-old with two Oscar nominations under her belt (I, Tonya and Bombshell) who can also carry an action blockbuster (Birds of Prey).  Not bad for a kid from Dalby, Queensland. If you think that’s impressive, consider the fact Robbie co-founded a production company, LuckyChap Entertainment, in 2014.  Its goal is to tell women’s stories on screen while utilising female talent off screen.  Robbie starred in several of the company’s projects (I, Tonya and Birds of Prey) to help build its early presence but it has since expanded with productions such as Promising Young Woman starring Carey Mulligan (in Australian cinemas from next month) and the television series Dollface starring Kat Dennings. Dreamland is another LuckyChap production where Robbie serves as both star and producer.  It’s the first feature film of writer Nicolaas Zwart and the second go-round for young director Miles Joris-Peyrafitte who won a jury prize at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival for his debut, As You Are.  Given the shoot took place in late 2017, it’s been a prolonged wait time for those looking to see the finished product (COVID-19 hasn’t helped). That said, I’m not convinced there’s a wide audience that’ll be lining up to see this.  It’s a slow, formulaic drama that never gets out of first gear.  Set in Texas during the midst of the Great Depression, the story is centred on an unemployed young man named Eugene (Cole) who is meandering through life with little purpose.  He still lives on the farm with his mum (Condon), deputy sheriff step-father (Fimmel) and younger sister (Camp). His simple world is upended when he comes across a beautiful woman, Allison (Robbie), hiding in the family’s rundown barn.  She has a bleeding bullet hole in her upper leg and Eugene immediately recognises her face from a much publicised “wanted poster”.  Local authorities are offering a sizeable $10,000 reward (the equivalent of about $200,000 today) given her suspected involved in a botched bank robbery where a 9-year-old girl was killed. There’s a saying that good looks will take you further in life and yes, that’s the case here.  If Allison was some old, bearded, haggard man, Eugene would have turned him into the cops and taken the reward money.  Instead, Allison turns on the charm and successfully plays the “damsel in distress” card.  It’s not long before she has Eugene running increasingly dangerous errands (such as stealing a car) and looking for a way to slip over the border into Mexico. That’s pretty much it.  She’s using him as a means of escape while he thinks he’s falling in love and doing good deeds.  These two characters have limited arcs and there’s not much else to offer in terms of action (we don’t even see the original robbery) or surprises.  Without giving too much away, I was also unconvinced by some of the decisions made by Allison in the final act – why would she want to spend more time with such a bland, boring guy? Margot Robbie (the actor) is the best thing in this but I’m not sure it’s a project that Margot Robbie (the producer) should have green lit in the first place.",NEGATIVE

Finn Cole, 25, plays 17-year-old (when will Hollywood stop doing this?) dreamer Eugene Evans, who longs to escape the dust storms of Childress County in a film that impersonates the canon of Terrence Malick so exhaustively that the novice director Miles Joris-Peyrafitte must be verging on copyright infringement (see nature montages, sunset footage and whispering, meandering, mostly pointless voiceover from Lola Kirke).

"Dec 10, 2020"," Starring and produced by Margot Robbie, Dreamland is a thriller drama by Miles Joris-Peyrafitte. The film revolves around Eugene (Finn Cole), a young man living in the desolate town of Bismark. One day, he stumbles across wanted fugitive Allison Wells (Robbie) and chooses to help her escape captivity. While the premise comes across as a Bonnie and Clyde-type thriller, Dreamland is anything but. Instead, the narrative focuses on Eugene and Allison’s lacklustre dynamic. Unfortunately, there is a general lack of emotional depth fails to capture audiences. Therefore, it makes it hard to resonate with the leads and their need to survive. Their relationship also pushes aside the financial struggles of Eugene’s family and his overall lack of responsibility, highlighting his petulant behaviour.  Throughout Dreamland, Eugene’s lack of maturity paints him as a boy refusing to accept the dark realism of life. He has a strained relationship with stepfather George (Fimmel) and increasingly feels like an outsider within his own family. The only solace from his humdrum life is pulp magazines and dreams of Mexico, inspired by his absentee father John Baker. So, when he unexpectedly a wounded Allison, her coy smiles and compliments quickly win him over. Initially seeing her as a damsel in distress, Eugene tries his best to help but despite his best intentions, his actions come across as impulsive and naive. As a result, the simple attention of an older woman is his downfall – a somewhat dull development, which isn’t helped by Zwart’s monotonous screenplay. On the other hand, Dreamland is salvaged by its two leading female characters, notably Allison and Eugene’s half-sister Phoebe (Camp). Scarred by the events following a botched bank job, Allison isn’t looking for a partner or companion – just sole survival. So when Eugene joins her on the run, her emotional conflict brings a complexity mostly missing in Dreamland‘s mundane characters. In addition, Phoebe brings a unique and insightful POV to the core relationship while showing genuine concern for her half-brother. Last seen in Slaughterhouse Rulez, Cole attempts to portray the dashing hero. However, his inexpressive performance falls short of compelling while Robbie struggles to carry the story on her more experienced shoulders. Behind the camera, Lyle Vincent’s cinematography brings out the setting’s natural beauty. Unfortunately, Joris-Peyrafitte’s direction jolts from the beautiful to the misplaced, which creates a frustrating inconsistency that restricts the narrative’s emotional development.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 10, 2020"," In Dreamland, dust storms brew above the Great Plains in 1935 Texas, while we wait for a plot to materialise. And wait. This has the trappings of a handsome period crime piece, with a couple of bank robberies up its sleeve, and glimpses of Margot Robbie as a runaway gun moll whose first shot is her best: a telephoto close-up of her in bat-out-of-hell mode, hair flying at the wheel, and with the police in hot pursuit. It lasts maybe five seconds, but that’s enough time for you to blink, and entertain the fantasy of something nervy and thrilling that will shotgun alongside this dervish. The trouble is, she spends the next hour of screen time hiding in a barn. The Clyde to her Bonnie, played in a quick cameo by Garrett Hedlund, is already dead after a bank shoot-out that cost five lives, and Robbie’s Allison Wells is injured and desperate, without the ride she needs to get out of dodge and safely into Mexico. Assistance comes from Eugene Evans (Peaky Blinders’ engaging Finn Cole, a Hedlund lookalike). He’s a feckless young farm hand with his own dream of escape, and another in his loins: if you sketched it, it would look very much like Margot Robbie as a fugitive temptress begging for his trust. Dreamland goes wide on backdrop, glowing panoramas of the desert horizon at dusk, and dimestore-poetic voiceover from Lola Kirke, playing Eugene’s little sister in later life. However much the director, Miles Joris-Peyrafitte, and writer, Nicolaas Zvart, want to pay awed homage to the early works of Terrence Malick, everything in their vision feels gummily stuck in the past tense, like that mosquito in amber from Jurassic Park.  Eugene, not Allison, is the main character. His whole life story is sketched, from his parents’ settlement in Texas to his dad violently bailing, to be replaced by a hostile stepfather (Travis Fimmel) whose blue eyes burn. The present all concerns his smitten dealings with Robbie’s outlaw, but the film takes forever to live up to its genre potential and speed off. It’s a lovers-on-the-lam picture that’s corny with loving and thin on lam. It’s also fussy in its form, punctuating the rare moments of action with 8mm shots in saturated colour to represent Eugene’s dream life: the waves off Mexico, usually. The camera and score do vexingly intrusive things, and Robbie’s performance feels especially stalled by all this fidgeting. Within individual scenes, and the film at large, she’s strangely bumped into off-screen space. The film has misunderstood the appeal of its cinematic pedigree by overthinking it, melding Bonnie and Clyde and Badlands into a static blur jammed on pause. Viewers with motion sickness certainly aren’t in any danger.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 10, 2020"," An exercise in super-charged gaiety from Glee creator Ryan Murphy, Broadway adaptation The Prom is the sort of musical that wants to have its cake and eat it. Meryl Streep and James Corden respectively play Dee Dee Allen and Barry Glickman, the former a Broadway diva who thinks the worthiness of a role is a direct reflection of her own fabulousness as a human being – and the latter pretty much the same, only younger, campier and significantly less acclaimed. When their latest show together, a musical based on the life of Eleanor Roosevelt, closes on opening night after a critical savaging, they decide they need to devote themselves to a brand-enhancing good cause that will prove to the critics they’re not the self-obsessed egomaniacs they’ve been (correctly) identified as. Finding the perfect issue on Twitter in the form of a gay high school student (Jo Ellen Pellman) who’s been banned from taking her girlfriend to prom, it’s not long before Dee Dee, Barry, their perennial chorus-line pal Angie (a game Nicole Kidman), and Trent (Andrew Rannells), a Juilliard-trained wannabe working as a bartender, descend upon her conservative Indiana town, proudly announcing themselves as New York liberals, here to overturn its residents’ Red State-ingrained homophobia. Like the characters themselves, the film isn’t all that interested in doing the hard-work of bridging the cultural divide; this is mostly a preaching-to-the-choir celebration of the joys of musical theatre and to that end it can be terrifically entertaining thanks to some dazzling routines, sharp one-liners and outré performances. Sticking with Broadway, the Spike Lee-directed David Byrne’s American Utopia captures the former Talking Heads frontman’s late 2019/early 2020 residency at New York’s Hudson Theatre where he performed a nightly version of his innovative 2018 concert tour. Incorporating songs from the album of the same title, as well as classic Talking Heads tracks and solo cuts, the film is a cross between a live concert and piece of performance art, one that puts us front, centre, left, right and even up above the show (Lee shoots from all angles) as Byrne explores a more positive idea of the United States through music, personal anecdotes and the free movement of his musicians across his purposely spartan stage. Watched in the wake of Trump’s reluctant defeat, the film certainly feels like an affirmation of everything Byrne – who discusses his own status as a Scottish immigrant to the US – holds dear. But it’s Lee’s ability to capture and convey liveness on screen that really ramps up the poignancy of the film. Shot just before the world went into lockdown, its ability to get you dancing in your own living room makes it a very welcome companion piece to Jonathan Demme’s classic Talking Heads concert film Stop Making Sense. Having directed the most nihilistic teen movie of all time with 1986’s cult classic River’s Edge, veteran US director Tim Hunter’s latest, Smiley Face Killers, sees him re-team with River’s Edge star Crispin Glover for one of the stranger serial killer movies of recent years. Scripted by American Psycho author Bret Easton Ellis, and apparently based on true events linked to a spate of mysterious drownings involving male college students, it takes a subversive approach to the genre by presenting the story mostly as a character study of the killer’s next target, Jake (Ronen Rubinstein), a good-looking but troubled student whose decision to go off his meds coincides with him receiving a series of weird text messages that his girlfriend fears he might have been sending himself. Hunter spends the first two-thirds of the movie tracking Jake like he’s prey, but he also gives the film a strangely blissed-out quality, ensuring it plays like a dream that’s about to turn bad, which it promptly does with the appearance of Glover as a hooded, van-dwelling occultist with a blood-lust and a crew of willing disciples. It’s freaky, engrossing stuff and Glover’s casting provides a neat link to his earlier collaboration with Hunter; it’s entirely possible to believe that the off-the-rails teen he played in River’s Edge would turn into a kind of garage band Charles Manson. Featuring Margot Robbie as a bank-robbing outlaw who takes up with a dirt-poor 17-year-old (Finn Cole) desperate to escape his own mundane dustbowl existence, the Depression era-set Dreamland could have been an interesting fusion of Bonnie and Clyde and Badlands had director Miles Joris-Peyrafitte had the courage of his convictions and built it around Robbie’s character. Instead he spends so long framing it as the story of a comic-book-reading teenage boy obsessed with his long-absent father that watching it feels like queuing up for a dull theme park ride into the past. There’s more coming-of-age drama in Cocoon, an earnest Berlin-set teen movie about a young girl discovering her sexuality during the hottest summer on record. As indicated by the film’s title and the way writer/director Leonie Krippendorff sets up the main character, Nora (Lena Urzendowsky), as a budding lepidopterist, it’s not exactly subtle in its efforts to dramatise what Nora is going through. Then again, neither are the feelings teenagers have at this age, so all the transformation symbolism feels appropriate rather than condescending. The Prom is on selected release now and streams on Netflix from 11 December, David Byrne’s American Utopia and Smiley Face Killers are available on digital download from 14 December, Dreamland is in UK cinemas from 11 December, Cocoon is in cinemas and on demand from 11 December.

"Dec 10, 2020"," A lonely kid in a 1930s Texas dustbowl town dreams of adventure. Then it all comes to life when a fugitive bank robber, badly wounded, shows up and hides out in the family barn. But this film switches the gender assumptions: the criminal is a woman, Allison Wells, played by the movie’s producer-star Margot Robbie, and her teenage protector is a boy: Eugene Evans, played by Finn Cole – and soon they’re hatching plans together, lovestruck Eugene having been assured by the wide-eyed Allison that the much-publicised death of an innocent bystanderarising from her last robbery was due to crossfire from the police. This is an interesting twist on the Bonnie and Clyde template from screenwriting newcomer Nicolaas Zwart and director Miles Joris-Peyrafitte, who was an award-winner at Sundance last year with his debut feature As You Are. Eugene himself is unhappy and alienated because, when he was a kid, his dad abandoned the family to chase his dreams in the supposed paradise of Mexico, a land of mistily imagined golden beaches. Maybe Eugene has inherited that wayward outlaw gene. Meanwhile, his glowering stepdad George (Travis Fimmel) is a deputy sheriff who is, of course, committed to bringing down Allison and her accomplices, maybe with a posse who can share with him the cash bounty to which he might not otherwise be entitled. Dreamland is no masterpiece but it is a robustly made action drama, with impressive and even daring visual sequences when Eugene and Allison have to rob a bank. The ensuing chaos meshes with Eugene’s hallucinatory vision of what their future life in Mexico will be like. Interesting work from cinematographer Lyle Vincent, who also shot Ana Lily Amirpour’s A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 10, 2020"," Following the Wall Street Crash of October 1929, America was thrown into a decade of high unemployment, deflation and widespread poverty. This period came to be known as the Great Depression and spread across much of the developed and developing world. Growing up during this time was hard, to say the least. Opportunities were scarce and both work and money were hard to come by. This is the setting for Miles Joris-Peyrafitte’s new film Dreamland. Eugene Evans (Finn Cole) is a young man living in a dead-end rural Texas town who dreams of escaping to make a better life for himself. When he learns that a notorious bank robber, Allison Wells (Margot Robbie), is on the loose with a bounty on her head, he sees the reward for her capture as a way out. However, when he discovers her hiding, injured, this determination soon begins to waiver. Dreamland uses the tumultuous weather and rugged isolation of the region as a startling backdrop to an impeccably made period drama. Lyle Vincent’s beautiful cinematography brings the setting and era to life. Whilst the romance between Eugene and Allison feels a little thin, at times, their circumstances ring true. Dreamland is driven by Robbie. Her performance illuminates a rather threadbare tale, but it never quite achieves the freedom everyone desires. Rob worked on a number of online music magazines, both as a writer and editor, before concentrating on his first love - film. After stints as Cultural and Film Editor on local magazines, he took up residency as Film Editor at Backseat Mafia.

"Nov 19, 2020"," Thanks to her powerful screen presence, transformative acting ability, and timeless beauty, Margot Robbie is the rare 21st-century actor who can show up in a film set during pretty much any time period without seeming out-of-place. In Dreamland, which Robbie also produced through her LuckyChap Entertainment shingle, she’s dropped into the middle of 1930s Texas as fugitive bank robber Allison Wells, a Bonnie who finds her unlikely Clyde in the former of a wannabe bounty hunter played by Peaky Blinders’ Finn Cole. Robbie is perfectly cast as a complex woman whose outlaw glamour belies her inner darkness, and it is around her that the rest of the film slowly revolves. Eugene Evans (Cole) spends most of his life engulfed in fantasy, though one cannot blame him too much considering the economic strife that plagues his small Dust Bowl town. When he’s not stealing and hoarding pulpy detective comics in his family’s empty barn, he’s fantasizing about getting out from under the oppressive thumb of his stepfather, local deputy George Evans (Travis Fimmel), and finding his birth dad, who abandoned Eugene and his mother (Kerry Condon) many years ago for the bright sun and sparkling blue water of the Gulf of Mexico.Eugene has the chance to make at least one of these dreams a reality when he learns that notorious bank robber Allison Wells has been seen in the area, with a $10,000 bounty on her head due to the trail of bodies she has left in her wake. Desperate for money and excitement, Eugene decides to track her down. But before he can make any headway in his search, Allison shows up in his barn with a bullet hole in her leg, claiming she’s not the heartless killer the authorities have made her out to be and begging Eugene for help. Needless to say, it’s all too easy for Eugene to fall under the spell of a beautiful woman who appears to have walked straight out of the pages of his books and into his life.source: Paramount PicturesAllison tells Eugene that if he can get her a car so she can drive to Mexico, she’ll reward him with double the bounty on her head. Eugene is all too willing to help, but only if he can go with her. In love with Allison — or at least, in love with the idea of her that she has fed him for her own benefit — Eugene is willing to risk it all to help her escape, all the while hoping that once they arrive in Mexico, he can potentially track down his father. Naturally, it’s only a matter of time before Eugene realizes that the harsh reality of his new life as an outlaw only bears a passing resemblance to the romantic escapade he envisioned.Mad for MalickWhile the initial comparison one might make is to the classic outlaw romance Bonnie and Clyde, the biggest influence on Dreamland director Miles Joris-Peyrafitte and screenwriter Nicolaas Zwart appears to be the cinema of Terrence Malick. The film contains echoes of Malick’s debut feature, Badlands, starring Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek as two young people in love and on the run, and his dreamlike second film, Days of Heaven, starring Richard Gere and Brooke Adams as another set of young lovers trying to find a way out of trouble while working as farm laborers in the Texas panhandle. (Needless to say, it cannot hold a candle to these classics, but one does appreciate the effort.)In particular, Dreamland’s earnest voiceover, courtesy of Eugene’s younger sister Phoebe (played by Darby Camp as a young girl and voiced by Lola Kirke as an adult), is clearly influenced by the rambling narration of Linda (Linda Manz), the younger sister of Gere’s character in Days of Heaven. However, Phoebe’s nostalgic telling of her brother’s story lacks the abstract beauty of Linda’s mostly improvised monologues and doesn’t really add much to the film apart from really emphasizing how much these filmmakers like Terrence Malick.In certain pivotal moments in Dreamland, Eugene’s reality is cut with flashes of both his dreams and his nightmares: Allison in a bathing suit about to jump into the clear blue ocean, a dead rabbit being skinned by his harsh stepfather. It’s an intriguing choice that pays off in allowing us a keener glimpse into Eugene’s inner life and the moments that haunt him. Combined with the soft glow of Lyle Vincent’s cinematography and the haunting twang of avant-garde composer Patrick Higgins’ score, the resulting film has a deeply introspective vibe that is altogether very different from the rock and roll rebel lifestyle portrayed in Arthur Penn’s Bonnie and Clyde. Yet that reference is still relevant here, for that appears to be exactly what Eugene thinks his life with Allison will be.Marvelous MargotLike someone who has watched too many gangster movies and has convinced himself that he too could rob a bank without getting caught, the stories Eugene devours have convinced him that being on the run with a tough-as-nails dame is something romantic and exciting. Instead, he finds himself struggling to deal with jealousy as Allison employs her substantial charm on other men in order to get their way, and when he accompanies her on a robbery to re-up their rapidly dwindling funds, he finds himself extremely out of his depth.source: Paramount PicturesCole’s portrayal of Eugene is occasionally quite annoying; in many scenes, he comes off as a whiny boy ready to throw his toys out of the pram for things not going his way. (It’s easy to see why Allison keeps calling him “kid,” which is yet another thing that he whines about.) Yet that is not a problem with Cole’s performance; it’s how the character is written. And while it might be irritating, it also feels very realistic. Eugene is not the (anti)hero he or even his sister Phoebe want him to be. That would be Allison, who is so far out of Eugene’s league that it’s no wonder he can barely keep up.Despite having a face full of modern makeup, including eyebrows that are far too well-groomed to have ever been on the run, Robbie is still spectacular as the tough-talking, no-nonsense Allison. It’s thrilling to watch her weave her story in such a way that Eugene ends up wrapped so tightly around her finger that she’d have to cut the whole thing off in order to be rid of him. Even as she paints herself as a victim of misfortune who is just doing what was necessary in order to survive, it’s clear — to the audience, if not to Eugene — that she is far more complex than such easily peddled stereotypes. She lives according to her own rules, making no apologies for those she hurts along the way. Not every actor would have the natural charisma to pull off such a performance, but Robbie makes it look easy. It is her presence that ensures Dreamland’s baggy second half doesn’t collapse.ConclusionDespite some flaws, including that aforementioned narration and some subpar costuming and set design that screams low-budget to the point of being distracting, Dreamland works as a vehicle for Margot Robbie’s substantial star power.What do you think?

"Nov 18, 2020","With its gorgeous cinematography, haunting score, careful pacing, evocative use of cross-cutting, and great performance from Margot Robbie, this is one of the best movies of 2020.",POSITIVE
"Nov 18, 2020"," Not as tough or edgy as its title suggests, this broad comedy about female empowerment is hardly a knockout. It follows Anna (Malin Akerman), whose life is in a downward spiral when she learns of an underground all-female fight club founded by her late mother. She sees the opportunity to improve her financial and emotional well-being, if only an alcoholic ex-trainer (Alec Baldwin) can whip her into shape for a high-stakes bout against Anna’s tough-talking rival (Bella Thorne). The actors seem to enjoy playing in a traditionally male-dominated arena, but their enthusiasm doesn’t make the lame gags funnier, or make the predictable film a winner. (Rated, 97 minutes). While its self-indulgent eccentricities might push you away, the relatable and heartfelt dynamics of this “bromantic” comedy keep drawing you back in. This glimpse into the highs and lows of an adult male friendship spanning more than a decade marks an audacious if uneven debut for director Michael Angelo Covino, who wrote the script with real-life buddy Kyle Marvin. Although their characters are fictional, their authentic rapport resonates as they portray longtime pals who stick together despite bickering over women and each other’s faults. The episodic story effectively weaves dark humor into serious subject matter while favoring long takes, overlapping dialogue, and random musical interludes. (Rated R, 97 minutes). Committed performances steer this meandering crime saga — about an outlaw couple seeking redemption on the lam — through its predictable narrative detours. It takes place in Depression-era, drought-ridden Texas, where Allison (Margot Robbie) is a fugitive bank robber hiding out in a rural barn. She’s discovered by Eugene (Finn Cole), a wayward teenager who happens to be the stepson of a local sheriff’s deputy (Travis Fimmel). With a bounty on her head, Allison offers a higher reward, and greater risk, if Eugene will take her to Mexico. More atmospheric than edgy, the film examines familiar themes with more emotional depth and moral complexity than you might expect. (Rated R, 101 minutes). When the economy tanks, who will save the poor millennials? That’s the extent of the moral complexity and financial insight in this derivative white-collar heist thriller, which is all attitude and no substance. Around 2010, Lance (Patrick Schwarzenegger) is a college graduate with heavy debt and no job prospects. He channels his frustrations into a Robin Hood-style scheme run by a hot-tempered criminal (Alex Pettyfer) whose crew brazenly robs mansions. Fine actors, including Michael Shannon as a complicit art collector, are stranded by this empty exercise in finger-pointing and anti-capitalist cynicism — inspired by true events — that stumbles badly when trying to legitimize its unscrupulous rogues. (Rated R, 93 minutes). A deliciously devious premise and some inspired casting fails to deliver its intended gift of edgy mischief to accompany your holiday cheer. Chris Cringle (Mel Gibson) is struggling due to the worldwide rise of spoiled brats like Billy (Chance Hurstfield), who receives a lump of coal for Christmas. So the youngster hires a hitman (Walton Goggins) to exact revenge at Santa’s compound in rural Alaska, where it’s cold but Santa packs heat. Despite some scattered big laughs, the screenplay by sibling directors Ian and Eshom Nelms (Small Town Crime) doesn’t commit to either embracing its inherent silliness or playing it straight. Such indecisiveness leaves moviegoers chilly. (Rated R, 99 minutes). Another deep-dive inside the eccentric and obsessive mind of legendary filmmaker Werner Herzog, this documentary tackles the timeless and mysterious world of meteorites. Herzog and Cambridge volcanologist Clive Oppenheimer travel to some of the most remote places on Earth — from the Australian Outback to Antarctica — to find craters allegedly created by meteors, and how their cosmic significance is found in art, religion, astronomy, and metaphysics. Herzog’s typically affable narration makes some dense material more accessible and fascinating that it probably should be, even if the film overall is more noteworthy for the beauty of its journey than its collection of loopy metaphysical theories and scientific discoveries. (Not rated, 97 minutes). More pretentious than provocative, this atmospheric exercise in psychological horror never gets under your skin. Charlotte (Odessa Young) is a Georgia teenager haunted by her mother’s death and jolted a string of murders affecting her small-town classmates during the summer after graduation. Then an old boyfriend (Ben Schnetzer) reappears as a sort of apparition, causing nightmares that leave Charlotte’s best friend (Madelyn Cline) justifiably fearing for her mental health. Unfortunately, viewers might not share that empathy, in part because the screenplay by rookie director David Raboy — expanded from his short film — remains emotionally distant. Despite some visual flourishes, the result is muddled and tedious. (Not rated, 99 minutes). As it subverts genre expectations, this slow-burning psychological thriller transitions into a deeply personal exploration of sexuality and self-discovery. In rural England, Ruth (Molly Windsor) moves in with her boyfriend (Joseph Quinn) in a mobile home park, only to suspect he’s cheating on her. Ruth finds comfort in her friendship with a new co-worker (Stefanie Martini), later developing an obsession that causes her to reconsider her own feelings. The character-driven screenplay by rookie director Claire Oakley meanders through a deliberately paced first act before rewarding patience with a haunting undercurrent and some well-earned twists. Windsor’s intricately modulated performance helps the film sidestep coming-of-age clichés. (Not rated, 86 minutes). While it’s an earnest tribute to the camaraderie and courage of our troops, this low-budget World War II thriller lacks the emotional stakes to transcend its narrative cliches. It follows four American soldiers sent on a perilous reconnaissance mission in the Italian mountains, where their resolve is tested by rugged conditions and by persistent sniper fire from an unseen enemy. Along the way, they take an elderly traveler (Franco Nero) as a prisoner. Relying more on talk than action, the true-life screenplay by rookie director Robert Port offers an intimate examination of the physical and psychological toll of war while struggling to resonate more deeply.

"Nov 18, 2020"," Hollywood has always loved outlaw movies, almost since the very first celluloid clacked through a projector, and since ""Bonnie & Clyde"" in 1967 it's had a particular fascination for doomed couples on open-sky crime sprees. It's been imitated countless times, from the gritty ""The Getaway"" to the hazy, dreamlike ""Ain't Them Bodies Saints."" ""Dreamland"" is closer to the latter, a story less concerned with the actual mechanics of robbing banks than the inner emotional journey of its two protagonists. It's an astonishingly beautiful film, set in the 1930s Texas dust bowl, with cinematographer Lyle Vincent's vibrant warm hues giving way to nearly colorless stretches of gray-brown. Margot Robbie stars as Allison Wells, a notorious bank robber on the run after things went to hell on her last job. Several people were killed, including a little girl and her lover/partner in crime, Perry (Garrett Hedlund). The lawmen and newspapers have been playing her up as a cold-hearted she-devil, though she's got another story to tell. Actually, several versions of it. Shot in the leg, Allison holes up in the barn of 17-year-old Eugene (Finn Cole), a kid with his nose in the dirt and head in the clouds. He steals detective comic books and dreams of reuniting with his long-departed father, who ran out on them when he was little and moved to Mexico. He loathes his deputy stepdad (Travis Fimmel), who wears a strange, vaguely Hitler-esque haircut. His own blue eyes are the icy counterpoint to Allison's heat. Gene does have a soft spot for his hard-pressed mom (Kerry Condon) and kid sister, Phoebe (Darby Camp). There really isn't a whole lot of story to speak of. Director Miles Joris-Peyrafitte and screenwriter Nicolaas Zwart concentrate on setting up situations and character impulses, and then seeing how the pieces will move around on their own. We know that Gene will be completely ensorceled by Allison, and she will do little to discourage this sentiment so long as he's helping her hide out and heal up. And that the $20,000 bounty on her head will lead the locals to start closing in on the couple, with Gene's stepdad as the head bloodhound. And eventually, she will need to move on and Gene will go with her. I'm not giving anything away; the narration says as much in the very beginning, Phoebe talking about the legend of her brother and ""the Wells woman."" I just loved the look of this film, with great attention detail paid to the frayed edges of the people's clothing, the rusty screws in the bed of the family truck and the slight sheen of sweat that hangs on people's foreheads to remind us of the Texas crop-killing drought. When things go south, people tend to get squirrelly, acting normal on the surface but ready to jump at the slightest chance to change the dire direction of things -- even if it chances things getting worse. Gosh, that sounds familiar... Even the smallest supporting actors are right in the groove, never altering the sense of well-worn authenticity. I especially liked Stephen Dinh as Joe, Gene's American Indian friend looking for his own way out, and Joe Berryman as the gimlet-eyed local sheriff, who eats BS for breakfast. There's one terrific sequence where Gene goes off to take a peek at the evidence the police have against Allison while everyone is at a town dance, as an old-timer performs energetic hambone -- percussive knee-slapping and such -- supplying the tension-building music underneath. Marvelous. The film does seem to be missing a few pieces, a little more backstory for Allison and more about Gene's longing for his dad's memory to fill out the connective tissue. In an age where I'm constantly harping about how many movies are too long, here's a handsome one that needed a little more fat on the bone.",POSITIVE
"Nov 17, 2020"," With the awards and holiday seasons coming to a collision course, there is a bounty of new releases hitting theaters and VOD platforms. Don’t get me wrong, I love having a vast amount of content to sift through, especially given the relative dearth of content 2020 has brought on the big screen. However, this weekend’s sizable output gives me little time to cover each release, which is why I am embracing this abridged format to catch you up to speed. Let’s get to it!  Synopsis: 1840s England, acclaimed but overlooked fossil hunter Mary Anning and a young woman sent to convalesce by the sea develop an intense relationship, altering both of their lives forever. Given all the turmoil going on in the film industry/world at large, there’s something oddly comforting about the latest awards-hopeful Ammonite. Even in a truncated year, studios are still here to greet audiences with flat, Oscar-bait offerings that can’t hide their simplistic intentions.  Ammonite’s middling results are befuddling considering the immense talent behind it. Kate Winslet and Saoirse Ronan are compelling as always, unearthing subdued dimensions from the character’s internal struggles. Their longing and displeasure simmer through each frame, with the two combating the societal standards that keep them an arms distance from personal freedoms.  While the two actresses are great as individuals, Ammonite never allows the duo to grow onscreen. There’s no spark to draw from their insular performances, with director Francis Lee struggling to generate emotion from his mannered craftsmanship. Even for a subdued effort like this, the lacking chemistry consistently keeps viewers away from the character’s painful (and exceedingly relevant) struggles. Ammonite rarely makes a major misstep, but the project never resonates the way it intends to.  Have you ever returned to an old stomping ground only to be met with a lingering sense of melancholy? While you can revisit the sites you once traversed, those once-beloved locations now leave a foreboding malaise. That raw sentiment renders throughout Monsoon, a meditative drama that never loses its humanistic drive.  Don’t get me wrong, this is set-up has been portrayed in a countless array of festival films. Some of these efforts have thrived (The Farewell and Garden State), while others have joined a long list of forgotten festival failures (The Only Living Boy in New York). Director Hong Khaou thankfully makes this premise his own though, favoring a quiet atmosphere that subverts the mawkish sentimentality that typically derives from films of this elk.  Khaou’s visceral craftsmanship registers poetic potency, with patiently-constructed long-takes allowing viewers to breathe in the setting alongside Kit. It also provides star Henry Golding ample opportunities to display his acting chops. The Last Christmas star possesses a natural gravitas onscreen, peeling at Kit’s protective layers through his effectively insular delivery. This film rests solely on Khaou and Golding’s abilities, but the well-matched duo certainly proves they are up for the task. Monsoon unearths its quaint observations with an equal measure of emotion and craft.  Synopsis: Amid the dust storms and economic depression of Dustbowl Era Oklahoma, Eugene Evans finds his family farm on the brink of foreclosure. His last bet to save the farm is the bounty on the head of fugitive bank robber Allison Wells. Once he stumbles upon Allison, Eugene begins to fall for her as he searches for a more profound life.  Dreamland’s set-up reads like a Bonnie and Clyde rip-off, a fact which director Miles Joris-Peyrafitte seems well-aware of. Along with his exquisite visual eye (he takes the empty Dusk Bowl setting and infuses it with a visceral poeticism), Joris-Peyrafitte approaches this familiar narrative ground with a reflective sensibility.  Dreamland operates at its best when uncorking the purpose behind its pulpy plot dynamics. Screenwriter Nicolaas Zwart uses his set-up to observe the respective allures of a grandiose lifestyle, with Eugene willingly embracing a deadly mission after years of being brainwashed by adventure stories. This conceit cleverly comments on our own relationship with high-stakes storytelling, a wistfulness that Zwart and Joris-Peyrafitte aptly juxtapose in the film’s melancholic final third. Credit to stars Margot Robbie and Finn Cole breathing assured performances from the character’s makeshift relationship.  The promising thematic conceits can only take Dreamland so far though. Zwart’s script utilizes a novel-esque approach that lands with an awkward thud, lacking the dramatic grace to completely reinvent its well-trudged devices. That being said, I do think Zwart and Joris-Peyrafitte craft a thoughtful film that lingers with audiences past its runtime.  We hope you're enjoying BRWC.

"Nov 17, 2020","  Margot Robbie is best known for her onscreen roles in films like The Wolf of Wall Street, I, Tonya, and Birds of Prey, but she's also made a name for herself as a producer recently. One such vehicle that sees her work on both sides of the camera is Dreamland, a crime drama set against the backdrop of the Dust Bowl. Having its premiere at the 2019 Tribeca Film Festival, the movie is finally being made available to general audiences. In a year that's been short on notable releases, the hope was Dreamland would be able to help fill the void, but it doesn't hit all of its marks. Dreamland is a fairly straightforward crime saga that doesn't reinvent the wheel, but is still enjoyable thanks to Robbie and its production values.   Dreamland follows Eugene Evans (Finn Cole), a young man living on a farm with his mother Olivia (Kerry Condon), stepfather George (Travis Fimmel) and half-sister Phoebe (Darby Camp). Eugene is a fan of reading stories about bank robbers, and dreams of what it must be like to live the life of a criminal. His life changes when he finds outlaw fugitive Allison Wells (Robbie) hiding in his family's barn. Rather than turning Allison in for a sizable bounty, Eugene considers helping her escape to Mexico and receiving an even larger financial reward.   The Dreamland script by Nicolaas Zwart is serviceable, but there are a few shortcomings that prevent the film from realizing its full potential. There are a number of threads, such as Eugene's relationship with his younger sister or the blossoming romance between Eugene and Allison, that would be a strong foundation for the movie's emotional core. The issue is they are mostly underdeveloped, negatively affecting the impact of these scenes. Viewers see glimpses of compelling material (Phoebe and Eugene have some cute and emotional interactions), but there isn't enough to stick the landing. This is very apparent in the love story elements, which feels rushed. Dreamland, which runs well under two hours, could have benefitted from additional time to flesh out key aspects.   Where the movie succeeds is teleporting audiences back to the 1930s in the Dust Bowl south. The period-accurate costumes and production design do a great job of replicating that era, giving Dreamland the look and feel of a work from the past. It may not be the most comprehensive exploration of the time period, but still works as a snapshot of what life was like back then. Director Miles Joris-Peyrafitte also gives Dreamland a bit of a visual flair, particularly in the use of cutting between reality and a character's fantasy to underscore specific emotions. Dreamland may primarily be seen on TV screens at home due to the coronavirus pandemic, but it boasts cinematic qualities and doesn't ever come across as cheap. This isn't to say it's a must-see on the big screen, but the crew did an excellent job across the board.   Robbie, perhaps by the nature of her star power, leaves the biggest impression out of the cast. She comes across as the ideal choice to play Allison, who Eugene views as a mythical, larger-than-life figure from the headlines. Robbie's chemistry with Cole isn't always apparent, though Cole does a good enough job portraying a love-struck farm boy who's in over his head. Even if the romance isn't always convincing, it's easy to see how someone like Eugene could fall for Allison, and the two do have some strong moments together. As for the supporting cast, those roles are largely underwritten and fill various archetypes (i.e. George is the disciplinarian stepfather, Phoebe is the adoring younger sister fond of her brother). There isn't much on the page for the likes of Fimmel, Camp, and Condon to work with, but they all fit their parts well and are solid.   It's probably for the best Dreamland is hitting on-demand platforms around the same time as its limited theatrical release. In a normal year, this is the kind of movie that would get lost in the shuffle - especially since the fall typically sees a number of Oscar contenders competing for attention. While Dreamland has some positive merits, it probably isn't going to be in the running for major awards (even in this weird, COVID-affected season). It stands a better chance of catching on with its niche audience in living rooms; fans of crime dramas and Robbie may find something to latch onto, but Dreamland is pretty standard fare when it could have been slightly more compelling.   Dreamland is now open in U.S. theaters and hits VOD on November 17. It runs 98 minutes and is rated R for some violence, language, and sexuality/nudity.

"Nov 17, 2020"," The film, in select theaters and available to stream starting Tuesday, Nov. 17, takes place in 1934, during the Dust Bowl, in a small rural town that would be bleak even in the best of times. On Sunday, the entire town goes to church, not necessarily because they’re all religious, but because it’s the only show in town. And the church is practically the only building in town. Welcome to No Place, surrounded by nowhere. Finn Cole (“Peaky Blinders”) plays Eugene, a teenager who dreams of something more. In an environment that might kill anyone’s spirit, he’s got some romantic ideas about what life could be. Then, miraculously, romance and adventure come to him when he walks into the barn and finds Allison Wells, played by Robbie, hiding there. Allison, however, is a woman wanted throughout the state for bank robbery and murder. She’s injured, desperate and dangerous, and suddenly he has a choice: He can turn her in and, in the process, turn his back on his destiny, or he can play the hand that fate has dealt him. This is where having a movie star becomes essential. In the glare and glow of Robbie’s star wattage, the sensible thing is hardly an option. Everyone young Eugene knows is drab, depressed and limited, while Allison is something off the pages of a pulp magazine — and she needs him. Of course, he has to help her! Robbie turned 30 years old this summer, which means that every time we’ve seen her onscreen, she has been in her 20s. Unlike many stars of our era, male and female, she has never been a juvenile or an ingenue, but rather a full-fledged adult from her first moments of stardom. She brings this screen maturity to her performance as Allison, so that we understand, without the script having to state it, the miles on this young woman, the spiritual toll. Chronologically, Allison might be 26 and Eugene might be 16, but in practical terms, she’s about 50, and he’s about 5 — and no match at all. The story is told from the standpoint of Eugene’s little sister, who narrates the story as an adult, presumably imagining the many scenes she wasn’t present for. The narration works just fine, at least until the movie’s last 30 seconds. But let’s not talk about the ending. Suffice it to say that it’s unusual for a good movie to screw up its last 30 seconds, but “Dreamland” manages it. Fortunately, it’s not enough to damage the entire experience. The important thing is that “Dreamland” accomplishes its main intention, which is to make us invest in this strange love story. To the outside world, Allison is a bad person who needs to be eliminated. But from inside the movie’s illusion — an illusion that we, as viewers, partake of — Allison and Eugene are the only people who are alive, and everyone else is the walking dead. In fact, it begins to seem that the reason that civil society is so intent on killing Allison is that she is alive and therefore a threat. It’s like her existence proves their lack of existence. This isn’t really true, but this is how we end up feeling, and it’s how the characters feel. Once director Miles Joris-Peyrafitte gets us to that place, he can do anything with us, because we are with Allison and Eugene. We’re not watching them from a distance, but experiencing the story through their eyes. At that point, a quiet scene can be powerful, and a love scene is as important as something happening to you.

"Nov 17, 2020"," Obviously, when Margot Robbie’s name gets attached to anything, I’ll take notice. But the strange little 2019 holdover Dreamland was a work I knew nothing about until a couple of weeks ago. In this Miles Joris-Peyrafitte-directed piece, Robbie plays wounded, fugitive, Depression-era bank robber Allison Wells, who has been making her way across Texas with her partner Perry Montro (Garrett Hedlund) until a botched job results in several deaths, including police officers and a little girl. The robbers are separated, and Wells ends up hiding out in the barn belonging to the Evans family, where she is discovered by teen son Eugene (Finn Cole, “Peaky Blinders”), who decides to nurse her back to health and help her escape to Mexico. Since the farm has been ravaged by multiple dust storms, the barn doesn’t get much use, making it safe for Wells to hide there, eve if she is eager to leave as soon as she’s healthy. And because she’s played by Robbie (Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Birds of Prey), naturally young Eugene falls madly in love with her, even after he discovers that she’s lied to him about certain aspects of what led her to the farm. Eugene also has a tumultuous home life, with his mother (Kerry Condon), sheriff stepfather (Travis Fimmel), and younger sister Phoebe (Darby Camp); an older version of Phoebe (voiced by Lola Kirke) serves as our narrator. Eugene has no real desire to stay on the farm any longer than he has to, and he sees Wells’ arrival as his way out as well, even though he doesn’t have a real plan beyond leaving with her, or at least being entertained by the romantic idea of it. I suppose Dreamland is a coming-of-age story about Eugene, but most such stories are identifiable by the audience, who is going to have to strain to find the universal qualities in his experience with this criminal. If it’s in fact meant to be a love story, it doesn’t really work either because Wells is so consistently dishonest with Eugene that they never really form a bond until very late in the film. And even then, I didn’t fully trust Wells's actions or motivations. Honestly, I’m still trying to figure out what an actor of Robbie’s caliber is doing in this movie at all. It’s a good-looking film that captures the dead-end life in a small town to some believable degree, but Robbie is better than this. Featuring a cast of largely forgettable performances reciting fairly standard-issue dialog, she’s really the only standout in this work. Even the ending misses the emotional peak it needs in order to really standout in one’s mind. Dreamland feels like another pandemic second-chance film that would never have gotten even this level of attention were it not for studios pushing their higher-profile films into 2021. Robbie is a known quantity who somehow got hoodwinked into being in this, and it certainly got me to watch it. But that doesn’t mean you should, unless you’re a completist of the actress's work. That's really the only reason to check out this aggressively average crime drama/love story/coming-of-age tale. Did you enjoy this post?

"Nov 16, 2020"," Ostensibly the story of an impressionable young man who falls for a beautiful, dangerous fugitive, Dreamland attempts to re-frame a familiar portrait of youth’s enduring restlessness with an overdue deconstruction outlaws romanticized in media and myth. But even a complex performance by Robbie can’t hold together all of the shaggy components of Miles Joris-Petrafitte’s Depression-era drama as it wildly overplays the emotional depth of the time in which its sequence of events are supposed to take place, feeling overlong and underwhelming as a result. Finn Cole (Animal Kingdom) plays Eugene Evans, a young man abandoned as a child by his birth father and then raised by an unsentimental stepfather, George (Travis Fimmel, Finding Steve McQueen). Living on the edge of poverty at the height of the Depression, Eugene retreats into the fantasies of detective stories and pulp novels when he’s not caring for his little sister Phoebe (Darby Camp, Benji). But when news spreads that a wanted robber, the supposedly cold-blooded child killer Allison Wells (Robbie) is on the loose in his community, Eugene becomes fixated on her exploits even as he joins the search party to apprehend her. He encounters more than he bargains for when Wells turns up in the family barn, bleeding, scared and requiring medical attention. Both terrified and tantalized by her legendary exploits, Eugene stitches up her wound and reluctantly befriends her, even as his stepfather becomes more determined than ever to capture her and hopefully acquire a portion of the $10,000 reward. But when Allison offers Eugene twice that amount in exchange for safe passage out of town, he’s too intrigued — and eager to fall for her charms — to refuse. Before long, Eugene and Allison are on the run with George and a small crew of bounty hunters at his side, with only her ghosts and his fears standing between them and their freedom in Mexico. The way the film opens sets a very different pace than the one into which it settles: Phoebe, as an adult (beautifully underplayed in voiceover by Lola Kirke), tells Eugene’s story, from the bullet points of his troubled upbringing to the intimacies of his hopes and dreams. But all of the events shared between Eugene and Allison last only a matter of a few days — certainly long enough for him to fall in love with her, and possibly for her to decide she loves him back — while the ups and downs they experience feel more like the evolution of weeks and months. Because there’s so much volatililty, scenes drag when they should be engrossing us further in Eugene and Allison’s goals, making us care about whether she truly cares for him or is just manipulating him, and whether or not he cares which of those is true. Suffice it to say that this is far from the first story ever told of lovers on the run ever told; Joris-Peyrafitte’s film shares much in common with Arthur Penn’s youth culture standard-bearer Bonnie and Clyde, including its juxtaposition of the characters’ impulsivity and the legends that arise about their crimes. The film also mines the familiar territory of a young man intoxicated by a beautiful and quite possibly dangerous older woman, and the yearning of a hometown individual to escape and explore the world outside his or her city limits. Unfortunately, Allison remains too much of a mystery for either her vulnerability or her calculating authority to register deeply, and Eugene’s schizophrenic immaturity undercuts the dramatic weight of almost every scene. Narratively speaking, one could understand his caution-to-the-wind enthusiasm for helping Allison, and even to go with her, but his willingness to help her fluctuates from one moment to the next, and it becomes exhausting to watch, and impossible to care about. To that end, there’s a shower scene that exemplifies how badly the filmmakers mangle what should be a home run story. In the moments prior to it, Eugene makes Allison laugh, even charms her, with his observation — his confidence — that he’s going to love her, and she can figure out if she loves him too. After she flirts with the front desk clerk at the motel where they stop for the night, she decides to take a shower, and invites Eugene to join her. The scene does not require nudity, and Joris-Petrafitte frames Robbie out of the shot completely while only Cole’s chest is visible, while the camera pans slowly up to include his face as their conversation progresses. This is a moment of her strength and his vulnerability, her experience and his innocence, as the two fumble and bicker their way into making love. But what are we watching? Two thirds of the frame dominated by a motel wall. Cole eventually disrobes and we do see them both in the shower as they finally consummate this partnership that has turned ham-fistedly into a romance, but what is the emotion we’re supposed to feel in this moment? Again, a filmmaker doesn’t need to expose his actors to communicate intimacy. But the moment and its staging suggests that this particular filmmaker doesn’t even know what this scene is about — or if it’s not about what the audience is taking away from it, he doesn’t communicate or execute that properly. Nevertheless, Robbie gamely tries to humanize a character that has been defined almost as a myth from the first time we learn about her, and occasionally succeeds. The actress is herself a bit larger than life, so it suits the legend that blows into young Eugene’s town and his life. But because the movie is told as a story from the perspective of Eugene’s sister about Eugene and the adventure Allison took him on, the character lacks an interior life that’s simultaneously understandable, and a bit disappointing. Meanwhile as, honestly, the real legend whose story is being told, Cole cannot quite square the circle of Eugene’s unpredictable decisions, his shifts in feeling and expectation, and quite frankly his many dumb-crook mistakes that only frustrate viewers because the movie doesn’t seem to lean into that lovestruck recklessness. Joris-Peyrafitte and Zwart are both early into their careers as storytellers, so hopefully they will repair the shortcomings of this work before embarking on too many others. But in a Hollywood landscape where a Bonnie and Clyde already exists, much less the Bonnie and Clyde, what new dimensions does this add to that legend, or new elements does it explore? (That said, definitely cast Travis Fimmel in a Richard Arlen biopic; he lacks the gravitas to sell this particular character’s pivot to third-act tenderness, but he’d be a knockout as David Armstrong in a remake of Wings.) The film’s 16mm academy-ratio dream sequences and even its impressive, looming storms simply aren’t enough to sweep audiences along for this bumpy ride, especially when the character motivations (much less choices) are so improbable. Ultimately, Dreamland juggles a lot of familiar narrative tropes without saying anything new, so the best that can be said about this Dust Bowl drama is that it effectively enough captures the details of the period that you’ll want a shower afterward.

"Nov 13, 2020","  Up-and-coming filmmaker Miles Joris-Peyrafitte puts an arthouse twist on Bonnie and Clyde in his latest period piece drama Dreamland. Featuring an all-star cast led by Margot Robbie and Finn Cole, the film follows a teenage bounty hunter in a small Midwestern town stricken by the Great Depression. And while the film boasts some gorgeous cinematography and understated performances from its ensemble cast, its laconic pacing and an overall sense of detachment from the proceedings disengages the audience from the experience, even after the key players are introduced.   Finn stars as a boy named Eugene Evans, who finds himself at odds with the rest of his family and their chosen profession during the Great Depression. When a fugitive young woman named Allison Wells, wanted for murder and a string of bank robberies, stumbles into Eugene's life, the teen is torn between turning her into the law or being drawn into her life of crime as he quickly falls head over heels in love with her. This leads the impressionable youth in a downward spiral of violence and murder as he questions just how innocent she claims to be.   One of the first noticeable things in Dreamland is just how subdued and awkwardly staged the film is. Characters speaking are off-center or even completely out of frame from the viewer, the dialogue is mixed deceptively low, Patrick Higgins' soundtrack is minimalist and Joris-Peyrafitte and cinematographer Lyle Vincent focus more on sweeping landscapes and taking their time in each shot rather than employing frequent cuts. While striking, there is an understated separation between audience engagement and the viewers, with this filmmaking approach almost lending a voyeuristic element to the experience -- we often feel like we're present in somebody's conversation to the side rather than right in the center of it. Random shots interspersed to indicate memory flashes similarly prove more distracting than emotionally meaningful or narratively effective as the story escalates.   Robbie is game in displaying a more vulnerable, nuanced character than her flashier roles and carries much of the film's focus; Cole's Eugene may be the P.O.V. character of sorts for the audience, but just as Eugene's attention is caught by Allison, so is the audience. Co-stars Travis Fimmel and Garrett Hedlund do a serviceable job, but their supporting roles are largely thankless.   As an intimate, independent arthouse film, Dreamland succeeds as a dark exploration of one lonely outcast's twisted coming-of-age but is too detached to be an effectively engaging love story and far too staid to be a gripping crime drama set in the Great Depression-era Midwest. Robbie does her best to keep audiences invested in the characters and the film offers a muted vision of the period and genre, but there simply isn't enough going to keep audiences moving through the molasses-slow narrative pacing and pretentious staging. For those looking to see Robbie and the cast stretch out their acting range in a well-worn period piece, this may be the showcase for it, but, outside of that, there just isn't enough meat on the bone.

"Nov 13, 2020"," Dust, dust and more dust. The parched Texas landscape of “Dreamland,” Miles Joris-Peyrafitte’s Depression-era drama, is chock full of the toxic gray stuff, which billows across fields and coats everything in sight. And then bank robber Allison Wells, aka Margot Robbie, pops onto the screen like a bolt of electricity, or “a bat outta hell,” as one character says — all charisma and brassy sex appeal and old-style glamour. She’s bleeding and she’s dirty, but heck, she’s glamorous. Robbie has always come across as a genuine movie star, but placing her in the 1930s seems to seal the deal. Like the best of the Golden Age goddesses, Robbie can burn up the screen with a mere flash of her blue eyes.  Robbie’s Allison, a fictional character, has obvious echoes of Bonnie Parker, the real-life outlaw played by Faye Dunaway in “Bonnie and Clyde.” Only here, her Clyde is gone; he’s been shot in the aftermath of their last heist, and Allison is all alone, wounded. That’s where Eugene Evans (Finn Cole), the impressionable young man who falls under Allison’s spell, comes in. The story, in fact, is his — narrated by his younger half-sister, Phoebe, decades later. (She’s played as a little girl by Darby Camp, sweet and spunky but not cloying.) We learn that Eugene’s father abandoned him as a young boy, leaving him with a single postcard to read over and over, filling the youth’s head with dreams of an eventual reunion in Mexico. Meanwhile, his mother’s new husband is a hot-tempered sheriff’s deputy (Travis Fimmel ) who runs an oppressive household. Soon after, Eugene finds Allison in his very own barn. It doesn’t take long for him to fall under her spell, and the essence of the film is this seduction. The story itself is unremarkable, even thin — there are no surprising twists or turns, no big lessons in the script by Nicolaas Zwart — but the relationship at its core is hugely entertaining to watch.  And it’s not just the always-impressive Robbie, who also produces the film; Cole is memorable, too, as a young man who struggles before our eyes not only between right and wrong or between lust and honor, but between youth and adulthood. Also to be admired is the evocative period cinematography by Lyle Vincent — you can practically feel the dust smart in your eyes — and the sure-handed direction by Joris-Peyrafitte, all the more noteworthy in that it’s only his second feature and he’s still in his 20s. (At some point, his age won’t be an issue to mention, but not quite yet.) One of the director’s most interesting decisions is to have Eugene’s reality appear in widescreen and his dream world in 8 mm film resembling home videos, showing Allison and Eugene in beachside frolics that may never happen.  But back to that barn, where Eugene makes the momentous decision not to turn Allison in and claim the money, which could save his family’s farm. First, he pulls a bullet out of her leg. He hasn’t made the leap yet to joining her life of crime, to becoming her Clyde (Cole does, by the way, seem to resemble photos of the real Clyde).  Still, it’s clear where this is going. The final stage of the inevitable seduction takes place in a motel room shower, and it’s shot in a distinctive way: for most of the scene we only see Eugene. The effect of this, one of the film’s standout scenes along with a vividly choreographed bank robbery and a beautifully rendered climactic confrontation, is to focus more intensively on the battle happening in Eugene’s soul (and body.) At this point, he’s already so in love with Allison that he seems more than willing to make himself accept her lies. “I’m not a killer,” Allison keeps insisting. But even that rather dubious claim is not the real point. She is killing Eugene, before our eyes. “Dreamland,” a Paramount release, has been rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America “for some violence, language and sexuality/nudity.” Running time: 98 minutes.

"Nov 13, 2020"," “Dreamland” tells a story we've heard many times before, blatantly displaying its influence for all to see but never quite pulling them together into a fully satisfying whole. And yet, it nearly works due to the presence of Margot Robbie in the central role. This news may not come as a surprise—from her first major film role in “The Wolf of Wall Street,” she has been an enormously exciting screen presence who has proven herself to be equally adept with both comedic and serious material in films ranging from “I, Tonya,” “Mary Queen of Scots,” “Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood” and “Birds of Prey.” While it's unlikely that this film will take up too much time in any future Lifetime Achievement Award clip reels, ""Dreamland"" is a testament to the importance of sheer star power to help carry even haphazard material along, at least up to a point. Set in 1935 in a small Texas town hit equally hard by the Great Depression, dust storms, and drought, Eugene (Finn Cole) is a young man living on a dying farm with his mother (Kerry Condon), adorable younger half-sister Phoebe (Darby Camp) and hard-ass stepfather (and police deputy) George (Travis Fimmel)—his biological father (Hans Christopher) fled years earlier with the only subsequent contact being a single postcard sent from Mexico. The only real excitement in his life comes in the form of the stories found in the pulp detective magazines. Things change one night when Eugene goes to the all-but-abandoned barn out back and discovers that serial bank robber Allison Wells (Robbie), who has been on the run following a botched heist that led to the deaths of five people, is hiding there with a bullet in her leg. He tends to her wound and listens to her side of the story—sure, she robbed the banks but it was in protest of the same banks that took away her own family’s home and she insists that she did not kill anyone. Eugene sympathizes with her plight—of course, the fact that she looks like she just stepped out of one of his lurid stories helps a little—and he begins trying to do what he can to help her out, ranging from sneaking her food and a dress to slipping into the police station to steal evidence implicating her. What she really wants is for him to get her a car so that she can flee to Mexico. When the time comes, he winds up going with her, fueled with dreams of a more exciting life with the woman he has fallen for—although she makes it clear that her feelings towards him are not romantic in the slightest, at least at first, she is not above using them to her advantage when the situation arises. Right from the start, it's obvious that screenwriter Nicolaas Zwart and director Miles Joris-Peyrafitte’s are positioning their film as a tribute to the early works of filmmaker Terrence Malick, especially “Days of Heaven,” which shares with it such elements as a Depression-era setting, lovers on the run following a crime (which Malick also utilized in “Badlands”), narration from the main character’s younger sister (voiced by Lola Kirke) and plenty of scenes clearly shot during the so-called “golden hour” to lend a sense a grandeur to the otherwise bleak surroundings. However, there is a fine line between “homage” and “uninspired imitation,” and this film constantly finds itself tripping over it. While Malick was able to transform those elements into sheer cinematic poetry, here they feel more like clunky affectations that fail to distract from the material's increasingly cliched nature. There are a number of other flaws as well. The film’s key relationship between Allison and Eugene never quite works because while the former is enough of a live-wire to keep things lively whenever she is around, Eugene is frankly a bit of a bore, making the later scenes in which it appears that Allison is developing genuine feelings for him seem extremely unlikely. This is especially evident during what is easily the film’s most bizarre sequence, an extended shower scene that seems like a refugee from a Skinemax extravaganza that goes on for so long that it feels like an entirely different kind of golden hour. Not only is the scene longer than most showers, it comes so late in the proceedings that it grinds the story’s momentum to a near-halt at precisely the moment when it should be building to its inevitably over-the-top climax. And yet, while “Dreamland” constantly struggles to rise above the level of the aggressively mediocre, Robbie (who also served as one of the co-producers) is doing everything she can to keep up interest, and she does a lot more in this regard than most other actors might have been able to muster in her position. Even though the trajectory of the film and her character are never really in doubt, she brings enough of an individual stamp to the material to make it seem a little less cut-and-dried than it actually is. If nothing else, “Dreamland” affirms Robbie’s abilities both as an actress and as a movie star of the highest order. Of course, the same thing could be said for nearly all of her movies and in many cases, they also happen to be better films as well.

"Nov 13, 2020"," Bonnie and Clyde were probably two of the most notorious criminals of the great depression error who died together in 1934.  However, have you ever wondered what would happen to Bonnie without Clyde?  What if she was only slightly wounded, hiding, a fugitive from the law? What if you were a young man living in poverty with your family in the dust bowl of America? What if you stumbled across this supposed wounded Bonnie?  What would you do?  Would you help her or turn her in for reward money?  This is the moral dilemma facing Eugene Evans (Finn Cole; Animal Kingdom) in Miles Joris-Peyrafitte's (As You Are) Dreamland. Allison Wells (Margot Robbie; Suicide Squad) and her partner were notorious bank robbers during the 1930s.  They were known in several states and supposedly had killed people.  However, it all went wrong one day and as they were leaving a bank along with the hostages, a shootout occurred leaving one young girl dead.  As police chased the duo through the Texas desert, Allison while her partner fired at authorities.  In the middle of nowhere, Allison stops as she realizes her partner was dying from his wounds.  She also was well aware she was wounded as she fled on foot. Eugene was a fairly innocent young man (aside from the petty theft he and his friend would commit on occasion) whose half-sister, Phoebe (Darby Camp; Big Little Lies), adored him.  On the other hand, his stepfather, George (Travis Fimmel; Vikings), was very hard on him, making Eugene dream of leaving and heading to Mexico to find his real father.  When Eugene finds Allison hiding in the family barn his first thought is to turn her in for the $10,000 reward but she convinces him otherwise with the promise of $20,000 when he gets her to Mexico.  Taken with her beauty, Eugene helps Allison avoid capture and leaves with her on their mutual quest for freedom. The New Mexico landscape offers the magnificent, yet isolating terrain needed to mimic the Dustbowl back in the 1930s.  The miles of nothingness add to the feelings of desperation that both Allison and Eugene encounter.  Director Joris-Peyrafitte so beautifully incorporates the landscape into the story that it could easily be a character unto itself.  As the viewer, you instinctively want to cover your mouth when the sandstorm comes raging through leaving everything dark and dreary. Robbie is making a career of portraying the bad girl whose looks and charm make her seductive to even the most hardened of hearts.  Interestingly, though the basic premises of her characters are the same, they all have a distinctive feel…Harley Quinn, Tonya Harding, Naomi Lapaglia, and now Allison Wells.  Cole brings a certain naivete to Eugene which makes it easy to see how he could easily be taken in by Allison.  Also, solidifying herself as the face of young Hollywood is Camp, who shines as Phoebe.  She is one of the only reason's Eugene almost considers staying in his less than desirable situation. Dreamland has all the elements of an interesting story but, sadly, doesn't fully develop any of the plot points that are introduced in the 98-minute movie.  Robbie's Allison obviously has a backstory, but it is never delved into because the focus is really meant to be on Eugene.  I suspect writer Nicolaas Zwart (Riverdale) could have been rather creative with Allison's past, but we will never know for sure. While Dreamland has some wonderful performances, it needed a better script to keep the audience engaged.  What could have probably been an Oscar-worthy film ends up being merely okay and not very memorable.

"Nov 13, 2020"," As filmgoers, many of us have lived vicariously through the misdeeds of mischievous or even downright diabolical characters for eons. That is the beauty of fictional storytelling in any form: allowing a person to participate in events without crossing the line into criminal actions themselves. It has been a cherished pastime for generations, and in Dreamland, our lead character is teetering on broaching this threshold of reality. It’s 1935 in a tiny Texas town under siege by a continuing depression coupled with a seemingly never-ending drought. Eugene Evans (Finn Cole) was abandoned by his father at a young age, leaving the boy to grow up pining for excitement by admiring while simultaneously admonishing the actions of the era’s criminals. His story is told via voice-over narration from his half-sister Phoebe, as she explains the fate of her brother once he crosses paths with the infamous bank robber, Allison Wells (Margot Robbie). Eugene finds Allison holed up in his parents’ barn – mother Olivia (Kerry Condon) and his deputy stepfather George (Travis Fimmel) – and nursing a bullet hole in the leg. Initially planning to turn her in to collect the $10,000 bounty, Eugene finds himself smitten with Allison and eventually even warming up to the prospects of joining her on a trek to Mexico where they can live as banditos on the lam. With her questionable promise of $20,000 on hand for incentive. Visually, director Miles Joris-Peyrafitte and cinematographer Lyle Vincent perfectly capture the majestic desperation of a bleak Texas landscape amidst dire circumstances. Every shot cascading across any landscape is sweeping in grandeur and a harsh foreboding. The aesthetics to shooting this period piece infuses Eugene’s story with a sense of our own understanding, the bitter Texas backdrop assisting the audience with coming to terms with exactly why Eugene chooses the path he’s on. This character accessory proves necessary because the characters, though engaging, could stand to be a bit more fleshed out on the page. Finn Cole does an affable job as the lead, meshing wild-eyed innocence with an underlying thirst for danger. As the film slowly builds, so does his character’s confidence and arc, and the actor morphs into a bit of a scamp. Especially as the relationship between Eugene and George begins to take center stage (Fimmel does much with his limited screen time, and is always a welcome asset to any production). Several moments in the final act, hints of that late 80s Christian Slater sardonic glee comes shining through his eyes and we finally see both Eugene and Cole’s full potential. While Cole does eventually get there, Margot Robbie is as indisputably enrapturing as ever. Very few actresses of today can so exquisitely dominate a frame with nary a hint of dialogue or character development as Margot Robbie does. The moment Allison is discovered in the barn, we completely relate to Eugene’s change of heart and circumstance despite the obvious question of Allison’s true allegiance as the film rolls. Robbie’s Allison emulates the gloss and allure of the life of a bank robber, providing exactly what Eugene and the audience needs to justify the potential abandonment of family and all that he holds dear in his heart.",NEUTRAL
"Nov 12, 2020"," The myth of Bonnie and Clyde dies hard, especially because of Arthur Penn’s romanticized crime film, which hit screens with a splatter in 1967. That movie’s special mix of Hollywood chic and frenzied violence rekindled the legend and kept it smoldering. Americans love their outlaws and really love them running wild, partly because the world’s most powerful country clings to its foundational us-versus-them identity. The hollow genre exercise “Dreamland” is the latest to take its lead from America’s favorite bandit couple, even as it tries to chart its own course. This time the focus is on a 17-year-old, Eugene (the very adult Finn Cole), whose failed family farm is part of a larger national catastrophe. It’s the 1930s and times are tough, or so the movie insists, even if the production design, costumes, etc. show otherwise. Eugene has the usual back story of an absent dad and stern stepfather (a fine Travis Fimmel). And, like every human to walk the earth (and most who crop up in fiction), Eugene has dreams. Eugene wants to help his family, though apparently not enough to work, preferring to wander and read pulp magazines. The promise of a hefty reward for a bank robber, Allison Wells (a criminally wasted Margot Robbie), seems to show him the way, but mostly puts his fanciful imagination into further overdrive. He decides he will find Allison, a plan that takes a far-fetched turn after she’s wounded and takes refuge in his family’s barn. The movie more or less writes itself after she hikes her skirt and he tends her wound. Dust swirls and so do passions, and before long this unremarkable pipsqueak and outlaw woman have become a wholly unbelievable couple on the run. It’s a lot of hooey and might have been at least tolerable if the movie had been rougher, meaner, tighter, and if the filmmakers — the writer is Nicolaas Zwart, the director is Miles Joris-Peyrafitte — had never watched a Terrence Malick movie. There are honeyed landscapes, still-life shots of crepuscular, peopleless rooms and a voice-over (by Lola Kirke), which tries to elevate Eugene’s story with penny-ante psychology and a splash of mythopoetic fancy. “The land turned on us,” the narrator says early on, pinning the Dust Bowl on Mother Nature, “and then the banks came.” So Eugene hides in the barn to read Black Mask magazine and “daydream about his destiny.” Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

"Nov 12, 2020"," A sensitive, soberly rendered and ultimately flawed film about growing up in the parched plains of the Texas Panhandle, Dreamland is an uneasy mix of Terence Malick’s Days of Heaven and Badlands, with a pinch of Arthur Penn’s Bonnie and Clyde, starring the always probing, often underrated Margot Robbie as a bank-robbing vigilante. She’s one of the exclusive new breed of actors struggling to maintain careers at a time when good scripts and directors are hard to find, proving that if you want to put anything valuable on the screen today, you have to produce it yourself. Dreamland doesn’t quite work, but she deserves an A for effort. Set during the Great Depression, the narrative centers on the disenfranchised families of homesteaders who forged their way west to stake claims to new patches of dirt hoping for a fresh-start to a better way of life. The Bakers pray for rain, but the crops fail, and Eugene’s disillusioned, alcoholic father deserts his family, heads for greener pastures in Mexico, and is never seen again. By the age of 17, Eugene (Finn Cole) reluctantly finds himself still trapped in the crude cabin his father built, bullied by the tough, resentful and mean-spirited local  police deputy his mother remarried, and a baby sister named Phoebe (Darby Camp) who adores her stepbrother and serves as a silent witness to his growing misery. Eugene dreams of fleeing the Dust Bowl for greener pastures himself, but has no idea how to do it until fate connects him with Allison Wells (Margot Robbie), the featured star of a most-wanted poster with a gunshot wound in her thigh and a $10,000 reward on her head. He hides her in the deserted barn with a plan to turn her in, claim the reward money and seize the chance to finance a flight to freedom from his humdrum life. But when she uses her sexy guile to seduce the naive country boy, convincing him to steal his stepfather’s pickup truck for a getaway vehicle to escape the law, Eugene’s new career as a bounty hunter weakens fast. Eventually, these two mutually mixed-up and unhappy products of the cruel, corrupt times they live in become unlikely lovers, replete with an awkward and completely unnecessary nude shower scene that might delight Margot Robbie fans but does nothing to invest the film with the badly needed character development it lacks. The relationship, both subtle and complex, changes the lives of everyone on screen while remaining stubbornly unconvincing. The first half of the film concentrates on Eugene’s transformation from unsophisticated ignorance to social awareness and political relevance, framed by the turbulence of a violent Texas sandstorm. But Dreamland goes awry in the second section, when director Miles Joris-Peyrafitte dices up the narrative into different time frames that wreak havoc on continuity. The story takes place in 1935, but is narrated 20 years late by Eugene’s little sister from memory, in an attempt to keep his legend alive. The result is not always coherent, and the final shoot-out is too clumsy to generate much impact. The result makes the acting seem uneven, largely because of the inert direction as well as a muted screenplay by Nicolaas Zwart that would benefit from a bit of tweaking. The thing I like best about Dreamland is the camerawork by Lyle Vincent, who admirably recreates a calming canvas of hardscrabble rural ambience in the form of rich orange sunsets and splendid peppermint skies. (Filmed entirely in New Mexico, which is vastly more beautiful than Texas.) Ms. Robbie is the glamorous centerpiece, but she generously turns the film over to impressive newcomer Finn Cole as Eugene, who gets a crash course in sex, love, and crime. Good as they are, I’m sorry to say their romance is superficial, the narration is regrettably one-dimensional, and Dreamland is close but no cigar.

"Nov 11, 2020"," The Times is committed to reviewing theatrical film releases during the COVID-19 pandemic. Because moviegoing carries risks during this time, we remind readers to follow health and safety guidelines as outlined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and local health officials. The new Margot Robbie vehicle “Dreamland” seems to be about legends, the price of escape, maybe unreliable narrators — but ends up not saying much about any of them. The Dust Bowl drama  finds Eugene (Finn Cole) longing to leave behind his small Texas town. He lives with his mother, young sister, Phoebe, and lawman stepfather George (Travis Fimmel of “Vikings”) on their ruined farm. He wastes his days on petty larceny with his apparently Native American pal Jo (Stephen Dinh) and ingesting exciting tales of the rebel heroes of the day: gangsters. Lo and behold, a fugitive bank robber shows up in his family’s barn — Allison Wells, played by Robbie. Injured Allison easily enlists Eugene’s aid; he patches her up and plans to help her escape to Mexico in exchange for $20,000; quite a load of suds to an average Joe. He falls for her, of course, though there’s no reason to believe she actually has $20,000; it’s what far-away-eyed Eugene wants. Allison seems awfully composed and well-spoken for a fugitive suffering from blood loss who claims to have come from similar downtrodden roots to those of Eugene’s family. She also claims to have never killed anyone, despite her notorious legend. That’s sure to come up later. She’s pretty darn cool as Eugene removes a bullet from her leg without anesthesia. Luckily, she’s an extremely quick healer. And about as perfectly made up and coiffed a gunshot-wounded bank robber as you’ll ever find hiding in an abandoned Dust Bowl barn. We dip a toe into her back story, but no more. What little we learn about her is unreliable anyway as the knowing, 20-years-later narration by grown Phoebe (voiced by Lola Kirke) assures us. In fact, perhaps because this is all ostensibly Phoebe’s imagined reconstruction of events, everything that happens between Allison and Eugene has a cursory feel, except for one vivid bonding scene in a hotel bathroom. Moments aren’t deeply investigated, and neither are motivations or emotions. Ultimately, “Dreamland” feels like the story of a rather selfish kid (Eugene) consumed by unrealistic escapism, with little interest in thinking important things through.  That might be from where the film’s title comes — that he’s in Dreamland. He imagines a better life but isn’t awake to the realities of what it takes to get there. Not that his daily struggle is vividly depicted: How Dust Bowl families survived isn’t the film’s concern. When Eugene risks his stepfather’s job on a whim, it doesn’t communicate land, just how disastrous that outcome would be.  Even grown Phoebe’s narration yields little. She says she’s setting the record straight, but she’s talking about things she couldn’t know. And while her assessment of her brother isn’t exactly worshipful, it’s not critical or insightful, either.",NEGATIVE

"Nov 10, 2020"," Eugene’s (Finn Cole) father used to say about their Bismarck home, “This place is cursed.” It didn’t matter that it’s where he and his wife Olivia (Kerry Condon) settled with a bunch of other families. He simply never thought any good could come from trying to make a life there. So he left. Olivia and Eugene stayed. Dust storms swept through the land destroying crops, farms, and hope. And the banks arrived with foreclosure after foreclosure. Olivia Baker eventually became Olivia Evans, her new husband George (Travis Fimmel) became a deputy sheriff, and along came little Phoebe (Darby Camp) as they still struggled to survive. That’s all before a dangerous outlaw entered the frame with a $10,000 bounty that everyone saw as solution. Could Allison Wells (Margot Robbie) be the person to change their lives? Could her capture inject enough money into their community to hold the creditors at bay for one or, maybe, a handful of homesteaders in desperate need? Or was she simply one more example that proved the cursed nature of that place—especially for the Baker bloodline? Because as easily as a now seventeen-year-old Eugene and his best friend Jo (Stephen Dinh) might change their fortune by finding her before the authorities, that outlaw might find him first and draw him into something else entirely. Comic book criminals and their adventurous lifestyles have always enamored Eugene. Appeal to that fantasy by offering another life and he may fall victim to much worse than a dust storm or predatory banks. Dreamland’s director Miles Joris-Peyrafitte and screenwriter Nicolaas Zwart know this to be true, but they also understand that Eugene wouldn’t see it that way—not at first. Therein lies the title, Dreamland, and this idea that this teen may be able to escape this dead-end place that drove his father away two decades earlier. After all, he’s always wondered what it would be like to travel to Mexico and look for that man on the Gulf Coast. So destiny appears to be shining on him when he finds Allison (Robbie) holed-up in the family barn with a gunshot wound asking for help in heading south of the border. And if he can also collect the reward, that would be gravy on top that he can mail back home after escaping. That’s Eugene’s dream anyway. Or, at least what his sister Phoebe believes it to be. Because despite Eugene being the ostensible lead – this isn’t actually his story. It’s hers. As narrated by Phoebe (Lola Kirke), she recounts her own version of those indelible weeks that changed her family forever. She’s giving her half-brother the benefit of the doubt with some of these details, and perhaps, adding a layer of romance that might not have been there to help swallow the pill of a harsh reality yet to come. For instance, she imagines that Allison recruits Eugene by telling him what he needs to hear: she’s not a killer; she robs banks to avenge her own foreclosure; and she’s all alone. The liberties Phoebe takes are both authentic and idyllic. She gives her brother the comic-book treatment with complex emotions, uncertain motivations, and potential love that moves beyond the violence, deceit, and stakes of what it truly means to be an outlaw. Dreams never quite come true the way you imagine them, and this is no exception. To choose this life isn’t without its sacrifices. Whether it’s news that Jo’s family is being run out of town or a single postcard from his father signaling the impossibility of ever finding him, Eugene is dealt blow after blow to his hopes. So he hides beneath the possibility of being a bounty hunter and saving the day. He embraces the possibility of being a knight in shining armor for a beautiful woman-in-need because it provides purpose beyond drowning in his own helplessness.  Cole embodies that role very well, shifting between teenage innocence and an unyielding desire to be seen as a man. His character can talk himself out of some jams, and wonders if he could even find personal salvation without hurting anyone in the process. But Allison isn’t some runaway to protect. She’s a criminal. Whether or not she pulled the trigger, she’s been accused of gunning down a young girl the same age of Phoebe during a shootout. Eugene isn’t thinking about the ensuing collateral damage. He’s infatuated by her occupation and her beauty regardless of whether he’s aware that she’ll do whatever is necessary to stay out of the sheriff’s crosshairs. For her part, Robbie is a standout supporting player who wrestles with the truths of her character and the fantasies she concocts in order to avoid them. The role isn’t as big as you might expect, but Robbie’s character isn’t just a throwaway piece of Eugene’s unraveling. She is her own person with palpable fears, regrets, and room to be more than an opportunistic, cold schemer. And even though this complexity may be a narrator’s liberty to absolve Eugene of what happens, it feels real precisely because Phoebe (as the filmmakers’ stand-in) renders it as such. So we also care about Allison’s fate with and without him. Those stakes are essential even as this ends up being a rather familiar take on a type of story we’ve seen many times. It helps that the cinematography and production design are all top-notch because we’re able to believe this environment is so lived-in, but Dreamland doesn’t rise to the level of outlaw stories like Ain’t Them Bodies Saints.  It is an attractive deviation that perhaps skews younger with its coming-of-age nostalgia overtaking the plot’s dramatic intrigue. It’s why Joris-Peyrafitte and Zwart can push Eugene and Allison so hard, so fast at the end. Because rather than need time to unpack the duo’s impulsive acts; they just need youthful passion to move past the pain.

"Nov 8, 2020"," After securing an undeserved Oscar nomination for Bombshell in January and stumbling through the misguided Birds of Prey the following month, the actress adds to her wildly inconsistent career with the lifeless drama Dreamland. Little more than a white, sanitized, Great Depression-set remix of 2019’s mostly excellent Queen & Slim, Miles Joris-Peyrafitte’s film stars Robbie as Allison Wells, a fugitive bank robber who holes up in the rural Texas barn belonging to the family of Eugene Evans (Finn Cole, Peaky Blinders). A young man obsessed with detective stories and escaping his boring small town life, Eugene is the ideal mark for Allison and, upon discovering her hiding spot, quickly falls under her spell and proceeds to perform dopey acts of loyalty to win her love. So that screenwriter Nicolaas Zwart doesn’t have to develop more characters than he can handle, Eugene’s stepfather George (Travis Fimmel, Warcraft) just so happens to be the local lawman most obsessed with capturing Allison and — gasp! — has no idea she’s sheltered within sight of his very own bed. Though the material is rote to a fault and bereft of surprises, Joris-Peyrafitte directs as if the Academy — or at least some mid-range critics groups — might take notice. The visuals are consistently crisp, especially for a Dust Bowl setting, and whichever effects team designed the film’s big dust storm sequence should be recruited for the next big superhero flick. But none of the technical achievements can compensate for Cole’s wet-blanket acting, Robbie’s odd lack of charisma, and a script uninterested in sustaining viewer attention. All involved may think they’re adding something new to the long tradition of outlaw narratives, but at best they’ve merely cobbled together details from better films. ",NEGATIVE

The story of a teenager living through an early 20th century Texas agricultural drought, saddled with fatherly abandonment baggage, stuck and destitute in a dusty boring town, and stumbling into the scenario of not only living his dream but becoming an outlaw alongside a seductive and dangerous Margot Robbie sounds like pure wish-fulfillment. However, the approach from director Miles Joris-Peyrafitte on Dreamland (working alongside screenwriter Nicolaas Zwart) has enough intelligence not to glorify the obvious Bonnie and Clyde dynamic, going against romanticism to show that the life of a bank-robbing gunslinger is not all it’s cracked up to be. And neither is running away from home (presumably underage/barely 18 – real age is never stated to my knowledge – as the boy’s lie of being 25 is seen through by her and audiences alike prompting him to be repeatedly called “boy”) to start a life of crime and sex with Margot Robbie. Intriguingly, Dreamland is also narrated by the boy’s younger sister Phoebe (Darby Camp in the flesh and Lola Kirke undetectable with her Southern drawl as the 20 years later voiceover relaying what she believes to be the ins and outs of what really happened). At times (most notably in the beginning when the film is setting its plot up) there is an unnecessary amount of narration, but the creative choice itself allows for a mythological sheen to a fictional female outlaw. Hearing adult Phoebe talk about the legend of Allison Wells (Margot Robbie) gives off the vibe that she’s a legitimate badass, someone not to play around with or doublecross, and enough fabled mystery to drive the lingering question of whether she’s actually a murderer or if it’s all a tall tale propagated by law enforcement for whatever reason. That’s better left uncovered for yourself, but what can be said is that Margot Robbie takes the right amount of quirkiness from her portrayal of Harley Quinn, her natural allure, and some grit fighting through a bullet wounded leg injury, concocting a character with unclear true intentions. Meanwhile, young Eugene Evans (Finn Cole), as excited as he is at the proposition of ignoring the rumors and pulling off a heist with her financially lucrative for the both of them (his family might lose their home and it’s clear he does care about Phoebe, but he desperately wants to get away and track down his real father who sent him a postcard), also becomes an object of manipulation. A point is made that Eugene is having rumbling hormonal reactions to the beauty and presence of Allison. He’s pervy and is quickly willing to take her to a hiding spot to bathe and nurse her healing leg, terribly hiding his inability to not spy on her undressing. Eugene’s virginity and horniness is something Allison incorporates into her playbook (she needs assistance for one final job and to get across the border), with both performers demonstrating thick sexual tension through extended dialogue exchanges and multiple long takes. There’s a shower sequence that is not only lengthy but visually gets into the headspace of both characters proving this to be a well-shot film as well. If the ending proves to be somewhat predictable, Dreamland and cinematographer Lyle Vincent make up for it with a striking aerial shot for the finale. Then there’s the Bismarck setting itself with blinding dust storms and appropriate barren landscapes that are exquisitely captured. Getting back to the point, whether Allison is a killer or lying about her innocence almost doesn’t matter (although I will assure you that you get your answer) because we are also witnessing her mold him into a criminal. The sexual attraction is just more of an element Allison plays to her advantage in escaping, sometimes pulling back and reminding Eugene she’s never going to actually romantically love him back the way he has fallen for her like a puppy dog. She’s grieving something and dealing with the circumstance in her own way while doing whatever is necessary to survive. We don’t even know if the stories surrounding her are real, just that she’s also in a bad spot, but we are rooting for them to legitimately fall for each other. For Eugene, he’s becoming an outlaw alongside her and has a dream girl, although, Dreamland, despite the title, doesn’t treat this as a wish-fulfillment but rather a cautionary tale about the dangers of tantalizing fantasy becoming a gritty and morally corrupting reality. The third act feels rushed and most supporting characters are forgettable, but the complicated tale of criminality and low-key taboo love bound together by excellent performances makes this dream lucid.",POSITIVE

"Jul 12, 2020",Most of Dreamland isn't about chase scenes between cops and robbers. It's about what can happen when people steal things more valuable than money -- hearts and trust.,POSITIVE

"Nov 28, 2019"," Though its events extend further backwards and forwards in time, Dreamland is set primarily in 1935, while the Great Depression is in full swing and rural Bismark in Texas is beset by dust bowl conditions destructive of all farming efforts. In other words, this is a small-town community where dreams have long since dried up. When wanted bank robber and killer Allison Wells (Margot Robbie) limps into town, most merely see the reward on her head, but young Eugene Evans (Finn Cole) is seduced by the stories she tells of romance, fame, freedom and self-made fortune - sexy stories of the American Dream. Dreamland is a film of stories: not just the ""Detective Stories"" which Eugene avidly reads to fuel his fantasies, or the multiple, contradictory accounts of what happened during Allison's last heist, or the framing story about Eugene, his family history and his collision with, Allison which is narrated decades later by Eugene's loving younger half-sister Phoebe (Darby Camp, with voiceover by Lola Kirke); but also the cinematic tradition of Great American outlaw stories (Billy the Kid, Bonnie and Clyde, Gun Crazy, Badlands) which informs the textures of this particular tale. In pursuit of the father who abandoned him aged five for a supposedly better life on the Mexican coast, and in flight from the oppressive thumb of stepfather (and local police deputy) George (Travis Fimmel), Eugene finds his growing disappointment and disillusion momentarily intersecting with Allison's on a road where choices, if you are lucky enough to have them in the first place, are always a burden. As such the film itself, directed by Miles Joris-Peyrafitte, (As You Are, 2016) and written by Nicolaas Zwart, comes with a bittersweet vision of America barrelling down a two-lane road to nowhere, where dreams of sun and surf and sex are offset by the harsher realities of dust and mud and blood, and where, as the landscape is inscribed with corruption, ambiguity and guilt, the best kind of life for which one can hope is simply to be remembered, however sketchily, with affection. It's an elegiac portrait (with Malickian colourings) as much of today's America as yesteryear's, in a land where every dream comes with a cost, and every story is built on tragedy.",POSITIVE
"May 24, 2019"," Margot Robbie is the rare talent who works both as a big movie star and a serious actress. Part of what made her turn in I, Tonya so gripping was her ability to switch from a big performance to a small one in a matter of seconds. That same talent is on display here in Mile Joris-Peyrafitte’s Dust Bowl drama Dreamland. Robbie plays Alison Wells, one half of a bank robbing duo in the 1930s a la Bonnie and Clyde. But the story starts with her fall rather than her ascension, after the death of her partner, and that’s partially because it isn’t really her story. We’re introduced to Alison through the young Eugene Evans (Finn Cole), as he hears of her crimes on the radio before discovering her in her barn, afflicted with a bullet wound in her leg. Naturally, he takes to her, or at least idealizes her in such a way that her status as a fugitive comes second to her charm and beauty. It’s fun watching Alison manipulate Eugene. The script rarely clues us in on what she’s actually feeling, letting Robbie plunge into a really delicious realm of ambiguity. Complicating matters, Eugene’s father George (Travis Fimmel) is part of the small town’s police force, putting a dark shadow on the forced secrecy of Eugene’s protection of, let alone affection for, a wanted criminal. Nicholaas Zwart’s script knows where all the dramatic beats need to go in this 90-minute story, even if his dialogue isn’t always on the mark. The performances across the ensemble are overall solid, but only Robbie is able to sell some of the script’s more difficult to swallow lines with any form of panache. The story itself takes its time, with the stakes laid out early on and then left alone to marinate for a little too long before Eugene and Alison start taking matters into their own hands. That said, the third act sneaks up on you, and the story, as simple as it is, evolves into something worth caring about before the fates of these characters is decided.  The film’s coming-of-age themes don’t go farther than skin deep, but being executed through a western crime saga, they don’t really need to for the story to resonate. Eugene’s arc is simple: he has to discover who he is as he learns that the world isn’t so black and white. However, the lack of resolve to dig further into what this journey means for Eugene distinguishes Dreamland as a merely good film, not a great one. Even so, Joris-Peyrafitte operates like a great director. His view of the Dust Bowl, as well as that of cinematographer Lyle Vincent, is truly breathtaking. From the gorgeous vistas to the frightening reality of oncoming storms—which are realized via very convincing, engrossing visual effects, I might add—Dreamland uses its desert location for all its worth. But the camera is wielded smartly throughout the more intimate scenes as well, with framing that draws the eye during long takes of characters speaking, or even sometimes not saying much at all. And that’s largely where the film’s power comes from. Its aspects that make this story necessary to be told on film help make up for what the writing and themes lack. Dreamland is so economical and discreetly grandiose that it looks like it had a bigger budget than it probably did. While certainly not everything, there is a good yarn here. The film as a whole may not carry the subtle layers an actress like Robbie can bring to an infectious character like Alison, but it’s certainly better for having her there to do so. As much of a mixed bag as Dreamland can be, by the end, it’s hard not to get swept up in its dramatic storm.",POSITIVE
"May 19, 2019"," While at this year’s Tribeca Film Festival, I had the opportunity to screen four narratives, each with their own successes and each with their own take on the coming-of-age storyline. Georgetown was one of the films I was most excited to see at this year’s festival. Christoph Waltz (or C. Waltz as he is credited in the film) being a brilliant thespian in front of the camera, I couldn’t wait to see what he would bring to the screen from behind the camera. He was careful in his answers to reporters on the red carpet, taking his time to carefully answer each question, never giving too much away. A wise choice, as Georgetown is a film best experienced with little about the film discussed – which now presents my challenge here.Georgetown, written by David Auburn, is inspired by true events. A would be socialite works his way up the ladder, mostly through the marriage to his much older counterpart Elsa Brecht (Vanessa Redgrave). Yet, what seems to be the epitome of changing one’s rank, he is charged in murdering his wife for her life and inheritance. While not a new idea for cinema, the basis on some truth makes for an engaging film, one that presented incredible potential.Not only directing, but starring as well, Waltz delivers a dynamic performance both on and off screen. The tension he is able to build within the film grips and captivates the audience. You will ask yourself  “did he do it” more than once while watching Georgetown. The volley between guilty and innocent perfectly played, no resolution revealed until the ball finally drops.Waltz is perfection, his performance delectably brilliant. You want to hate him and come to your own conclusions about what is happening on screen, but he commands your attention, guiding your confusion down every avenue with ease. In both avenues, director and star, he is a seasoned participant, no sign of novice ever breaking through. His counterparts, Annette Bening and Vanessa Redgrave, round out this stellar cast, each bringing strength and questionability to everything happening on screen.Georgetown is a must-see if you are a fan of Waltz’s work, but it is also a must-see for the power new up-and-coming directors are bringing to audiences. One of the most anticipated films for myself this season, I left felling completely enthralled with the story, its characters, and its outcome.Good Posture – Dolly WellsGood Posture (2019) – source: Tribeca Film FestivalThe Tribeca Film Festival made a conscious decision this year to consciously raise the amount of female directors showcasing work at the festival this year. With 50% of the competition lead by female directors, there is an outstanding amount of work being brought to audiences that may never have had the opportunity before. Good Posture, from director and writer Dolly Wells, not only speaks to the festival’s inclusion but to good filmmaking as well.Good Posture was one of the earlier films I had the chance to see at this year’s Tribeca Film Festival, and one I fondly look back on. An endearing coming-of-age story, it is delivered with sincere wit and genuine emotion, giving viewers not one, but two characters to fall in love with. It was one that captivated my attention on synopsis alone, the idea surrounding it intriguing from the get go.While Good Posture is a film about growing up and the people who guide you along the way, it is about so much more, bringing in the ability to discover one’s own self and a deep rooted need for connection. It follows a young girl who practically does nothing for herself. She does not go outside, she does not buy milk, she does not cook, she doesn’t even bring a towel to the shower with her. When her boyfriend breaks up with her, rendering her homeless, she is taken in by friends of her father, ones, unbeknownst to her, who have known her since she was a small child.As Julia (Emily Mortimer) disappears, becoming the recluse she is perceived as, Lillian (Grace Van Patten) is left on her own, forced to begin to do things for herself. Yet, the need for connection is one of the strongest desires in human nature, Julia and Lillian start to reach out to one another, communicating through a journal. What they find, though, is something more than could ever be communicated.When the film began, the first thing that secured my attention was the amazing soundtrack. This beat and rhythm carries throughout the film – both score and song – heightening the moment and mood. There is a quiet intensity coupled with a kick in the step. What it also does is maintain the pace of the film while also cleverly filling in as parts of the film’s transitions.Where the script and execution of Good Posture succeeds on every note, so too do the performances in the film, especially Patten and Mortimer. There is a raw truth when Patten is on screen, a depth that she brings to her character, one that rings out the loudest in her moments alone. Mortimer, while not on the screen as often, still radiates, filling the room, every ounce of her screen time matching Patton. Their dual depth, many times preserved through nonverbals and facial expressions, gives way to an exquisite chemistry, a beautifully constructed bond between them.Good Posture was one of my favorite films in the entire festival. It was a last minute add on before diving into the week, one that I am grateful I had the opportunity to see.Dreamland – Miles Joris-PeyrafitteDreamland (2019) – source: Tribeca Film FestivalWhile not a bad film, there is nothing particularly groundbreaking that makes Dreamland stand out compared to all the other films premiering at this year’s festival. Honestly, I had hoped for more – more action, more intrigue, more intensity. I never feared for Allison Wells (Margot Robbie), her discovery meaning certain death. I also never wondered where the story was going, the predictability snatching any grip the film may have had on its viewers.There was this Bonnie and Clyde vibe that did reverberate, the chance that Allison and Eugene (Finn Cole, best known for Peaky Blinders) might launch into a murderous crime spree a possibility at any moment. Yet, the intensity of this scenario never comes to fruition, leaving it just that – a vibe. As of this moment, I am still unsure if this was an intent that was never fully realized, or an avoidance of being too closely similar to Bonnie and Clyde, a need to make it different and unique. Either way, succumbing to this vibe may have given the film its extra boost.There was a wasted potential in the slow burn of these characters and their journey, there lacked a depth in each of these characters, most with basic or lacking a drive strong enough to support many of their actions. Sometimes with films that come across lackluster, there are performances that can become a film’s redeeming quality; unfortunately, this is not the case with Dreamland. The script and the story bring the performances down, preventing any elevation. Where there could have been intensity in a forbidden potential love, there is none. Even the desperation of finding someone before it is too late is weighed down by the concern nothing will happen.Unfortunately, this was one of the most lackluster films of the festival I had the chance to see. I had been excited for the film, a fan of Margot Robbie’s work up until this point drawing me into the screening. While not every film within a festival will resonate with its audience, it was sad to see one with so much potential fall so short.Low Tide – Kevin McMullinLow Tide (2019) – source: Tribeca Film FestivalLow Tide from writer and director Kevin McMullin, was not a bad film, it was entertaining and it had a solid story. Yet, much like Dreamland, there was just a shine missing, something to make it stand out from the crowd. This was a film I had selected to screen on synopsis alone. There was no hype or built up excitement from any outside factors, just the idea of a small band of boys whose criminal plunders leads them to the discovery of a lifetime. I mean my biggest complaint is really only this, it just felt like something was missing…Low Tide follows the story of a couple local boys living in a vacationer’s paradise. On the shore, where the primary source of income is fishing or cruise directing, they are left to their own devices, seemingly tightly bonded and willing to do what they can and want to make an extra buck – all at the expense of the temporary residents. When one robbery goes wrong, the cops now on their trail, they are only briefly deterred, not only staking the house of a recently deceased local but bringing their brother along. What he discovers soon leads the boys down a path of vulnerability, wealth, and distrust, the small group turning fractures into canyons.I wish I could pinpoint what was missing in the film, what could be changed or added to give it a heightened glow. The story, while solid, followed many of the common tropes of a coming-of-age film, yet the angle which it was presented was nothing viewers haven’t seen before. Boys getting in trouble, one shady, another’s motives questionable. Here too, as in many films before it, there is the brainiac kid and the others finding salvation by following his lead. While the story itself leaned more to the original, the foundation it is built upon did not give it further room to branch out and grow.What I do have to say about the film that did shine through was its young performances. Jaeden Martell, who many will remember from Stephen King’s It: Chapter 1, has a shy, yet confident air to his performance. He owns this character, unafraid to let his performance match and at times surpass the performances of those around him. He is the character your eyes will constantly be drawn to, even when he is not the primary aspect on screen.As Red, Alex Neustaedter brings to mind an essence of Heath Ledger, his looks and hairstyle only heightening the resemblance. There is a strength in his performance that is coupled with his character’s disposed vulnerability. He is constantly fighting with himself on the inside, a drive you constantly see him pushing for a war. He is trying to win the battle, unfortunately choosing the side others disapprove of. There is also a danger, a calm warning as he walks by or enters a room that violence could erupt at any moment.I cannot stress enough that Low Tide is not a bad film, and I would not sway anyone from seeing it. It just needed something more. I can wholeheartedly recommend it on the performances alone, a sampling of the up-and-coming talent that could one day be constant faces on our movie screens.Does content like this matter to you?Become a Member and support film journalism.

Yet, the intensity of this scenario never comes to fruition, leaving it just that – a vibe. As of this moment, I am still unsure if this was an intent that was never fully realized, or an avoidance of being too closely similar to Bonnie and Clyde, a need to make it different and unique. Either way, succumbing to this vibe may have given the film its extra boost.There was a wasted potential in the slow burn of these characters and their journey, there lacked a depth in each of these characters, most with basic or lacking a drive strong enough to support many of their actions.

Yet, much like Dreamland, there was just a shine missing, something to make it stand out from the crowd. This was a film I had selected to screen on synopsis alone. There was no hype or built up excitement from any outside factors, just the idea of a small band of boys whose criminal plunders leads them to the discovery of a lifetime. I mean my biggest complaint is really only this, it just felt like something was missing…Low Tide follows the story of a couple local boys living in a vacationer’s paradise.

The story, while solid, followed many of the common tropes of a coming-of-age film, yet the angle which it was presented was nothing viewers haven’t seen before. Boys getting in trouble, one shady, another’s motives questionable. Here too, as in many films before it, there is the brainiac kid and the others finding salvation by following his lead. While the story itself leaned more to the original, the foundation it is built upon did not give it further room to branch out and grow.What I do have to say about the film that did shine through was its young performances. Jaeden Martell, who many will remember from Stephen King’s It: Chapter 1, has a shy, yet confident air to his performance. He owns this character, unafraid to let his performance match and at times surpass the performances of those around him. He is the character your eyes will constantly be drawn to, even when he is not the primary aspect on screen.As Red, Alex Neustaedter brings to mind an essence of Heath Ledger, his looks and hairstyle only heightening the resemblance. There is a strength in his performance that is coupled with his character’s disposed vulnerability. He is constantly fighting with himself on the inside, a drive you constantly see him pushing for a war. He is trying to win the battle, unfortunately choosing the side others disapprove of. There is also a danger, a calm warning as he walks by or enters a room that violence could erupt at any moment.I cannot stress enough that Low Tide is not a bad film, and I would not sway anyone from seeing it. It just needed something more.

Georgetown is a must-see if you are a fan of Waltz’s work, but it is also a must-see for the power new up-and-coming directors are bringing to audiences. One of the most anticipated films for myself this season, I left felling completely enthralled with the story, its characters, and its outcome. The Tribeca Film Festival made a conscious decision this year to consciously raise the amount of female directors showcasing work at the festival this year. With 50% of the competition lead by female directors, there is an outstanding amount of work being brought to audiences that may never have had the opportunity before. Good Posture, from director and writer Dolly Wells, not only speaks to the festival’s inclusion but to good filmmaking as well.Good Posture was one of the earlier films I had the chance to see at this year’s Tribeca Film Festival, and one I fondly look back on. An endearing coming-of-age story, it is delivered with sincere wit and genuine emotion, giving viewers not one, but two characters to fall in love with. It was one that captivated my attention on synopsis alone, the idea surrounding it intriguing from the get go.While Good Posture is a film about growing up and the people who guide you along the way, it is about so much more, bringing in the ability to discover one’s own self and a deep rooted need for connection. It follows a young girl who practically does nothing for herself. She does not go outside, she does not buy milk, she does not cook, she doesn’t even bring a towel to the shower with her. When her boyfriend breaks up with her, rendering her homeless, she is taken in by friends of her father, ones, unbeknownst to her, who have known her since she was a small child.As Julia (Emily Mortimer) disappears, becoming the recluse she is perceived as, Lillian (Grace Van Patten) is left on her own, forced to begin to do things for herself. Yet, the need for connection is one of the strongest desires in human nature, Julia and Lillian start to reach out to one another, communicating through a journal. What they find, though, is something more than could ever be communicated.When the film began, the first thing that secured my attention was the amazing soundtrack. This beat and rhythm carries throughout the film – both score and song – heightening the moment and mood. There is a quiet intensity coupled with a kick in the step. What it also does is maintain the pace of the film while also cleverly filling in as parts of the film’s transitions.Where the script and execution of Good Posture succeeds on every note, so too do the performances in the film, especially Patten and Mortimer. There is a raw truth when Patten is on screen, a depth that she brings to her character, one that rings out the loudest in her moments alone. Mortimer, while not on the screen as often, still radiates, filling the room, every ounce of her screen time matching Patton. Their dual depth, many times preserved through nonverbals and facial expressions, gives way to an exquisite chemistry, a beautifully constructed bond between them.Good Posture was one of my favorite films in the entire festival. It was a last minute add on before diving into the week, one that I am grateful I had the opportunity to see.Dreamland – Miles Joris-PeyrafitteDreamland (2019) – source: Tribeca Film FestivalWhile not a bad film, there is nothing particularly groundbreaking that makes Dreamland stand out compared to all the other films premiering at this year’s festival.

Good Posture was one of my favorite films in the entire festival. It was a last minute add on before diving into the week, one that I am grateful I had the opportunity to see.Dreamland – Miles Joris-PeyrafitteDreamland (2019) – source: Tribeca Film FestivalWhile not a bad film, there is nothing particularly groundbreaking that makes Dreamland stand out compared to all the other films premiering at this year’s festival. Honestly, I had hoped for more – more action, more intrigue, more intensity. I never feared for Allison Wells (Margot Robbie), her discovery meaning certain death. I also never wondered where the story was going, the predictability snatching any grip the film may have had on its viewers.There was this Bonnie and Clyde vibe that did reverberate, the chance that Allison and Eugene (Finn Cole, best known for Peaky Blinders) might launch into a murderous crime spree a possibility at any moment. Yet, the intensity of this scenario never comes to fruition, leaving it just that – a vibe. As of this moment, I am still unsure if this was an intent that was never fully realized, or an avoidance of being too closely similar to Bonnie and Clyde, a need to make it different and unique. Either way, succumbing to this vibe may have given the film its extra boost.There was a wasted potential in the slow burn of these characters and their journey, there lacked a depth in each of these characters, most with basic or lacking a drive strong enough to support many of their actions. Sometimes with films that come across lackluster, there are performances that can become a film’s redeeming quality; unfortunately, this is not the case with Dreamland. The script and the story bring the performances down, preventing any elevation. Where there could have been intensity in a forbidden potential love, there is none. Even the desperation of finding someone before it is too late is weighed down by the concern nothing will happen.Unfortunately, this was one of the most lackluster films of the festival I had the chance to see. I had been excited for the film, a fan of Margot Robbie’s work up until this point drawing me into the screening. While not every film within a festival will resonate with its audience, it was sad to see one with so much potential fall so short.Low Tide – Kevin McMullinLow Tide (2019) – source: Tribeca Film FestivalLow Tide from writer and director Kevin McMullin, was not a bad film, it was entertaining and it had a solid story. Yet, much like Dreamland, there was just a shine missing, something to make it stand out from the crowd. This was a film I had selected to screen on synopsis alone. There was no hype or built up excitement from any outside factors, just the idea of a small band of boys whose criminal plunders leads them to the discovery of a lifetime. I mean my biggest complaint is really only this, it just felt like something was missing…Low Tide follows the story of a couple local boys living in a vacationer’s paradise. On the shore, where the primary source of income is fishing or cruise directing, they are left to their own devices, seemingly tightly bonded and willing to do what they can and want to make an extra buck – all at the expense of the temporary residents. When one robbery goes wrong, the cops now on their trail, they are only briefly deterred, not only staking the house of a recently deceased local but bringing their brother along. What he discovers soon leads the boys down a path of vulnerability, wealth, and distrust, the small group turning fractures into canyons.I wish I could pinpoint what was missing in the film, what could be changed or added to give it a heightened glow. The story, while solid, followed many of the common tropes of a coming-of-age film, yet the angle which it was presented was nothing viewers haven’t seen before. Boys getting in trouble, one shady, another’s motives questionable. Here too, as in many films before it, there is the brainiac kid and the others finding salvation by following his lead. While the story itself leaned more to the original, the foundation it is built upon did not give it further room to branch out and grow.What I do have to say about the film that did shine through was its young performances. Jaeden Martell, who many will remember from Stephen King’s It: Chapter 1, has a shy, yet confident air to his performance. He owns this character, unafraid to let his performance match and at times surpass the performances of those around him. He is the character your eyes will constantly be drawn to, even when he is not the primary aspect on screen.As Red, Alex Neustaedter brings to mind an essence of Heath Ledger, his looks and hairstyle only heightening the resemblance. There is a strength in his performance that is coupled with his character’s disposed vulnerability. He is constantly fighting with himself on the inside, a drive you constantly see him pushing for a war. He is trying to win the battle, unfortunately choosing the side others disapprove of. There is also a danger, a calm warning as he walks by or enters a room that violence could erupt at any moment.I cannot stress enough that Low Tide is not a bad film, and I would not sway anyone from seeing it. It just needed something more. I can wholeheartedly recommend it on the performances alone, a sampling of the up-and-coming talent that could one day be constant faces on our movie screens.Does content like this matter to you?Become a Member and support film journalism.

Editor’s note: This review was originally published at the 2019 Tribeca Film Festival. Paramount Pictures will release the film in select theaters on Friday, November 13, with a PVOD release to follow on Tuesday, November 17. A Depression-era coming-of-age story that’s told with all the born-to-run romance of a Bruce Springsteen anthem, Miles Joris-Peyrafitte’s “Dreamland” is a film as mythic and familiar as the Dust Bowl itself. It’s an arresting fable fueled by the restlessness that American kids have always regarded as a birthright, and a penniless runaway of a movie that’s almost too beautiful to care that it’s racing towards a dead end. You’ve seen this story a thousand times before, but Joris-Peyrafitte’s expressive direction and Margot Robbie’s sheer force of will are enough to endow the movie’s best moments with the same hope-and-a-prayer immediacy that its heroes take with them as they speed towards the southern border. Beginning with fatalistic narration (from an unseen Lola Kirke) that immediately locates the film in a long tradition of neo-Western legends, “Dreamland” channels everything from “Days of Heaven” to “Slow West” as it lays the groundwork for a half-remembered folktale about a teenage boy and the outlaw who changed his life. Eugene Evans (“Peaky Blinders” star Finn Cole) is no longer around to tell this story for himself, but wherever that strapping teenager got off to — dead or alive — it’s safe to say that he’s in a better place. His arid Texas hometown is a hostile stretch of blue sky and brown dirt where even the days without apocalyptic sandstorms feel like a kind of death rattle. It’s no wonder that Eugene’s father left for Mexico a while back, and that everyone who stuck around seems to resent the land itself. Eugene doesn’t know much, but he knows that it gets better than this. Maybe it would be easier if things were worse; if the comic books he steals from the local store didn’t fill his head with ideas, or if the “A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night” cinematographer didn’t saturate every part of his world with the deep colors and soft poetry of a lucid dream. The pot seems just a bit too big for Eugene to accept the hand he was dealt. He loves his spark plug of a little sister (Darby Camp, who’s inquisitive but never annoying), and might harbor some vague tenderness for his struggling mother (Kerry Condon), but that only goes so far. His dad once sent him a postcard from the Gulf of Mexico, and Eugene wants nothing more than to hand-deliver a reply. And then some news blows into town: A bankrobber named Allison Wells (Robbie) has botched her latest heist, leaving five people dead at the scene. She’s penniless, leaking, and was last spotted head straight for Eugene’s neck of the woods. Naturally, our gawky adolescent hero (who worships his favorite comic book characters because they know how to speak to women), finds the fugitive hiding in the barn behind his house. Scared as he is, this is obviously the greatest thing that’s ever happened to him, and not only because it’s the only thing that’s ever happened to him. Allison might have a bullet in her leg and a $10,000 bounty on her head, but she’s still Margot Robbie (her blonde mop and black eyeshadow lender her the unmistakable danger of a gun moll). On the flip side of things, Eugene could be Allison’s best-case scenario. Sure, he could use the money, but who’s easier to manipulate than a horny teenage virgin who shares her desire to sneak away from this place forever? It’s easy enough to predict what happens from there, as the nuances of Nicolaas Zwart’s script don’t quite disguise its clichés. There’s a standard-issue obviousness to the bond that inevitably develops between Eugene and Allison, and “Dreamland” often wrings too much tension from circumstance instead of character. Much of that is laid at the feet of Eugene’s kid sister — who will grow up to be our narrator — as she pokes around the barn and threatens to discover what her brother is hiding in there. On the other hand, the film does right by the boy’s stepfather (Travis Fimmel), an emerald-eyed hardass that a lesser film would have turned into a brute. But “Dreamland” thrives by inviting viewers to fill in the empty gaps inside and between its lead characters. Both Eugene and Allison are inflated with hot air, but he’s up front about his attraction to her, and she’s just as open about her disinterest in him (which only makes it more intriguing when things change). Robbie, whose still-nascent career has been defined by a striking willingness to explore the power of her own screen image, is in full command of her role, and does a brilliant job of wearing Allison’s manipulative intentions as a kind of loose-fitting mask. Cole’s part is underwritten, as the blank male leads in stories of maturation often are, but the actor negotiates a curiously space between adolescence and adulthood. Most of the movie feels like it’s suspended in the space between Eugene’s last step as a boy and his first as a man, and he only touches his feet on the ground after an indelible long-take towards the end. It almost feels like he grows older as she gets younger, and they get to be the same age for one short-lived moment. This is the story of two people who are desperate to find beauty in an ugly world, and it’s a delicious thrill to see how they find it in each other. And also how they don’t. It helps that Joris-Peyrafitte, still a kid in his own right (his “As You Are” premiered at Sundance when he was only 23), is able to find something beautiful in just about everything. His active, dynamic camera manages to enliven all but the most obvious beats, and the busyness of his visual approach never suggests a scrambling uncertainty. If the landscape evokes the mythicism of Terrence Malick, the rest of the aesthetic often channels the criminal buzz of Fritz Lang: High-angle shots add a divine sense of danger, while noirish lighting and expressive cuts endow the movie with an energy all its own, even as Allison and Eugene careen into every cliché they find along the side of the road. It’s one thing to have a good eye, but Joris-Peyrafitte has real vision. You can see it in the visual integrity of the film’s occasional effects, and you can hear it in the tornado-like strings of Patrick Higgins’ reactive score, a riveting body of music that recalls the work of “Woman in the Dunes” composer Toru Takemitsu in how it creates dense cavities of feeling beneath the film’s characters. There’s far more to “Dreamland” than the movie is able to wrangle over the course of its harried 98-minute runtime, and even when Allison and Eugene finally ride out to case the promised land it can feel like they’re driving in circles. Then again, it’s not like they’re looking for a real place. There’s no escaping that America is a land of burden, but Joris-Peyrafitte’s movie finds something tragic and beautiful in the story of two people who refuse to carry the weight they were given, no matter how much it costs to put it down.

	Miles Joris-Peyrafitte makes a grand stride forward in his ambitious second feature, a singular if somewhat slow-to-alight outlaw romance set against a Dust Bowl backdrop. The dust in “Dreamland” is so thick, it makes your eyeballs itch. Clouds of the stuff billow up from dirt roads with every car that passes, swarming dark and angry as a massive bee horde when the winds pick up. And when the air is still, it smudges the cheeks of the film’s characters — poor, small-town Texas farmers with faces as desiccated as their fields — rendering them haunted, like the Depression-era sharecroppers Walker Evans photographed in “Let Us Now Praise Famous Men.” Dreams, it seems, are all these opportunity-strapped Americans have going for them: dreams nourished by pulp crime magazines and, maybe, by the movies, although it’s doubtful this bedraggled settlement can support a cinema. From its opening lines of narration, Miles Joris-Peyrafitte’s revisionist outlaw saga endeavors to set the record straight about one Eugene Evans, a naïve Texas teen who ran off with on-the-law beauty Allison Wells and wound up etched beside her legend in history. These words are spoken by Eugene’s kid sister, Phoebe (Lola Kirke performs the older-wiser thoughts of child actor Darby Camp), with a kind of purity that recalls the dreamy voiceover of Terrence Malick’s “Days of Heaven” — as mythic an influence on “Dreamland” as Arthur Penn’s “Bonnie and Clyde,” which could have been its prequel, had Clyde died and Bonnie stumbled away wounded from that climactic shootout. If you don’t remember whatever version of the Allison Wells story Phoebe so earnestly wants to correct, that’s because no such bank robber as Allison Wells ever existed. And yet, there’s a plausibility to the tall tale Joris-Peyrafitte is selling here that rings truer that plenty of films based in fact. Maybe that’s because screenwriter Nicolaas Zwart approaches this mythic American genre through the storm cellar rather than the front door: While Allison (Margot Robbie) and her photogenic partner-in-crime (Garrett Hedlund) are shooting up banks somewhere offscreen, the film opens on Eugene (Finn Cole), saddled with mundane chores and thirsty for excitement. No sooner does Eugene hear that Allison’s camped out somewhere in the vicinity, and that there’s a $10,000 reward for her capture, than he discovers her bleeding behind a tractor in the family’s barn. The money would be more than enough to rescue the family farm from foreclosure, but as outlaws go, Allison isn’t anything like he expected. For starters, she’s looks like Margot Robbie — and not the dumpified, down-to-earth version made up (or down?) in “Mary Queen of Scots.” This is Robbie at her radiant best: movie-star gorgeous, at this naïve young man’s mercy, batting her eyes and enticing him with the possibility that his nobody life might just have gotten interesting. At that moment, Eugene decides not to collect the bounty, but to help this fugitive, who assures him that the blood-soaked stories he’s heard aren’t true — though her guilty flashbacks, parceled out in fragments, suggest otherwise. Zwart paints Eugene like a fame-struck ingenue, seduced by whatever glamorous south-of-the-border fantasy he imagines awaits if they were to run off together. (His father fled to Mexico when he was a kid, leaving him a postcard, and now he lives with his stepfather, a stern sheriff’s deputy played by a square and weathered-looking Travis Fimmel.) Allison serves as something of a femme fatale, bewitching the boy, whose every questionable decision is his own. Obviously, there’s no room for a “Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head” interlude (which seemed out of place even for Butch Cassidy) in a town where it never rains, so Zwart concocts a midnight swim during which Eugene and Allison can bond, sowing sexual tension that pays off later in an evocatively shot hotel tub scene. Though the chemistry between these two characters feels genuine (Cole, who was a regular on the series “Peaky Blinders” and “Animal Kingdom,” gives a star-making performance here, opposite the ever-impressive Robbie), “Dreamland” spends a bit too much time standing still, holed up with Allison in the Evans’ barn, or waiting for the right moment to make their break. Maybe the filmmakers felt it was more realistic for the bond between these two to temper slowly, although those early looks pack more strength than the movie realizes. The movie races when they’re together, but drags during those intervals when Eugene is off running errands, telling fibs to his folks, or stealing first small necessities — food, clean clothes, etc. — and later bigger-league things, including Allison’s police file from the station and the getaway vehicle they’ll need to skip town. As Eugene’s minor transgressions compound into outright crimes, “Dreamland” positions itself for that inevitable escape, at which point the film finally shifts gears, becoming at last the bandits-on-the-run spree we’ve been anticipating all along — although strangely, it’s disappointing to note that at no point does the movie really take off. It’s gorgeous, yes, and texturally vivid enough to leave your mouth dry at the sight of all that dust, but Zwart’s script ultimately takes too long to get rolling, and when it does, the directorial vision that has so far distinguished “Dreamland” from other films like it gives way to generic tendencies: a close call with a bumpkin cop who pulls them over for speeding, a giddy bank robbery (Eugene’s first) nervously captured in a single shot. Momentum problems aside, “Dreamland” has such a strong identity of its own, it’s hard to believe that the project is just Joris-Peyrafitte’s second feature. Certainly, cinematographer Lyle Vincent (Ana Lily Amirpour’s go-to DP) deserves a hefty share of the credit, although it was presumably Joris-Peyrafitte’s idea to alternate between bold widescreen compositions and the square 8mm format used to represent the duo’s dreams: projections into the future, shot like celebrity home movies (in anachronistic color), of the couple frolicking in period bathing suits along the Mexican coast. Several sequences — including a massive CG dust storm, and a poignant cornfield scene that ends with a floating camera peering down as rain falls around it — are quite literally arresting. As for Eugene’s fate, it’s more romantic than realistic, despite his kid sister’s assurances to the contrary.",POSITIVE

"May 3, 2019"," Miles Joris-Peyrafitte’s Dreamland opens around the time of World War I, with families of homesteaders in a dirt field in Texas staking their claims on their own private pieces of land. One of these families is the Bakers, who, like those around them, moved west to become landowners, and as such masters of their own destinies. But this promised land is hard and unforgiving, and alcoholic patriarch John Baker (Hans Christopher) soon leaves his wife, Olivia (Kerry Condon), and young son, Eugene (Finn Cole), for what he believes are greener pastures in Mexico. Flash forward to the 1930s and these Texan dirt fields have grown into a small, hardscrabble farming community, and Olivia and Eugene have a new paterfamilias in the form of police deputy George Evans (Travis Fimmel). Olivia and George also have a daughter together, Phoebe (Darby Camp). This is, course, the time of the Great Depression, and this particular community lies in the heart of the Dust Bowl. Dreamland envisions the American West as a land of broken promises and dreams forsaken—a physical, social, and emotional wasteland. Like the foreclosed farms and homes around them, Eugene and his neighbors feel abandoned by their government, which appears to have reneged on its implicit promise to look after its people. At least that’s how Allison Wells (Margot Robbie), an impossibly alluring bank robber and vigilante who blows into Eugene’s life like a dust storm, sees it. She blames banks and the government for losing her family home and uses her plight to rationalize her robbing and killing to Eugene, who, like Dreamland, never fully decides whether he accepts her reasoning. Joris-Peyrafitte effectively captures the fear and misery of life in this hard-bitten time and place. This is a world of ecological ruin and apocalyptic dust storms. Locals wear gas masks to protect themselves against the omnipresent storms, which shatter windows and make the land nearly uninhabitable. Yet the director also finds beauty amid so much squalor, revealing wide vistas of monumental red skies and golden twilights. It’s here most of all that Joris-Peyrafitte wears his cinematic influences on his sleeve, filtering his story through the cinematic influence of Terrence Malick. Dreamland is Joris-Peyrafitte’s attempt at making a Badlands of his own, though closer in aesthetic register to Days of Heaven. But Dreamland, which also boasts naïve narration from a young girl and many scenes set during “the golden hour,” is ultimately a pale imitation, lacking the cosmic grandeur and aching humanity of Malick’s work and ultimately succumbing to melodramatic clichés and simplistic political demagoguery. The film’s first half largely consists of Eugene helping Allison hide from the authorities on his farm, and there’s much suspense regarding their goals and intentions toward one another. Allison deftly wraps Eugene around her fingers without revealing her true purposes, but Cole’s character is frustratingly one-note, dulling the dynamic between them. An extended chase sequence that sees the pair on the run from the law comprises the film’s second half, but it’s compromised by poor pacing and several gratuitous slow-motion scenes. One especially egregious example is a seemingly unending shower scene that could have been lifted straight from an episode of Red Shoe Diaries. The moment saps the suspense out of the film just as it’s about to reach the obligatory final shootout, a melodramatic and forgettable decrescendo.",NEGATIVE
"Apr 29, 2019"," The narrator tells us that Eugene’s father disappeared when he was five, leaving him with a postcard and a dream of finding his father in Mexico. When we find him as a young man, he is addicted to detective stories, idolizes glamorous criminals and longs for adventure. But his riskiest move has been stealing a pulp detective magazine from the local store. Robbie wears clumsy 1930s shoes, and has dirt and bloody smudges on her cheeks. But let’s face it, she still looks like Margot Robbie, with makeup so perfect it seems like she’s not wearing any; like female criminals in old movies, she has to look at least a little glam. But she is quietly fearless in creating Allison as an enigma. Through all the twists and turns of her character, Robbie refuses to allow Allison to become a simple, sympathetic heroine. Allison swears to Eugene that she has not killed anyone, but the narrator tells us that Allison tailors her story to the audience. That sets up the guessing game the film will follow through. Exactly how deceptive is she being? How blinded by his attraction and the possibility of adventure will he remain? Is she his ticket to the future or his destruction? As the answers take shape, Cole (from the series Peaky Blinders and Animal Kingdom) gives a nuanced performance that charts the complicated way the character reacts. Eugene is not stupid, but he is besotted. Late in the film, with the pair on the run as we knew they would eventually be, his eyes have been opened enough so that he asks Allison if he’s being used. He’s also so in love that he chooses to believe her when she says he is not. There are set pieces as vital to the film as the story, including a town dance that is lively and full of folksy fiddle music. It establishes the life of the community, and also provides a setting from which Eugene slips away to pilfer and destroy evidence the police have against Allison. The special effects only go over the top once, when giant billowing clouds of dust appear spanning the horizon. It is a distractingly artificial moment that briefly takes us out of the film’s fictional world. A better effect has Eugene’s stepfather bracing himself against the wind, trying to make his way to the barn, as we see him though a veil of dust that covers the screen. Meredith Lippincott’s production design feels entirely lived in. Travis Fimmel is gripping as the oppressive stepfather, and Kerry Condon empathetic as Eugene’s worried mother. As the young Phoebe, Darby Cole (who is in the new season of Big Little Lies) in wonderfully natural, a child who is suspicious and precocious yet believable. Joris-Peyrafitte’s first feature, As You Are, won a Sundance Special Jury Prize in 2016. That achievement was obviously no fluke. The final image of Dreamland is an overhead shot of a body lying in a pool of blood on the drought-ravaged dirt, as rain finally starts to fall. Harsh and beautiful, it is just the right ending to this lovely, evocative film.",POSITIVE
