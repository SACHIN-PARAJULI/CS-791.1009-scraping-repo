"Feb 27, 2024"," The biggest cinematic undertaking of the last 15-plus years, Kevin Feige’s grand attempt to serialize blockbuster storytelling has featured some ridiculous highs and some bleak lows. It’s changed the way Hollywood looks at its intellectual properties, and it’s trying to figure out its uncertain future after briefly imploding under the weight of its massive overreach into film and streaming television. We’ve gone through all 33 of the MCU’s films, from 2008’s Iron Man to last fall’s The Marvels, and ranked them according to quality. We don’t include the streaming series in this list, either; just the movies. While you’ll notice a high number of recent MCU films toward the bottom of the list, keep in mind that the series’ struggles post-Avengers: Endgame have been substantial, largely because of storytelling issues. As much as those films showed real promise, they represented a Marvel Studios that lost its consistency, hence the recent efforts to retool the universe. Before we get to the sole MCU film of 2024 in Deadpool & Wolverine, let’s dive into how the 33 films that came before it stacked up against each other. This is truly the low point in the MCU, a film that purely exists to connect dozens of uncompelling dots to a future that probably now won’t happen because of Jonathan Majors being booted from his role as Kang for his legal issues. The film tries to find its own path into the James Gunn-iness of the Galaxy of the Guardians movies, but it fails miserably in that pursuit. We love Paul Rudd, but not even he could save this one from itself. It’s everything wrong with the MCU at its worst: corporate product that exists to expand the empire rather than tell a compelling story with relatable characters. Chloé Zhao is an incredibly talented filmmaker who is responsible for some of the best films of the last decade. Eternals is sadly not one of them. Pairing Zhao with the MCU just simply didn’t work for either party, producing a largely lifeless superhero slog that very much overstays its welcome. Zhao’s natural lighting works incredibly for her arthouse films, but it’s not a match for studio filmmaking. It’s just a huge miss by a major talent, which happens. Taika Waititi’s long-anticipated to the incredibly fun Thor: Ragnarok was an absolute stinker for most of its runtime, one that lost its grip the tonal excellence of its predecessor and wastes a very fun Christian Bale villainous turn. It’s not the worst of the bunch necessarily, but it’s perhaps the biggest disappointment on the list. Nia DaCosta is another incredibly talented filmmaker whose Marvel project went off the rails because of the MCU nightmare machine’s malfunctioning. The film’s story is nearly incoherent, and it leaves a few inspires set pieces to dry with nonsensical villainy and far too much reliance on having seen multiple television shows to understand what’s going on in totality. We don’t blame DaCosta for this; the signs of life feel directly linked to her creativity. Destin Daniel Cretton’s Short Term 12 is one of the best movies of the 2010s, so it hurts our hearts to rank his MCU movie so low on this list. It’s an occasional chore, one that cannot link its kung-fu homages to the CG messiness that envelops the film by its third act. Tony Leung is as good as advertised, but the rest of this movie struggles to live up to that performance. The first sign of trouble in the post-Avengers: Endgame MCU, Black Widow just felt too little, too late, an attempt to make up for the unfairly procrastinated Black Widow origin movie that can’t match its compelling human moments with its bland action set pieces. We liked the cast, but it didn’t live up to the potential of telling Natasha Romanoff’s backstory. The clever bits can’t quite save this one from forgettable territory, even if it’s a step ahead than the rest of the movies on this list. Ant-Man’s first film is the best of the bunch, while this one just felt too small and unimportant in the grand scheme of things to really register. Rather than use that smallness to its advantage, it just felt a bit superfluous. It’s not bad, though. Brie Larson is a terrific actor, but the origin story for her Captain Marvel doesn’t quite live up to what it could’ve been. It is a fun 90s adventure film, and it was about time for the MCU to give a woman her own film in the series. We just wish it was, y’know, more deserving of the moment, even if the moment in and of itself boosts this one up a bit. This one gets a bad rap. It’s by no means a great movie or anything, but it’s got a very good Tom Hiddleston performance and moves at a satisfying clip. The elven villains are notoriously bad, but the rest of the film is alright. While it pales in comparison to Ang Lee’s thrilling 2003 Hulk, Edward Norton’s lone venture into the MCU as the angry green guy was a perfectly suitable introduction for the character. It’s hard that it’s been so long since this one came out, but it’s better than you remember. Definitely the weakest Avengers film, this overstuffed sequel still found a way to take the series into a refreshingly dark direction while giving Jeremy Renner’s Hawkeye a nice spotlight to work with. Still, this one hasn’t aged nearly as well as it played in the moment. The weakest of the Jon Watt/Tom Holland Spider-Man films, this one is like a tasty burrito that is so overstuffed that it falls out the bottom and gets all over your lap when you try to eat it. The film’s second act is as good as advertised, but you have to wade through a very uneven first half to get there. It’s darn good when it wants to be, but it needs a much tighter edit. Coasting on the nostalgia of yesterday can only get you so far when the jokes aren’t landing and the plot gets a little too convoluted. Thank goodness this one found its footing in the second act and eventually lived up to the potential. It was always going to be hard to live up to Iron Man, but Iron Man 2 is probably the MCU film that deserves more credit than it gets. It’s a very enjoyable sequel that deepens the journey for Robert Downey Jr.’s Tony Stark while zeroing in on some really well-crafted fight scenes. It’s a good film; flawed, sure, but we’ve missed this kind of effectively contained storytelling in these movies. The remnants of Edgar Wright’s scrapped vision for this film and Rudd’s impossibly buoyant charm helped the first Ant-Man movie stand out. While it’s still a step behind some of the better origin films, it’s the best Scott Lang movie of the three. It’s funny, it’s got a good heist and, again, there are a few scenes in this that feel preserved from Wright’s ideas. We’ll take it. Kenneth Branagh’s take on the Norse god definitely just scratched the potential that Waititi found with Thor: Ragnarok, but it’s still a very enjoyable origin tale that took full advantage of Branagh’s Shakespeare background in building the Asgardian palace intrigue. It also is the film that first understood how funny Chris Hemsworth could be with good material. Jake Gyllenhaal’s Mysterio and some really clever visual effect sequences give the second Spider-Man a real jolt, as the lighter elements of Holland’s take on the character meshed well with the way this one raised the stakes. It’s a good Spider-Man flick, even if the Tony Stark tech of it all got a little tiring. The first half of the conclusion to the Infinity Saga left viewers in limbo with a gut punch of an ending, even if it wasn’t hard to see how it would all get undone in the next movie. It felt like half a journey, and what you do to get there isn’t necessarily as compelling as what came after it. However, it’s hard to knock the MCU with finding this dour a story and sticking to it to the closing credits. For a year, Marvel wasn’t afraid to avoid a happy ending. That was nice; they should do it again some time. A clever political thriller disguised as a Captain America movie, this one really showed audiences that the MCU could branch itself into some really interesting directions that would pay off in the future. It felt a bit riskier than some of its predecessors, and it complicated the universe in some welcomed ways. It’s not quite the achievement it’s made out it be, but it’s quite good. A spectacular opening to lament the loss of Chadwick Boseman, Ryan Coogler’s directorial savvy and a very complicated villain in Namor helped lift the second Black Panther film through the tragedy of Boseman’s loss. That alone is cause for respect. Even if this one falls into the CG fight mess of most of the MCU films, it’s still one of the better titles on this list. Doctor Strange got one of the best origin films in this series, one that utilized filmmaker Scott Derrickson’s genre bona fides with some mind-bending visuals to couple with Benedict Cumberbatch’s memorable take on the Sorcerer Supreme. Also, adding Benedict Wong to these movies was such a smart move. He never wastes a second of his screen time. The first Holland Spidey film is also the best, one that felt refreshingly removed from the MCU ongoings and scaled down Peter Parker’s universe into a New York City-set drama with real stakes and effective coming-of-age comedy. Michael Keaton’s Vulture is one of the MCU’s best and believable villains. While the MCU never fully capitalized on the fascinating rift between Captain America and Iron Man, this film deserved a lot of credit for creating that fraction in the first place. The airport battle is still one of the best scenes in all of these movies, and the introduction to Holland’s Spider-Man is still such a joy and the best use of his iteration of the character in this series. The first Captain America film is still the best, as Joe Johnston’s World War II action-adventure did an incredibly effective job of introducing Steve Rogers and underscoring the scrappy virtues that defined the character. Chris Evans earned his star power in this role, and he was never better than here. Getting Shane Black to make an Iron Man movie just felt too good to be true, as this fantastically entertaining third Tony Stark solo venture took the markings of a great Shane Black movie and put them in the MCU to great effect. It’s a very subversive, introspective film, one replete with great action sequences and a bad guy switcheroo for the ages. It’s the most underappreciated film in this series by far. The best film post-Avengers: Endgame by a country mile, Sam Raimi’s thrilling, unpredictable Doctor Strange sequel took some bold steps to complicate the MCU while playing into those Raimi staples that make him one of the best filmmakers to ever work in the genre. Elizabeth Olsen’s fascinating heel turn for Wanda Maximoff is still one of the bravest decisions in any of these movies, and Raimi knew exactly how to capitalize on it. It was so gratifying to have Raimi back in the genre, and this was a clear highlight for the MCU to learn from and build off of in the future. Perhaps the most purely fun MCU film to date, Waititi revived the Thor movies in stellar fashion with this incredibly funny, consistently impressive action comedy that boasted freakin’ Cate Blanchett as its bad guy. There are so many inspired bits in this movie, capped with a technicolor smackdown finale that rivals any other in the MCU. This movie is just a blast. Even the most cynical person had to give the MCU its flowers for nailing this grand finale to a decade-plus of storytelling, as the Infinity Saga came to its grand conclusion. It’s a gripping spectacle that closes out so many storylines with a satisfying cap and gave Downey Jr. and Evans some rich material for their final outings as Iron Man and Captain America. The series may never reach this fever pitch again, but we’re glad we got to watch the plan come together in such a memorable way. Gunn is the best filmmaker to ever work in the MCU, and his Guardians of the Galaxy films are the gold standard for this series as a whole. The second installment richened the characters while also giving Michael Rooker’s Yondu one of its best character arcs. Kurt Russell was such an inspired bit of casting as Ego, and the film just packs such a wallop with its deeply emotional finale. We dare you not to cry at what happens during the Cat Stevens needle drop. Gunn’s final outing in the MCU with his Guardians was also one of the best MCU films, period. Exploring Rocket Raccoon’s heartbreaking backstory and welding that with its main story arc just hit like a ton of bricks, as Gunn refused to let this one pass him by without a statement. The film’s final dance scene to Florence & The Machine is just such a joyous summation of why these movies worked so well and why they’ll be so missed in Gunn’s hands. Probably one of the most exciting blockbusters of the 2010s, the first Avengers film was a genuine moment in pop culture, one that pulled off a teamup movie that had never been attempted before in film history. It set the standard incredibly high for how these multi-hero movies would go, and we’re not sure any of the films to come after it ever cleared the bar. Coogler’s masterful first Black Panther film is also one of the best blockbusters of the 2010s, one that created an indelible moment in pop culture that widened spectacle representation in a way that felt sustainable. This one is just everything good about superhero films, from the stellar craftwork to Coogler’s sharp eye for staging the material and Michael B. Jordan’s unforgettable villainous turn that refused easy explanations. Of course, Boseman’s memory lingers high on this one in the rearview, as it was his true moment to shine in the role that defined him. As hard as it is to believe, Downey Jr. was not one of Hollywood’s biggest stars before his first Iron Man movie came out. This film not only led to perhaps the greatest comeback in acting history, but also launched the MCU in spectacular fashion. It’s perhaps the most grounded Marvel film to date, but it’s also one of the absolute best for a reason. Everything is owed to Iron Man, a film that launched a moment and set a standard that hasn’t always been reached. The pinnacle of the MCU was also its greatest risk, as it took a genre filmmaker who had never worked with this big a canvas before in Gunn and some of Marvel’s most obscure characters and made a masterpiece out if it. Guardians of the Galaxy essentially changed the way that superhero movies could be made, adding in a cosmic sense of irreverence and a template for building lovable characters out of oblong sketches. It launched Chris Pratt to stardom and turned Rocket Racoon and Groot into household names. It also showed how putting in the right amount of heart and pathos can essentially make even the strangest of characters the most cheerworthy of heroes. We’re not sure the MCU will ever top the first Guardians film, as it’s the shining standard for what Marvel movies can be. Take risks; hire good filmmakers who fit the mold and let them cook; cast wisely; let these things breathe without so much responsibility to the grander universes. If we can get at least one more movie from Marvel as great as this, it’s a huge win.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 16, 2023"," Even before the arrival of Eternals, critics were raising concerns. In Hollywood, the force more powerful than Uatu the Watcher — the Rotten Tomatoes score — started dropping, with the film currently ranking as the lowest in MCU history.  ELI:  The Eternals are supposed to introduce something majestic, a new galactic scale to the Marvel Universe, beginning with the arrival of massive celestial beings who we're told are responsible for essentially seeding the cosmos.  Like bespoke Power Rangers, the Eternals arrived thousands of years ago, hovering above the Earth in their sleek triangular spaceship.  With their colourful costumes and array of powers, they were designated as our planet's protectors, keeping the evil deviants in check. Similar to Star Trek's prime directive they were told not to interfere in human affairs, but have lived among us for thousands of years waiting for the deviants to return.  Gemma Chan has the most screen time as Sersi, the Eternal who can change the physical properties of objects.  She works at a museum during the day (I guess Wonder Woman gave her career advice). But the return of the deviants brings her old flame Ikaris back. Richard Madden played the stoic hero who flies about with a flapping loincloth zapping people with his eyebeams.  But this is only the latest version of these superpowered protectors.  JACKSON:  For sure. The Eternals has been through numerous reboots and retcons — the age-old comic book tradition of altering old plot points at will —  throughout the years. While main character Sersi — and, to a degree, Richard Madden's Ikaris — remain mostly consistent, the rest are barely recognizable. The characters Ajak (Salma Hayek), Makkari (Lauren Ridloff) and Sprite (Lia McHugh) have been gender-swapped from their most common depictions. Brian Tyree Henry's Phastos is depicted as a married gay man with a child, and others — including the comic's original ""prime Eternal"" Zuras — are completely ignored. While changing aspects of their source material is nothing new for Marvel, the extent to which the characters are altered here speaks to why The Eternals never really worked. The comics did not see mainstream popularity, largely because the truly ensemble-style story never landed on a clear main character — instead dragging up a different one of the Eternals' 100 members to focus on for each outing.  For that reason, readers had a hard time even latching on to a favourite member, as it was always so difficult to pin down who any of the heroes really were. ELI:  It's a pity because the idea of secret celestial sleeper agents living among us certainly has potential.  But the film's biggest problem is there's just too many of them.  There's a good reason the modern Marvel era started with Iron Man, then Hulk and Thor,  slowly teasing out the characters' backstories and connections. Imagine if The Avengers was the first Marvel film and spent half the time introducing Black Widow, Hawkeye, Captain America and more. Eternals has that problem multiplied by ten and without the pre-existing pop culture familiarity. Many of us had heard of the Hulk at one time or another, but Thena? Phastos? Ajak? Druig?  JACKSON: I can't say I'm surprised. The Eternals was never supposed to fit into the Marvel superhero world, and required an incredible amount of exposition over multiple years to do so.  Comic book legend Jack Kirby was first inspired to write The Eternals after reading Chariots of the Gods? Unsolved Mysteries of the Past,  a 1968 book about alien contact with a prehistoric Earth. He meant to keep the final product separate from the universe of Iron Man, Captain America and Thor, but was pressured by editors to meld them together.  ELI: If there's one element that marks a great superhero film, it's a villain who can hold their own. Consider: the chaotic energy of Heath Ledger's Joker from The Dark Knight. Killmonger nearly stole the show from Black Panther. Heck, even the Scarlet Witch had Agatha all along. While Eternals features the all-powerful celestial Arishem pulling strings behind the scenes, too much of the film is about battling forgettable deviants — snarling creatures that are powerful but lack any personality.  But Jackson, you see some possibilities there?  JACKSON: While it was a challenge to force the square pegged-Eternals into the round hole of Marvel, it does allow them to significantly up the ante. The various MCU heroes have already saved their respective cities, countries, planets, and galaxies — how do you keep things exciting when you've already clawed back half the population of the universe? While we don't see all the scariest aspects of Arishem, the spooky space gods certainly open up the playing field for Marvel. And while the deviants may lack personality, they offer a potential way for the franchise to finally introduce another property: the similarly altered mutants of X Men.  ELI:  After the Oscar-winning triumph with Nomadland, it was exciting to imagine what director Chloé Zhao could bring to the Marvel movie universe. With her films such as The Rider and Nomadland she showed an instinct for blending documentary with drama, recruiting real people for moments on film where the boundaries between fact and fiction blur.  But like Galactus gobbling a planet, Zhao's unique filmmaking style has been subsumed by the mighty Marvel maw. The movie shares some superficial similarities to her previous works.  Her love of natural landscapes and a certain Western esthetic, even going so far as to have Salma Hayek kicking back at her own private ranch as the leader Ajak. JACKSON:  Zhao's final product may not have reached the heights we hoped it would, but there are some wonderful additions. Her commitment to diverse characters is a more-than-welcome change for Marvel: Phastos' unquestioned and unemphasized representation as a gay man was both powerful and empowering, while Ridloff's turn as Marvel's first deaf actor to play a superhero was a remarkable milestone.  At the same time, blurring fact and fiction when talking about human history can be a fraught endeavour. The Eternals are to thank for many of humanity's accomplishments, instead of real people and their cultures, while tragedies — such as the 1945 atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki — are mined for shallow character development.  ELI:  I would like to briefly praise what worked for me.  I'd watch an entire film with Brian Tyree Henry as Phastos the technologist. As the IT guy for the Eternals, Henry added such a soulful and heartbroken component to the character it gave us a glimpse of what the movie could have been. Also, for all the attention of Kumail Nanjiani's new physique, his greatest asset is still his funny bone.  As Kingo the part-time Bollywood star, he added much needed levity to the overly earnest production.  JACKSON: Eternals the movie suffers from the same thing The Eternals comic did — it focuses more on a concept than it does on characters. For that reason, I'm less impressed by Sersi's ability to turn someone into a tree, and more enamoured by the characterization when it does peek through — like the fascination Ma Dong-seok's muscle-bound Gilgamesh has with cooking, or the PTSD-like affliction Angelina Jolie's Thena struggles with. If I could stretch our definition of who counts as an Eternal, my hands-down favourite would be Karun, played by veteran stage and screen actor Harish Patel. Patel's depiction as Nanjiani's dedicated (though under-equipped) assistant is the highlight of the movie for me.  ELI:  I wouldn't describe Eternals as an absolute failure, but more a disappointment considering the talent involved. If you want a film that has something to say about our place in the universe, I think 1997's Men in Black did it better.  Eternals has moments of awe, but mostly it's a celestial bore.  JACKSON: I'm disappointed by the movie, though not surprised. The epoch and galaxy-spanning story's original comics run was never a commercial success, and almost every other attempt to make The Eternals work has either failed, or found lacklustre response. Still, this movie is sure to become required viewing for the committed MCU fan — though you may be better served by simply reading the Neil Gaiman comics and calling it a day. It is a priority for CBC to create products that are accessible to all in Canada including people with visual, hearing, motor and cognitive challenges.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 10, 2023"," BAKERSFIELD, Calif. (OPINION) — This week’s new DVD and Blu-ray releases show that films can miss whether they are made with massive production budgets or produced with very little money. “Eternals” Grade 2 stars: Films in the Marvel Universe had been so consistently good that it was inevitable there would be the occasional misfire. That happens in a big way with this bloated production that never works on a personal or super power level. The Eternals are a group of immortals from the planet Olympia who have been hanging around Earth for thousands of years. They have been using their skills and knowledge to help mold the human race. That changes when the Eternals discover their true mission. They must choose between completing the task they have been waiting thousands of years to do or save the humans. “Eternals” started out from a bad spot as the feature film is based on one of the weakest publications created by comic book legend Jack Kirby. It was one thing for the story with all of its players to start unfolding on printed pages back in 1976. It ends up being a mess trying to introduce and foster a multitude of characters in one movie. “The Avengers” worked because those characters were introduced in individual films. “The Eternals” is a jumbled mess because it has to include the origin story plus detail the long lives of the 10 major characters. “Settlers” Grade 2 stars: This film that looks at life in the frontier of space is painfully frustrating. It starts with a great concept but the writing by Wyatt Rockefeller (who is also the director) makes too many glaring errors for the project to ever gain strength. The idea is solid. The film takes place on a remote homestead that is in the Martian frontier. A refugee family from Earth struggles with the harsh world while clinging to the hope of a better life. This is disrupted when strangers appear in the surrounding hills and attempt to run them off. Remmy (Brooklynn Prince), a spunky 9 year old, is faced with the harsh realities of their life from which her mother (Sofia Boutella) and father (Jonny Lee Miller) have tried to protect her. That concept works because the film draws parallels to what life would have been like in the Old West. Brave settlers were on their own facing the natural dangers of their environment and the unnatural dangers from humans. But, Rockefeller kills this concept with sloppy writing. The viewer is thrown into this situation with no explanation. These settlers aren’t bouncing around the Martian landscape (that should have one-third Earth’s gravity) in spacesuits but are living the kind of life one would find on Earth. That includes an atmosphere that is so good, there are winds to help dry the laundry left on the line. “Heels: Season 1”: Starz series that looks at the costumed heroes who face the emotional and physical challenges of small time professional wrestling. Stephen Amell stars. “Soumaya”: A practicing Muslim who works as a manager at a company in charge of security at Charles de Gaulle Airport becomes a suspect in an incident that killed 130 people. “The King’s Man”: A look at how the Kingsman becomes the world’s very first independent intelligence agency created to fight master criminals. Ralph Fiennes stars. It will be released on DVD and Blu-ray on Feb. 22. “Worst to First: The True Story of Z100 New York”:  The documentary looks at the against-all-odds story of the launch of the iconic and most successful radio station in history.

"Aug 3, 2023"," Halfway through Chloé Zhao’s (Nomadland) Eternals, two of the film’s titular characters have a conversation, and one of them tells the other, Richard Madden’s (Game of Thrones, Bodyguard) Ikaris, that he’s always thought of him as Peter Pan. In this scenario, Ikaris’ love interest, Sersi (Gemma Chan, of Crazy Rich Asians and Let Them All Talk), would be Wendy, and the other Eternals would be the “Lost Boys”, a bunch of eternally young souls who have survived the worst moments in the history of the universe, and gone on many missions accompanied by their flying companion. These Peter Pan metaphors are particularly appropriate to describe the Eternals, and it’s not just because of the obvious similarities between the all-powerful Ikaris and the ageless protagonist of J.M.Barrie’s novel.  Marvel’s “immortal heroes” are aliens who come from the planet Olympia that have been sent to Earth thousands of years ago by the Celestials, a race of cosmic builders whose job is to ensure the correct functioning of the universe. When they were first sent to Earth, the Eternals’ mission was to protect humanity from the Deviants, giant, pastel-coloured, dinosaur-reminiscent predators who have the power to destroy entire planets. But when their mission was completed and there were no Deviants left on Earth, no instructions came from the Celestials as to what the Eternals were supposed to do, or when they would be allowed to return home. And so, our heroes waited for centuries, abandoned to their own fates by the same creatures who sent them to Earth in the first place, and attempting to each live their own life and find purpose while also trying not to interfere with the many human conflicts they witnessed, so as to enable humanity to learn from their mistakes and ultimately evolve.  If we first meet the Eternals in 5.000 BC in Mesopotamia, where they are using their powers to defeat the Deviants and sharing a mutual understanding that is almost spiritual, we soon jump in time to the present day, when they’re all leading separate lives as eternally young human wannabes – “Lost Boys” who are, at the same time, invincible and abandoned, knowledgeable and inexperienced, old and young, strong and fragile, wise and devoid of a purpose. It’s not by chance that the name of one of the most powerful Eternals is Ikaris: it’s a clear reference to Icarus, the mythological figure who ignored his father’s instructions and flew too close to the sun, ultimately causing his own demise due to his lack of experience and self-control. The only paternal figure the Eternals have ever had is the Celestial who sent them to Earth, Arishem (voiced by David Kaye, of Pixar’s Up), a cosmic being who gave them a mission and left them to their own means as soon as it was completed, hence depriving them of a chance to grow up, evolve, realise their full potential, and find their own place in the universe.  Stuck in a perennial state of limbo, Marvel’s “Lost Boys” are both protectors of humanity and pawns to their leaders, and this makes them complex, fascinating creatures. Figures of both unlimited potential and unexpected fragility, the Eternals embody many contrasting issues and ideals, from freedom of choice, power dynamics, and the connection between one’s memories and one’s identity to the very idea of evolution, and this makes Eternals a very different kind of Marvel movie. Chloé Zhao’s superhero epic might not reflect your idea of what a Marvel movie should look and feel like, but it’s also the MCU’s most philosophical film to date, and a thoroughly enthralling, meaningful journey that will inspire and captivate you thanks to its immersive world-building, exceptional characterisation, and more than one reveal you won’t see coming.  Inspired by Jack Kirby’s 1976 Marvel comic books with the same name and written for the screen by Chloé Zhao and co-writer Patrick Burleigh (Peter Rabbit 2: The Runaway) from a story by Ryan and Kaz Firpo, Eternals takes place across two time periods: the past, when the group first arrived on planet Earth to fight the Deviants, and the present—that is, five years after the Blip, when the Eternals are no longer a team, since the Deviants have been defeated, and our heroes have separated to live among humans. But a new threat emerges that makes the humankind-loving Sersi, the eternal child Sprite (Lia McHugh, of The Lodge) and the newly reunited Ikaris decide to go look for the other Eternals: the Deviants have somehow managed to resurface, and, this time, they seem to have evolved into much deadlier creatures. And so, our trio finds the others, and reunites with spiritual leader Ajak (Salma Hayek, of Desperado), cosmic-powered-turned Bollywood star Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani, The Big Sick), genius inventor-turned family man Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse), super-fast, wise old soul (not to mention Marvel’s first deaf superhero) Makkari (Lauren Ridloff, Sound of Metal), slightly disquieting but powerful loner Druig (Barry Keoghan, of The Green Knight), strong and kind combatant Gilgamesh (Don Lee, of Train to Busan), and Thena (Angelina Jolie, of Maleficent), a fierce warrior who appears to be experiencing some issues with her grasp of reality, as a side effect of having lived for so long.  As our reunited heroes try to understand why these new Deviants seem to be able to heal themselves and constantly evolve into stronger creatures, their understanding of their role in human history becomes clearer, and this leads them to question their very existence, and ultimately face the choice of whether to follow their orders or their hearts. Meanwhile, we get to see them in action centuries in the past, from ancient Mesopotamia 7000 BC and Babylon 2500 BC to the fall of the Aztec Empire in 1521 AD, and in the present, from London to Mumbai, South Dakota, Chicago, Alaska, Australia and the Amazon forest, and not only do we understand just how much of human life they have observed and experienced throughout the years, but we also instantly build a connection to them.  Though all ten Eternals are introduced to us at the same time and right at the beginning of the film, and each of them comes with their own set of powers and sensitivities, it’s not hard for us to remember every single one of them and immediately find them familiar, and that is due, in part, to a script that values character development and world-building and to the tangible chemistry between all cast members, who all deliver memorable performances with just the right amount of emotion. At the same time, it’s the universal issues approached by the film that really draw us in, turning this fantastical story about immortal aliens with god-like powers who fight superpowered beasts into an incredibly relatable tale that touches upon many themes, from the importance of family to the struggle to “remember who [we] are” when we’re lost and without a purpose; from our obsession with technology to our relationship with nature; from how evolution can turn preys into predators and leaders into followers to the nature of good and evil itself.  Eternals is not devoid of twists, and there’s one in particular that is bound to get you even more invested in both the narrative and our characters’ fates, but all of that is best left unspoiled. The film is not the kind of Marvel movie you’re used to watching, as it’s a much more meditative, almost spiritual experience that asks you to pay attention to its subtext, valuing what’s left unsaid as much as what’s actually happening. But that doesn’t mean there isn’t room for action, laughs, and surprises. The humour mainly comes from Kumail Nanjiani’s Kingo and his butler-turned-cameraman Karim (Harish Patel, of Run Fatboy Run), whose many gags are bound to keep you entertained, together with more than one unexpected moment featuring the Eternals using their powers in inventive ways. The movie’s most shocking twists come at unexpected times, and though a couple of choices made by the film’s protagonists can feel, at first, a little out-of-character, it all makes sense by the end, and credit goes to the filmmakers for presenting us with heroes who might be immortal but who are also imperfect, reflecting the very essence of humanity.  The narrative does feel a little muddled at times, and there are several scenes towards the end that could have been cut, but it’s never boring or not rewarding, as most of the fun comes from watching the characters simply be with one another. And though every single cast member turns in impressive performances, the standouts are undoubtedly Gemma Chan, Angelina Jolie, and Lia McHugh, who will move you to tears at times and give you many epic, unforgettable scenes at others, also thanks to a script that gives them plenty of screentime and enables them to shine. Though Kit Harington‘s (Game of Thrones) Dane’s scenes in the film are very limited, they are also meaningful, and Harington imbues one of the few non-superpowered characters in the movie with such authenticity that it will stay with you long after the credits roll, making you think about what might happen next in the MCU.  Eternals is not your typical Marvel movie, but that isn’t a bad thing. What Chloé Zhao and the team behind the movie have crafted is a truly impressive, ambitious epic that is huge in scope and scale, with a screenplay that values emotion just as much as it values action, and mesmerising world-building and clever character development that will keep you enthralled throughout. The film has been shot almost entirely on location, with the use of wide-angle spherical lenses and deep focus that give us insight on the characters and make for an even more immersive experience, and the naturalistic style of Zhao’s filmmaking is reflected in a script where at least eight different languages are spoken, and those include ancient languages such as Sumerian, Babylonian and Sanskrit, but also Hindi, Arabic, Spanish and even sign language. It’s a film that invites us to connect deeply with one another, and to reflect on the issues that affect humanity as a whole. Eternals is drenched in mythology, but it’s also unmistakenly real, and that is the strength of a film that isn’t perfect, but that still manages to stay grounded to our own reality, keeping us entertained while asking all the right questions, and showing us the real monsters of an individual-centred society that seems to have forgotten how to establish authentic, meaningful connections. Eternals might not be what you expect it to be, but it’s exactly the kind of film we need in our day and age, and it’s not to be missed.",POSITIVE

"Jul 26, 2023"," With an ensemble cast of movie stars, Chloe Zhao brings her unique aesthetic of vast landscapes and nature to expand the MCU. In the ned, audiences experience a gentle blockbuster with visuals that could kill and an empty soul.  Before diving into the main plot, a lot of exposition takes up space to firmly establish a large, diverse ensemble of Hollywood A-Listers. While taking time to provide explanations it results in a rushed second half when the action starts to take place.  Moving from indie films to comic books, Zhao finds her trademarks of magic hour and rolling plains across middle America. She heavily focuses on the nature of the world she creates almost as it is the main character.  It creates a calm atmosphere in the midst of the world ending. Although different from its predecessors it keeps the theme of witty banter and funny moments to break any scenes that might feel too deep.  The main problem of this film is the writing. It is told through a non-linear timeline that doesn’t allow the audience to spend too much time with the characters or the setting they are in. The Eternals are a group of super-beings sent to Earth to fight the deviants. They have been apart for 7,000 years and reunite to fight the resurgence of the creatures they thought were gone. This ensemble feels different from other Marvel movies with the inclusivity of a gay couple and a character with a hearing impairment that is her superhero.  Each actor does a good job to work with the limited material given to make them stand out in scenes.  At times there is so much visually happening that you miss out on the smaller moments between characters. The film features the first Marvel sex scene which displays one of the deeper romantic relationships in the entire cinematic universe. It reminds viewers that the heroes they watch onscreen are people that have the ability to connect with others and feel.  It feels like experimentation in different styles and tones to explore in future MCU projects.  Eternals has its moments but its massive scale never allows the characters to live in their world.  It is successful in using the other to examine moral and humanity but the lack of interaction between the Eternals and the world they live in makes it hard for this theme to be communicated. Visually it is stunning but barely has a soul due to its dense material. It does leave a cliffhanger that leaves audiences excited to explore these characters and their world more. ",NEGATIVE
"Jul 25, 2023"," Synopsis: Eternals follows a group of heroes from beyond the stars who had protected the Earth since the dawn of man. When monstrous creatures called the Deviants, long thought lost to history, mysteriously return, the Eternals are forced to reunite in order to defend humanity once again. Ever since the end of the Infinity Saga that viewers have been waiting for the next big step. Everyone knew the MCU needed to go cosmic and deal with a completely different kind of superheroes. Kevin Feige entrusted Chloé Zhao - winner of last year's Oscars for Best Director and Best Picture with Nomadland - with probably the most important project of Phase Four. This film is supposed to mark the beginning of a new Era of heroes, and it even introduces the next ""big bad"" - or at least, a villain of that level. So, while we all wait for the Multiverse, let's discuss the highly divisive Eternals. I'll start with that last sentence. As always, I've been able to avoid trailers and all that, but it was difficult to ignore the negative evolution of critics' general consensus. Usually, these massive blockbusters all mostly greeted with extraordinarily positive reactions that overhype any work. However, it's uncommon for such a considerably well-received movie to exponentially get negative reviews to a point where it becomes 50-50. The narrative issues and structural problems are undeniable from my viewpoint, but they're far from overpowering the numerous excellent aspects of the film. Let me get the bad stuff out of the way then. Eternals holds a team of four screenwriters: Zhao herself, Patrick Burleigh (Peter Rabbit 2: The Runaway), Ryan Firpo, and Kaz Firpo. Most movies within the MCU possess more than just a couple of people responsible for the screenplay, so nothing new here. Nevertheless, I can't help but find the number of writers attached to this film one of the reasons why the movie loses itself amid so much exposition and world-building, forgetting about the characters and the core story. Eternals constantly jumps back and forward in time to explain to the audience everything. Literally everything. From the origin of the Eternals, Deviants, and Celestials themselves to the religious rules, cosmic hierarchy, and principles that the characters must hold close to their hearts. Contrary to what some people may think, this film isn't too long. The 157-minute duration fits the amount of story Zhao and her team desire to establish and develop across that runtime. It's the preparation and execution of said story that doesn't work that well. First of all, the number one mistake filmmakers can make while handling exposition: treating the audience like brainless viewers. Some expository dialogues feel irrelevant and uninteresting in retrospective due to the incessant need to explain plot points or foreshadow events that don't need any of that. These scenes could have been replaced with more character development, something that I was already expecting to be a challenging task. With such a stellar ensemble cast and a group of heroes larger than the first Avengers team, it isn't surprising to see that some characters end up underdeveloped.  It's even more frustrating since every Eternal holds a pretty likable personality. Some get more screentime than others, which is understandable, but the flashbacks lack efficient storytelling concerning both plot and characters. A particular twist is saved for the transition between the last two acts, but its shock value is almost null due to the heavy foreshadowing and repetitive discussion about the topic that leads to that revelation. I also find the Deviants' arc underwhelming, especially when the movie misleads the viewers into believing there's something more to them than what's at the surface. Action-wise, it features the high levels of entertainment fans expect. The distinct superpowers allow for some fascinating combinations, consequently creating thrilling sequences. The visual effects are on-point, but I don't think I've ever called an MCU film ""beautiful"" until now. With the tremendous help of Captain Marvel's DP, Ben Davis, Eternals is the most gorgeous movie in the cinematic universe. From the jaw-dropping wide shots to the more intimate angles, the striking cinematography steals the show in the technical field. Ramin Djawadi's (Game of Thrones) score accompanies the narrative seamlessly throughout the whole runtime, but it's only in the action-packed third act that it really steps up and becomes a chill-inducing factor. The costumes (Sammy Sheldon) look amazing, but I send my congratulations to every department for such a well-produced film. Moving on to what makes this movie one of the riskiest, ambitious films of Marvel's recent years: its themes. Zhao brilliantly walks the thin line between faith and fanaticism, which becomes one of the most captivating storylines of the movie. The Eternals believe in the Celestial Arishem, the God-like figure of their ""religion"". Some characters are blindly devoted to Arishem and follow his commandments without question. Others eventually start seeing the world from their own perspective, forming their own opinions, and making their own decisions. However, it's the middle-ground that Zhao nails perfectly.  A character - who I won't spoil - believes in Arishem as much as the fanatics, but they respect and understand other positions. At a certain point, an impossible moral dilemma is dropped at the feet of our heroes, where basically either they apply what their religion taught them, or they follow their hearts. Honestly, there's no correct answer, and Zhao demonstrates it to the audience through the behavior of each character. Eternals is undoubtedly an exposition-driven story, but its success depends almost exclusively on how the viewer connects with the heroes. I won't delve into detail about everyone, and I might as well praise the exceptional performances already. Everyone embodies their characters effortlessly. The diverse and inclusive cast offers fans of the MCU new favorites, and I stand by the statement that it will be improbable that a viewer doesn't create a connection with someone in the film. In fact, Eternals is a movie of ""firsts"" in many ways.  Not only it contains the first sex scene in the cinematic universe, but it also holds the first deaf character and openly gay family. I wouldn't mention these details - particularly the latter - if it didn't cause so much controversy, including a specific market forbidding the distribution of this film. It's true that in the last few years, studios have tried to force inclusion and diversity into hundreds of projects, leading to movies randomly and weirdly focusing on character traits as if they're something special instead of normalizing them. Zhao is clever enough to handle these sensitive topics carefully. Everything is approached just like every other scene in the film. Every kiss is filmed in the exact same manner, and the sex scene unravels naturally because that's simply how intimacy works. The characters themselves might not all be fully developed, but their relationships feel astonishingly genuine and emotionally compelling. Ikaris (Richard Madden), Sersi (Gemma Chan), Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), Sprite (Lia McHugh), and Thena (Angelina Jolie) are my personal standouts when it comes to the Eternals. However, I find the relationships between Druig (Barry Keoghan) and Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), Thena and Gilgamesh (Don Lee) more worthy of investing on. Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani) is mainly used for comic relief, except for one of my favorite scenes in the movie related to the third act events. In the end, it's Karun (Harish Patel), Kingo's valet, who I remember most fondly. Karun represents the very best in humanity: he's humble, honest, loyal, hardworking, and incredibly grateful. One of the most genuine performances of the whole year. The problem isn't in the characters themselves, but what they do with their allocated screentime. The film feels a tad convoluted and messy at points, but I wholly believe that if the viewers can establish an emotional attachment to some of the characters, these issues may turn out to be insignificant. By the way, Dane Whitman (Kit Harington) is merely a teaser in this movie for what's to come in future content, so moderate your expectations. Don't forget to stay for the credits! Eternals boasts evident narrative issues that affect its overall structure and pacing, but Chloé Zhao still manages to deliver a solid MCU installment. Packed with outstanding performances from the stellar ensemble cast, Zhao still follows some of Marvel's success formulas, but her unique style brings new attributes to the cinematic universe, such as the distinctly gorgeous cinematography and the profound themes of faith and humanity. Despite the exposition-driven screenplay, the admittedly underdeveloped yet inclusive, diverse group of characters hold genuinely compelling relationships. For fans of the mandatory action, the extraordinary entertainment levels are still present, but it's definitely the furthest from the MCU a film has ever been. It's meant to be divisive, but fortunately, I fall on the positive side.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023"," Based on the Marvel comics of the same name, Chloé Zhao’s Eternals is a high budget spectacle full of personal drama and stunning visuals. Telling the story of ten different immortal superheroes and their time protecting Earth, this film is one of Marvel’s most ambitious endeavours to date. However, between multiple character storylines, and a couple of pacing issues, you can’t help but wonder if a story as massive as Eternals is actually suited for the big screen?
 That’s right, even in the colossal world of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, full of lore and even a looming multiverse, Eternals still feels like a massively vast entry in the timeline. The action movie spans over several centuries, offers new insights into space and time, and even recontextualises the big bang itself. Written by Zhao, Patrick Burleigh, Ryan Firpo, and Kaz Firpo, the film follows a group of humanoid ‘aliens’ called Eternals, who serve ancient beings named Celestials. We are introduced to an ensemble of wonderfully unique and diverse characters, who each hold their own extraordinary talents, such as super strength, mind control, and healing abilities.
 On the order of the “Prime Celestial” Arishem, the gang of powerful ‘heroes’ comes to Earth to help civilisation flourish and destroy monsters called Deviants who are inhibiting civilisation’s advancement. However, keeping the peace and maintaining the balance of the universe proves to be more complicated than they originally thought, and after seven centuries of living among humans, the Eternals must question the purpose of their original mission and their very existence.
 Structured as a fractured narrative, the film constantly switches from present-day to flashbacks of the past, in order for the movie to convey the amount of history the group have experienced together over the centuries. However, the central conflict and plotline driving the Eternals happen exclusively in the present day – where half of the Earth’s population has now returned following the events of Avengers: Endgame.
 The actual story of this massive film follows the Eternal Sersi (Gemma Chan), who is now working at a museum with her very mortal boyfriend, Dane (Kit Harington). After noticing strange earthquakes and facing a new Deviant, which were previously considered extinct, Sersi travels the world to re-assemble the Eternals, including her ex-boyfriend Ikaris (Richard Madden). While reuniting with her old comrades, Sersi learns that Earth’s returned population after Thanos’ snapping antics have kickstarted something called “the emergence”, which will destroy the planet if not stopped.
 Now facing a race against time, Sersi continues gathering her friends in hopes that they can band together once again to save the world. While she is globetrotting, we also uncover more of the Eternal’s past and interpersonal drama via flashbacks. We witness the gang of immortals’ experienced history. We see the heroes in an exciting, morally ambiguous light in these moments as they watch colonialism and war unfold from the sidelines silently.
 These flashbacks add extra context and provide some beautifully touching personal moments to the movie. However, besides building up Sersi’s and Ikaris’s romantic past, the flashbacks don’t add much momentum to the immediate story itself, feeling at times like dramatic filler as opposed to offering actual insights. It should be noted that while these personal reflections are taking place, another three plotlines are working in tandem. Besides having to save the world from the “emergence”, the Eternals find themselves hunted by an evolved Deviant who can steal their powers, Sersi uncovers the truth about Arishem’s mission, and Sersi and Ikaris must deal with their lingering feelings for one another.
 As you can see from that very, very brief summary, there is a lot going on in Eternals. Its fresh but jam-packed story proves to be both its appeal, making it stand out as a unique superhero movie, as well as its downfall as it simply takes on too much to truly be a hard-hitting film. While it is exciting to see Marvel show us heroes who will let humans destroy themselves – as interfering in any non-Deviant issues isn’t part of their mission – you can never fully appreciate the new superhero dynamics brought up in Eternals as our attention is spread too thin. With so much story, it seems as if Eternals is better suited as a TV series as opposed to a two-hour feature.
 Zhao works to make us care about all the ten main Eternals, crafting a backstory for each. However, Sersi, as our lead, feels lacklustre in contrast to some of the other characters, who are shown to be just as important as her. In many ways, it feels as if the film is so focused on unpacking each character that it forgets to craft tension and to actually get on with the story – stopping the emergence. Eternals Thea (Angelina Jolie) and Phastos (Brian Tryee Henry) are shown to be more complex and captivating as characters than our chosen lead, and the battles with the Deviants feel like afterthoughts in the massive scope of the story.
 It’s a pity that the huge take on adapting the Eternals for the big screen just missed the mark since the acting in this film is some of the best seen in a Marvel movie, period. Every actor leans fully into their role, managing to portray the darker and emotional taunt side of immortality. Henry and Jolie especially stand out as dramatic drivers in the film, haunted by their past in fascinating ways. At the same time, Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani) and his manager Karun (Harish Patel) give us a perfect display of comedic timing and chemistry.
 Marvel should be applauded for taking risks. However, Eternals proves that pacing and thoroughly adapting your source material for a feature film are the true keys to success – you can’t rest on fresh ideas alone. There are plenty of good ideas here, singular moments to love and appreciate. But at the end of the day, the writing for Eternals trips itself up, and the giant well of storylines, characters and themes strangles the film – preventing it from reaching its potential as something truly special. Still, it is a flick worth seeing and offers a fresh discussion on morality and superheroes that we haven’t seen Marvel approach before.

"Feb 13, 2023"," Eternals is the latest entry into the MCU, directed by Oscar Winner Chloe Zhao. Hot off of the success of Nomadland, the academy award-winning director has been given the opportunity to helm Marvel’s Eternals. The film follows the expedition of Earth by a group of beings created to protect Humanity from the Deviants, over the course of seven millennia. This group of individuals, comprising Ajak, Sersi, Ikaris, Thena, Kingo, Gilgamesh, Sprite, Makkari, Phastos, and Druig, all have their own feelings towards the planet Earth and the humans that inhabit it. If that description feels ambitious, it’s because the film is ambitious. There’s a lot of exposition that needs to be conveyed to the audience for this film, due to the size of the cast, the duration of their lives, and thus complex relationships with one another. And luckily, the film changes the Marvel formula to better tell this story. In utilizing a non-linear plot, the film is able to take us through each of these characters’ lives on Earth, showing us important moments of the past. And these moments in the past are littered with references to ancient mythology that is sure to excite. But in spite of the talented crew behind this film, Eternals is unable to carry the weight of its ambitious scale. The core issues with Eternals are largely found in its script, which lacks subtlety and emotion. To compare it to another 2021 film, Eternals shares the writing problems of Candyman (2021). Both films want to throw around big thematic ideas. So the writing achieves this as efficiently as possible, solely comprising of exposition and explicit theme statements. And while some films are able to move past this, Eternals doesn’t. The pacing of Eternals rarely finds time to sit with these characters, as the story needs to move at a breakneck speed to be told in two and a half hours. And that really holds Eternals back from being a truly great movie. There are plenty of significant moments throughout Eternals that have to be skipped over due to the scale of the project. And there are a lot of dialogue exchanges that tell the audience something important happened in the past, though we don’t see them. But that isn’t to say the entire movie feels rushed. There are some of the sequences that slow down. These are the sequences full of subtle acting and gorgeous cinematography. Even without dialogue, these sequences feel more impactful to the story than any of the words the characters say. Those sequences are the highlights of Eternals, where we see the craftsmanship of everyone involved on display. From the cinematography by Ben Davis to the rousing score of Ramin Djawadi, there’s a hypnotizing effect at the core of Eternals. This is accentuated by Eve Stewart and Clint Wallace’s work on the production design, which brings historical locations like Babylon to life. It’s infinitely grand in scale, and yet infinitely personal in these sequences. And that is largely to do with the performances Zhao is able to get from the stellar cast. Gemma Chan and Richard Madden are stellar, making the relationship between Sersi and Ikaris believable. Angelina Jolie, Kumail Nanjiani, and Ma Dong-Seok all convey their larger-than-life characters with effortless charm. And even the smaller performances from Lia McHugh, Lauren Ridloff, and Barry Keoghan are impactful, bringing the most heart into the film. When the characters stop telling us what occurred in the past and live in the moment with one another, Eternals feels like the best Marvel movie to date. The small exchanges between those characters have humor more in line with The Dark Knight than the bathos style we’ve come to expect from the MCU. It’s a kind of humor that lets you chuckle and smile, and sells the millennium-spanning relationships between these characters. And yet, the majority of Eternals is not these small moments. Once the third act begins, Eternals jumps into lightspeed, trying to resolve each of the character arcs set up earlier in the film. But due to the ambitious size of this story, none of these arcs feel earned. Largely, it’s because this film seems to be missing a central character. Each character has their own mannerisms and beliefs, but none of them has a central arc that pulls us through the story. In the end, it leaves you feeling numb, as each character changes in their own way. But due to the little thematic overlap between these character changes, it lessens the impact of the story at the end. This lack of a uniform idea guiding Eternals is the film’s biggest weakness. While the action looks great, it all feels meaningless. Despite the diversity of the group’s beliefs, there is little conflict between each member on a philosophical level. The action feels big, looks gorgeous, is at times full of tension, but lacks any true meaning. All this goes to say that Eternals is a movie at odds with itself. It’s clearly directed by a master, with great production design, fantastic performances, and impactful cinematography. And there seem to be a few story threads that Zhao really wants to play with: contentment, aid, and the need for companionship. There are fragments of these ideas found in the screenplay, but these ideas are told completely through the performances and cinematography. And on the other hand, there’s a screenplay that operates in either exposition or explicitly stating its theme to the audience. Where Zhao’s style seems to ignore the marvel formula as much as possible, the writing tries to remind the audience it’s a marvel movie. The jokes don’t land, and the references to previous entries feel tiring. From a directorial standpoint, the film is one of the best in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But the screenplay brings this movie down and makes it one of the lesser MCU entries. As a whole, it’s somewhere in the middle; and I hope it’s not the last time Marvel allows a prestigious director to take a shot in the MCU and give a bold take on the formula, flaws and all.",NEGATIVE

"Oct 21, 2022"," After watching Chloé Zhao’s sophomore film, The Rider, I wrote I could not wait to see what Ms. Zhao would come up with next. I ended my review of her third film, Nomadland, noting the movie’s profoundly immersive experience and personal journey. Both have breathtaking visuals, haunting musical scores, and pitch-perfect final scenes. Yet, her Marvel debut is the opposite of anything she’s ever done — she has created something stale, repetitious, and heavy-handed. I’m sorry to say, Eternals is a massive disappointment. Eternals takes place right after Avengers: Endgame, where half the population returns. This causes the band to get back together. Though, none of them are really happy about it because no one seems to love human existence. The group mentioned above is the Eternals, an alien race which the Celestials have created. They have lived on Earth for over 7000 years. They were sent to protect us from the Deviants, a type of humanoid that absorbs powers and is in desperate need of a Snickers. The group’s spiritual leader, Ajak (Selma Hayek), can heal anyone injured while acting as the defacto go-between them and the Celestials. Ikarus (Richard Madden) flies around, shooting beams of cosmic energy from his eyes. He has a history with Sersi (Gemma Chan) who manipulates inanimate matter and is your social worker of the group — she has empathy for humans that the others do not. She looks after Sprite (Lia McHugh), a youthful-looking fairy with an old soul who can project lifelike images. Sersi is dating Dane (Kit Harrington) who holds a secret (you can quickly look up or know if you are versed in the MCU). Are there more? You bet your ass. And the film will keep shoving it down your throat for the first 48-minutes. You have Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), who shoots cosmic energy from his hand as Ikarus does from his eyes. The ice-cold, mind-controlling Druig (Barry Keoghan) and Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry) question protecting a race who do nothing but kill each other. Gilgamesh (Ma Dong-seok) has the hitting power of Mike Tyson in Punch-Out. He watches over Thena (Angelina Jolie), a fierce warrior who creates any weapon with, again, that cosmic energy. She begins to come apart like Mabel in A Woman Under the Influence and is under the care of Gilgamesh. I’ll get right to the point — the script is eternally redundant. The problem is too many hands and rewrites. Starting with Ryan and Kaz Firpo (Child’s Play) and ending with Zhao and Patrick Burleigh (Antman and the Wasp), they spend the first 45 minutes establishing characters. Yes, some exposition is needed, but this MCU entry is filled with lousy exposition from beginning to end. None of it is subtle or folded into the story naturally, like, for example, Denis Villeneuve’s Dune. It, frankly, comes across as patronizing. There is also the consistency problem of their existence that makes it obvious they do not live in secret. Besides the never-ending history of Eternals and the repetitive nature of constantly showing each Eternal’s power (yes, Makkari runs fast, Druig controls minds, and Kingo shoots energy from his hands— we get it), it’s incredibly heavy-handed and preachy by repeating atrocities of humankind. It practically destroys the purpose of the movie. Considering the writers are so set on humans being the problem, destroying each other and ruining humankind, blah blah blah, did they ever consider then this makes the deviants the good guys? Zhao is a director who utilizes real-life people to play themselves or close versions of themselves—like the coward Robert Ford playing himself, shooting Jesse James over a century ago, then going on the road in a Wild West show. However, she has a deep, wonderful cast here. The actors here though are saddled with cookie-cutter characterizations and bland dialogue. The trademark depth is oddly absent. Sure, the backstory of Madden and Chen’s characters makes for a damn fine-looking couple and a human connection, but hasn’t that been done before a million times over? Yes, we have the intelligent Eternal with glasses. Let’s not forget the good-looking Eternal who shoots lasers that match his brooding stare. Yes, the Eternal who is too caring for her good. Even Jolie’s Thena is an outdated metaphor of the trope that a woman can’t handle intense pressure. No worries though, Gilgamesh is there to man-splain things to her. While they have and bring fun to their roles, the talent is so abundant it exposes just how the script is one of the worst Marvel has ever done. I will give Zhao credit. Her beautiful CGI visuals (the creation of turning a bus into an immense amount of what I can only assume are rose petals is breathtaking) are rich and uncommon for the genre. It’s a level of sophistication that the MCU has never had. Which, I’m sure was the reason why she was chosen. I had a film critic mention that she was just the wrong choice for the material. I would point out though her previous films questioned human existence. Harish Patel’s Karun has one of the film’s best scenes that epitomizes that established theme too late. Will Eternals satisfy most action and comic-book genre fans with its talented cast? Yes. It may lay the groundwork for future stories, however, the film is ultimately undone by the story’s lackluster plot. Sending the Eternals to kill the deviants is the equivalent of sending a mongoose to kill a snake, which will cause a chain reaction of needing to grab a wolf to kill the mongoose and so on — it’s the definition of insanity on repeat.

"Aug 16, 2022"," You can count me among the many Chloé Zhao fans out there. The Beijing-born filmmaker has had a short yet prominent career, making a name for herself in the thriving world of independent cinema. Her renown grew even more last year when her film “Nomadland” dominated awards season, taking home Academy Awards for both Best Picture and Best Director. Needless to say, a lot of people became well acquainted with her name. You can also count me among the many who were surprised by the announcement that Zhao would be co-writing and directing the next $200 million installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In one sense it was interesting to see how Zhao’s distinct artistic sensibilities would fit with a mammoth MCU blockbuster. On the other hand, it felt so at odds with what she has become known for. While Zhao unquestionably puts in the effort and gives it her all, “Eternals” is a surprising inert and at times downright dull superhero movie that doesn’t really utilize her strengths. Yes, you can see it working hard to be a departure from the staling Marvel movie norm. Yes, you can see its attempts at humanizing its characters in more intricate ways than past MCU films. But Marvel already has a pretty good track record for digging into the humanity of their heroes. Sadly Zhao and Marvel Studios guru Kevin Feige’s efforts to be something new never goes beyond the optics. The screenplay comes from the writing team of Zhao, Patrick Burleigh, Kaz Firpo, and Ryan Firpo. Their story spans 7000 years, sloppily hopping back-and-forth across their timeline, resulting in an overly long and overstuffed 157-minute running time. To cover all its ground, the story ends up drowning us in exposition, skimming over things that might have been interesting if given enough time. Instead, stuff like Celestial Seeds, the Emergence, a World Forge, etc. means nothing, and goes in one ear and out the other. One key problem with “Eternals” is that it is overloaded with characters, and Zhao tries to give each of them some semblance of a backstory. Inevitably all end up feeling shortchanged to various degrees. A few get more attention which helps in terms of depth. Others have their lives crammed into small segments. It’s obvious Zhao is interested in her characters, but too much of their stories are left on the side. Mainly because the film also needs to build its superhero mythology which too often consists of large and often tedious information dumps.  Storywise, the Eternals are a group of ten good-looking cosmic beings who were sent to Earth eons ago by Arishem the Judge to defend the planet against a ravenous species known as Deviants. Their centuries long war ends in 1500 when the last of the Deviants are finally killed. The Eternals then go their separate ways, with each immortal settling and assimilating into different locations around Earth, waiting for Arishem to summon them home. 500 years pass and each Eternal has carved out a life for themselves (more or less). But when a particularly nasty new Deviant suddenly appears in London, it’s clear that it’s time to get the team back together. Marvel Studios brings in a lot of star power to portray the Eternals and much like the characters themselves, some are much more convincing than others. At the top is Gemma Chan who plays Sersi, an eternal with the weird ability to manipulate matter. Sersi is easily the most complete character and Chan gives a terrific performance full of warmth and compassion. Richard Madden plays Ikaris, a poor man’s Superman and one-time love interest of Sersi. Angelina Jolie plays Thena, a powerful Wonder Woman like warrior who wields weapons made of cosmic energy. She’s haunted by past memories that threaten her and the team. Druig (Barry Keoghan) can control minds and Makkari (Lauren Ridloff ) is the Eternals version of The Flash. Both are two of the movies most intriguing characters but both (especially Makkari) get back-burned. On the downside you have Salma Hayek who plays the team leader Ajak. I love Hayek and there’s nothing wrong with her performance. But she feels woefully out of place in most of the scenes she’s in. The same can be said for Brian Tyree Henry who plays Phastos, a cosmic inventor (for lack of a better description). His story is the most jammed together and almost feels plucked from another movie. And like Hayek he’s not always convincing, especially on the battlefield. Kumail Nanjiani is Kingo, who shoots balls of energy from his fingers and provides tacked on comic relief. But he inexplicably vanishes during the final act. Then you get Don Lee as Gilgamesh (super strength) and Lia McHugh as Sprite (projects illusions) – both are nice presences but both feel like tag-along characters. As the movie predictably brings the former teammates back together, it tries to tell their individual human stories while also building up its cosmic storyline. Surprisingly that leaves little room for superhero action. We do get a couple of set pieces that look fine and checks most of the boxes, but there’s little there that we haven’t seen done better elsewhere. Even the big CGI blowout finale is missing the energy and style of the better Marvel films. Even worse, it has no stakes. Yes, the world is in danger once again. But frankly, I really didn’t care. As I sat through “Eternals” I couldn’t help but think of how it would have fared better as a Disney+ streaming series. There’s very little here that screams big screen movie and giving the characters and their stories more room to develop would have helped tremendously. Instead we get a rare MCU misfire – a flat and flavorless superhero film full of bold ambitions. But in its efforts to realize those ambitions it cuts too many corners and forgets a key ingredient in all of these superhero movies – fun.  Yet all that, at least we have the post credits scenes, right? Don’t worry, no spoilers here. I’ll just say even they fall short. I would laugh off the shockingly bad mid-credits scene as a stunt if it wasn’t actually happening. And the end-credits scene (which is actually pretty exciting), is so poorly put together that many will immediately pull out the phones and go online just to understand what happened. But what can I say? It almost feels like fitting end for a movie that aims at something new, but completely misses its target. “Eternals” is now playing in theaters. Oh this is sad, and even more sadly it’s not the only poor review of this that I’ve read. But I will have to see it anyway of course. I never forget I am the only person in the world who liked Suicide Squad in spite of the reviews! It’s not good. It has some good ideas that just never come together. I was surprised by how flat and uninteresting parts of it is. Yeah I think this movie missed on a great opportunity to introduce this new team. Also there is a massive figure coming out of the Earth and none of the heroes on Earth are aware of this? Ah I did enjoy this, however, I agree with some of the content going in one ear and out the other. There was a lot to take in. Maybe a streaming series would have been better. Ultimately, I really liked this movie, but mostly because of the implications of how the Celestials are going to influence the MCU later on.  There’s definitely some execution issues here that could’ve been better, but I definitely some of the high-level ideas that they were trying to go for.  To me, it’s unlike any other MCU movie I’ve seen before.  Again, it’s mostly the concepts and ideas that I love.  Truth is, you could’ve shave off 20 minutes or so and you wouldn’t have lost anything.  It’s definitely a little long, and some of the chemistry between the characters doesn’t work as well as it should.  Eternals is an ambitious movie, probably the most ambitious that Marvel has attempted thus far.  But as I said, the implications here make me excited for what Marvel is going to try next.  I think the MCU is going to deal with Galactus at some point.  I think that’s one of the directions that the MCU is going towards. It’s funny, the implications didn’t move me much mainly because I still don’t have a good idea of what the MCU is going for right now. Even worse, I left Eternals with no connection to the characters at all. I agree the ambition is there. But the execution left me wondering if this was all Zhao or if Feige was pushing for certain things. I think the whole Infinity Saga exposed the idea of existence-level threats like Thanos.  In my opinion, I think that’s going to be what drives this phase in the MCU.  We’re eventually going to be dealing with forces that will threaten the Celestials themselves, which is why I brought up Galactus.  The Celestials themselves could end up being serious threats.  I think Eternals could’ve done a better job of bringing some of these ideas to life, but I definitely agree with some of the characters feeling flat and uninteresting.  I respect Chloe Zhao, but it seems like she was out of her element here.  Maybe she’ll do a better job with a sequel that Eternals is likely to get. I just got back from the film and I liked it but… I understand your issues as I found the narrative and tone of the film to be uneven.  I think it wants to be a Marvel film but also something more and struggled to find that balance.  Plus, I thought it too long for the team to reunite as it made the whole thing felt uneven for me.  I also think they could’ve trimmed 15 minutes of it.  I enjoyed it but it was flawed. Oh man, I have never rolled my eyes harder than during the first post-credits scene. The second one was really interesting AFTER I went online to actually hear who the voice was. ",NEUTRAL

The Disney-Marvel juggernaut continues with this 26th film in the ""Marvelverse"" and I'd hate to suggest that they've become such an unstoppable force that even governments and nature bow down before them, but is it just a coincidence that our COVID pandemic lockdown ended just a week before this film's opening date? It is a mammoth exercise in a number of ways. As a member of the audience, its an investment in time at nearly three hours, and one that should possibly be undertaken without liquids. As an exercise in storytelling it is ambitious. Kevin Feige and the Marvel team are very experienced in long story arcs and keeping track of thousands of characters and plot threads across their films, but Eternals is almost as jam-packed with those things as all of the 25 previous films combined, with a dozen lead characters and a storyline that takes place over 7,000 years.  It takes a strong person at the helm to control such chaos and for the most part Oscar winner Chloe Zhao pulls it off. Responsible for much of the screenplay, working from years of Marvel comic books and with author credits shared with a handful of other writers, the script races through the millennia at times, at others pausing for the moments that help us understand our lead characters.  The Eternals are an alien race sent to Earth to protect humankind and nurture it through its development while protecting it from a race called the Deviants.  There's a bunch of them, each with their own special powers they employ as a team to save mankind. As the film settles into its current-day storyline, Eternal Sersi (Gemma Chan from Crazy Rich Asians) hasn't seen most of her God-like friends for a dozen centuries. She is living in London and teaching at the Natural History Museum. She has a human boyfriend in Dane (Kit Harrington) and she protectively lives with one of her Eternal friends, the youthful Sprite (Lia McHugh), who despite also being 7,000 years old never grew into adulthood.  Sersi and Sprite are attacked on the London waterfront by a Deviant, thought killed into extinction by the Eternals thousands of years earlier, and so they take off around the world to get the old band back together.  First on the trail is Sersi's former husband Ikaris (Richard Madden) but when hey come to the home of their leader Ajak (Salma Hayek) they find her dead, evidence pointing to death-by-Deviant. That takes them next to the Australian outback to collect Thena (Angelina Jolie) and Gilgamesh (Don Lee), to the Amazon for Druig (Barry Keoghan), to a Bollywood film studio to collect Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), and thence to find Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry) hiding in suburbia and finally Makkari (Lauren Ridloff).  Marvel had a few dozen films to build a sense of motivation and then development for this many characters that eventually came together in The Avengers, but here Chloe Zhao has just half of this film's run-time to do it. It is successful for some characters, and others we barely know. Gemma Chan and Richard Madden enjoy the greater screen time and the greater audience connection.  Smarty funnyman Kumail Nanjiani enjoys the light-relief role as the God turned Bollywood movie star, hiding in plain sight as generations of leading men from the same family film dynasty over a century. His character discussing the action going on around him in filmic terms is the kind of meta stuff Marvel audiences just love.  A Goddess in her own right, Angelina Jolie humbly shares the spotlight, her character having her on moments of comedy and plot-progression, but nonetheless a secondary character.  One of the production decisions I question most vocally is why most of the film's many fight scenes needed to take place at night. Perhaps we were sitting a little too close to the screen but much of the action was hidden by dark and murky lighting and I lost track of much of the action.  The film's best moments come earlier on, as the Eternals live among the humans they love and protect, in ancient cities like Babylon, meticulously recreated (and with a handful of notable historians in the credits contributing to the authenticity). The costuming, set design and CGI here is lovely work, as are the moments of storytelling, aided by Sprite's powers, that are the building blocks for much of mankind's mythology and fables, inspiring the heroic tales Gilgamesh and Athena and Icarus, and even Peter Pan.  What a monumental adjustment Chloe Zhao undertook, moving from her faux documentary small production Nomadland, to the hundreds of millions of dollars and thousands of support staff here. It's not a perfect film, moments are frustrating, some of the storytelling is lazy, but the scale and ambition do pay off despite the exhaustion of it all. ",POSITIVE
"May 18, 2022"," THE STORY – After the return of half the population in Avengers: Endgame (2019) ignites “the emergence,” the Eternals—an immortal alien race created by the Celestials who have secretly lived on Earth for over 7,000 years—reunite to protect humanity from their evil counterparts, the Deviants. ​​​​Going from “The Rider” and “Nomadland” directly to the Marvel Cinematic Universe is a surprising next step for Academy Award-winning writer-director Chloé Zhao. That’s not for lack of talent, though. On the contrary, the recent Academy Award winner is one of the most distinct directors out there working today. Her films focus deeply on everyday characters and their internal human struggles, with her naturalistic sensibilities walking the line between reality and fiction. All of these incredible qualities begged the question: what would a Chloé Zhao Marvel movie look like? Ultimately, Zhao’s introduction on a new ensemble to the MCU, “Eternals,” doesn’t entirely work despite admirable work from the director. The clashing of Zhao’s artistic sensibilities with the bombastic nature of this cinematic universe is a conflict that not even the universe’s mightiest warriors could overcome. “Eternals” may be the most disconnected MCU film since the first “Guardians of the Galaxy.” The titular Eternals have existed on Earth for over 7,000 years, but with a strict mission to protect the world from Deviants, their evil alien counterparts who could destroy humanity. This inflexible mission means that, even after defeating the Deviants hundreds of years ago, the Eternals have remained hidden, not interfering with other conflicts on Earth. Instead, they mostly live modern lives spread out across the globe. There are references to Thanos and the “snap,” and they try to justify the fact that these insanely powerful beings have never helped in any of the Avengers’ battles, but it never makes much sense at all as to why exactly. Now, Deviants have returned to Earth, and the Eternals must reunite to defeat them. While I’d like to discuss the plot further, it’s difficult to dissect it without getting into spoiler territory. From the start, “Eternals” feels incredibly unique in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. There is an epic scale to the storytelling, spanning thousands of years to when the Eternals first came to Earth. We see glimpses of their time throughout history, including with early humans in Mesopotamia, Babylon, and more. Along with the scope of the story itself, the tone of the movie is regal and dignified. It’s a stark contrast to most Marvel films that can blend together in style and tone, even if the films are, for the most part, good. “Eternals” primarily follows Sersi, played by the consistently excellent Gemma Chan (“Crazy Rich Asians“) who leads the charge in reuniting the Eternals to face the Deviants. While not every cast member is given as much material as her, Richard Madden, Brian Tyree Henry, and Lauren Ridloff stood out as steady, reliable heroes with interesting characters worth exploring. Kumail Nanjiani is always hilarious and gets his time to shine as a narcissistic Bollywood star. Barry Keoghan and Lia McHugh have challenging roles, as their motivations aren’t always clear and can be misleading to the audience. This lack of clarity in the script leads to less than stellar performances from both of them and a general confusion overall as the screenplay struggles to juggle multiple characters, even with the over two and a half hour running time. Similarly, Kit Harington is hardly in the story, making his inclusion very strange, other than to set him up for future MCU installments. On the other hand, Salma Hayek and Angelina Jolie are magnificent in their supporting roles, allowing the other cast members to shine, despite arguably being the biggest stars in the movie. With such a diverse cast of actors, the individual performers make a general emotional impact, but the group’s chemistry doesn’t always come through. They’ve known each other for thousands of years, but they often feel a bit awkward around each other in their various interactions ranging from dramatic to light-hearted and comedic. “Eternals” is a film of polarities. Some of the movie’s biggest strengths are also the elements that drag it down. For instance, Zhao’s greatest asset as a filmmaker is her innate ability to dig into the depths of a character, finding every bit of humanity inside of them. This deep sense of character is fresh for the MCU, which is always more about the bigger picture than individual characters, even in their best offerings. And yet, this also becomes a problem when trying to tell such a massive, time-spanning story. How does one communicate deeply felt emotions and relationships that have developed over thousands of years? It’s no easy task, and the final result ends up feeling more unsatisfying than anything. Similarly, a strength of “Eternals” is how much it tries to stand on its own, setting the stage for a new chapter in the MCU. It’s always refreshing when a Marvel film avoids unnecessary cameos from preexisting MCU stars. And yet, this desire to be its own unique entry feels at odds with who the Eternals are. When they’ve existed for thousands of years, it’s a significant story problem that they’ve never interfered with battles before, even when Thanos made half of the universe disappear. The film tries to explain this away, but it’s never conveyed believably. Disconnecting from the MCU, though admirable, doesn’t make sense in this context. There are almost as many references to Batman and Superman as to the MCU, which is as fascinating as it is bewildering. Aside from the story’s problems, Zhao’s work as a director is pretty powerful. We’ve not seen her direct action scenes before, and it works rather well here. While birthed out of a weak script, the variety of powers amongst this ensemble makes for exciting action sequences, taking place over vast landscapes. “Eternals” is perhaps the best-looking Marvel film to date, shot by cinematographer Ben Davis, largely thanks to the reliance on natural exterior locations rather than soundstages. There are lots of long, lingering shots aided by natural light, bringing a much-needed visual shakeup to a series that’s needed it for a long time. Ultimately, “Eternals” is a mixed bag. The highs are high, but the film’s poor script cannot sustain the epic scope and many new characters it is trying to introduce. Still, Zhao’s talent as a director is never in question. Instead, it will be fascinating to find out what Zhao will do next in her career, now that she has a $200 million movie under her belt. “Eternals” may be one of the weakest Marvel movies yet, but there is still enough to enjoy as it propels us into a new and uncertain future for the franchise.

"Mar 13, 2022","We have to wonder what kind of movie Zhao would have made left to her own devices. We suspect it would have less CGI monsters and more ruminations on character, immortality and watching humanity evolve.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2022"," Who are the Eternals? We all had this same kind of question when Marvel Studios rolled the dice on introducing The Guardians of the Galaxy to their sprawling Marvel Cinematic Universe in 2014. As we know, the Guardians went on to become a highlight among the studio’s movie-adapted superheroes and a key component to the unfolding of Marvel Studios’ Infinity Saga. But this is what the MCU has been great at since pop culture was introduced to Iron Man in 2008: bringing characters on the fringes of their comic book lore and presenting them as high profile components to an ever-evolving and interwoven cinematic superhero story. Now, waist-deep in Phase 4 of the MCU, audiences now have a new set of heroes to explore, and they are the Eternals. Sent to Earth seven thousand years ago to protect mankind from ravenous monsters called Deviants and to aid in the evolution of human civilization, Eternals are bound to the mission given to them by Arishem, a giant universe-monitoring celestial being. Thanos’ plan to end half of life across the universe wasn’t enough to call Eternals to action, but what’s occurring now after “the blip” is an awakening that the team has to investigate and figure out how to stop without disrupting the proliferation of life across the universe. In this movie, the Eternals are an immortal team made up of ten members, each with their own abilities, their own internal conflicts, their own motivations, and their own levels of affection for the people of Earth. Ajak, played by Selma Hyak, is the appointed leader of the team, with Sersi (Gemma Chan), Ikaris (Richard Madden), Thena (Angelina Jolie), Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), Sprite (Lia McHugh), Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), Druig (Barry Koeghan), Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), and Gilgamesh (Ma Dong-seok) following her command until she is inexplicably attacked and killed by Deviants, ultimately passing the mantle of leadership to Sersi. Coming off of her critically acclaimed and Oscar winning film Nomadland, director Chloe Zhao brings to the Marvel Cinematic Universe a more grounded approach to filmmaking. Yes, there's action scenes and impressive CGI sequences, but there are also naturally gorgeous practical effects and stunning cinematography infused throughout the production unlike anything we've seen in the MCU so far. It’s a beautiful film to watch with visually stunning sequences worthy of the big screen experience. But the other impressive thing about how this film is how the team of characters is crafted and how diversity and representation is accomplished. Though the Eternals features an eclectic mix of minority female characters in team-leading roles, another young female character, a Korean character, a Pakistani character, a married gay black father, white male characters, a character with a mental disability, and a deaf character (a demographic we’re seeing much more prominently in mainstream films like A Quiet Place, The Sound of Metal, and this year’s Sundance hit and Apple TV+ Original Film CODA), the film is never overt or pandering about its diverse cast and characters. They are who they are. They come with their strengths, their flaws, and their worldviews, and the inclusion of so many different types of people couldn’t have felt more organic. While there is much to appreciate about this reimagining of what a Marvel Studios movie could look like, Eternals comes with some deficiencies as well; namely scripting and editing. It’s no easy feat to juggle so many characters’ stories over multiple time periods, and the challenge proves daunting for this production. As each character is assimilated back into the team thousands of years after their dispersing, the film whiplashes back and forth in time to cover their pasts, which can be disorienting over the 2 hour and 40 minute runtime. Additionally, while the film builds up to an epic and climactic battle, the climax sputters to a lackluster resolution, leaving much to be desired from a film that, up to that point, rides high on its fresh take of ensemble entertainment. But ultimately, Eternals is a Marvel film that does its best to bring practicality back to superhero filmmaking. Endowing its heroes and villains with reasonable intentions and moral dilemmas, this is a film that admirably attempts to appease many types of moviegoers, even if its story falls short. Regardless, mainstream audiences can now discover who the Eternals are, and with much to enjoy and much to discuss about the film, Eternals - for better or worse - have made a lasting impression on the MCU.

"Mar 3, 2022"," So, what are the Eternals? Put simply, they are a group of celestial alien beings with various powers who are tasked with protecting the world from Deviants, carnivorous beasts who share a similar extra-terrestrial origin. They have lived quietly among us for over 7,000 years, witnessing the evolution of mankind and even helping us along the way, but never involving themselves in human conflict that doesn’t involve Deviants. With their foes defeated and the Eternals scattered across the globe for centuries, they are called back together as Deviants begin to resurface and Sersi (Gemma Chan) reluctantly becomes their new leader. An Oscar winning director, numerous ceiling-breaking characters, and an eye-watering cast. Eternals should have fans salivating, but thus far it’s seemed like the warm up act for December’s Spider-man: No Way Home. These priorities are well placed. Eternals is a serious film, in which serious and attractive people discuss things, often while staring across the horizon. The stakes are explained and made abundantly clear, the lore comes thick and fast as a whole new wrinkle in the universe is revealed. How this all fits in with the upcoming multiverse, I have no idea, and the convoluted plot may alienate the more casual Marvel fan. A complex moral quandary threatens to split the superhero team in two, as they fight for the survival of our planet, all framed through Zhao’s miraculously beautiful lens. It is a big budget movie efficiently made, but that efficiency also makes it joyless. Zhao made her name as a director who captured the human condition, and so it’s odd to find her blockbuster debut feeling so detached. The leads are serene and poised, but one dimensional – Chan is heroic, but doesn’t show much in between the big speeches to make you care about her plight. Richard Madden’s Ikaris, who is so much like Superman it’s even mentioned in one scene, has nothing to him other than a steely stare and lifeless delivery. These two characters are the main focus of a busy film, but every time they share the screen it feels like a distraction. Angelina Jolie is puzzling as Thena, an Eternal with a condition that affects her memory and makes her violent (a kind of space dementia). A star of her calibre would be expected to play either the lead, or a mentor role like Salma Hayek’s Ajak. Instead, she’s one of the gang, and while she has her own side plot, it is a bit jarring, like if Denzel Washington played War Machine in Iron Man, or if Leonardo DiCaprio played Vision. You keep looking at Jolie, expecting something to happen that never materialises. It also doesn’t help that Jolie looks as though she’d rather be anywhere else. There are some gems to be found in the wider cast, which features some firsts for the MCU and Hollywood in general. Barry Keoghan is charismatic as Druig, an Eternal who can control humans’ minds and has his own ideas about their progression; while young Lia McHugh is terrific as Sprite, a Tinkerbell-like character who mixes things up in the group. Kumail Nanjiani made headlines with his dramatic body transformation to play Kingo, an Eternal who becomes a Bollywood icon, but the real praise should be for his wit, offering refreshing bursts of humour and personality in a dour film. Far and away the most interesting, however, is Brian Tyree Henry as Phastos, the Eternal with a gift for inventing machinery and weapons, who discovers with horror what mankind does with his gifts. It’s a fascinating arc that could have merited its own movie, but as it is he shines in a supporting role, which also happens to be the first gay MCU character. Considering how LGBTQ+ representation has been bungled in the past by Disney, his relationship is presented in a refreshingly wholesome way.  But this can’t overcome a film that takes an age to arrive at a familiar place. Yes, there are a plethora of new terms, species, and legends to learn, but it all boils down to heroes preparing for the big battle at the end. It’s visually impressive, particularly when the camera flies around the universe, and will be enough for those who just need something to tick them over while they wait for Spidey. However, it’s missing the sense of fun that made the biggest franchise in the world so popular.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 25, 2022"," Unlike some of the world since the beginning of Covid’s ugly head, I have still resisted going to the movie theaters to watch the most current and theatrically released movies. Thus, I haven’t seen The Eternals until its release on Disney plus. Though some of the initial reviews were critical, I saw a recent headline in which the reviewer said he or she actually liked it better on demand than in the theaters, so there is that. I’ll say one thing having just watched it on Disney plus. Due to the increasing complexities of the Marvel Universe and the plethora of hero names and more, I did enjoy the process of watching this film, as I was able to stop at the introduction of each new name and subsequent superpowers.  Does anyone else watch Marvel movies (or any complex movies) this way? Or am I just a super nerd? Let me know in the comments below. I enjoyed The Eternals quite a bit, and though my all-time favorite is still Avengers: Endgame, there were a lot of great new content themes and storylines I am interested to see develop as the Marvel Universe continues to unfold in all of its wild ways. In my reviews, I give my score from 0 to 10 on a one point decimal scale. I feel I can be the most fair that way. As a film lover, I don’t give a lot of terrible reviews, because I appreciate the work that goes into them so much. That said, there are a few over the years that have garnered a “Rotten” on my Rotten Tomatoes critic page. An interesting storyline in the Marvel Universe that in my opinion, proves how the status quo just might miss the most impactful reason comic books existed in the first place. In my view, comic readers will likely appreciate this movie more. The Eternals, a race of immortal beings with superhuman powers who have secretly lived on Earth for thousands of years, reunite to battle the evil Deviants. This is an entirely new world for me, as I am sure it is for any Marvel movie lover that hasn’t read The Eternals comic books. I never did. But I am interested to go back and look into some of them.  So in pretty quick fashion, we are introduced to the team of Eternals, Ikaris (Richard Madden) who can fly and shoot lasers from his eyes, Sersi (Gemma Chan) who controls the elements of objects, the leader Ajak (Salma Mayek) who can communicate with the god-like celestial Arishem, Sprite (Lia McHugh) a creator of life-like images, Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry) the inventor, Thena (Angelina Jolie) a warrior and creator of weaponry, Gilgamesh (Ma Dong-seok) who has great strength, Makkari (Lauren Ridloff) a deaf Eternal with vibration sensitivity and super speed, Druig (Barry Keoghan) who has mind control, and Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani) who controls balls of energy.  An appreciative shout to Harish Patel as Kingo’s valet and assistant Karun, who provides some truly delightful banter traded with Nanjiani. In fact Nanjiani’s antics throughout the film, caused me to laugh out loud quite a few times.  One nice thing to me about The Eternals is that there wasn’t any real dead time. Even the less action-packed moments of the film were filled with relevant information that was also mind-capturing. Wait a minute, were you controlling my mind to enjoy this film Druig?  The main points of conflict in the film were the interactions between Sersi and Arishem, the god-like being who decides whether a planet lives or dies. This makes me wonder out loud, is there some relation to Galactus here? For those of you who don’t know, Galactus was a literal eater of planets in the Marvel Universe, or in this case, should I say universes? The fighting between the The Eternals and the deviants, aka Apex hunters aka human eaters, was complex and satisfying. I rarely knew who may or may not win any particular fight, which is nice to experience.  I liked all of the actors in this film. They all did exceptional jobs as their heroic characters. I do want to commend Kumail Nanjiani for his hilarity as Kingo, the multi-generational Bollywood actor — whose love for his own image on film gave me persistent reasons to laugh and smile.  I also appreciated Ma Dong-seok as Gilgamesh, the Eternal with exceptional strength, who was unafraid to show his vulnerable side, much in the same way the mighty Thor might show that his feelings are hurt at a mean comment about his weight.  I really enjoyed the film. My all-time favorite movie moment? I have to say the interaction between Kingo and Druig, when Kingo said that he was also a director of online content, who “doesn’t do it for the views,” had me rolling on the floor.  I understand why, even though I really enjoyed the film. In the movie world, people want action packed sequences, eye-watering special effects and mind-blowing explosions. Today’s audiences likely tire out from emotional bonding, love affairs and mindful eternal struggles. But the emotional connections between Sersi and Icarus (including a kiss from the past) were truly heartfelt and believable due to exceptional cinematic chemistry between the two. The Eternals, in my view, is showing to the world why comic books were not for everyone. As a young kid living in my own world, going to Geoffrey’s Comics in Gardena, a few blocks from Compton Blvd. I went into the store each week with my allowance, eagerly looking for each new month’s treasure — delivered to the overly-crowded comic book shelves. I interacted with other kids who were also disregarded, ignored, bullied or told they were not allowed to hang out with the other kids. Comic books were my refuge. I fantasized every day about being able to jump from tall buildings, shoot webs from my web shooters, read the minds of my enemies, cut through walls with adamantium claws or walk through walls.  I don’t think a lot of other kids at my school did this. I was part of the minority population of kids. I was unpopular. I was not part of the status quo. Movies were different. Everyone I know has gone to the movies for their entire lifetimes. So what happens when there is a combination of efforts? What happens when the mindset of the moviegoer tries to combine with the mindset of a comic book nerd? There is a battle of mindsets. These mindsets often do not agree with each other. I remember reading The Uncanny X-Men as a kid. As I write this now, I can feel the quiet solitude of these memories overwhelm me in the most comforting ways. I can hear the quiet pages turning, smell the comic newsprint paper, and I can see the ads for Mr. Atlas, funny posters, or joke gum and smoke from your fingers magic tricks. I even ordered a few of these items over the years. I remember the characters in the X-Men by name, Kurt Wagner as Nightcrawler, Jean Grey as Phoenix, Charles Xavier as the professor with the world’s strongest psychic mind, Kitty Pryde and Logan as Wolverine. Movie audiences don’t want emotional struggles in their Marvel movies to the extent that comic enthusiasts do. It is not an easy thing to do for Kevin Fiege, it has to be a heck of a hard job.  Before I leave you all — and thank you so much for reading my reviews as always — I have a few completely unsubstantiated predictions that bear no proof to what might actually happen. During The Eternals, Makkari, played by Lauren Ridloff, who you might recognize from The Walking Dead, uses American sign language quite often. If you haven’t yet watched Hawkeye on Disney plus, both Clint Barton/Hawkeye and Maya Lopez/Echo also both use sign language. I predict that Makkari and Echo will be teaming up. Perhaps Hawkeye might even make an appearance. I don’t know to what extent, but I do think this will happen. Galactus and Arishem will eventually interact, or heck, maybe they are even the same entity. I don’t really know, but I just assert there will be some connection. They both have watched planets get destroyed, so some connection will surface. Sersi is dating Dane Whitman at the beginning of The Eternals. For those of you who don’t know the name, Whitman is the secret identity of the Black Knight, a man who inherits an evil and cursed sword giving him the powers of the Black Knight.  Again, I have zero proof. But the introduction of Thanos’ brother Starfox, just gives me a bit of pause to question and wonder how marvel might introduce Secret Wars, the biggest Marvel series and most all-inclusive series ever to hit the Marvel Universe.  Vincent Schilling, Akwesasne Mohawk, is the founder and editor of Native Viewpoint.

"Feb 23, 2022"," One can only hope this is a failure solely based on Chloé Zhao being the wrong filmmaker to work within the confines of the Marvel machine, and not a sign of things to come from her in the future. Drowning in too many characters, convoluted plotting and disappointingly bad visuals, Chloé Zhao’s ‘Eternals,’ based on comic book characters created by Jack Kirby in 1976, follows a group of immortal aliens who have spent the last seven thousand years protecting the humans of Earth from evil, primitive, animalistic creatures called Deviants. They seemingly accomplish their mission, forcing the Deviants into extinction. As the film progresses the group learns more about the true nature of their mission, the Deviants return, bigger and badder than ever, and the heroes must learn to face the most human of all traits: free will. Zhao’s cast is filled with mostly character actors who finally get an A-list treatment. At the center is Gemma Chan as an empathetic Sersi who can manipulate matter through physical contact. Chan is an intriguing actress who often brings complex emotions to her characters, so the casting is apt, though unfortunately the film rarely allows her the time to feel like a true protagonist. Same goes for Richard Madden, as her sometime love interest Ikaris, who much like in Greek mythology can fly, but also harbors some dark secrets. Madden is all brooding looks, an immortal Superman-esque sadboy. Much hype was made of Kumail Nanjiani's physical transformation as Kingo, who can shoot cosmic energy from his hands, and for the last hundred or so years, has built himself up as an acting dynasty in Bollywood. Nanjiani is the actor best suited for the witty banter that has become a trademark of the MCU, but much of his one-liners land flat amongst a cast ill-prepared to match him snap for snap. Bollywood mainstay Harish Patel often steals the show as Kingo’s manager Karun, who is effortlessly funny, yet also adds some much-needed poignancy to the film’s more emotionally urgent moments. Brian Tyree Henry does the best he can as Phastos, a scientist and the MCU’s first openly queer character. It’s a pity that he has absolutely no chemistry with his on-screen husband, and is mostly strapped with fairly hetreonormative ideas of queer life. In perhaps the film’s most absolutely ill-conceived scene, not only does he blame his technology for the bombing of Hiroshima, Zhao shoots the sequence with him being comforted amongst the bleak, blasted remains of thousands of nameless Japanese. Also, for a film touted as queer representation, Zhao’s insistence on pairing off all the Eternals into heteronormative couplings, as if the only outcome of spending thousands of years together is that the male-presenting and female-presenting immortal beings will eventually end up together, feels like a slap in the face. I’d almost rather go back to a sexless MCU than this aggressive heteronormativity. The biggest disappointment in terms of untapped potential is Barry Keoghan as Druig, who can manipulate the minds of others. Keoghan is a once-in-a-generation presence on screen. There is currently no one doing unsettling like him, and you can see glimmers of what makes him such a beguiling presence on screen every so often. Yet it seems Zhao is determined to damper the unique energies of her performers, to turn down their shine until they all feel like a similar shade of bland. Lia McHugh plays Sprite, a pixie who can project life-like illusions but is forever trapped in the body of a pre-teen girl. There’s an episode of 'Highlander: The Series' that is more nuanced in the way it explores what it's like to be an immortal child, if you’re interested in seeing this story done well. We’ve also got the MCU’s first deaf character in Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), who can run really, really fast. That’s pretty much all we get to know about her. Also, she’s after some green tablet, but we never find out what its significance is. Then there is Salma Hayek, at the helm of the group, as Ajak. She communicates with their leaders, the Celestials, and has hidden the true nature of their mission from the heroes. She’s also barely given anything to do beyond a few stern speeches to her team. How you waste a star like Hayek would be the biggest mystery in the film if it didn’t also star Angelina Jolie. How can you cast a star with her megawattage as Athena - here called simply Thena - the goddess of war, and make her so dull is truly one for the ages. Aiming for shell-shocked and wise, Jolie’s performance is undercut every time she begins to do something remotely interesting, as Zhao’s camera cuts away to something else. Even her connection with fellow Eternal Gilgamesh (Don Lee) is so undercooked it’s hard to see why he’d sacrifice anything for her, and later why she’d be moved to seek revenge for him. Hampered by too many characters, the plot is equally underdeveloped beyond the major beats. After learning the true purpose of their existence, suddenly our heroes have a ticking clock set before the actual end of the world. This is where American exceptionalism becomes human exceptionalism, and the safety of our planet is weighed as more important than thousands of other civilizations waiting to be born. Okay. Sure. I guess that makes sense when all the terrible things humans have actually done to the planet, like the melting of the ice caps, are easily explained away by the Celestials’ actions. It’s easier to see us as better than we are when there’s a big bad out there in space actually to blame. More disappointing than any of the ham-fisted plotting or underdeveloped characterization, is the filmmaking itself. The stunning compositions and natural light that permeate Zhao’s earlier films made with long-time cinematographer Joshua James Richards are rendered flat under the weight of the Marvel house style, mostly lensed by Ben Davis. Even the shots in South Dakota have none of the majesty we know Zhao and Richards have brought to the location in the past. How everything that felt fresh and unique and uncompromising in her earlier films is completely lacking in this film serves as a testament to how important the collaboration between director and cinematographer can truly be. Ultimately, ‘Eternals’ is a story about how empathy is the greatest strength of all, unfortunately that lesson is hampered by the physical strength-based action set pieces on which the MCU has built its style. One can only hope this is a failure solely based on Zhao being the wrong filmmaker to work within the confines of the Marvel machine, and not a sign of things to come from her in the future.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 21, 2022"," It’s no small feat of irony that “Eternals,” the 26th Marvel Cinematic Universe chapter, opens with talk of cosmic balance. A nod to when the box office’s favorite genocidal alien was waxing poetic about his world galaxyview? Maybe. But it’s also hard not to consider cosmic balance in the context of the movie’s director, Chloé Zhao, an Oscar-winning arthouse titan in her own right who up to this point has worked to expand American cinema during a time when the MCU has succeeded by streamlining it. Many an indie filmmaker has been welcomed into franchise architect Kevin Feige’s embrace only for their idiosyncrasies to vanish within his grand designs. Perhaps reflective of its own kind of triumph, “Eternals” provides a comparatively clear view of Zhao reaching to pull the MCU to more contemplative places than spandexed showdowns and rollicking set pieces. But her grip is tenuous, and you can almost imagine Feige pointing the industrial-sized fan in her direction, tossing in handfuls of colorful confetti whenever he worries that audiences won’t recognize the series’s jaunty painlessness amid the naturally lit pondering Zhao prefers. The result is a two-and-a-half-hour epic which unfolds across centuries, civilizations and tonal commitments, doing more than the last several franchise entries combined but accomplishing very little as it slots itself alongside this year’s “Black Widow” and “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings” as another pseudo-family reunion story. The titular family here is bound not by blood but by directive. Created several thousand years ago – at the dawn of time, you might say – by a great galactic being, Arishem, the Eternals are superhoic beings dispatched to Earth as humanity’s guardian angels. They’re a dutiful posse as distinct in their powers as they are ambiguous in personality. Thankfully for our human ancestors, it’s the laser beam-shooting eyes of Ikaris (Richard Madden), the speedster trickery of Makkari (Lauren Ridloff) and the violent swagger of Thena (Angelina Jolie) that prove useful in taking down the monstrous Deviants during Mesopotamian times, not personality. That doesn’t stop sparks from flying between Ikaris and Gemma Chan’s matter-manipulating Sersi, however, and in their MCU-rare moment of sexual consummation (don’t worry, parents, your kids have seen steamier TV ads) resides the seeds of “Eternals” as a halfway-fruitful and pop culturally relevant exploration about what happens when creations take on a life of their own. You can feel Zhao’s eagerness to expand on those ideas come the present day, when centuries of bearing witness to Earth’s population growing on parallel tracks of capability and viciousness while being forbidden to stop the bloodshed has made the immortal Eternals a sympathetic but passive bunch (the apocalyptic skirmish between Thanos and the Avengers is below-the-fold news to these gods). Sersi is now a lecturer on the ancient arts and dating a different Stark brother, Kit Harrington’s Dane, but when a Deviant surfaces for the first time in centuries it isn’t as much a shock to her system as when Ikaris blasts in to save the day. So begins a road trip to bring the Eternals back under one roof after the loss of their commander, a regal Salma Hayek’s Ajak, leaves the group rudderless about what their mission on Earth was in the first place and who it makes them now. In that muted suspense, the movie manages to be one of the scant MCU entries to acknowledge the existence of emotional conflict. What’s lacking is enough self-awareness to bring the best out of the paradoxical partnership between Zhao’s textured melancholy and Feige’s two-dimensional sense of spectacle. In the spirit of the Russo brothers dubiously citing “The Parallax View” and “Three Days of the Condor” as inspiration for their own MCU efforts, “Eternals” might very well be the MCU’s biblical epic. Only I don’t recall Pontius Pilate cracking wise before ordering Christ to the cross. On paper, “Eternals” represents a union of director to material as inspired as it is surprising. Perhaps the most philosophical MCU entry to date and certainly the most existential, “Eternals” makes a bid at externalizing the enormity which underscores “The Rider” and “Nomadland,” turning Zhao’s contemplative protagonists into humbled wanderers. She excels at fashioning time’s ceaseless passage into its own kind of cataclysm, and in a story which echoes “Pinocchio” when the Eternals begin to think, dream and act for themselves, one sees how she might be well suited to take the source material’s gargantuan canvas and give it a depth to justify the heaps of dry exposition. The problem is that in order to maintain a semblance of momentum, “Eternals” employs a momentum-stifling boomerang narrative structure; that, combined with a cast bigger than all of Zhao’s prior features combined, neutralizes the emotional intensity of this cosmic melodrama. The line between self-awareness and self-parody turns fuzzier than the army of roaring, rubbery Deviants the conflicted heroes were ostensibly created to pick off so many millennia ago. Sersi is the closest thing to being an audience proxy, but Kumail Nanjiani’s cosmic gunslinger Kingo makes for a distractingly unfunny audience tour guide. That “Eternals” co-opts Nanjiani’s tempered but here ill-advised brand of absurdity only further muddles priorities when Kingo’s bits force the arcs of his vastly more tortured companions to be compressed. This is how the movie arrives so suddenly at the moment of one of humanity’s greatest atrocities without justifying a harrowing, imagined connection to genius inventor Phastos (a brilliant, underused Brian Tyree Henry), and how it so startlingly asks that we buy into the youngest Eternal’s suppressed adoration which stretches a love triangle into a trapezoid. In light of Marvel recently capping an impressive – and it is impressive, no matter what your investment in these movies – “Infinity Saga” culminating in Iron Man’s aptly emotional sacrifice, it’s mighty off kilter and slightly disorienting how “Eternals” asks that we invest wholeheartedly in its carousel of protagonists via a single movie. Then again, there are moments when two characters share a quiet space just long enough for Zhao to unearth some unspoken, powerful reckoning, and the fascinating, flawed experiment is almost made worthwhile. A magnetic Jolie, for her part, and in a role written in hardscrabble, injects a subdued gravitas the likes of which only a handful of actors have been able to gift the MCU, even as her part feels merely outlined. Like many movies before it – though unlike most every movie in the MCU – “Eternals” is a vastly more interesting movie to ponder and talk about than to watch. Where it falls short isn’t a matter of whether or not the MCU should stay in its lane; that Feige is willing to explore what these movies can be is an exciting proposition after two dozen movies of just-good-enough superhero sameness. But the harder this intermediary, conceptually fascinating Marvel chapter veers from the familiar, the harder it collides with the guardrails of frustrating MCU formula. In her magnificently messy story about puppeteered, all-powerful beings snapping their strings, it’s a considerable achievement that Zhao at least manages to bring some tension to her own.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 19, 2022"," THE FINAL OPTION (1982). As a kid who was raised Republican, I enjoyed The Final Option upon its initial release for its gung-ho action and chest-beating jingoism; as an adult who saw the liberal light while in college, I now “enjoy” the film for its dum-dum politics and inane plotting. Admired by Ronald Reagan (and, presumably, Margaret Thatcher), this casts Lewis Collins as Peter Skellen, a member of Britain’s military unit the SAS (Special Air Service). Skellen is chucked out of the SAS for being a bloody sadist and subsequently joins the anti-nuclear terrorist group the People’s Lobby. But wait! Skellen hasn’t really been thrown out of the SAS — this is actually a fib so that he may infiltrate the People’s Lobby and discover what nefarious deeds its members have planned. Placing queen and country over wife and baby, he shacks up with group leader Frankie Leith (Judy Davis) and learns that the outfit plans to hold hostage a number of American diplomats. These anti-nuke nitwits hope to illustrate the evils of nuclear power by forcing those in charge to, uh, launch a nuclear missile at Scotland. It’s quite daft, but no more so than the fact that every terrorist aside from the swooning Frankie knows that Skellen is a spy but lets him hang around anyway (maybe because he’s revealed to be a terrible and ineffectual spy?). Released in the U.K. as Who Dares Wins, The Final Option was expected to make a movie star out of Collins, who was a hit on the TV show The Professionals and considered to be a leading candidate to replace Roger Moore as the next James Bond. But while fine on The Professionals, he’s a humorless bore here, overshadowed by former Hammer actress Ingrid Pitt as a terrorist harpy and Richard Widmark as a sarcastic U.S. Secretary of State. The action is still aces, though. HOUSE OF GUCCI (2021). One of the major cinematic disappointments of 2021, Ridley Scott’s House of Gucci is a film that wildly careens between a dour biopic and a rowdy camp fest without slowing down to take the curves. Based on Sara Gay Forden’s novel The House of Gucci: A Sensational Story of Murder, Madness, Glamour, and Greed, it stars Lady Gaga as Patrizia Regiani, a social climber who marries into the Gucci family and finds herself frequently combating its various members, including her mousy husband Maurizio (Adam Driver), his cold-hearted father Rodolfo (Jeremy Irons), his garrulous uncle Aldo (Al Pacino), and his dim-witted cousin Paolo (Jared Leto). Patrizia’s opportunistic zeal eventually leads to her asking her friend and psychic adviser Pina (Salma Hayek) to help arrange an assassination of one of the men in the clan. House of Gucci might have worked as a bombastic pseudo-morality tale (like Pacino’s Scarface) or an eccentric black comedy (like Irons’ Reversal of Fortune, reviewed here), but Scott and scripters Becky Johnston and Roberto Bentivegna opt instead for an unsavory gumbo of conflicting tones, styles and attitudes. Leto’s performance is utterly ridiculous, and it’s astonishing that he’s been nominated for various awards (only that Razzie nod for Worst Supporting Actor seems appropriate). Buried under pounds of latex, he’s a buffoonish caricature, whether he’s whining about his sorry lot in life, discussing his “small peaches,” or worrying that his imprisoned father will “bend over to pick up the soap.” House of Gucci was expected to be a major Oscar contender, but its sole nomination was for Best Makeup and Hairstyling. THE HURT LOCKER (2009). Kathryn Bigelow made history when she became the first woman to win the Academy Award for Best Director. Her victory lap came with this Iraq War drama in which the three members of a bomb squad ply their trade during the last six weeks of their tour of duty in 2004. Staff Sergeant William James (Jeremy Renner) is the leader of the outfit, a man as reckless as he is efficient when it comes to defusing bombs. Sergeant J.T. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) is the most professional — that is to say, most stable — member of the team, anxious to get away from a job he despises. And Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) is the young pup of the outfit, a clean-cut kid terrified that his life will soon get snuffed out. Scripter Mark Boal focuses all of his attention on the soldiers who are placed in the line of fire, never allowing any political discourse to enter the conversation — it’s an acceptable decision in that it pays sincere tribute to Americans willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for their country. The movie works best when its storytelling remains shaggy; it gets into real trouble when it introduces a forced subplot in which James sets out to avenge the death of a friend. But never does Bigelow falter in her direction, which, by adroitly alternating between muscular and sensitive, reapplies a recognizable face to a conflict that has largely slipped from the American public conscious with all the wispiness of a bad dream. Nominated for nine Academy Awards (including a Best Actor bid for Renner), this earned six, including Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, and the aforementioned Best Director. The Hurt Locker has just been released on 4K UHD in a steelbook edition currently only available at Best Buy. Extras consist of audio commentary by Bigelow and Boal; a behind-the-scenes featurette; and an image gallery. LIAR’S MOON (1982). Fans of 1985’s Clue might be surprised to learn that the board-game adaptation wasn’t the first movie to be released to theaters with different endings. Apparently, the same thing happened earlier with Liar’s Moon, an inert indie melodrama that, depending on where one saw it, ended with either a happy fade-out or a tragic denouement. Alas, the film is such a grueling watch that the proper reaction to either ending is a well-timed raspberry. In one of his earliest appearances, Matt Dillon stars as Jack Duncan, a farmer’s son living in the small town of Noble, Texas, in the late 1940s. Jack falls in love with Ginny Peterson (Cindy Fisher), the daughter of respected banker Alex Peterson (Christopher Connelly) — while Jack’s own father (Hoyt Axton) sees nothing wrong with this budding relationship, his mother Babs (Maggie Blye) and Ginny’s dad are both determined to see it not flourish. But the kids won’t be deterred, and they move to Louisiana since it’s a state where 17-year-olds (like Ginny) can get married without parental approval. The reason Alex and Babs are against this union isn’t revealed until the final stretch, but it’s remarkably easy to guess within the first 15 minutes. Of course, there’s a late-inning twist that upends what has already transpired, but it’s both bathetic and pathetic. Dillon and Fisher are fine, while Oscar winner Broderick Crawford (All the King’s Men) is wasted as a Peterson family member who wanders in and out of a couple of scenes for little apparent reason. And what’s with Jack’s horny best friends, both seeming to have been teleported over from the same year’s Porky’s? Liar’s Moon is the latest title being released on Blu-ray as part of the MVD label’s Rewind Collection (with the case designed to look like that of a VHS rental). Extras include a retrospective making-of featurette; a piece on the film’s music; and an alternate ending (i.e. the theatrical one not used for the feature presentation on this disc). REMO WILLIAMS: THE ADVENTURE BEGINS… (1985). The sequelitis that gripped many a film during the mid-1980s — even sorry efforts like Hardbodies (1984) and Angel (ditto) received follow-ups, for Pete’s sake — didn’t quite spread to every project released during this time frame. The makers of 1984’s The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension (reviewed here) envisioned several screen sagas for their unique hero, but the franchise was aborted after just one. The same fate befell this takeoff of The Destroyer book series, a missed-opportunity exercise that might as well have been called Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins… and Ends. The problem with the picture starts with the casting of the lead role: Fred Ward is a damn fine actor — check out his dramatic chops in The Right Stuff and his comedic ones in Big Business — but even with the filmmakers’ desire to build a series around a working-class James Bond, he’s ill-suited for the task, coming across as that proverbial bull in a china shop. His character is a cop who’s transformed into an elite operative for an American outfit that spies on all citizens for their own good (a pre-Patriot Act in all its implicit creepiness); this snooping leads the clandestine group to uncover corruption that’s affecting the U.S. Army. The story is drab in the extreme, although there’s one nicely staged set-piece largely filmed on the Statue of Liberty (the rest of the scene was shot on a partial replica). Joel Grey co-stars as Remo’s mentor, the martial arts master Chiun, and Carl Fullerton earned a Best Makeup Oscar nomination for his ability to turn a 53-year-old Caucasian into an 80-year-old Korean. Blu-ray extras include audio commentary by producer Larry Spiegel and co-producer Judy Goldstein; behind-the-scenes pieces on the music score and the production design; and the theatrical trailer. SURF NAZIS MUST DIE (1987). It’s always amusing when a studio takes a critic’s blurb and edits it down to provide a different meaning. As one example, Pauline Kael called 1983’s The Makioka Sisters “the most pleasurable movie I have seen in months.” Despite being a rapturous pull quote, the distributor nevertheless chopped it down in some ads to read, “The most pleasurable movie I have seen!” (Like, ever?) Another critic who rightly trashed the 1985 Al Pacino howler Revolution made the mistake of using the word “magnificent” in her review (if memory serves, to describe the cinematography); I’m sure she was shocked to open a newspaper and find herself declaring the movie “Magnificent!” at the top of the ad. And now here’s the new Blu-ray for Surf Nazis Must Die, which has Variety breathlessly declaring on its back cover, “A Clockwork Orange meets Mad Max on the beach.” Sounds like exciting stuff, until one learns that the entire sentence is, “A sort of A Clockwork Orange meets Mad Max on the beach, pic hasn’t one redeeming feature.” I suppose there is one redeeming feature in that it runs under 90 minutes, but even that isn’t much of a blessing since there’s more padding here than in 200 mattresses. Troma Entertainment is known for its gloriously cheesy entertainment — everyone from popes to presidents loves The Toxic Avenger — so maybe it’s telling that this title was a distribution pickup rather than created in-house. The main problem with this awful film, in which a gun-toting granny (Gail Neely) seeks revenge on the neo-Nazis who murdered her son (Robert Harden), is that it isn’t nearly outrageous or offensive enough — instead, it’s just cheap and dull. THE THREE MUSKETEERS (1948). To date, there have been well over two dozen screen adaptations of the Alexandre Dumas classic — it would be logical to assume that the Warner Bros. version from the 1940s would be the champ, given the quality of the studios’ productions during that particular decade. Yet that’s not the case, with Richard Lester’s excellent 1973 version (the one with Michael York, Oliver Reed and Raquel Welch) besting the 1948 edition in practically every respect. From a visual standpoint, the WB interpretation can’t be faulted, what with its lavish sets, colorful costumes, and Oscar-nominated cinematography. But George Sidney, a director best known for such zippy musicals as The Harvey Girls (reviewed here) and Bye Bye Birdie, rarely finds a consistent rhythm for his picture — the 1973 version does a far better job of effortlessly switching between heavy drama and swashbuckling shenanigans — and most of the cast members were hired for their marquee value rather than their appropriateness for the roles (which at least worked from a financial standpoint, as the film was one of the top grossers of its year). Aside from his remarkable physical prowess, Gene Kelly is all wrong as the youthful wanna-be musketeer D’Artagnan, while others who fail to convince include Van Heflin as a rigid Athos, June Allyson as a bland Constance, Angela Lansbury as a nondescript Queen Anne, and Keenan Wynn as a modern Planchett. Faring better are those cast as the villains of the piece: Lana Turner is all purring menace as Lady de Winter while Vincent Price is all slippery charm as Richelieu. Blu-ray extras consist of the 1946 live-action short Looking at London; the 1948 cartoon What Price Fleadom; an audio-only radio promo; and the theatrical trailer. ETERNALS (2021). It’s not surprising that many viewers are citing Eternals as one of the worst of the MCU films — I’ve seen numerous incels online slamming the picture (women! gays!) alongside Captain Marvel (women!), Black Widow (women!) and Black Panther (blacks!) — but it’s mind-blowing that it’s the first MCU offering to earn a Rotten rather than a Fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Mind you, it is one of the weaker MCU outings, but is it really inferior to some of the Iron Man and Thor entries? In its favor is a willingness to break away from the established Marvel formula as well as an ofttimes artful visual scheme orchestrated by Nomadland’s Oscar-winning director Chloé Zhao. Working against it are the usual soul-sapping CGI slugfests and a roster of performers who are competent without commanding attention in the manner of, say, Robert Downey Jr. or Scarlett Johansson. MURPHY’S LAW (1986). Here’s one of those junky Cannon flicks made by Charles Bronson as his career lamentably winded down. He plays Jack Murphy, a hard-drinking cop who’s targeted by a psychopath (Carrie Snodgress) he once arrested. After she frames him for murder, he’s forced to take it on the lam, finding himself (shades of The Defiant Ones) handcuffed to an obnoxious street urchin (Kathleen Wilhoite) he previously had busted for theft. Rancid even by Golan and Globus standards, this mainly suffers from the irksome performance by Wilhoite, whose character spends the entire picture hurling insults like “dildo-nose,” “jism-breath,” and “snot-licking donkey fart.” Where’s a script rewrite by Robert Towne when you need one? Blu-ray extras consist of audio commentary by Wilhoite and film historian Nick Redman; an interview with co-star Robert F. Lyons; radio spots; and the theatrical trailer. Love Remo Williams, such good hokey fun!!! Still need to see The Final Option, aka Who Dares Win as I became a Lewis Collins fan after seeing uploads of the ITV game show drama Cludeo on YouTube where he played Col. Mustard in Season 3. I’m a big Charles Bronson fan, and have actually heard some good things about Murphy’s Law, I’ll pick the 88 Films edition up as I’m boycotting Kino Lorber (a long story there). Nice mixed round-up. I’ve never seen CLUEDO, but I did enjoy ​Lewis Collins on THE PROFESSIONALS​ decades ago​. And I’ve been a huge Bronson fan since I was a wee lad ​(​and not only because our names are similar​, ha)​. After so many great supporting performances in classic films and so many great leading roles in ’70s hits, I hated that his career had to end with Cannon​. I always felt like he still had plenty to offer than just DEATH WISH 37.",POSITIVE
"Feb 17, 2022"," Marvel Studios is scraping the bottom of the barrel with its latest offering, Eternals, a movie about one of the least popular superhero teams in Marvel’s universe. But it’s not the characters’ obscurity that makes this the worst Marvel movie yet. Writer and director Chloé Zhao, who won an Oscar for Nomadland, has given audiences a plodding, nonsensical film bereft of feeling and action. Eternals features 10 immortal superheroes sent to Earth 7,000 years ago by godlike Celestials to protect humanity from alien predators called Deviants. The Eternals shepherded fledgling human society and inspired polytheistic mythologies, but now, after having eradicated their enemies 500 years ago, the Eternals must face a new Deviant threat. And this time the Deviants have evolved to absorb the Eternals’ powers. Power-stealing Deviants might sound bad, but you’ll be surprised how inconsequential it is to the film’s meandering plot. The movie boasts many firsts for Marvel. The 10 Eternals are the studio’s most ethnically diverse group of heroes: some Caucasians, a couple of Africans, a couple of East Asians, a South Asian, and a Latina. We also get our first deaf superhero—though it’s never explained why the Celestials would create a deaf Eternal—and the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s first gay superhero. The PG-13 movie also contains the franchise’s first sex scene, which felt like an attempt to make up for the film’s lack of human emotion.  Collin is WORLD’s arts and culture editor.

"Feb 16, 2022"," If, as some fans argue, superhero comics represent a modern, secular mythology, few properties better support this claim than Marvel’s The Eternals. The result of a decade-long attempt by legendary comic book artist Jack Kirby to tell a sprawling epic about warring gods, the series offers up a psychedelic creation story involving an alien species. In Kirby’s story, the universe was forged by giant, ageless beings called Celestials, who create humans along with superpowered demigods called Eternals and, in a mishap of genetic engineering, aggressive and highly efficient creatures called Deviants. Chloé Zhao’s Eternals does its best to simplify and rework the bedrock of the comic series into something that can reasonably fit into a standalone film. But it’s arguably impossible to introduce a team of superheroes who are unfamiliar even to casual comic book fans and establish the nuances of their long-standing relationship to human civilization and their overarching and underlining conflicts without resorting to one of the most exhausting exposition dumps in the Marvel Cinematic Universe to date. The film aspires to paint complex, emotionally nuanced relationships between its characters, often via flashback, but every time it does so, there are momentum-shattering effects on the narrative. To the credit of Zhao and her three co-writers, Eternals tries to differentiate its cast of characters in ways that go against the grain of the typical MCU style of flattening every hero into a sardonic, reluctantly responsible figure weighed down by daddy issues. These heroes even have an overriding streak of earnestness that runs counter to the glibness of most other Marvel movies: The empathetic Sersi (Gemma Chan) exhibits only tenderness toward humanity, and the Superman-esque Ikaris (Richard Madden) smolders with an intensity that feels far removed from the snark that the average MCU A-lister tends toward. Even the characters that are closest to the franchise’s usual mold of wisecracking, pop-culture-referencing cut-ups are complicated by underlying neuroses. Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), for one, uses his quips to mask his cowardice, while Sprite’s (Lia McHugh) own sardonic one-liners act as pressure releases for her agony at being trapped in a body of perpetual adolescence, cursed with eternal youth that withholds the pleasures of adult life. Still, Eternals suffers from spending much of its 157-minute runtime introducing us to characters that have little in the way of mainstream recognition. And for a film in which the heroes have only a few days to avert the destruction of Earth, a shocking amount of scenes consist of them sitting around tables talking out their less-pressing personal disputes. Kirby’s Eternals marked the culmination of his avant-garde artistic style, a bombastic showcase of electric colors, dizzying scale, and minutely detailed panels. Zhao’s film, by contrast, is defined by earthen tones, subtle grades of light and shadow, and a reliance on natural vistas over epic-scaled CGI spectacle. Its delicate compositions were shot by Ben Davis, who lensed Avengers: Age of Ultron and Captain Marvel, two of the most visually flat MCU films, but Eternals marks the first time that one such film has taken any interest in soaking up the beauty of a planet that its characters are always trying to preserve. That care extends to the action, which leans into pans and arcing camera motions over kinetic editing to capture the ebb and flow of battle between the Eternals and the Deviants. It’s a style remarkably similar to Zack Snyder’s approach to staging combat across his DC films. There’s a real weight to these superhumans’ movements, especially the speedster hit-and-run combat style of Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), that also feels indebted to Snyder’s conception of how such beings would defy mere mortals’ ability to fully process their speed and power. But the clean, lucid layout of the action scenes is such that it may make you wish that more of the film were given over to them and not the more sedentary conversations that propel the narrative. Zhao is genuinely trying to bring something new to the increasingly moribund Marvel formula, tackling philosophical and political ideas that have been sprinkled across the larger franchise but rarely approached with serious interest. This isn’t the first Marvel movie to throw in a narrative twist that challenges the idea that the heroes are unambiguously working for the good of the universe, but Zhao takes more time than others to study how such a revelation might shock characters who’ve never questioned their impact on the world. Marvel’s well-publicized cooperation with the United States military has worked to undercut the studio’s critiques of state power in such films as Captain America: Winter Soldier and Black Panther. Which makes it all the more remarkable to follow the arc of the Eternals’ engineer, Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), whose centuries-long quest to aid humans in their technological development ends with him standing in the ashes of Hiroshima, utterly disgusted with the atrocity that mankind could so callously unleash with his gifts. And yet, at every turn the formula that Eternals seeks to challenge only reasserts itself, as the film is constantly given over to exposition and, with a few notable exceptions, ultimately absolving its characters of the fraught revelations of their culpability in the evil that threatens the world. At once bloated and rushed, Eternals suffers from frequent lurches in tempo that dispel its occasional moments of tranquil thoughtfulness by rehashing plot information ad nauseam until the simplest of details start to feel convoluted. Where Synder’s Justice League displayed a far greater grasp of the grandeur of Kirby’s work, Zhao ultimately robs the artist’s comic of its sweep by constantly turning a space opera into a repetitive character drama, one where demigods with the fate of the world in the palm of their hands spend far too much time sitting around a table attempting to work out their own personal issues. Compared to most entries in the MCU, Eternals is notable for its impressive sense of scale, and the clarity of Disney’s 2160p/HDR presentation does justice to that grandeur. The range of fine details is exceptional throughout, in everything from clothing to faces. At the same time, what the HDR color grading giveth, it also taketh away. Specifically, the presentation is quite dark, resulting in a more broodily cinematic experience but also one where those aforementioned fine details are not always so easy to appreciate. The Dolby Atmos soundtrack boasts excellent clarity throughout, and while the separation of elements is solid and dialogue is clear and natural-sounding, the more action-forward sequences want for more subwoofer action. That the commentary track featuring director Chloe Zhao and visual effects supervisors Stephane Ceretti and Mårten Larsson doesn’t appear on the 4K UHD will only make sense after you pop in the Blu-ray and realize just how much brighter the presentation is on the latter. All the better, one imagines, to appreciate the work that Zhao, Ceretti, and Larsson tout, but they’re focus is so strongly on the effects and matters of location, location, location that even those who came to the film’s defense during its theatrical run may find it difficult to justify that it was an especially personal project for Zhao.

"Feb 16, 2022"," 2021 seems to be the year of the sci-fi epic. With grandiose ambition and tenderness at its core, Eternals is a unique experience tailored to a new audience. Created by American comic book artist Jack Kirby, the Eternals are elevated human-like aliens from a planet called Olympia. They were fabricated by the Celestials, all-powerful cosmic beings. Under the lens of director Chloé Zhao, they are not much different. In this film, they go to Earth to fight against the Deviants and protect the human race. They have been living on Earth for centuries thinking they have fulfilled their duty. That is until the Deviants return alongside a bigger threat at hand. The film plays a lot with truth and deceit. It constantly goes around through different twists and turns as the audience tries to find out what is really happening alongside our heroes. Through it all, we are able to discover much of what shaped reality and history within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Zhao showcases a story that is undeniably human. Characters meant to be larger than life are just as plagued with existence and purpose as those they have sworn to protect. The narrative lives under a rich blend of religious scripture and mythological motifs similar to that of classic literature. This sets up Eternals to serve as both the old and new testament of the MCU. Zhao’s artistic style highlights this point beautifully. Eternals packs itself with cinematographic moments that highlight the beauty of simplicity. While Zhao’s technique and methodology influence the narrative, it goes beyond what we have become accustomed to when it comes to her films. Instead of breaking out of her comfort zone, Zhao expands it. She steps into a new element and is able to bring forth a film that feels unquestionably like a superhero movie meant for comic book lovers. However, she is able to cultivate and update the studio’s brand. Eternals is driven by a love story. One between lovers, duty, and legacy. Throughout the 157-minute runtime, viewers will have their eyes glued to the screen and rediscover what it means to be excited about something original. While canonically these characters have been around since the beginning of time, they are recent additions to the roster of players. Nevertheless, it is quite easy to get attached to them. The entirety of the film spends time with its leads as opposed to the action itself. This leads to the biggest gripe many may have with the film. The MCU spent years building up to team-up movies with solo projects. Meanwhile, Eternals tries to accomplish this in one sitting. There is a lot to unpack and unload within the story. It tries to cover important moments in human history. Then it adds on the exploration of who these people are, why they are this way, and why they react to certain plot points the way that they do. At times, it would have been better to simply focus on the Eternals themselves instead of the history they witness. That being said, it is key to who they are. Because of this, a standout detail is the aspect of the tortured soul. Many of the heroes of the MCU experience grief with their legacy and the weight they carry. Zhao highlights the flaws above the glamour and glory. One important facet of that is the spotlight on the female characters. The exaltation of female strength is not performative. It is one that comes from within, and it is the beauty that encompasses them as they exist. Gemma Chan is a spectacular leading lady, often fighting off her own self-doubt. With the exception of her role in Captain Marvel, Chan has proven to be a highly capable performer. Salma Hayek is another to command such strength in every scene she’s in. It is spellbinding the attention she is able to command by simply taking up space in a room. It is also refreshing to be able to view Hayek as a leader. Eternals also serves as a reminder of Angelina Jolie’s resurgence. Considering the tragic storyline Jolie tackles, many will be able to relate to her fight to believe that she’s worth loving and fighting for. There’s also Lia McHugh’s fight with her own self-image and her place in the world. Finally, Lauren Ridloff is enchanting as Makkari. There is delicate care taken with language in this film. Therefore, every moment Makkari has a chance to speak up, Zhao makes sure everyone pays attention. As for the men of the film, there comes a point where one may think they’ve seen everything Richard Madden has to offer as an actor. Then he goes and surprises you once again. Ikaris may be one of the most complex characters of the MCU. What he brings to the table as a soldier sworn to duty will surprise many. On the opposite end of the spectrum, Kumail Nanjiani and Brian Tyree Henry are the heart of the film with their quick wit. As well, Henry provides one of the first instances of LGBTQ+ representation in the MCU that feels genuine. Finally, Don Lee, Barry Keoghan, and Kit Harington provide tenderness to the tougher moments of the story. The film stars Gemma Chan, Richard Madden, Salma Hayek, Angelina Jolie, Lia McHugh, Barry Keoghan, Don Lee, Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry, Lauren Ridloff, and Kit Harington.",POSITIVE

"Feb 12, 2022"," In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, there are countless potential threats. Some are relatively minor. Others are universe-threatening. With Eternals, Disney seems to have settled on a galaxy-spanning villain that could hang over the entirety of their Phase IV efforts, but the film might just feel too obvious to entice the legion of franchise fans to their latest lengthy story arc. What made the MCU successful from its seemingly humble origins in Iron Man through its massive two-part finale was that the build-up occurred slowly over the decade, with new hints and Easter eggs popping up gradually over the course of more than a dozen films. Eternals, the third feature in the self-titled Phase IV of the MCU, introduces a multi-universe villain that hits bluntly and obviously. On the opposite end of the spectrum, Warner Bros.’ DC Extended Universe started with a massive storyline that would be broken into smaller films for each hero. It’s clear which direction worked out best and for Eternals to start at the other end is a worrisome development for Disney’s latest multi-film story arc. Part of the galvanizing factor of the first films was that Samuel L. Jackson’s Nick Fury was slowly recruiting heroes to a new initiative. In these latest three efforts, no attempt at inter-film cohesion is attempted and that makes it all feel rather disconnected. The influx of new characters has given a shot in the arm to the franchise with the likes of Captain Marvel, Ant-Man, Black Panther, Shang-Chi, and others taking a front seat towards driving the narrative. The Eternals are another attempt to add to the bloated number of characters that fans of the MCU have to commit to memory. Eternals does a fine job introducing each of eleven new characters, giving a surprisingly bountiful bit of back story to each character, fleshing them out in ways that characters like Hawkeye and Black Widow didn’t get until recently. Part of that attention to character detail comes from director Chloé Zhao, the latest indie director to tackle an MCU feature. Disney seems to believe that getting smaller directors and giving them big budgets, but slapping specific standards on their creations, is a way to give some gravitas to the franchise. Yet, unlike Destin Daniel Cretton with Shang-Chi and Cate Shortland with Black Widow, Zhao’s unwieldy film has too many parts to give her the kind of time she should need to craft something much more intimate. That doesn’t stop her from trying. While the film sometimes struggles to give all the characters something to do, Zhao’s focus on diversity and big moments gives the film room to breathe that a lesser director wouldn’t have found. Scenes surrounding the MCU’s first deaf superhero and its first gay hero are given subtle treatment, allowing the characters to shine and develop in ways that don’t make them feel like footnotes. The film also introduces the first moment of sexual intimacy. It’s kept brief and nudity free as Disney would demand, but it’s a nice attempt to make the series feel more adult than it has up to this point. Eternals is a gorgeous film to look at. Zhao’s eye for framing is dominant throughout the film and while she’s forced to adhere to Disney’s seemingly strict framework for successful filmmaking, she infuses it with just enough of her own talent to make it feel somewhat unique. Ultimately, the MCU is chomping at the bit to bring in as many new characters as possible and invest the audience in the continuation of the series with new threats and new opportunities for everyone to find their place within the universe. Unfortunately, after more than a decade of films that are similar enough to one another to become forgettable after a time, the MCU faces an uncertain future. Films like this are necessary to move the narratives forward, but they are also helping to create a sense that what has worked in the past may no longer be effective. And it’s going to take a major realignment of strategies to suitably impress future audiences.",POSITIVE
"Feb 12, 2022",Eternals is as good as it could have been. The issues stem from the source material and the movie acts as a huge set-up for what's to come.,NEGATIVE
"Feb 12, 2022"," Since the release of Spider-Man: Far from Home in 2019, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been stuck in a point of struggle. Both series and features fail to build an engaging Phase Four for the universe, with stagnant developments for established narratives and uninteresting new stories being found. Continuing to build towards the future, Eternals hoped to turn things around, and with Chloé Zhao coming off not only a Best Director Oscar win but also arguably her magnum opus Nomadland, it seemed like the film might just be able to do so. Sadly, this potential is never realised, as Eternals fails on nearly every level, becoming one of the most boring films in the MCU to date. While there are many areas where one could start with Eternals, the story itself feels demanding enough to deserve to go first. Serving as an origin story for not just 1 but an entire group of characters, Eternals is rather ambitious when it comes to scope but clearly bites off far more than it could ever chew. The film jumps erratically around – not just between characters but also time periods – creating a confusing narrative to follow. It is hard to keep track of what characters are where, who knows what, and what each character thinks of each other when the structure and layout of the film feel so jumbled.  This proves to be a massive issue for the film as, due to this, it is incredibly hard to become immersed or engage with it; this makes the audience aware of every minute passing. While a 90-minute feature might be able to get away with this, Eternals holds a staggering 157-minute runtime which crawls as slowly as possible. Eternals easily takes the title of being the most taxing viewing experience in the MCU to date, with the experience being genuinely painful at parts. The thesis found within the film is bland, further proving that there is no point for the film to demand the audience sit through such a long runtime and, sadly, the film isn't even fun. The characters and humor of Eternals are genuinely grating. Since Guardians of the Galaxy, the MCU has crafted a very specific type of humor and with every entry, this style grows less and less funny. By now, every joke and character quirk is to be expected and has been seen already in some form in the MCU alone much less the larger cinematic landscape. It doesn't help that the acting within the feature ranges from decent to terrible. While Brian Tyree Henry clearly is the MVP of the film, others like Barry Keoghan feel completely out of place. The chemistry of the group is nonexistent and there isn't a single true standout who feels worthy to be seen anytime in the future of the universe. Especially when the characters are as flat narratively as they are in Eternals, the focus goes to their individual personalities and the film simply lacks anything fresh or worthwhile in this department. Everything feels incredibly basic and simple, with the only real point of depth being the pain these characters face seeing humanity consistently fall around them.  Even this, however, holds a strange perspective, as the characters seemingly influence human development, not only leading to fun moments like the first properly queer character in the MCU being the one responsible for the bombing of Hiroshima but also a strange undercutting of the human species which has been ultimately the soul of the universe up to this point. How the film decides to use history feels confusing and cheap, only furthering the frustrating viewing experience one has when watching the project.  With a $200 million dollar budget, the film should at least be able to have some fun action scenes but, again, Eternals fails. While the action is visually competent, it feels so bland coming not just from what has been seen in the MCU but the superhero genre for the past few decades. Seeing these characters with incredibly basic powers fight completely generic CGI monsters holds no charm or intrigue. At least something like Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings managed to create interesting set pieces on occasion, such as the bus battle, here there is nothing. The action speaks to a larger issue rooted within the film, it simply is too generic.  While many hoped that Zhao might be able to bring her unique style to the MCU, any sign of her involvement feels erased, with the film feeling like every other MCU project to come before it. At this point, the MCU alone is 26 feature films deep with over a decade of releases. While there has been some evolution within this – specifically with the release of Guardians of the Galaxy – as of recent, things have become stagnant and honestly painful. Every film might change a few details about their exterior but ultimately provide the same formula with the same recycled ideals that are just beyond boring at this point. Eternals is nothing short of a disaster. Easily not just the most boring MCU film but also simply the worst, Eternals is the perfect example of everything wrong with Phase 4 of the MCU. Rather than pulling the audience in film by film as the series heads towards some worthy grand conclusion, Phase 4 feels less interesting by the minute. There hasn't been a single project not to feel somewhat disappointing, and the experience of watching Eternals is so off-putting that the idea of seeing a follow-up feels genuinely painful.

"Feb 10, 2022","Though there’s definitely some fun to be had with this film beyond Zhao’s glorious compositions, Eternals ends up being one of the more overwrought and, frankly, silly additions to the MCU canon. ",POSITIVE
"Jan 17, 2022"," The iconic superheroes that most of us grew up watching on the big and small screens—usually straight, white, and male—have become so ingrained in our minds, it can be difficult to imagine something different. The first wave of Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films that began in the aughts adhered completely to that masculine fantasy, featuring in succession: Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Thor, and Captain America. Strong, powerful men, but singular in their uniqueness as rugged mavericks and lone wolves. But like all universes, the MCU inevitably expanded. I say “inevitably” because, try as they might to retell the same story over and over again (see: every reboot since 2002’s Spider-Man), studios also need new stories, new faces, and new points of view in order to keep feeding the content beast. Later films such as Black Panther (2018), Captain Marvel (2019), and most recently Shang-Chi (2021) proved how popular and successful it can be to dip, even just a small toe, outside the expected norm. While those films still roughly follow the same formula of the typical superhero movie, Eternals offers an unequivocal departure. For this reason alone, it’s perhaps unsurprising that critical reception remains divided.  Originating from a comic book series that debuted in 1976, the Eternals refer to a group of immortal aliens sent to Earth to watch over human civilization. Although kept in the dark about the true purpose of their mission, they’re instructed not to interfere in the affairs of people while protecting them from deadly creatures known as Deviants. Director Chloé Zhao brings to the ambitious project that same sensibility for gorgeous landscapes and restrained character portraits seen in her previous work Nomadland (2020), for which she won an Academy Award, and The Rider (2018). Eternals, with credit to director of photography Ben Davis, is visually stunning. The CGI used to illustrate various powers appears seamless, beautiful even. The actors have never looked better. (I could stare at Salma Hayek’s perfect bone structure all day.) They’re smartly cast and flawlessly perform their roles as god-like figures who feel conflicted about their responsibilities to humankind. If the film does suffer, it’s from under an immense weight—not only the galactic scale necessary to the story’s world-building, but also the greater Marvel universe. With stray references to plot points from the MCU’s Avengers saga, Eternals struggles with its obligation to stay connected. Possibly because the installment exists so far removed from its predecessors, it requires far more exposition, meaning the larger-than-life stakes sometimes get lost. Sersi, played by British Asian actress Gemma Chan (Crazy Rich Asians), emerges as the story’s protagonist—though you wouldn’t know it from watching the trailers. Part of me wonders if the bait-and-switch inadvertently threw viewers expecting a more traditional Marvel film. Instead of being tokenized, female characters balance the number of male characters within the ten Eternals. When the mother figure of the group Ajak (Hayek) is killed by the Deviants they believed to have been exterminated thousands of years ago, she leaves Sersi to succeed her. As their newly chosen leader, Sersi must reunite the Eternals, who by this time have spread out across the globe, living separate lives. But not everyone, including Sersi herself, appears confident in her abilities to guide them, especially those who have always regarded Ikaris (Richard Madden) as the most powerful. The revelation that the Eternals were essentially created to allow Earth to incubate a giant entity known as a Celestial, whose Emergence will destroy the planet, further divides the group between those like Ikaris who believe in following orders and those like Sersi who want to save humanity. Both Sersi and her forerunner Ajak lean into maternal archetypes as nurturers and healers, whose instinct is to preserve life, not destroy it. Sersi and Ikaris’ past romantic relationship (featuring “the MCU’s first sex scene”) and sudden split are gradually revealed over the course of the film. Yet where Sersi ultimately draws strength from is not the love for a male partner, as is the case in DC's Wonder Woman (2017), but in her own conviction of what’s right. Ikaris, in fact, turns out to be the villain and the one who murdered Ajak, proving that being the most physically dominant does not always equate with being the best leader. Upending the trope of a solo (and often male) hero, the Eternals must support each other and cooperate in order to succeed. It only dawned on me partway through watching Eternals that a Chinese woman director had managed to make an American superhero movie with a British Chinese woman as its lead. The film had not been marketed that way at all. Interestingly, the storyline has nothing to do with China (unlike in Shang-Chi) but rather takes a cosmopolitan approach as it zips across geographical space and time from present-day London to ancient Babylon. Although derivative of Greek mythology, the Eternals, we learn in Zhao’s adaptation, serve as the inspiration behind many deities of various cultures and religions around the globe and throughout history. The choice to cast actors of color as the majority of the Eternals characters seemingly emphasizes that pluralistic vision: Hayek (who is Mexican by way of Lebanese and Spanish descent) as Ajak, Kumail Nanjiani (who is Pakistani American) as Kingo, Brian Tyree Henry (a Black American actor) as Phastos, Lauren Ridloff (Black and Mexican American) as Makkari, and Don Lee (a South Korean American actor who also goes by Ma Dong-seok) as Gilgamesh. While race is not overtly addressed in the film, perhaps because the Eternals are not actually human, neither is the casting colorblind. A role specifically tailored for Nanjiani, for example, Kingo has become a Bollywood megastar that doesn’t age in his post-Eternals life.  In other words, the inclusive representation on screen is deliberate. Screenwriters Ryan and Kaz Firpo, cousins who drafted the initial script, have described how growing up in a diverse environment influenced their writing: “The Bay Area is such a magical melting pot. That diversity really shaped our world view, and it's reflected in 'Eternals.'” Kaz Firpo’s Japanese heritage also informed the decision to depict the devastation of the 1945 Hiroshima bombing in a point to show one of humanity’s “greatest failures.” In the scene, Phastos expresses horror and guilt that his technology could have led to people committing such an atrocity against one another. While the optics of a Black man shouldering the blame troubled some viewers, that he demonstrates a clear-eyed, moral conscience among the group arguably makes sense, considering he more than any of the other Eternals is first to recognize Ikaris’ false sense of superiority. Later during their battle, Phastos binds Ikaris in a symbolic reversal of how history has tended to play out. Ridloff makes history playing Marvel’s first Deaf superhero. The actress shares the same condition as her character Makkari, who communicates using American Sign Language in the film. In addition to her super speed, Makkari’s heightened senses allow her to pick up vibrations. Without falling into the “disability as a superpower” trope, the character’s inclusion underscores how deafness doesn’t have to be treated as a deficit. In what could be interpreted as a form of neurodiversity or mental illness, Angelina Jolie’s character Thena lives with what Ajak diagnoses as “mahd wy'ry” (which sounds like “mad weary”), the result of too many memories confusing her sense of reality. She unexpectedly attacks her friends, reinforcing an unfortunate stereotype that cognitively disabled people are dangerous, when in reality they’re more likely to be victims than perpetrators of violence. Rather than allow Thena to be “cured” by wiping her memory, however, Gilgamesh volunteers to stay with and care for her, allowing her to have a relatively peaceful if occasionally challenging life. Eventually, it comes to light that Thena’s mind is not actually flawed or weak: She is accessing past memories, which their Celestial creator Arishem (voiced by David Kaye) erased from the other Eternals’ consciousness. Notably, Phastos is the MCU’s first openly gay superhero. His relationship with his husband Ben (Haaz Sleiman) and their young son (Esai Daniel Cross) give tangible weight to Phastos’ dilemma as to whether he wants to help the Eternals. Here, the portrayal of an interracial gay family is normalized, albeit in a framework that’s more about assimilation rather than true acceptance for queerness. On the other hand, the film misses an opportunity to challenge gender binaries. Despite the androgynous appearance of Sprite (Lia McHugh), who inhabits the body of a child, she is gendered as female. It’s not clear why the Eternals have genders at all since we learn that they are not even evolutionary lifeforms, but rather the invention of Arishem. Eternals, which boasts the most diverse Marvel cast to date, may not be to everybody’s taste—particularly those who find comfort in tradition. Yet, diversity in filmmaking isn’t only about who you put in front of the camera; it demands risk-taking and unconventional approaches to storytelling. This is how the universe expands.",POSITIVE
"Jan 17, 2022"," In 5000 BC, ten superpowered Eternals are sent by the Celestial Arishem to Earth on their starship, the Domo, to exterminate the invasive Deviants. The last of the Deviants are killed in 1521, and the group’s opinions differ over their continued responsibilities and their relationship with humankind. Over the next five hundred years, they mostly live apart from each other, awaiting Arishem’s return. So that’s a lot to cram into a debut film, but as mentioned they also added in the second Black Knight from the comics, Dane Whitman (Kit Harrington), though here he’s just the kind boyfriend of Cersi with only a post-credits tease showing the classic Ebony Blade. Still good fun, and I love how we’ve ended up with so many obscure comic characters on-screen. I’ll say as well that I don’t think any one of the eleven cast members I just mentioned did badly in their roles either, I wasn’t often in love with the story but the actors never pulled me away from the screen, even Kingo’s sidekick/valet Karun (Harish Patel) nailed the comedic timing. What I did like was the big twist, so in case you didn’t read my spoiler warning, here’s a second one: Spoiler warning! … alright, so instead of being put on Earth to protect humanity from the Deviants for the race’s sake they were put on Earth to defeat the Deviants so humanity could get to a certain technology / population level to “feed” enough intelligence to birth a new Celestial, one that would break through the planet and wipe it out once it “hatched”. It’s also revealed that this group of ten had done this already, many, many times, with their memories erased each time so as to not make them go crazy (like what happens with Thena…) The only people aware of this are Ajak and Ikaris, and when Ajak decides humanity, a race that through its own strength brought half of the universe back to life, should be spared Ikaris is the one who kills her so the birthing can still take place. Arishem looms in space. Or was this the shot that transitioned into the crystal statue on the Eternals ship? … Either way, there he is! This eventually leads to a split in the Eternals, with Ikaris and Sprite siding with Arishem and the Celestial’s perfectly logical idea that although Earth will be destroyed the Celestial it births will go on to create billions of more lives across the universe, while Sersi, Thena, Phastos, Makkari and Druig decide to fight against them and try to save Earth. Kingo opts out as he believes the Celestial should be born to help the universe but can’t bring himself to fight against his own family, and Gilgamesh is killed protecting Thena earlier in the film, so… he didn’t really have a say. It’s made clear that Sprite sides with Ikaris more out of love than the ideal, and there are also some sweet moments where Phastos has a husband and son he is willing to die to protect despite having previously given up on humanity after his technology was used for nuclear warfare, and Makkari and Druig have a surprisingly believable romantic line running through the story, despite their personalities being completely different. They all fight (themselves and a super Deviant I’ll talk about later…) but in the end Cersi is able to connect all the nearby Eternals into a “Uni-mind” and use that power to turn the emerging Celestial into stone. Knowing he’s failed his mission and being unable to kill the woman he loves, Ikaris kills himself by flying into the sun. We get a few different end points after this. Phastos, Cersi and Kingo stay on Earth, while Thena, Druig and Makkari head off into space to find other Eternals and tell them the truth. Cersi and Dane meet but before he can tell her about his family history the three Eternals who stayed on Earth are whisked into space by Arishem himself and told that their memories will decide whether he permits Earth to be allowed to live or not. Meanwhile the three Eternals in space meet a new Eternal from another group in Eros, otherwise known as Starfox (Harry Styles), who is also Thanos’ brother. That was a weird cliffhanger… Then we get Dane about to touch his Ebony Blade (oo-er?) scene I mentioned earlier, though he’s stopped by the new Blade (Mahershala Ali) off-screen, which is a nice tease. Overall it was a fun two and half hours, and I loved the designs of the Celestials and some of the flashbacks to the past, seeing a recreated Babylon and the fall of the Aztecs were a refreshing change from some of the more obvious “set in the past” scenes these sort of stories tend to do. The Black Knight in live action! … Eventually. For now just Dane Whitman. Also I haven’t made one Game of Thrones reference in the whole review! Hooray! I also have to say that two and a half hours felt like too much. I really liked some of the scenes in the past and I know there were a lot of characters to get to know, but overall there were times when I looked at my clock and was shocked that there was still so much of the film left to go. Definitely felt slow in places. This is the kind of scene I was talking about when mentioning the phrase “visually stunning”. Looks like crazy concept art brought to life… in other words pretty much everything because that’s what concept art is… Man I say some stupid things some times… Anyway, looked great on my 4K TV!",NEUTRAL
"Jan 14, 2022"," It has taken me quite a while to compile my thoughts on perhaps the most polarizing Marvel film to come out. With an overly ambitious plot fueled by loads of exposition and drawn-out sequences, Eternals is currently the lowest-rated MCU release — though it hardly deserves that placement. I’m not saying those who disliked this film are wrong. I actually agree with many of the critiques, and I understand how some could be a dealbreaker for some viewers. For me, a lot of it comes down to far too much being done in an attempt to carve out and solidify this epic new direction for Phase Four of the MCU. With a runtime of over 2.5 hours, the film does feel a bit stuffed. A lot of exposition is delivered throughout by clunky past timeline sequences. This was by far the weakest point for me, as they were long and woven in at times that stunted the progression of the story. Fine-tuning all of that would have really improved the overall flow. Character development was rich, perhaps one upside to all those flashbacks, as we were able to get familiar with their pasts and evolving dynamics. An unexpected standout for me was Gemma Chan‘s Sersi, as she steps out as the lead with a wonderfully compassionate performance. And even the budding romance between Makkari (Lauren Ridloff) and Druig (Barry Keoghan) continued to build that personal investment with viewers like myself. Though I will say, some characters are a bit underdeveloped, mainly with its biggest star, Angelina Jolie. It almost felt purposeful to perhaps dull her magnetic star quality in an attempt to avoid her overpowering the rest of the cast. But when you have Jolie in your film, just let her badassery shine. Visually the film is a spectacle. With beautiful cinematography and gorgeous costume design, the technical portions of the film are top-tier Marvel. I think that’s what director Chloé Zhao does best — ensuring her films have breathtaking sights. Which at times may have been more top of mind than the overall story. Action sequences are fun and engaging, with every hero getting a moment to have their powers take center stage. There’s great chemistry between the team, and I loved the banter and humor throughout that felt well-balanced, mainly in the present timeline. The issue with Eternals is with every compliment, there can be a caveat. But again, I would never call this the worst film in the MCU. Despite some weak moments and a slightly muddled execution, I think it has a lot of entertaining aspects. At its core, it has a great foundation and doesn’t overdo it with tie-ins to other Marvel films, really sticking to creating this new world for these very different superheroes. While the sentient being plotline is a bit messy and tricky to follow, I expect they’ll find a better way to balance it and avoid overcomplicating things as they dive into it more in the sequel. Which I’m still very excited about. Eternals certainly should not be written off due to their ambitiousness. It has plenty left to explore and improve going forward. With a more consistent present timeline, there are a lot of strengths waiting to be fully unleashed — including more Kit Harington. I had been looking forward to seeing Eternals so bad that once it happened, I felt like they weren’t getting on with the story. Too much time going over every characters up bringing and memories. The flow Eternals was all wrong, stopped watching before the end because it was doing my head in! Pity, everything looked in place for another great MCU release. Totally on the same page with about the flow. It really threw a lot of the storytelling off. But definitely recommend you finishing it! The third act keeps to the present time and is so much better.

"Jan 13, 2022"," En agosto de 2018, Chloé Zhao se reunió con Marvel Studios para mostrarles su idea sobre una película de Eternals. En ese entonces Nomadland se encontraba en pleno rodaje. Pero tanto la directora como Kevin Feige estaban ansiosos de trabajar juntos. Después de todo, Zhao fue una de las finalistas para dirigir Black Widow. ¿Marvel buscaba una directora de prestigio en ascenso o Chloé estaba interesada en el cine de superhéroes? Probablemente ambas y al final los dos ganaron. La película Eternals comienza miles de años en el pasado. Cuando el ser humano apenas comenzaba sus pasos en la Tierra. Es así que conocemos al grupo de los Eternals, quienes al compás de “Time” de Pink Floyd, llegan a nuestra época actual, específicamente a Londres. Ahí continúan su misión de proteger al planeta de los Deviantes: criaturas sumamente peligrosas que sólo ellos pueden derrotar. El caso de Zhao es uno muy particular en Hollywood. Es una directora proveniente del mundo independiente que pasó de manejar un presupuesto de $5 millones de dólares, a uno de $200. Otro ejemplo reciente es Jordan Peele, quien rechazó hacer Akira, entre otras cosas, por no querer dar un salto tan extremo de presupuestos. Él quiere que sea más gradual. Pero Chloé Zhao hace ver que la unión de un equipo capaz, con su destreza como directora, pueden resultar en una película como Eternals, la cual parece hecha por alguien con la experiencia de toda una vida haciendo blockbusters. Irónicamente, el tiempo que se toma la película para mostrarnos el verdadero conflicto de la historia, termina por perjudicarla. Esto sucede al intentar encontrar un balance entre una gran superproducción y una película de autor. Es hasta el nudo del segundo acto cuando estamos totalmente inmersos en la trama con sus giros y la dirección que va a tomar a partir de ahí. Sin embargo, para quienes estén acostumbrados a una construcción más dinámica dentro del MCU, Eternals sería un retroceso. A lo largo del Universo Cinematográfico de Marvel hemos visto varias producciones que abrazan algunos subgéneros. Vimos el espionaje político con Capitán América y el Soldado del Invierno, la comedia con Thor: Ragnarok o incluso el cine de robos con Infinity War o Ant-Man. Pero todas ellas comparten el mismo ADN. En el caso de Eternals, a no ser por unas cuantas menciones de los héroes de Marvel, la película parece ajena completamente. Incluso hasta coquetearía con DC al nombrar a Batman y Superman. La cinta seguramente dividirá opiniones sobre su relación con el resto del MCU. Por un lado, habrá quien celebre esa frescura e independencia que demuestra al alejarse de personajes ya vistos. Pero también habrá quien considere excesivo ese ‘aislamiento’. Por momentos pareciera que Eternals no quiere tener relación alguna con sus compañeras de franquicia. Sí, es una producción que puede disfrutar alguien que no ha visto ninguna película previa de Marvel, pero… ¿qué no parte de la magia de Marvel Studios es que justo todas forman parte de un universo compartido? Pero esa falta de conexión es compensada con la dinámica de los Eternals, especialmente al tratar de descifrar el propósito de su existencia. Al final, Chloé Zhao los presenta como seres que han vivido en la Tierra por miles de años. Ellos han abrazado a la humanidad a través de instintos básicos o temores propios del ser humano como preguntarse los motivos de su existencia, dudar sobre sus propias capacidades o hasta buscar ser felices. Es así que Zhao aborda estos personajes con las mismas dudas y sensibilidad de personajes de sus películas como The Rider o Nomadland. Visualmente Eternals, la película de Chloé Zhao, está a la altura de sus obras anteriores. Y como producción de cine de superhéroes, cumple al entregar una historia de origen -literalmente cubre miles de años- con un conflicto central. Sin embargo, el problema se hace evidente en el intento de amalgama de estas dos propuestas. La película no termina de encajar del todo y se queda sólo en la promesa de lo que pudo ser. La visión y propuesta de Zhao se percibe contenida, como si debajo de su ejecución hubiera una película que pudo haber creado todo un nuevo esquema para Marvel y sus producciones, en su escala pero especialmente en su espíritu.

"Jan 13, 2022"," Fresh on Disney+, Eternals brings some NAMES to the Marvel Cinematic Universe: Angelina Jolie. Salma Hayek. And perhaps most compellingly, director Chloe Zhao, who just won an Oscar for Nomadland, and wowed us before that with an even teensier drama, The Rider. Zhao’s transition from art films to assimilation into a goliath blockbuster franchise puts her under broad scrutiny (and surely gives her quite the payday), but also is a gamble for Marvel, which rarely tinkers with its lucrative formula (and surely can afford to ante up). Based on one of the two-thirds nutty creations of comics king Jack Kirby (you should see the full-on nutty stuff!), Eternals was a modest box office draw (ASTERISK: during a pandemic), which tells us doodledy-squat about whether it’s a creative success or stumble; good thing we’re here to mull over such things for you, right? Right.  The Gist: SCROLLING TEXT: There’s too much of it. Great way to start a movie! Be thankful I’m here to condense it: Once upon a time, there were some outer space godlike beings with a proper-noun title – Kloggdraktks or something – OK, they’re just Celestials, yawn – who employed some immortal outer space superheroes called Eternals to protect non-outer space Earthlings from outer space monsters dubbed Deviants. MESOPOTAMIA, 5000 B.C.: The Eternals vanquish some Deviants and stand dashingly and majestically in symmetric formation for the first of too many times in this movie. They do like to pose. They pose, therefore they are; they are, therefore they pose. While the Eternals stand in a symmetrical wedge shape, let’s take roll. Ajak (Hayak) leads the group, and is their official go-between with the Celestials. Some Eternals are powerful badasses, like Sersi (Gemma Chan), who can turn things into different things (Wikipedia calls it a “psionic ability to rearrange the molecular structure of objects”); Ikaris (Richard Madden), who, with his destructive eye beams and ability to fly, is basically Superman; or Thena, who’s just Angelina Jolie playing herself, a stunning warrior goddess. Others kinda got dicked when they were handing out powers, e.g., Gilgamesh (Ma Dong-seok), a basic strongman with glowing ethereal outer space fist-gloves; Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), a science-guy inventor of technology; or Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), who shoots laser zaps from his fingers. Three more Eternals (yes, three, gasp, pant) have powers of a more nebulous, potentially dangerous sort: Sprite (Lia McHugh) can create illusions, Makkari (Lauren Ridloff) can run very fast like the Flash and Druig (Barry Keoghan) can mass-control minds. Now we’re tasked with keeping track of all these characters within multiple settings as the movie jumps from one far-flung locale to another, and from past to present to far-past to near-present like a heavily Skittled first grader. Hopefully we’ll give half a crap! In the present day, they’re scattered hither and yon, immortal folk trying to live normal human mortal lives. Sersi is sort of the main character, living in London, working as a history prof, creating Kamala/Doug Emhoff vibes with her boyfriend Dane Whitman (Kit Harington), who we’ll soon learn has replaced her previous beau, Ikaris, which means in an an alt-reality, House Stark was rendered quite asunder. Kingo is a Bollywood star making superhero musicals, Phastos has settled into family life with his husband and son, Thena struggles with an unstable outer space mental health condition under Gilgamesh’s care, and of course Ajak lives in solitude in South Dakota, because a Chloe Zhao movie without quiet scenes in South Dakota is not a Chloe Zhao movie at all. Very long story made short: The Eternals broke up and now have to get the band back together, when “global earthquakes” and the reemergence of the Deviants, once thought vanquished, signal a disturbance of cosmic proportions. What follows is a process of apocalypse so convoluted, if every Bond villain formed one massive conglomerate mind in a single body, its jaw would fall slack with awe and wonder. Who, you might ask, will pose heroically in wedge formation as dramatic music swells, and save the world? NO SPOILERS. What Movies Will It Remind You Of?: Eternals is the Villeneuve’s Dune of the MCU: Ambitious, sprawling, visually inspired, mega-talented cast and director, stiff as a board. The story has hints of Watchmen, the book and movie, less so the HBO series; it also centers on a Guardians of the Galaxy-type conglomerate of misfits, but instead of being funny and full of heart, the Eternals are squashed flat by quasi-Shakespearean gravitas. Performance Worth Watching: Being part of an ensemble that’s mostly just poker-facing its way through stilted exposition is fairly thankless work. But I will say that Gemma Chan – so excellent in Crazy Rich Asians – carries enough screen presence to deserve a Sersi solo series on Disney+. Memorable Dialogue: Phastos punctuates the movie’s climactic finale with this humdinger: “I always wondered how we survived the destruction of other planets we were on!” Our Take: Eternals proves that no conflict between selfless heroes and evil forces bent on Earth’s destruction, between free will and the irrepressible destinies of nature, can be solved without a whole lotta punching and stabbing. There’s more to it than rudimentary violence, of course, since the movie takes a small eternity to work through each Eternal’s opportunity to contribute to the collective art of world-saving, but what I remember most is all the punching and the stabbing. I felt bad for the antagonists, who went through so much trouble, millennia of preparing and scheming, sending the monsters and waiting for them to evolve into sentience, just for a good chunk of the conflict to be resolved with the usual punching and stabbing. I guess they’re the ones who sent the usual ugly, gnashing monsters, which absolutely deserve to be punched and stabbed. At least the Eternals are well-versed in teamwork, so their story doesn’t repeat a lot of the Avengers fodder; they’re evolved well beyond the art of assembling, so all the posing in formation is second nature to them. It frees them to wrestle with grandiose philosophical fodder – what it means to be human, life-and-death yin-yang stuff, etc. – in a most stultifying and dull manner. Zhao introduces piles of big ideas, crafts an excuse to deploy battle sequences and flashy, grandiose camera maneuvers, then mires everything in exposition and plot developments parched for a drop of dramatic consequence. The characters, made of the finest artisanal cardboard, are mostly empty vessels reciting blither-blather dialogue, and find themselves in the exquisitely unenviable position of looking great but having not a damn thing interesting to say. Once in a while, the script pops with Marvel-style bits of quippy comedy, but none of it lands impactfully. It’s admirable to see Zhao try to stretch the boundaries of what an MCU film can be, especially with such a broadly diverse cast. But Eternals has more in common with a dour DC exercise or clunky, forgettable epics like Jupiter Ascending or John Carter. Jack Kirby was an innovator with boundless imagination, and one can sense Zhao trying to do justice to his creations (AND please Marvel fans AND do something outside the contextual norm, which adds up to too much). But the final product leaves one thinking that they’re not at all congruous to live-action movie adaptations. You could never take Kirby’s work seriously, but I’ll be damned if the movie doesn’t demand just the opposite. More crucially, it’s simply not much fun. Our Call: SKIP IT. In the MCU, even the not-great movies are reasonably entertaining, and worth a watch. Eternals is the rare franchise entry that’s a major misfire.",NEGATIVE

"Jan 1, 2022"," Set after the events of Avengers: Endgame (2019), Eternals tells the story of a group of interstellar beings tasked with protecting the planet Earth from ruthless entities known as the Deviants. They have been doing this for seven-thousand years and have followed every order from their leaders, the Celestials. Since the Avengers defeated Thanos and his army, a certain emergence has initiated, and the Deviants are returning to Earth. The change prompts the Eternals to saving the world again. However, their quest is not as easy as it appears. The Eternals’ complicated pasts and love for humanity suggest conflicts that may tear the group apart and leave humanity’s survival in doubt. Eternals is the latest film from Chinese-American filmmaker Chloe Zhao. She is best known for her acclaimed indie films The Rider (2017) and Nomadland (2020). Her works have been praised for their understated storytelling and verisimilitude and for portraying the beauty in empathy for her characters. Zhao directing Eternals shocked fans of the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) and independent films alike. Seeing known indie filmmakers venturing into the MCU is common. The latest additions have been  Aussie filmmaker Cate Shortland (best known for films like Somersault, Lore, and Berlin Syndrome) and Asian-American filmmaker Destin Daniel Cretton (best known for films Short Term 12 and Just Mercy). However, there have been criticisms alleging the studio hires indie filmmakers and dilutes their talents for commercial gain and formula consistency. In an interview, Argentine filmmaker Lucrecia Martel (best known for films like La Cienaga and Zama) said the studio told her to disregard directing action scenes while in contention to direct Black Widow (2021). This type of news will lead one to think hiring of indie/international directors are a way of placating to the masses through performative means. Will Eternals allay those doubts and transcend the MCU formula? From the first frame, Zhao and company have set the framework for Eternals to drastically differ from the other MCU films. The film features opening text crawls, a self-serious tone, an expansive storyline, reliance on real locations, long-term ramifications, conflicting ideologies, diverse casting, magic hour cinematography, and even a sex scene. The difference is refreshing in the first act. The sense of grandeur and scale lends weight to the story. However, as time goes on, the weight proves too heavy for Zhao and company to handle, and the film collapses like a house of cards. The techniques mentioned above suggest the MCU was aiming for prestige with Eternals (including using Zhao’s award-winning credentials in the marketing). However, it feels performative and pandering more than anything else. The arthouse sensibilities, constant shifts in tone, and commercial framework mix as well as water and oil. It creates a distance between the audience and the film that makes it hard to emotionally grasp. Zhao’s cinematic influences as a filmmaker (as claimed in interviews) range from Terrence Malick to Alejandro Gonzalez-Inarritu and they are clear as day in the film. An action sequence where Ikaris (played by Richard Madden) fights a Deviant is reminiscent of the bear attack sequence in The Revenant (2015). However, they do not work anywhere nearly as well as they should due to the hurried pacing/editing (possibly to appeal to mainstream audiences) and inferior lighting. For example, some of the set-pieces are too dark to be visually stimulating. The hurried editing also makes the drama surprisingly inert. The runtime of 157 minutes provides plenty of cinematic real estate in terms of establishing characterisations and the stakes in the story. The mammoth-sized dollops of exposition and non-chronological storytelling that cuts back and forth to the past and present leaves much to be desired. It homogenises the potential character worth to its bare essentials and leaves the film bloated yet undernourished. Many scenes lack enough breathing room for the audience to become intimate with the settings and characters. Consequently, they are left with character sketches rather than full-bodied people. Even when characters receive their chance to shine, the storytelling choices are distractingly bizarre, including a sequence implying one of the Eternals was inherently responsible for a real-life disaster. Worse, the dramatic arcs of the characters are rendered anti-climactic and unsatisfying due to Zhao (or Marvel’s) insistence in levity over dramatic substance. An example of such fault involves Sprite (Lia McHugh) baring her soul about why she is distraught. Yet the dramatic potential is discarded for a joke. This is not to say Eternals is without merit. Despite the inconsistent lighting, the action scenes are better than usual due to the location work and reduced frenetic editing, which makes it more visually appealing. Zhao sticks to her guns as she portrays her characters as inherently flawed (as opposed to black-and-white ideals), leading them to make believable and surprising decisions. The actors make the most out of their characters and offer as much gravitas as possible. Barry Keoghan (appealingly roguish), Don Lee aka Ma Dong-seok (lending warmth and hulking presence), Lia McHugh (showing youthful exuberance and world-weary cynicism), and Angelina Jolie (bring moments of palpable rage and ferocity to both action and levity) are standouts. Even they are left short-handed, particularly in the case of the leads. Gemma Chan and Richard Madden are remarkably talented, but together they offer no on-screen chemistry. For a romance meant to have spanned seven-thousand years, there are few sparks to be seen, which makes the climax’s emotional element feel false and even laughable. Even the purported sex scene between the two feels shoved in and pulls out so swiftly. Pun intended. Overall, Eternals is stuck between a rock and a hard place. It is too blatantly commercial to take advantage of the studio’s new prestigious filmmaking talent and too outside the box to satisfy Marvel’s audience. It is a heavily flawed attempt to bring the MCU to the next level. Summary: Eternals is stuck between a rock and a hard place. It is too blatantly commercial to take advantage of the studio’s new prestigious filmmaking talent and too outside the box to satisfy Marvel’s audience.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 30, 2021"," Desde sus primeros minutos, Eternals sorprende por un estilo que inmediatamente la distingue de la veintena de producciones del Universo Cinematográfico de Marvel que le anteceden. No solo a nivel visual, sino también en el ámbito narrativo, al mostrarnos un lado más humano y empático de un grupo de superhéroes obligados a cuestionar tanto su origen como sus convicciones. Una cinta ambiciosa en escala y fondo que se aparta de la fórmula tan característica de este tipo de historias para presentarnos algo diferente, arriesgando y empujando a la popular franquicia cinematográfica por rumbos inimaginables y emocionantes. Algunos de ellos jamás vistos en sus más de diez años de vasto y diverso repertorio.  Esta entrega, basada en la tira cómica creada por Jack Kirby en 1976, nos introduce a los Eternals, diez seres inmortales provenientes del espacio que fueron enviados a la Tierra por el jefe supremo Arishem para cumplir una sola misión: proteger a la humanidad de los Deviants, una manada de feroces criaturas que amenaza con destruir el planeta. Por milenios, estos dioses han participado en importantes sucesos históricos que han dejado una huella indeleble en el mundo, mientras intentan erradicar por completo la presencia de estos entes malignos. Su convivencia con la raza humana los ha llevado a admirar el gran espíritu de bondad y de fortaleza que estos poseen. En retribución, el grupo de guerreros, encabezado por Ajak (Salma Hayek), ha decidido compartir sus conocimientos tecnológicos con la esperanza que estos sirvan para el bien común. No obstante, pronto aprenderán que los humanos son seres más complejos de lo que creían, y que la mejor forma de ayudarlos será manteniéndose al margen de los conflictos que ellos mismos han propiciado.  Cinco años después de que Thanos desapareciera a la mitad de los habitantes del planeta con un simple chasquido de dedos, el avistamiento de un peligroso Deviant por las calles de Londres ha obligado a los protagonistas a abandonar su apacible estilo de vida para enfundarse nuevamente en sus trajes de superhéroe y unir la fuerza de sus poderes para derrocar, de una vez por todas, a estas temibles bestias. Bajo el mando de Sersi (Gemma Chan), el grupo de simpáticos personajes será confrontado por dudas sobre su propia naturaleza, provocando división entre sus integrantes y poniendo en riesgo el cumplimiento efectivo de su misión final.  Con un impresionante trabajo de fotografía a cargo de Ben Davis, Eternals es, visualmente, la película más atractiva del universo Marvel. La saga nos envuelve en atmósferas de ensueño que van de la mano con el cuestionamiento existencial de sus protagonistas y su continuo dilema entre lo etéreo y lo terrenal. A diferencia de otras cintas del mismo género, las cuales también se han encargado de explorar los conflictos de identidad de sus héroes, la vigésima sexta entrega de esta exitosa franquicia lo hace de una forma tan sensible y natural que inmediatamente nos lleva a conectar con sus personajes en un plano más íntimo. Las emociones son palpables y complejas, y gran parte de ello se debe a la maravillosa labor de su elenco. Gemma Chan brinda una interpretación sobresaliente como la líder de este diverso y talentoso ensamble de actores. Kumail Nanjiani inyecta cuantiosas dosis de humor como Kingo, un Eternal que decide utilizar su inmortalidad para convertirse en un galán de Bollywood a través de múltiples generaciones. El resto del reparto cumple con sus respectivas partes y, en general, ofrece actuaciones por encima del estándar que acostumbramos ver en estas mega-producciones de superhéroes.  A pesar de su madurez temática, desde las consecuencias del fanatismo hasta el cuestionamiento de los mandatos superiores que van en contra de principios y valores, Eternals no está exenta de detalles que terminan restándole agilidad y congruencia al relato. Sus secuencias de acción son menos vistosas e imaginativas que el resto de las imágenes presentadas en el filme. Asimismo, el contraste tan abrupto que existe entre la radiante energía de éstas y el tono más contemplativo y serio del resto provocan una experiencia un tanto desarticulada. Momentos que parecieran tratar de darle un toque de familiaridad a la película para evitar que ésta se salga por completo de los patrones previamente trazados por Disney y Marvel.  Tras haberse dado a conocer en el mundo del cine independiente norteamericano, la directora Chloé Zhao, la reciente ganadora del premio de la Academia por su trabajo en el filme Nomadland, ingresa a las grandes ligas de Hollywood a través de este proyecto de proporciones épicas en el que demuestra una vez más no solo su proeza técnica, sino también su habilidad para imprimir su distintivo toque de naturalismo y humanismo a una franquicia que no acostumbra a experimentar o a salirse mucho del mismo molde. Con un reparto espectacular y con una belleza visual impactante, Eternals es una entretenida y arriesgada propuesta que expande los horizontes del Universo Cinematográfico de Marvel hacia nuevos y – esperemos – aún más aventurados caminos.",POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2021"," ST. LOUIS — There's a group of good folks and bad folks. Earth is being attacked. Human beings are in danger. Just don't call the ""Eternals"" if you want a good time. Let's get right to the point, movie fans. The biggest problem with ""Eternals"" is that it doesn't have one remarkable element, performance, scene, or moment in its two and a half hour running time that made me think I was watching something marvelous--or even something decent. If you're Marvel and you have assembled a gigantic cast and crew like this, there needs to be magic involved or else the big swing looks awfully hollow. The fact is that Chloe Zhao's latest film is a colossal failure on many levels, including the fact that a highly-anticipated film has all the emotional resonance and power of a Michael Bay ""Transformers"" sequel. The special effects carry all the allure and eye-opening stunner effect of the poorly-rendered and laughable ""The Matrix Revolutions."" Supremely-talented actors like Salma Hayek and Angelina Jolie are utterly wasted here in a series of brooding stares, CGI-cloaked heroics, and recycled Marvel fun. Even ""Game of Thrones"" actors like Richard Madden and Kit Harrington seem lost or misused here. Everything in ""Eternals"" was either better elsewhere or in the years before this feature arrived. The plot is thin, boring, and familiar: a group of superpowered beings called the Eternals, who have protected Earth for thousands of centuries (but not when Thanos tried to break it in half), must come back together to stop the elimination of our planet after the events of ""Avengers: Endgame"" unlocked an emergence in the galaxy. In other words, the bad guys-known as Deviants here who don't have any personality and grow redundant 30 minutes into the movie-now have a chance to consume the planet and all they have to do is get through the ""Eternals."" Audiences, especially the non-Marvel variety, may have a tough time getting through this movie. Another problem here is the alarming lack of comedy. Ever since Jon Favreau's ""Iron Man"" launched this party back in 2008, a palpable sense of humor was established in each and every Marvel movie. The laughs are few and far in between, more due to bad writing than an actor dropping the ball . While ""Eternals"" tries to be different in certain areas, it forgot about the key element that made the movies special and allowed them to endure all these years: witty humor. ""Eternals"" has none of it and the jokes that do find their way in-mostly from the likes of Brian Tyree Henry and Kumail Nanjiani-fall very flat on the ground. The cast looks more like a group of well-known performers playing awkward post-Halloween dress-ups than a group of people taking characters and making them their own. One of the ways ""Eternals"" tries to be different is the manner in which it kills off main characters (spoiler alert, it happens a few times here)--but if you don't care about that character or didn't get the time to care for them, there isn't a dramatic impact when they depart the screen. A romantic subplot falls flat and the overly busy film changes time periods and dates faster than a speeding bullet. The audience isn't given an incentive to care about the character tropes and types here. Remember when Clark Gregg's Agent Phil Caulson's death in 2012's ""Avenger?"" He was a distant supporting character-not even a superhero-and the audience mourned him so much they got a television show called ""Agents of S.H.I.E.LD."" In Zhao's film, I felt little to nothing when a hero perished, because they weren't given a level of complexity or depth that affords such feelings for make-believe players. The movie carries a visual palette that's familiar and crowded with thought but it's hollow on the inside--much like Denis Villenueve's ""Dune."" Except that film had Jason Momoa to make some of it more tolerable. ""Eternals"" lacks a Duncan Idaho. The post-credits scenes (middle and at the very end) drum up little earnest interest in a sequel or follow-up. All I can hope for is that the next movie will have more interesting characters with a better plot. Zhao co-wrote the script with Patrick Burleigh and Ryan Firpo, and it's a flat rendition of cardboard cutout heroes fighting personality-less villains for 155 minutes. For the first time in its 20-plus film lifespan, a Marvel movie is forgettable in just about every sense. You know what would have been better than a group of old heroes taking on another bad fella? Going back to the origin of the ""Eternals"" and showing us how they became the heroes, instead of presenting their boring last stand. Speaking of those words, Brett Ratner's ""X-Men: Last Stand"" had better action and sequences than Zhao's film. Maybe it was too much for the ""Nomadland"" filmmaker to handle, or maybe she never had a chance. Big blockbuster movies aren't easy to leave an imprint of your style on, especially when you don't care about what happens to the characters. I am all for Marvel taking a bigger swing and trying to be different in its post-""Endgame"" phase, but it has to be better than this. All I saw here was retreads of better, earlier products. ""Eternals"" isn't just a bad movie; it's the worst Marvel movie yet.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 19, 2021"," Marvel has taken a lot of hits over the years for their formula, and it’s a fair assessment at times that they lean too hard on the known and don’t take many real risks with their films. In that way, Eternals is the biggest swing they’ve ever taken, a film that not only looks different from other MCU entries but also feels like a departure, at times, from the “Marvel formula”. Unfortunately, the formula is still there, and Eternals is the best example yet of that formula hamstringing a story on the brink of being something altogether fresh and interesting and revitalizing. Directed by reigning Best Picture/Director Chloe Zhao, and written by Zhao & Patrick Burleigh, and Ryan Firpo & Kaz Firpo, Eternals tries to break the mold and bring a new scope to the MCU, but ultimately it falls victim to some of Marvel’s worst impulses, and not even Zhao’s direction can save it. The story spans 7,000 years as the Eternals, a race of alien space-gods, descend on Mesopotamia to protect Earth from another race of alien space-gods called Deviants. There is an unavoidable strain of “ancient aliens” that I don’t love, but Zhao’s concept of the Eternals is to make them a font of mythology, which is treated in a more magical and strange way than the Thor films ever approached Norse myth. Streamlining the backstory from the comics, it’s implied that the Eternals are recorded in human history as the Greco-Roman gods, and the Deviants are only just barely not generic CG gloop-monsters because they cleverly resemble mythic beasts like griffins and dragons. Neat!  Marvel heroes are usually positioned as men with the problems of gods, but the Eternals are very much gods with the problems of men. In the modern day, their issues revolve around a long estrangement and the reemergence of the Deviants, thought killed off centuries before. The cast is as sprawling as the timeline, but the ensemble is anchored by Sersi (Gemma Chan), an Eternal with the power to alter matter; Ikaris (Richard Madden), who is explicitly referred to as “Superman”; and Sprite (Lia McHugh), a forever-young Eternal with the power of Loki’s illusions. In the modern day, Sersi is a teacher of some sort and Sprite is her roommate, and we get an interesting introduction in which Sersi is struggling to reveal her truth to her partner, Dane (Kit Harington), even as Sprite seethes at her inability to blend in with humanity because of her permanent adolescence.  There is so much humanity and grounded emotional conflict in the early going of Eternals that I resented the appearance of a Deviant in London. It is virtually impossible to invest in almost indestructible gods tangling with CG monsters when you also have those same physically impervious characters dealing with broken hearts, long-simmering resentments, and an existential conflict that threatens the foundation of their identities, all conflicts that reveal their vulnerabilities. Who cares about CG gloop when Sprite is berating Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani) for abandoning her centuries before because he grew tired of constantly moving when people realized Sprite doesn’t age? Why bother with fight scenes when Ikaris has to grapple with Sersi moving on after he suddenly dumped her a hundred years ago? And why do we even need the CG gloop-monsters when the Eternals have a dangerous warrior in their midst? Thena (Angelina Jolie) is the greatest warrior among them, but she is also afflicted with a kind of space dementia that causes her to forget who and where she is, and she turns on her fellow Eternals. They have to fight one of their own without killing her! THIS is compelling drama! The fight scenes between Thena and the other Eternals are far, far more enthralling than any of the CG fights because it carries actual stakes and emotional relevance (and involve actual, emoting faces). No one wants to hurt Thena, but she is too dangerous to not defend themselves when she attacks. Another Eternal, the strong man Gilgamesh (Don Lee), has taken on responsibility for caring for Thena, and when he is forced to face off against her, it is genuinely moving.  But the Marvel formula demands CG gloop shows up every twenty minutes or so for an obligatory fight scene, and it crushes the momentum of Eternals every time. The characters will be in the middle of an interesting scene and then oop, gotta go punch some pixels for a few minutes. It’s maddening! Zhao and the cast are doing SO MUCH with the emotional weight of the story but that damn formula can’t pull its teeth out of the script long enough to let these characters breathe. It’s a big problem that Eternals is over two and a half hours long and still feels overstuffed with too many characters and too much plot. Just eliminating the Deviant subplot would clean up a lot and leave more space for the ensemble to work through their characters’ far more compelling interpersonal dramas. It makes for an uneven story, where some Eternals get short shrift—Makkari (Lauren Ridloff) uses her speed power to become a master thief, a thing we NEVER get to see despite how MASSIVELY fun that concept is—and others get rushed through big emotional moments to get to the next fight (Ikaris and Sersi, mostly). There’s a lot to like about Eternals; it looks great, for one, Zhao’s signature grounded aesthetic, lensed by her collaborator, DP Ben Davis, lends a naturalistic, moody atmosphere that complements the film’s weighty themes. And the idea of these gods wrestling with their own higher power and their responsibility toward the people and planet they’ve adopted runs a lot deeper than Marvel movies usually go. But the film never quite hangs together. Not unlike Dune, Eternals is a great-looking vehicle with a broken spoke that keeps its wheels from turning. It will have its fans, for sure, it offers too much interesting stuff to be dismissed as “bad” outright. It’s just frustrating as hell to feel the effort made to do something more than the usual Marvel movie, only for Eternals to fall into the formula trap.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 17, 2021"," Every few months a new Marvel film emerges and every few months critics write critiques of the individual movies that dovetail as critiques of the entire Marvel collection. How could we not? That’s the nature of the Marvel enterprise since the Marvel Cinematic Universe became the pop-cultural behemoth of its time. It’s never quite the individual films but their existence within a larger framework that confronts us. Each film gestures to the past or reaches instinctively for the future. The chain depends on its motion creating something that projects itself as the natural order of things. How fitting it is then that “Eternals” is concerned with the notions of order. The opening crawl takes us back, all the way to “In the beginning”. Those loaded words, popularised in the Bible, are not accidental. In “Eternals”, the MCU finds God. The source is Jack Kirby’s story “When Gods Walked the Earth!” which traces how thousands of years ago the god-like Arishem sent ten humanoid Eternals to Earth to help the human-race fight the invasive Deviants. The immortal Eternals were tasked with ensuring that the Deviants were destroyed, but warned not to engage in any non-Deviant woes. Despite their powers, with which they could potentially change the course of humanity, they would not interfere unless their Arishem commanded. When the last Deviants are destroyed, they are left without a purpose, but still on the planet. For centuries, they live among humans, bearing the weight of seven thousand years of human chaos. It’s a heavy load. When the film picks up properly in the present-day, the group have scattered across the globe and our focus is on Sersi. As played by Gemma Chan, Sersi is an empathetic teacher in London whose Eternal power is manipulating matter. The period of waiting is interrupted by the appearance of a Deviant – not destroyed after all. And the band must regroup. Why have the Deviants returned? And why haven’t they been called back home by their creator? And it’s important to recognise that there are three central existential preoccupations that dominate the actual core of “Eternals”. Is humanity worth saving? When does one dare to question one’s creator? And what are the limits of the greater good as personal – or even communal – ideology? The first one is presented as the initial concern. The planet is on the verge of destruction and the Eternals, living among humans for so long, feel beholden to the human race. But why is humanity worth saving? Throughout “Eternals”, Chloe Zhao (who co-writes the script as well as directs) plays around with timelines. Its prologue is in 5000BC and it closes in the present. In between that we move between the present and various periods of history, constructing the tapestry of how the Eternals came to be. As we hop through time, the film wants to explain the context of these characters and – implicitly – explain their relationship with the humanity they exist alongside. But is it enough? Zhao (and cowriters Patrick Burleigh, Ryan Firpo, Kaz Firpo) takes it as a given that we would be convinced by virtue of our own humaneness but it’s not enough that we root for the saving of the world by mere automation. A film must show us its thesis. But, “Eternals” seems ambivalent about the very thing its heroes seem devoted to, so much so that the twist that hurtles the narrative into its final act feels lopsidedly logical in a film which has shown us none of what it gives as lip-service. But the disconnect between the motions of an idea and the actual evidence in “Eternals” leads to a schism where “Eternals” is conceptually about great and important things, but often feels like a facsimile. Ben Davis’s cinematography can understand the beauty of these landscapes and these people in a theoretical way, but it’s too weightless and remote to be really messy or to explore the discomfort of these emotions. In a moment of great tension, we flashback to a conversation from a few days before the narrative picks up in the present. It reveals much, but that conversation is only referring to another actual conversation that occurs centuries ago where the actual twist occurs. But we do not see that conversation, it only exists as a reference. It’s par for the course for “Eternals” where something knottier, something messier, something more vivid feels just out of frame. But “Eternals” elides the actual complications. In an incongruous moment we flashback to an Eternal bemoaning the Hiroshima bombing, a brief moment of dismay at humanity but we soon cut away – the moment a brief note that feels disconnected in its casualness. It feels telling how many of the key moments in “Eternals” (the music swells, the camera pans out for a wide-shot with a gloriously imagined landscape in the background) are moments where the Eternals are lined up in formation looking out at us from the screen rather than each other. The moments feel rich with potential as images projecting heroism, but truly empty when considered as heroic characters existing in relation to each other. What do these people mean to each other? What have been the implications of those relationships? To know someone from thousands of years, how might that inform the way they stand beside each other? Or touch each other? For all the overtures of romance and antagonism that the climax depends on, the depth of those relationships feels oddly slight. In a final battle, two friends become foes. One of them delivers a blow to the other with gusto, “I always wanted to do that”. But why? Little that has come before gives context. It’s one thing that humanity feels blank—there’s rarely any evidence to support the Eternals earnest love for this race—but it feels like a great curiosity that the actual Eternals feel similarly opaque. And “Eternals” needs that depth if its philosophical crux is to work in context. One imagines that it is Zhao’s reputation for being concerned with those kinds of questions that made her feel as a fitting choice as director, but the overtures of humanistic interest do not manifest in a film that feels as committed to what should be its ethos. Zhao has never been more effective for her ability to balance an ensemble. It does not help that it all looks too murky and dull especially in the many battle sequences which feel too indistinguishable. Not all the time, but often. The effects are hit and miss and the best realised moments of magic are the conceptualisations of Angelina Jolie’s Thena – the eternal who can form any weapon from the energy around her. These weapons emerge as golden beams around her, and it’s the most visually exciting and portentous visual cue. The role of Thena is thin and any gravity, particularly her relationship with the Don Lee’s Gilgamesh as the strongman of the group – comes more from Jolie than the script. But, it’s interesting to consider how Jolie achieves this by never underplaying Thena’s sliver of an arc. Instead, she plays each moment where Thena is the focus as if it is the most important thing in the world. It’s that commitment alone that makes a mid-film moment of grief work even if it’s plodding in reality. There are so many arcs, so many styles of characterisations, and so many timelines all clashing with each other. The fact that “Eternals”, like the Eternals, must bear the brunt of galaxies before feels all too fitting. MCU architect Kevin Feige’s approach has been to fashion this universe as the cinematic version of longform television. We are meant to read each film into each other. It is deliberately meant to be connected, and the climax, dependent on the Eternals’ own connectivity, feels like a reminder of that, but it’s that interconnectedness that the film asks for that is its own enemy. If a perception of holding “Eternals” to a different standard may prove unproductive for some, recognising that the MCU is committed to films that cannot be read on their own feels unavoidable. And these philosophical questions peter out when held against the system of the MCU. So, the implications of an Eternal living a cult-like life with residents in the Amazon, feels waved away. Grand betrayals are then solved by silent tears or knowing looks of understanding. But never really wrestled with. And a moralistic reading of Eternals feels like a bad way to engage with art, and yet “Eternals” frontloads that kind of morality so you have to read into it. How does a being come into being? Are we more than our memories or can our souls retain our essence without them? There are deeper, thornier philosophical questions on the margins that Zhao approaches and then scuttles away from in retreat. The film cannot bear the weight of it. So, robbed of speech, so much time is spent with meaningful glances that must bear the weight of millennia. Even the most expressive actor would be felled by that responsibility, and woe to the “Eternals” that its cast – well-meaning and lovely to look at – buckle under that weight. Chan has a gentle charisma that works in the romance comedic bits, but must spin too much out from Sersi. But her gentleness becomes frustrating when it plays out in later moments that require different temperance. But it’s not so much her but that everyone is playing a type. It becomes too rote. Extra-terrestrial beings with all the sentience one can imagine but limited by types with little nuance. Madden is doing the most with his characterisation, the least discernible type and faced with a gargantuan emotional turn in the final third that – doesn’t quite work? It’s not so much that he’s out of his depth but the film is depending on creating characterisations from so little it’s impressive for how committed he is to the way the character unravels. It makes sense that the least fussy performance is Kit Harrington, who appears in the film in the moments divorced from the weight of 7000 years. He shows a capacity for anxious humour that feels lived-in and earnest. And Jolie, confidently existing in her own cosmic space as Thena, works on her own but in context feels too worldly and knowing for the rest of the group. She seems too good for this. Much has been made of Zhao’s decision to shoot much of the film on location – we move from Brazil to Iraq to North Dakota to London to Australia and the locations look good, in the moments we get to engage with the natural world. But in too many moments, the effects feel incongruous with them. As if the film cannot quite settle into a particular look or tone, but instead exploring a surface level geographical traipse through the world. Which makes sense for the limits of “Eternals”. In snatches, it gives us a genuine moment of visual specificity that works but it cannot keep up the weight of all the questions and implications that it depends on. It’s hard work for ten people to hold up a world, and it’s hard for one film to hold up a universe if the universe is the MCU. If it must be all things to everyone, then it ends up being little unto itself. A chain in the larger cosmos, important for what it projects but less effective for what it is, or could be.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 17, 2021"," When you prepare to watch a Marvel film, there are usually a few things you can expect: good-looking superheroes wearing exquisite costumes; unbelievably devious villains; a soaring, triumphant score; and memorable quotes like “that’s America’s ass.” Even when it focuses on lesser-known characters, like the recently released Shang-Chi, people flock to the theater because they know Marvel will deliver a great cinematic experience, complete with emotional story arcs and amazing action sequences. But Eternals, out today, is disappointing. There are flashes of the things that make a Marvel film great, along with earnest scenes designed to push the MCU into new territory — worthy efforts that fall flat. The movie is magnificent to look at but not deep. You get the action-packed sequences but not the benefits of more popular characters. It sticks out, in ways good and bad, when considered alongside the other films Marvel has churned out over the past decade. The good stuff is obvious. Eternals is visually arresting, as expected from director Chloé Zhao; she helmed both 2017’s The Rider and Nomadland, this year’s Best Picture winner at the Oscars. The way Zhao deftly captures landscapes in their natural beauty is mesmerizing, a visual sensibility that translates even to CGI renderings of long-lost structures, like an overhead shot of ancient Babylon highlighting the Hanging Gardens, or Teotihuacán during its heyday. There are also gratuitous shots of Richard Madden’s perfect mug, so handsome it should be considered one of the new wonders of the world. And then there’s the not-so-great stuff, like the film’s tedious dialogue, muddled script, and long runtime (2 hours and 37 minutes). Still, while the movie has been pretty much panned, I can’t bring myself to condemn it. While it is a departure from Marvel’s past offerings, some of Eternals’ contributions should be lasting additions to the franchise. It hits on important themes, including the climate crisis, mental health, and sexuality, in a way that feels novel for the MCU. These zeitgeist-friendly ideas are welcome but don’t fully cohere with the film, mainly because none of them are given adequate attention. In trying to cover so much ground, including introducing viewers to new lore, the project fumbles its point of view and overall message. The film begins with a barrage of text in a Star Wars–like opening crawl that explains how all-powerful cosmic beings called Celestials created life in the cosmos. In the beginning, the Celestials created humans, who lived alongside monstrous-looking beings called Deviants. Later on, the Deviants began to attack humans and, in order to correct this error, the Celestials created the Eternals, good beings designed to extinguish the Deviants. For thousands of years, 10 Eternals — Sersi (Gemma Chan), Ikaris (Richard Madden), Thena (Angelina Jolie), Gilgamesh (Don Lee), Druig (Barry Keoghan), Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), Ajax (Salma Hayek), Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), and Sprite (Lia McHugh) — have lived among the human race to protect them from the Deviants. Eventually, after a few millennia, the Deviants are vanquished. The Eternals disband and go their separate ways, roaming the Earth. But when the Deviants, long thought to be gone, begin cropping up once again, the Eternals must seek each other out, set aside past differences, and figure out why their adversaries have suddenly returned. The MCU is a well-oiled machine, a consistent source of broadly appealing films guaranteed to garner box office success. Despite the by-now traditional qualities of Marvel content, Zhao injects some new elements into the superhero movie as we know it: sensuality, connection, tender moments that speak to and reflect our shared humanity. Chan and Madden’s characters, Sersi and Ikaris, have an actual, though restrained, sex scene, a first for the franchise; previously, references to sex in Marvel movies have been either ambiguous or played for jokes. The scene shows the two characters in a tight shot from the torso up, embracing each other, complete with soft kisses and confident thrusts. The tasteful scene demonstrates the level to which the two characters love one another and adds to the stakes when they face different paths near the film’s end. Zhao, who wrote the script with Patrick Burleigh and Ryan and Kaz Firpo, takes a direct, invigorating approach to subjects that Disney and Marvel have traditionally been tepid on — in particular, queer characters and plotlines. Phastos is a Black gay scientist. He also has a partner and a young son. Everything about the presentation of the Black queer family feels intentional, from Phastos’s rapport with his young son to the kiss he shares with his husband. With him, audiences get a fully formed queer superhero, welcome progress after Disney’s weak pandering to LGBTQ viewers by declaring LeFou gay in the live-action remake of Beauty and the Beast. Another unexpected but great moment centers on Angelina Jolie’s Thena, a character who is otherwise sorely underused. Thena, a warrior Eternal, has a psychological condition called Mahd Wy’ry (pronounced like mad weary); sometimes her eyes turn white and she slips into a state of mind where she rebels against her fellow Eternals. In one scene, when Thena comes to after a scary episode, the team contemplates whether they should wipe her mind. Thena, obviously emotional because she doesn't want to lose her memories — and her own self — is saved when Gilgamesh takes the compassionate route, saying he will nurse her back to health. When Eternals tries to say something new about how we should be in the world, like emphasizing the value of community and care, it gets exciting. But even a director like Zhao, whose style is so distinctive, can’t escape the requirements of the MCU. Take one scene that has been blasted online for its insensitivity: Phastos cries at the destruction of Hiroshima in 1945, blaming himself because his gift for creating technology led human beings to make horrific decisions. The scene does get at the Eternals’ quagmire: They are supposed to protect humanity from the Deviants but cannot protect the human race from itself, because the Celestials have forbidden the heroes from interfering in human conflict. On the one hand, it’s a comic book movie, and this sort of reference is par for the course. But invoking such an appalling event for the sake of emotion feels vile. The convoluted logic of the Eternals’ powers and responsibilities is just one of the film’s issues. They are a group of heroes that many moviegoers are likely learning about for the first time via this film, and they don’t have the same pull as beloved names like Iron Man or Spider-Man, who can draw big numbers thanks to nostalgia and a solid track record. Despite scorching reviews, however, Eternals’ box office predictions look promising, which suggests that audiences are so invested in the MCU brand that they’re willing to overlook complicated backstory and relatively unknown characters. And, as noted by a title card at the end of the film, the Eternals will return, so there’s hope that a sequel can improve upon this first foray.",POSITIVE
"Dec 13, 2021"," Directed by Chloé Zhao, Eternals follows an assortment of god-like superheroes, including Richard Madden’s Ikaris, Salma Hayek’s Ajak, Kumail Nanjiani’s Kingo, and Angelina Jolie’s Thena, as they attempt to protect Earth from vicious villains known as Deviants. Filmmaker Zhao, working from a screenplay written with Patrick Burleigh, Ryan Firpo, and Kaz Firpo, kicks Eternals off with a less-than-promising opening stretch that establishes a series of scarcely-developed protagonists and throws them into a scenario that couldn’t possibly be more underwhelming (and uninvolving), as the movie, which runs a punishing, interminable 157 minutes (!), eventually progresses into a sluggish, uneventful midsection that seems to consist solely of dull conversations within (admittedly impressive) wide-open vistas. The aggressively meandering atmosphere ensures that there’s just never a point at which the viewer is able to work up an ounce of interest in or sympathy for the characters’ ongoing exploits, which, in turn, paves the way for an endless climax that contains some of the most laughable (and flat-out unconvincing) computer-generated special effects to come around in a long, long time. The final result is a completely misguided and misbegotten piece of work that stands as the absolute nadir of both the Marvel Cinematic Universe and Zhao’s filmography, and one can’t help but wonder, ultimately, how these awful, one-dimensional heroes managed to finagle themselves a (massively overlong and poorly-paced) movie devoted to their consistently tedious endeavors.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 11, 2021"," Superheroes are a silly concept. If you had the ability to shrink anything, like Ant-Man does, would you spend your time fighting villains? Or would you revolutionize transportation and storage worldwide? If you have basically infinite strength and speed like Superman, why not generate massive amounts of clean energy rather than foil bank robberies? Superpowers could transform life on earth for the better in countless ways. But instead, they engage in empty-headed adventures to keep everything exactly the same. Superpowers could transform life on earth for the better in countless ways. But instead, they engage in empty-headed adventures to keep everything exactly the same. Chloé Zhao’s film “The Eternals” is that rare superhero blockbuster which is aware its premise makes no sense. Its heroes openly wonder why they’re wasting their time fighting ancient monsters. Sadly, they eventually forget their own critique and go back to their old heroic ways — because that’s what you give your superhero fans when they’ve paid to see a superhero movie. “The Eternals” of the title refers to a group of superpowered, ageless heroes sent from space to Earth more than 7,000 years ago by the cosmic-powered Celestials. Refreshingly, these heroes are not all white, heterosexual, able-bodied men. But in other respects they are quite traditional. Their mission is to destroy the Deviants: oozing, dinosaurlike monster things that have attacked and eaten humans throughout millennia. When you live for centuries, you have a lot of time to question your life choices. Many of the Eternals do in fact wonder why, given how much good they could do, they’re restricted to fighting one particular group of bad guys (or creatures). Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry) is a superinventor, who gets giddy at the idea of bronze-age humans can be taught to build steam engines. Druig (Barry Keoghan), who can control human minds, protests in frustration that he could end war and genocide if given the opportunity. These arguments continue into the present day, as one human wonders why the Eternals didn’t help Earth’s other superheroes fight Thanos in previous Marvel movies. If they could have prevented him from destroying half the people in the universe, shouldn’t they have done that? Ajak (Salma Hayek), the leader of the Eternals, has super healing powers and a string of glib answers to these concerns. Most seem cribbed from the “Prime Directive” guiding principles of ""Star Trek."" It’s important not to interfere in human development, she insists. Humans need to follow their own path. None of this is convincing — and the film, surprisingly, admits as much. It’s impossible to go into the exact plot machinations without a ton of spoilers, but suffice to say the Eternals’ goals are not what they seem at first. Much of their backstory is an elaborate ruse. Ajak’s rationale for their mission’s limits doesn’t make a lot of sense because it’s not the real rationale. The meta-critique here is quite intentional. One of the Eternals, Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani) spends much of the movie filming his friends and their battles. Segments of the film effectively turn into a mockumentary. “We need action sequences!” Kingo’s cameraman and valet exclaims during a de rigeur Deviant attack. The film tells you it’s deploying pointless superhero tropes as it deploys pointless superhero tropes. In this context, the film’s many weaknesses almost become a kind of elaborate parody. The underdeveloped characters are a commentary on the typically paper-thin characterization in superhero films. The underwhelming computer-generated image effects underline the unconvincing world-building. The narrative’s wild vacillations and deus ex machina resolutions show the genre’s helpless contrivance. Even the film’s repeated, tasteless use of various genocides to give the characters something to emote about can be seen as a kind of bleak joke about superhero shallowness. The film even half encourages you to root for the Deviants. Unfortunately, while the film flirts with self-awareness, it ends up dutifully fulfilling audience expectations. The moral arguments about ending wars or advancing technology or changing the world for the better are tabled in favor of remarkably noncompelling disputes about which monsters to fight. (The answer is all of them, if you were wondering.) And the post credits sequences tie the Eternals more closely to the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, promising that, despite their confusing past, they’ll be incorporated into standard superheroing going forward. This triumph of genre default can seem inevitable. But it really doesn’t have to be. To name just two fairly successful examples, “The Boys” on Amazon and Robert Kirkman’s “Invincible” comic series are both effectively skeptical of standard superhero expectations around violence and defending the status quo. “The Eternals” is a superhero movie in which the point is that the superheroes aren’t superheroes. It starts to explore that contradiction, and then backpedals furiously to familiar ground. No doubt many fans will be delighted. But at this point, the MCU formula has been recycled so often that sitting through these movies starts to feel eternal.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 7, 2021"," Overlong and dull, Eternals fails to do much with  its group of third string superheroes, save for how to create a comic book  movie void of charisma and excitement. The Marvel Universe is filled with all matter of  superhero, yet when it comes to film, not all heroes are created equal. Eternals is the latest case in point.  Created by legendary comic book creator Jack Kirby, this  group of super powered beings sure do look the part, yet in the Chloe Zhao  directed Eternals they have the personality of paint drying on a wall.  Even the presence of superstar actors Angelina Jolie and Salma Hayek canât  inject life into this 156-minute snore fest of routine stakes and plodding  storytelling.  Eternals follows a group of immortal alien beings â  among them Sersi (Gemma Chan), Ikaris (Richard Madden), Thena (Angelina Jolie)  and Ajak (Salma Hayek) â who are tasked by celestial overlord Arishem with  protecting mankind from their monstrous counterparts, the Deviants. After  centuries of living amongst humans, the Eternals band together once  again to take on a new menace that threatens (shock! horror!) to end the world.  Director Chloe Zhao (Nomadland) has  delivered something of a best-of superhero clichÃ© movie, with the usual tropes  of free will and âgreat power and great responsibilityâ the films central  themes yet executed better in other films in its genre.  While costume design by Sammy Sheldon (The Imitation  Game) and cinematography by Ben Davis (Doctor Strange)  delivers an aesthetically pleasing film, there is little to no substance to its  story and even less entertainment quality in how it is executed. Try as Marvel must  to present a diverse group of superheroes with every gender/race/sexuality box  ticked, these characters are as vanilla as they come. Character development is  sparse, narrative stakes are lacklustre, jokes fall flat, and the action scenes  are almost criminal it its boredom. Worst of all is that Zhao, who has made a name for  herself as an award-winning indie director with Nomadland and The  Rider to her name, must take on a superhero movie to (seemingly, assumingly)  give her career âmainstreamâ credibility. Whether it be the material is  underneath her, or simply went over her head, the reality is Eternals is  a poor match of filmmaker and genre, with the only thing âsuperâ about it is  its ability to cure insomnia.

"Dec 7, 2021"," Well, they can’t all be winners. With the arrival of Chloé Zhao’s Eternals, somewhere Alan Taylor, director of Thor: The Dark World, is breathing a sigh of relief; he’s no longer responsible for the worst Marvel film. The Eternals are a group of 10 alien superbeings who have hidden on Earth for the past 7000 years, fighting the monstrous Deviants on behalf of the Celestial (read: God) Arishem. Having seemingly defeated the Deviants, which are big CGI beasties of various forms, some 500 years ago, the Eternals have scattered. Now, the death of one of their number brings them back together to fight a Deviant resurgence. However, there’s something about their past they don’t know, and soon they’ll be fighting a bigger threat than they ever imagined. Sounds pretty good, doesn’t it? Comics legend Jack Kirby’s cosmic nonsense filtered through a secret history/hidden magic lens that takes us from the depths of space to the splendour of ancient Babylon and more, with perhaps the most impressive cast Marvel has yet assembled filling out the roster of costume-clad demigods. Unfortunately, what we get is a slow, turgid, lifeless mess bereft of charm, personality, and momentum, yet obviously enamoured of its own sense of self-importance. Eternals is a slog; clocking in at almost two and a half hours it does nothing to earn that running time, consisting mostly of info-dumps (I lost track of how many times the same plot, themes, and backstory were related to us by different characters at different times) and flashbacks that are meant to invest the film with a sense of sweep and grandeur, but instead are completely inert onscreen. I don’t know how you manage to make the sack of Tenochtitlan boring, but Zhao managed it. Thematically, the source Eternals comics always struck me as religious metaphors, and here the characters are essentially Old Testament angels tasked with doing God’s dirty work (remember, it was an angel who slew all the first born of Egypt). But Zhao and her team suppress that theme, reducing it mere plotting rather than invoking anything resembling awe. Indeed, given the scale of the film, it’s remarkable how pedestrian it all feels—maybe we’re all just a bit tired of the Big Existential Threats that so many of these cape flicks seem duty-bound to invoke? Even on the interpersonal level, Eternals doesn’t work. These characters have almost no chemistry with each other. The millennia-long love affair between Sersi (Gemma Chan) and Ikaris (Richard Madden) fails to convince, and neither does Druig’s (Barry Keoghan) cynicism or Sprite’s (Lia McHugh) puckishness. The performance highlights are Korean star Ma Dong Seok as Gilgamesh and Angelina Jolie as Thena, the former caring for the latter as her mind fractures under the weight of thousands of years of memories; and Kumail Nanjiani as Kingo, an egotistical Eternal who has forged a career for himself as a Bollywood star in the last century. By the way, Nanjiani’s much-ballyhooed physical transformation for the role was in no way required—in costume, he simply looks like himself. I’m pretty convinced that the cast were given almost no direction, leaving them to soldier on as best they can while the big cosmic plot unfurls around them. Keoghan flails, Angie and Ma bring it, poor Brian Tyree Henry (playing the MCU’s first openly gay hero Phastos) vacillates between killjoy misery and unsuccessful comic relief, and Salma Hayek as Eternals leader Ajak simply reads her lines. Chan, ostensibly the main protagonist, is given nothing to work with and her arc fails to engage us, while Madden is literally compared to Superman in the movie but never does anything to earn that apart from fly and shoot lasers out of his eyes. Given Marvel’s top-down, studio-led approach to filmmaking they must take the weight of blame here, although it is incredible to me that Zhao can go from an Oscar win on Nomadland to this absolute mess. Perhaps she simply has no facility for the material or was hamstrung by the more constrained big budget working environment. In any case, her gifts are largely absent from the screen. While Marvel has made a habit of taking emerging indie filmmakers and plugging them into their content machine, Zhao is the most high-profile and acclaimed director so far recruited, and there’s a fair chance this whole train wreck is down to director and studio pulling in different directions. Whatever the case, Eternals is not worth your time. You may be tempted to check it out for yourself on the off chance I’m overstating the case, but I swear to you I am not. This is the nadir of the MCU thus far, and given the tag “The Eternals Will Return” that flashes up onscreen as the credits roll, does not bode well for the future.",NEGATIVE
"Nov 30, 2021"," The time has come, Marvel’s Eternals has hit screens across the world and, while it’s a perfectly good, well made film, it fails to reach the true greatness many of us desperately wanted. I won’t lie to you all; Eternals was one my most anticipated of the year and given the score I’ve just given, it’s only natural to say it somewhat disappointed me, leaving too many questions hanging to fully immerse me. Now, the looming questions I can forgive, there’s always the possibility of a sequel (given the ending I bloody well hope so!), but what really got under my skin was how tiresome the humour was. Sure, the occasional one liner made me chuckle (that IKEA joke is gold! Don’t hate me), but the vast majority of them failed to garner almost a whimper, feeling forced into the script as a last-ditch effort to make this beautiful film feel ‘funnier’.  However, despite the humour taking me out of the movie a tad, there were some genuinely breathtaking moments within. The story, while not being 100%, fits into this universe perfectly. Watching how the Eternals helped shape past civilisations gripped me, with the set design and cinematography standing out in particular, bringing with it a unique feeling to this franchise, one I hope they continue with in the future. In addition to the beauty of Eternals, the incredible cast, made up of: Gemma Chan (Sersi), Richard Madden (Ikaris), Kumail Nanjiani (Kingo), Lia McHugh (Sprite), Brian Tyree Henry (Phastos), Lauren Ridloff (Makkari), Barry Keogan (Druig), Ma Dong-seok (Gilgamesh), Salma Hayek (Ajak), Angelina Jolie (Thena) and Kit Harington (Dane Whitman), all play their characters to perfection, not only leaving me intrigued by their abilities but excited to see what direction they’re taken in the future. Nevertheless, Eternals is a whole lot to take in upon first viewing. With far too much going on and too many characters to fully develop, it’s easy to see where some audience members will get lost. Yet for me, while it’s not the masterpiece many fans wanted it to be, it did do enough for me to still have a good time and enjoy it. Chloe Zhao’s direction is unlike anything this franchise has experienced, she enhances every aspect of this mediocre screenplay and while it may not be the perfect start for her, I believe she’s the perfect choice for the sequel. Setting up these incredible characters was a hard task and while yes, there are too many characters to develop all at once, I still found myself interested, even caring, about them all as individuals. While it’s certainly got its fair share of problems, Eternals is a beautifully made, well-acted film with characters I can’t wait to see more of.  We hope you're enjoying BRWC.

"Nov 30, 2021"," “Ambitious” has been a key word to describe the work and operations of Marvel Studios from the very beginning. There was no guarantee that their plan to organize a multi-series, single-canon franchise was going to work – especially without the rights to key characters like Spider-Man, the X-Men, and the Fantastic Four. When it turned out not only to work, but become a global phenomenon, however, the creative push continued, and inspired gambles on obscure superheroes and up-and-coming filmmakers. Marvel's moves run counter to what is traditionally expected out of great success in Hollywood, where it so often results in the sole production of echoes and copies. Instead, the company has looked at its popularity as a license to try and experiment with new things, having faith that that the audience will follow. Chloe Zhao’s Eternals is what could be called the most obvious result of this philosophy that we have seen since James Gunn’s Guardians of the Galaxy in 2014. The titular group is held in high esteem by comic book fans as creations of the legendary Jack Kirby, but there is little awareness of them in the grander scheme of pop culture; and while Zhao may now be one of only two women to ever win Best Director at the Academy Awards, she was hired to make the blockbuster nearly half-a-year before Nomadland entered pre-production. Those elements combined don’t look great on paper, but Marvel respected her vision, and committed to it. More than three years after Chloe Zhao’s hiring, “ambitious” remains an appropriate adjective to apply to Eternals, albeit with a caveat. The film has impressive scope, compelling characters, and some fascinating driving philosophies, but it’s an adventure that also attempts to bite off a bit more than it can chew. On top of a “getting the band back together” narrative with 10 main characters and world-ending stakes, it also dabbles in epic romance and non-linear storytelling – which is a hell of a lot for one movie to take on. It’s mostly successful in keeping all of the balls in the air, but the actual juggling itself is also too apparent as you watch, taking away from total engagement with everything it tries to do. Reaching further back in history than any Marvel Cinematic Universe film before it, Eternals introduces its eponymous group as cosmic beings who arrived on Earth 7,000 years ago to do the bidding of the god-like Celestials. Their job is to guide the development of human evolution without direct interference – helping the species make progress and slowly grow without overtly taking control or specifically influencing big choices. Simultaneously, they are also responsible for the culling of the Deviants, which are monstrous and exceptionally dangerous creatures whose viciousness threatens humanity in its nascency. Having successfully shepherded Homo sapiens through their infancy over thousands of years, the Eternals in the modern world are given freedom by their leader, Ajak (Salma Hayek), to essentially live traditional human lives until the Celestial Aramesh tells them otherwise. The group – including the matter-manipulating Sersi (Gemma Chan), the illusion-generating Sprite (Lia McHugh), the speedy Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), the mind-controlling Druig (Barry Keoghan), the flying Ikaris (Richard Madden), the inventive Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), the energy-firing Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), the formidable Gilgamesh (Don Lee), and the weapon-generating Thena (Angelina Jolie) – spread out across the globe. In the wake of Thanos killing half of all life in the universe and the Avengers bringing everyone back, Sersei and Sprite live together in London, the former dating a charming and sweet man named Dane Whitman (Kit Harington), but their existence changes within an instant. While it is believed that all of the Deviants are extinct and have been for centuries, a surprisingly powerful one attacks the two heroes during a night out, and effectively changes their world view. Understanding the danger that the monsters represent, a journey is undertaken to bring all of the Eternals back together – and over the course of the adventure deeper and darker secrets are uncovered that could threaten life around the planet. With Sersei, Sprite, and Ikaris uniting in the first act, and Thena and Gilgamesh still being together in the 2020s, the heroes have to travel to six different locations around Earth to assemble their whole group, and while that would be plenty of narrative meat for any other movie to sink its teeth into, Eternals goes for more. In addition to its present day story, the film frequently flashes back in time to flesh out the long history of the central characters and their mission on Earth – not to mention also works to maintain a thread chronicling the conflict-laden romance between Sersei and Ikaris. It’s a lot for any blockbuster to take on, even with a 150-plus minute runtime. At its best, all of these operations serve to add greater depth to the characters and not shortchange their backstories and personalities; at its worst it can be throttling to the point where you’re not wholly sure where you are in the story. It’s never boring, as it regularly spices things up with the Marvel staples of humor and action, but it does feel convoluted, and that convolution does hamper its ability to properly drive home its larger themes. This is particularly unfortunate because the material that the film broaches is legitimately impressive to see coming from a mainstream blockbuster. There is a tremendous amount of religious commentary that comes out of the story, primarily extending from the relationship between the Eternals and Aramesh, who, for all practical purposes in the context, is god. While humans grapple with existential questions about existence, the heroes are fully aware of their purpose, and that by itself is a exciting perspective to see examined. It’s the strongest aspect of the film, and the ideas within it are manipulated in interesting ways, but it is ultimately obfuscated by plot. Where Eternals best succeeds is in the arenas where you wholly expect to succeed. The size of the ensemble proves to be unwieldy narratively speaking, but it’s also a great collection of personalities, and each of the characters is cast genuinely well. Kumail Nanjiani is given prime position as a scene-stealer, with the movie taking full advantage of the actor’s wonderful comedic gifts without undercutting the emotional conflict Kingo experiences, but Gemma Chan is also charismatic and dynamic in what’s essentially the prime protagonist position, and each of the other members of the team adds interesting colors to the drama. Eternals also has the distinction of being visually gorgeous and unlike anything we’ve seen before in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. There is an important and distinct appreciation for natural beauty, and the production’s extensive use of on-location shooting allows for gorgeous cinematography that stunningly captures the grandeur of our world in a way that is both thrilling and on-theme. And even when there is a great deal of visual effects in play, be it in various fight sequences or the epic face-to-face meetings with Aramesh, Chloe Zhao is still able to ground it in a way that adds terrific weight. In terms of overall quality, Eternals is a mixed bag, but it’s also a film that is easy to appreciate for what it is. While still maintaining some familiar DNA, it takes some bold swings at new ideas, and even when it doesn’t fully connect you can appreciate the effort and are still left with something to chew on. It’s not among the best releases we’ve seen come out of Marvel Studios, but still manages to be interesting and exciting blockbuster filmmaking.

"Nov 25, 2021",Zhao is quite literally providing us the best of both worlds as a result. Eternals simultaneously feels like an MCU film and a prestige picture with everything that entails.,POSITIVE
"Nov 24, 2021"," That's no small feat for a film about a race of immortal beings that have been sent to earth to protect it from primordial monsters called the Deviants in the name of the gods (or Celestials, as they're called here). These beings eventually became the stuff of legends, their stories becoming myths and religions of the ancients, passed down for generations, until the present time when the Eternals live in secret amongst us, concealing their powers until the Deviants re-emerge. And re-emerge they do, bringing the team back together to save the Earth once again. This time is different, however; not only are the Deviants stronger than ever before, their presence finally brings the true purpose of the Eternals' mission on earth to light, and to be successful in their purpose the world must end. This allows Eternals to explore the morality of the heroes' mission, and it isn't black and white. What happens if the mission that the so-called good guys have been sent on actually makes them the bad guys? Have their actions to protect humanity actually hurt them? It's intriguing moral gray area for an MCU film to explore, and Zhao grounds it with naturalistic lighting and disarmingly quiet character moments. This is the first MCU film that truly takes its time setting up its action sequences rather than barreling from one set piece to the next. Sure, it's exposition-heavy, and introduces a ton of new characters, but Zhao actually takes the time to set them up and make the audience care about them. That the film allows their relationships to grow, even across millennia, is something altogether remarkable. And while its inevitable sequel setup and typical post-credits silliness blunt the overall impact somewhat, Eternals is, for the most part, a thoughtful and earthy epic that dares to ask big questions and acknowledge its characters' weaknesses. If this is the future of the MCU, I'm far more encouraged by this than anything its given us previously. More of this, please.",POSITIVE
"Nov 23, 2021"," There is quite a bit going on with THE ETERNALS, a bold attempt to marry CGI action on a grand scale with metaphysical musings about free will, while also contemplating the fundamental principles of physics vis a vis the conservation of energy in the universe. Like I said, a lot. Had it worked, it would have been spectacular. As it is, we are left with a philosophically dense film that stagnates under its own considerable weight as it dances through 7000 years of world cultures while never quite finding its groove. We are in the same Marvel universe as The Avengers, but they get on a passing reference as we set about getting to know the many characters involved here. The Eternals, as the opening crawl explains, are human-looking immortal beings sent to Earth by the Celestial Arishem those many millennia ago to save our planet from the Divergents. Those are mutanty things that feed on intelligent life. Why they don’t also save us from ourselves is explained away by the strict instructions they were given by Arishem to war only on the Divergents. Any mischief on a small or great scale, think genocide, is something for the humans to sort out for themselves in order to fulfill their true potential. Sure, they can get a technological nudge from Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), the gift of agriculture from Sersi (Gemma Chan), or a warrior assist s in the form of Thena (Angelina Jolie), but Conquistadors taking out the Aztecs, that’s strictly a hands-off situation. The leader of this heroic band is Ajac (Salma Hayak), the only Eternal capable of talking directly to Arishem about their mission. Even she, however, does not know why, now that all the Divergents have been destroyed, they have not been recalled to their home base of Olympia. With nothing to do for a half-dozen centuries, they go their separate ways, with Sersi landing in London as an instructor at the Natural History Museum and conducting a relationship with a human (Kit Harrington) after her true love, Ikarus (Richard Madden) left without a word and the centuries that passed convinced her to make a fresh start. That and how very adorable the human is. Think of him for the poster child of why all the Eternals have become so very fond of their human charges, despite the shortcomings of human nature. Alas, adding to the complications of a relationship between an immortal being with superpowers and a human with an expiration date is the sudden appearance of one of those Divergents shortly after a world-wide earthquake episode. In short order, Sersi is tracking down her comrades and working out how to save the world from the new, improved Divergents. Oh yeah, there’s more than one. If only it were actually a short order. The story, obviously enjoying the nuances of its subtext and the whiz-bang nature of its special effects, takes forever to rev up properly as a narrative. After a very promising start bringing Sersi and Ikarus back together for an emotionally fraught reunion while fighting off that first Divergent, introducing the other character backstories and present occupations becomes a slog with flashbacks, side bars, and several repetitions of the conundrum in which our protagonists find themselves. Without giving away too many plot points, this involves sacrificing current life in the interests of possible future lives. Don’t get me wrong, I do love a philosophically dense exercise, and sci-fi provides a scintillating framework for that, but it behooves the filmmakers to trust their audience to get if the first time, maybe even the second if characters are divided in their opinions, as they well might be resulting in an incisive dialectic. After that, it’s a time waster for those engaged by it, not to mention boring for those in the audience who are not going to be engaged by that aspect of the story no matter how many times it is referenced. They are there to see Angelina Jolie slice up a monster and that’s okay, too. In which case, just get on with it for everybody’s sake. It’s not that the other Eternals aren’t interesting. Druig (Barry Keoghan), the cool bad boy one who can control minds has a nice subplot about his own God complex, while at the other end of the spectrum we have Phastos, a blissed out tech geek is easily the most loveable of the crew. Between those poles there is Sprite (Lia McHugh) the snarky Eternal doomed to an eternal pre-adolescence, Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani) who has found a way to turn his perpetual youth and essential narcissism into a film dynasty in Bollywood, while Gilgamesh (Ma Dong-seok) exists only to care for Thena when the burden of a millennia of memories becomes too much for her. This involves baking pies and the brewing of questionable beverages. There is also Makkari (Lauren Ridloff) the deaf-mute with super speed and wicked sense of humor that spares no one. As I mentioned before, there is a lot going on here. The expected Marvel humor is here, though barely treading water in the murky and turgid cinematic waters in which it struggles. The expected spectacular effects are here, too, from lava spewing islands disgorging themselves with wild abandon into he ocean, to a glittering light show that Sprite puts on for the ancient Mesopotamians. THE ETERNALS promises a sequel to it tumultuous events, with the now requisite TWO post-credit sequences offering hints of what’s to come. It is with genuinely mixed feelings that I report that. Will the next installment be a leaner, meaner, and much more enjoyable flick? Dare I hope for one that actually allows us to emotionally engage at critical moments instead of yawning? Let’s all hope so.",NEUTRAL
"Nov 20, 2021"," The Eternals — from left: Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), Gilgamesh (Don Lee), Thena (Angelina Jolie), Ikaris (Richard Madden), Ajak (Salma Hayek), Sersi (Gemma Chan), Sprite (Lia McHugh), Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry) and Druig (Barry Keoghan) — arrive in prehistoric Earth, in a scene from Marvel Studios’ “Eternals.” (Photo courtesy of Marvel Studios.) What used to be a thrill of the Marvel Cinematic Universe was how individual directors could, within the confines of the superhero sandbox, play around with genre conventions — which is how we got Joe Johnston making a war movie (“Captain America: The First Avenger”), the Russo brothers making a political thriller (“Captain America: The Winter Soldier”) and Taika Waititi making a comedic fantasy flick (“Thor: Ragnarok”). It’s not often, though, that a director’s vision is so at odds with the audience demands of a big-budget blockbuster as what happens with Chloé Zhao and Marvel’s “Eternals.” Zhao is a wizard at mood, creating beauty out of the prosaic details of van life in her Oscar-winning “Nomadland” or the rodeo circuit in “The Rider.” Nobody this side of Terrence Malick can evoke such a sense of wonder out of something as simple as a sunrise. Putting a passel of otherworldly super-beings in front of those sunrises — and staying true to both Zhao’s sensibilities and the requirements that those superheroes, you know, do something — is another matter altogether. The Eternals, created in the comics by Jack Kirby in the 1970s, are 10 beings who arrived on Earth at the beginning of history, tasked by their godlike creator, a Celestial named Arishem, with two missions: To nudge humanity gently toward progress, and to defeat an evil monster species, the  Deviants, that appear bent on destroying all human life. The Eternals do this with a variety of powers. Ikarus (Richard Madden) flies — and, more often, floats — and fires lasers from his eyes. Sersi (Gemma Chan) can alter inanimate matter, and has an empathic connection to humanity. Sprite (Lia McHugh) is a shape-shifter, but usually in the body of a teen girl. Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani) fires bolts of energy from his fingers. Druig (Barry Keoghan) can control humans’ minds. Phantos (Brian Tyree Henry) is an inventor, gradually introducing technological advances to the humans. Gilgamesh (Don Lee) is the strongest of the bunch, while Makkari (Lauren Ridloff) is the fastest (as well as being deaf). Thena (Angelina Jolie) is a fearsome warrior, while Ajak (Salma Hayek) is their leader, the link back to the Celestials. With 10 heroes, “Eternals” has space for representation — Black, Latina, south Asian, east Asian, deaf and, as we learn later, LGBTQ — which can only be a good thing as Marvel’s universe tries to emulate our own. The script (credited to Zhou, writing alone and with Patrick Burleigh, and Ryan and Kaz Firpo) sends these Eternals to various moments in Earth’s history, starting about 7,000 B.C., battling Deviants without changing human history too strongly. It’s later explained that they did not interfere in Thanos’ plan to eliminate half of all life in the universe because it wasn’t Deviant-related — but Ajak and others admired the humans’ resilience and ability to fight back. In the 21st century, though, the Deviants are believed to be dead, and the Eternals have scattered to build their own lives. That’s how we find Sersi in London, working at a museum (oddly, the same job Diana Prince has in “Wonder Woman 1984,” just in a different city) and having a seemingly normal romance with a human coworker, Dane Whitman (Kit Harington). But when a Deviant attacks in London, and Ikarus and Sprite show up to fight it, Sersi must return to her old mission. Cue the “getting the band back together” montage, which has its fun moments, like finding Kingo is now a Bollywood action star, and Phantos is happily married to a guy in Chicago and fixing their kid’s bike. Other revelations, like Druig’s fiefdom in the Amazon or Thena battling the superhero version of Alzheimer’s, are less cheery. Zhou and cinematographer Ben Davis (whose Marvel history includes “Guardians of the Galaxy,” “Doctor Strange” and “Captain Marvel”) create some beautiful images of superheroes posing superheroically on beaches and near erupting volcanoes. Zhou concentrates on character, particularly Chan’s Sersi finding her emotional voice through her compassion for humanity, in ways Marvel movies often don’t. It’s the thing Marvel movies are supposed to have — action — where “Eternals” doesn’t quite keep up. The action set pieces have a robotic sameness to them, serviceable but not dynamic, like a director’s afterthought rather than an organic part of the whole.  “Eternals” isn’t a terrible Marvel movie, just an average one. Considering the talent at work, and the potential of such a world-changing set of heroes, it could have been so much more.",POSITIVE
"Nov 20, 2021"," I went out to the mall last Friday to watch a self-made double feature of superhero movies at the AMC. First up was Eternals, the latest in the on-going saga of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Directed by the Oscar-certified Chloé Zhao, whose Nomadland and The Rider are notable for their location work, focus on small details of performance and process in everyday lives, and twilight-gray color palettes, she was maybe the worst possible choice to adapt the work of four-color genius/cosmic weirdo Jack Kirby, whose 1970s series of the same name was his third (at least) attempt at creating a new kind history myth of the universe, after the initial creation of the Marvel Universe and then his New Gods series at DC. The comic book Eternals is a massive epic, encompassing the whole history of humanity and the wider universe beyond, marked by Kirby’s densely packed and luridly colored panels and splash pages. Zhao’s Eternals, on the other hand, is very very beige. A group of super-powered beings are sent to the Earth 7,000 years ago to defend humanity from big CGI lizard dogs who show up sometimes and start eating everyone. They each have special powers and colored suits (all the colors of the rainbow: blue-grey, green-grey, red-grey, white-grey, etc). Most of the powers involve yellow lines of CGI (why is it always yellow?) that allow them to punch stuff really hard or set things on fire with their eyes or have a sword. One of the guys looks exactly like the evil Super-man from a Zack Snyder movie. He’s not the leader, but everyone acts like he is because he can fly and he’s a handsome white guy. The actual leader is Salma Hayek, who can heal people, but she’s dies early on and that’s what sets the plot in motion.  The new leader is Gemma Chan who plays Sersi. She’s dating Jon Snow, and her ex is the flying guy, Ikaris, played by Robb Stark. This is funny because those two actors were on the same show with a main character also named Cersei and they also look exactly alike: they can’t get away from Circes (like Odysseus I suppose) and also they’re totally interchangeable in every way. Sersi tracks down all the other Eternals, who have spread out across the globe for the last 500 years and don’t have phones or internet or any way to communicate other than showing up in person at each other’s house or place of business. They argue about whether or not they should do something (most MCU properties are about people with superpowers arguing about whether they should do anything at all), and Zhao intercuts flashbacks of what they’ve all been up to for all of recorded history (mostly stuff like brainwashing indigenous people in the Amazon rain forest or taking thousands of years to realize that sometimes humans do bad things with technology). One of them, Kingo, is a Bollywood star. We’re introduced to him filming a musical number that seems to be conceived as an homage to a much more vibrant cinema, but literally pales in comparison and might be in slow motion. More action happens, secrets are revealed, there’s a big showdown on a beach, Kingo wanders off and everyone forgets about him, Ikaris flies way too close to the sun. It’s baffling how low-energy Eternals is. It looks like a film made by people who work in an office. Zhao’s intimate approach is swallowed up by the demands of the epic story and Disney house style, and the result isn’t satisfying on either a personally expressive or corporate synergy level. It’s a marked contrast to the next movie I saw, Venom: Let There be Carnage, the second film about the alien symbiote that possesses Tom Hardy and tries to eat people and talks in a funny voice. The villain is played by Woody Harrelson in a disastrous red wig, a serial killer who accidentally becomes a host of a different, much meaner symbiote named Carnage. Woody and Carnage break his old girlfriend out of superpower jail (she breaks stuff by screaming) and go on a Natural Born Killers style rampage, and only Venom can stop them. Like the first Venom, Let There be Carnage is crude and tasteless and very funny, with more physical comedy than all 20+ MCU films put together. Deeply black and red, in both humor and visual scheme, it flies along in seemingly half the running time of Eternals. If in Zhao’s film, everyone looks like clockwatchers, in Carnage, everyone involved appears to be having a tremendous time. Great Actress Michelle Williams returns as Hardy’s estranged love interest for some wide-eyed shenanigans—she plays the straight-man girlfriend role, but with an energy that demonstrates that she wouldn’t mind chomping some heads off either. Naomie Harris dusts off her Pirates of the Caribbean performance and chews up the screen with aplomb, every bit a match for real-life lunatic Harrelson. Motion capture actor Andy Serkis takes over as director, and keeps things rolling delightfully free of backstory or moral lessons, moving from one frenetic action sequence to the next with only quick breathers for oddball asides like a sequence where Venom hangs out in a club, or one where Hardy explains Don Quixote to a pair of chickens named “Sonny” and “Cher”. An Eternals/Carnage double feature is a textbook example of the white elephant/termite distinction in comic book movies. Or at least as close as we are likely to get, considering that even Carnage is a product of huge corporations (Sony and Disney have split rights to the characters), and is now directly connected to the larger MCU thanks to its cliffhanger ending. It’s possible that we’re going to see more of this split in the future, with more diversity of filmmaking and storytelling approaches within the larger corporate umbrella. As the MCU enters its second generation of characters and actors, we can only hope that our content overlords allow us a taste of the wild breadth of the medium their movies and TV shows are based on.",NEGATIVE
"Nov 19, 2021"," Wonder no more, as Zhao — months after her 2020 film was awarded the Academy Award for best picture and she the Oscar for best director — sees the theatrical release of her new MCU movie, “Eternals.” Plus, it can be at least a little confusing in stretches. It’s chock full of super-powered beings, and if you are able to grasp exactly what each of them can do and how he or she is using that ability at all times, a tip of the cap to you. Having already given us big-screen versions of instantly recognizable heroes such as Captain America and Iron Man, the MCU is trafficking in some lesser-knowns in its Phase Four. Hence, we get the Eternals, an ageless group of heroes from beyond the stars sent to earth thousands of years to keep tabs on humans and protect them from one specific enemy: monsters known as Deviants. Upon learning that his girlfriend, Sersi (Gemma Chan) is, in fact, one of these beings — after an attack by a Deviant that brings her Eternal ex, Ikaris (Richard Maddon), to the rescue — the amiable Dane Whitman (Kit Hanington) asks a reasonable question: Hey, why didn’t you guys help out with the Thanos thing? Or how about all the other terrible events that have happened on the planet the last few millennia? Her answer is their assignment is strictly Deviant duty. That is something the script — credited to Zhao and a few other folks — does well: addressing those elephants in the room. Another example: After we’ve seen the handsome, dark-haired Ikaris soar through the air and shoot lasers from his eyes, a boy refers to him as Superman. The hero, in turn, points out that he is cape-less. The otherwise uninspired script isn’t so successful in smoothly giving us all the background we need to know to understand what is happening. There are a few mind-numbing information dumps — starting with on-screen text at the movie’s beginning — and you have to work a bit to absorb it all. However, as “Eternals” jumps from place to place and back and forth in time — from 5000 BC Mesopotamia to present-day South Dakota and myriad spots in between — you’ll get at least the broad strokes. Along with fending off the Deviants, the Eternals face a dramatic choice: either fulfill the mission given to them by giant otherworldly being Arishem (voiced by David Kaye) or try to save humanity from a pending universe-shaping event. Expect some disagreements in the ranks. Other members of the team include the leader, Ajak (Salma Hayek); engaging Bollywood star Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani); fight-thirsty warrior Thena (Angelina Jolie); mind controller Druig (Barry Keoghan of “The Killing of the Sacred Dear”); and Sprite (Lia McHugh, “The Lodge”), a powerful being who, despite being 7,000 years old, is frustratingly stuck in the body of 12-year-old girl. Given that the team members have known one another for so long, it’s understandable that there are romantic crushes and general dislikes among them. In fact, they’re not so unlike us — save for the agelessness and superpowers. In fact, you also have to appreciate the relatable qualities of two of the team members. Makkari, who possesses super speed, is the MCU’s first deaf character — and is portrayed by deaf actress Lauren Ridloff of “The Walking Dead” and outstanding 2000 film “Sound of Metal.” Meanwhile, kindhearted inventor Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry of “Atlanta” and “Widows”) is married to another man and is raising a son with him. It’s hard to say much more about the plot of “Eternals” without potentially giving away one of its twists. Still, those turns are not too tough to spot coming down the road. The two biggest names are Hayek (“Like a Boss,” “The Hitman’s Wife’s Bodyguard”) and Jolie (“Those Who Wish Me Dead,” “Maleficent”), but they are relegated to supporting duty. The true lead is Chan, who’s appeared in “Crazy Rich Asians” and portrayed a different character in MCU entry “Captain Marvel”. She’s engaging enough as Sersi, but the character isn’t anything all that interesting. (Speaking of Sersi, it’s pronounced the same as the name of “Game of Thrones” character Cersei, and it’s all together distracting to have two “GoT” alums — Harrington and Maddon — portraying characters who have feelings for her and repeatedly speak her name.) Also know that while Maddon (“Rocketman,” “The Bodyguard”) has a very key role, Harington (“Gunpowder”) is a background player. (Tip: Stay all the way through the credits for a hint at a potentially bigger MCU role for Mr. Whitman in the future.) The standout in the cast is the comedically gifted Nanjiani (“Silicon Valley,” “The Big Sick”). However, while he gets some laughs, his sequences are not all they could have been in Zhao’s hands. The director, who also helmed the independent films “The Rider” and “Songs My Brothers Taught Me,” also seems ill-equipped for the film’s obligatory action sequences. They tend to be both underwhelming and disorienting, thanks in part to the ever-moving camera by cinematographer Ben Davis (Marvel Studios’ “Captain Marvel,” “Doctor Strange”). Again, though, much of the film is striking, so Davis and others such as production designer Eve Stewart (“The Danish Girl,” “Les Misérables”) deserve credit for that. The first post-credits sequence teases further adventures for the Eternals, but we’ll see how strongly the movie-going public responds to this first go-round. It may not be a love for the ages.",NEUTRAL
"Nov 19, 2021"," CHICAGO - The initial experience of watching ""Eternals"" is overwhelming. Though writer/director Chloé Zhao’s thinky sci-fi action melodrama may not draw much plot from the 25 Marvel Cinematic Universe films that have come before, it introduces 10 main characters, covers 7,000 years of human history and runs a lengthy 157 minutes.  There’s at least a movie and a half’s worth of story here about the immortal super-powered aliens who have been gently guiding humanity’s evolution since they first arrived to beat some alien beasties back in 5000 BC Babylon. Coupled with a tone that’s more ponderous than quippy, ""Eternals"" makes for an alienating first watch. That could be why the movie has been met with such a divisive reaction. Dig a little deeper, however, and this behemoth of a superhero flick has its rewards too.  It’s not just that Zhao has purposefully diversified what superhero line-ups traditionally look like, it’s that she’s radically changed the tone in which these sorts of stories usually operate. In place of quips, conflict and macho posturing, ""Eternals"" is about collaboration, cooperation and empathy. It’s a superhero blockbuster that filters its questions of power and purpose through a feminine lens rather than a masculine one. The theme of feminine power starts with Ajak (Salma Hayek), the team leader with a warmly maternal energy. She’s not a fighter but a healer. And when disagreements arise, she’s willing to hear out her metaphorical children rather than just shut them down.  Sent by the godlike Celestial Arishem to kill monstrous creatures known as Deviants, the Eternals complete their mission circa 1521. From there, Ajak encourages the group to find their own paths in life —empowering them rather than trying to control them.  The film’s flashback structure reveals that the ageless aliens have spent the past 500 years engaging with humanity (or not) on their own terms. Some, like stoic Superman-esque Ikaris (Richard Madden), brooding mind-controller Druig (Barry Keoghan) and spunky speedster Makkari (Lauren Ridloff) have largely kept to themselves. Others have taken up jobs or started families, like Brian Tyree Henry’s Phastos, the first major gay character in the MCU. One has even become a famous Bollywood star (that’d be Kumail Nanjiani’s winning Kingo).  So when a crisis forces the long-separated crew back together, they each bring those unique lived-experiences to the film’s central question: Is humanity worth saving? And at what cost? Intriguingly, Zhao doesn’t suggest there’s only one right answer here. But she gives the question a fulcrum point in Sersi (Gemma Chan), the empathetic Eternal who’s always had a soft spot for humans.  Thrust into a leadership role that no one, including herself, seems to think she’s right for, Sersi brings a new point of view to the team’s god-given mission. Just because a way of doing things is old and traditional, is it inherently natural? Or is it violent and archaic? Though Chan isn’t the strongest actor of the bunch, she projects a bookish, overlooked middle sister quality that fits well with Zhao’s interrogation of what leadership looks like. There’s also a compelling parallel through-line for Angelina Jolie’s Thena, a legendary warrior who finds herself suffering from a memory loss condition that robs her of her sense of self. As with Sersi’s story, it’s another chance for Zhao to examine what it means for a woman to step into her power, even if it winds up feeling somewhat detached from everything else going on. In fact, ""Eternals"" is a movie with so much on its mind that it’s hard to know where to look sometimes. It doesn’t help that the Oscar-winning director of ""Nomadland"" has a fondness for tableau-style staging that can look gorgeous in the moment (particularly when filmed on the sort of natural landscapes rarely seen in the MCU), but also becomes a hinderance to fleshing out real human connection between her cast. There are other weaknesses too. The fight scenes often devolve into weightless CGI and the comedy is hit or miss. And it really can’t be overstated that there are just way, way too many characters in this thing. (Other Eternals include Don Lee’s brawler Gilgamesh and Lia McHugh’s childlike Sprite).  Once you wrap your mind around who these characters are and the basic shape of their mission, it becomes easier to appreciate the philosophical underpinnings of their story. Above all else, ""Eternals"" is a movie that values the idea of changing your mind and evolving with time. Perhaps that’s a quality that will serve the film’s legacy in the long run too. In theaters now. Rated PG-13. 156 minutes. Dir: Chloé Zhao. Featuring: Gemma Chan, Richard Madden, Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Kit Harrington, Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry, Bill Skarsgård. About the writer: Caroline Siede is a film and TV critic in Chicago, where the cold never bothers her anyway.

She also co-hosts the movie podcast, Role Calling, and shares her pop culture opinions on Twitter (@carolinesiede). Deep Blue Sea (1999): ""Deep Blue Sea"" is a classic ""oh my god that is a giant shark"" movie — though it must be said that it’s not exactly high art. Still, this is one that’s definitely better on rewatch, especially if you’re seated next to someone who’s never seen it before. Just make sure to position yourself to watch that person’s reaction when the big Samuel L. Jackson monologue begins. Rated R. 104 minutes. Dir: Renny Harlin. Also features Saffron Burrows, LL Cool J, Thomas Jane and Stellan Skarsgård.  The Freak Brothers (2021): Okay, so it’s actually impossible to rewatch this series in its entirety, as only the first two episodes have premiered. But this animated stoner/time-travel comedy, an adaptation of the cult classic underground comic series, is the kind of show in which you are guaranteed to miss some of the jokes the first time around, because the punchlines come fast and furious. ""The Freak Brothers"" is a Tubi Original. Rated TV-MA. One season (first two episodes currently available). Featuring: Woody Harrelson, John Goodman, Tiffany Haddish, Pete Davidson, La La Anthony and Adam Devine. Donnie Darko (2001): It’ll take at least two viewings to understand everything that happens in this trippy cult classic starring Jake Gyllenhaal as a troubled suburban teen haunted by a giant bunny. That makes it perfect for falling down the rabbit hole again and again. Rated R. 113 minutes. Dir: Richard Kelly. Also features Jena Malone, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Patrick Swayze and Mary McDonnell. Jupiter Ascending (2015): Like a lot of the Wachowskis’ post-""Matrix"" output, ""Jupiter Ascending"" is the sort of gonzo swing that definitely isn’t for everyone. But once you embrace the unexpectedly earnest tone of this sci-fi fairy tale romance, it has plenty of rollicking action fun to offer on a second viewing. Rated PG-13. 127 minutes. Dir: The Wachowskis. Featuring: Mila Kunis, Channing Tatum, Sean Bean and Eddie Redmayne.

"Nov 19, 2021"," Seven thousand years ago, the Celestial named Arishem sent the Prime Eternal, Ajak (Salma Hayek), to lead a team against the scourge of the invading Deviants, ensuring humanity’s survival to become the dominate species on the planet Earth. As heroes of myth and cast as demigods of legend, the appearance of these advanced beings and their deeds capture the imagination of humanity, passing down stories to future generations and embellishing them with each retelling. After thousands of years believing the Deviants defeated and with their team secretly spread among the populace of Earth — waiting to be recalled to their home planet Olympia — Sersi (Gemma Chan) discovers a secret that will change her teammates forever and seal the fate of Earth… if it’s not already too late. By the time viewers catch up to the main characters in the present, these immortal beings are tired, believing their mission accomplished ages ago and enduring millennia with varying degrees of success. It’s angsty and lovelorn but adds few revelations to the who-wants-to-live-forever trope explained in flashbacks, further complicated after discovering their task wasn’t as complete as originally assumed. What Eternals manages to do well is tie dangling story elements from previous MCU films together, universe-explaining rather than world-building, including multiple back story montages. It’s everything fans expect from Marvel Studios while still feeling a bit hollow — more Black Widow than Shang-Chi — but it’s no secret the info dump is going to be important to future films.  There’s more story here than could ever realistically fit, and trying to hit the bullet points makes it impossible to shore up a three-act structure; it’s just too much to work in. Making this a pair of films or even a Disney+ series like “Loki” or  “WandaVision” might have served the story better without beating viewers over the head. For all the wonder and splendor, more than a few things fall through the cracks, like when characters recall how many thousands of years between major events take place, or why Lauren Ridloff’s Makkari uses ASL (American Sign Language) in ancient times pointing to her wrist for time… when wristwatches won’t exist for another five millennia. Forget about the myriad accents of the ensemble, because the film glosses over it, too. Coming off big wins from last year’s Nomadland, Chloé Zhao’s unique direction makes Eternals better than it might have been from a less-visionary director. The same kind of inherent innocence and steely resolve to endure is present in both films, whether it’s from a woman who chooses to wander or an ensemble of powered beings on-mission waiting to be called home. Gemma Chan’s Sersi is the heart of the story, focusing upon her relationship with each of her fellow Eternals through disagreements and betrayals in spite of only having one another to relate to. It’s also nice to see Angelina Jolie playing matron warrior Thena as a scene-stealing secondary character instead of in a story rewritten to make her role more important aka Those Who Wish Me Dead. Most of what makes it to the final cut is fuel for the imagination, from obvious references to Greek gods and Arthurian legend to sea monsters and dragons, but the finished product can’t help but feel like viewers missed out on a lot of awesome to fast-forward to the end of their story. Diehard fans will find much to digest herein, but mass audiences may cringe at the downtime between big set pieces and action sequences. Be prepared for a mid and after-credit hints at what’s to come, but think twice about that jumbo drink when hitting the theater. Eternals is rated PG-13 for fantasy violence and action, some language, brief sexuality, starting the flick with an opening crawl, and Jon Snow still knowing nothing.",POSITIVE

"Nov 17, 2021"," Some things aren’t meant to be just fun. For a lot of people, even in 2021, genre fiction is something that has to earn respect. If a science fiction or fantasy movie isn’t super-serious in a way that reaches right down into the bones of the viewing experience, the fear is that audiences will laugh and walk out, and the fans left behind will then feel ashamed and walk out too. This worry is deeply ingrained in Hollywood, even after decades of genre success. You see it in trailers for space epics that are all just thunderous music and grey images; you see it in prestige SF series that are just endless scenes of sombre people speaking leaden dialogue in fancy sets. You see it in fantasies where monsters and magic are the backdrop to conniving and lechery. And now you can see it on the big screen in Eternals. Eternals is based on a comic by Jack Kirby, who came up with many of the greatest comics of all time. Thor? Him. Fantastic Four? Him. Captain America? Him (with Joe Simon). Darkseid, the bad guy Zak Snyder edited back into his cut of Justice League? Him. And the Eternals isn’t just any comic, but one of Kirby’s late period stabs where he was trying anything for a hit. Here ‘anything’ means, ‘what if Chariot of the Gods but the Gods created superheroes’. Sent to Earth by Arishem (a space god known as a Celestial) to battle creatures known as Deviants – and only battle Deviants, which explains why they didn’t turn up during any of the previous 25-odd Marvel movies – the Eternals are immortal ageless figures who have spent the last seven thousand years inspiring humanity’s myths and legends. And also fighting monsters. They include Sersi (Gemma Chan), who can manipulate inanimate materials; Ikaris (Richard Madden), who can fly and shoot lasers out of his eyes; fireball shooting Bollywood star Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani); the illusion-projecting Sprite (Lia McHugh) who will forever remain a child; the mind-controlling Druig (Barry Keoghan); Gilgamesh (Don Lee), who has power fists and is hanging out in the Outback; Makkari (Lauren Lidloff), who runs fast and is deaf; Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), the tech guy who gets to have the first on-screen gay kiss in a Marvel movie; Thena (Angelia Jolie), a warrior with Space Alzheimer’s; and Ajax (Selma Hayek), their leader – until her death kickstarts the story. the present-day scenes are almost all set in isolated areas, giving much of the film a thin, depopulated feel that’s great for moments where isolated characters stand out against picturesque backdrops, but not so good for making the film feel like anything but a video game with a limited cast of playable characters. In large part this is a ‘getting the band back together’ story, as Sersi, Sprite and Ikaris travel the globe warning everyone of a looming threat, interspersed with flashbacks to their glory days hanging around previous civilisations. The flashbacks are full of people and life: the present-day scenes are almost all set in isolated areas, giving much of the film a thin, depopulated feel that’s great for moments where isolated characters stand out against picturesque backdrops, but not so good for making the film feel like anything but a video game with a limited cast of playable characters. Director Chloé Zhao (Nomandland) brings enough of her sombre visual style to things to make this at least somewhat different from the usual Marvel fare. Unfortunately, her sombre visual style isn’t the best fit for what feels like it should be a crazy rollicking adventure packed with strange concepts, but is instead something of a slog spent with a found family who never really seem to click. Many of the Eternals have paired off over the years, either with each other or humans – Phastos’ partner is human and they have a child together – but romance and passion is not a lasting takeaway from this film. A lot of the problems here are basic ones. The script juggles a large cast reasonably well, but a big team story probably isn’t the place to try and give everyone at least two defining characteristics. Ironically, it’s the more straightforward characters who end up the most memorable, which is a problem as the story isn’t about them. And if you really want to build a sense of threat, basically sidelining the initial menace and having a final battle where one character says, ‘yeah, I’m going to sit this one out’ with zero consequences, might not be the way to go. What this is trying to offer that can’t be found anywhere else is scale. It’s a big cast, with a lengthy run time (it might have worked better as a miniseries). The timeframe is huge, the threat is (literally) massive, the theme is basically, ‘if you knew God’s plan with absolute certainty, what would you do if you disagreed?’. But without a strong human-level side to balance it all out, big concepts are just lifeless words and images. It’s the little things that let Eternals down.

"Nov 16, 2021"," Eternals (Estados Unidos-Reino Unido/2021). Dirección: Chloé Zhao. Guion: Chloé Zhao, Patrick Burleigh, Ryan Firpo y Kaz Firpo, sobre una historieta creada por Jack Kirby. Fotografía: Ben Davis. Música: Ramin Djawadi. Edición: Dylan Tichenor y Craig Wood. Elenco: Gemma Chan, Richard Madden, Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Kumail Nanjiani, Kit Harington, Brian Tyree Henry, Lia McHugh, Lauren Ridloff, Barry Keoghan. Duración: 157 minutos. Distribuidora: Buena Vista. Calificación: apta para mayores de 13 años. Nuestra opinión: regular. Eternals es la peor película de Marvel. Aquí están las dos horas y media más solemnes, pretenciosas y aburridas de toda la historia cinematográfica del estudio, que además anticipan algo todavía más inquietante. La llegada al cine de una de las historietas más veneradas de Jack Kirby fue pensada para motorizar y envolver la siguiente etapa de un universo audiovisual que quiere capturar espacios cada vez más grandes y de mayor complejidad. Los Eternals expresan ese sueño de manera inequívoca. El relato atraviesa toda la historia de la humanidad, marcada por la pertinaz e inacabable intervención de estos seres inmortales que a instancias de los Celestiales (suerte de demiurgos del equilibrio cósmico) aparecen en cualquier momento y lugar para evitar el ataque de los Deviants, monstruos que parecen salidos de algún álbum mitológico japonés. Estamos entonces frente al escenario más imponente jamás imaginado por Marvel hasta ahora. La historia de la humanidad como tiempo y la totalidad del universo como escenario para que los Eternals cumplan con su misión y, cuando esta termina, dejen a la vista que la vida de todos los días se complica inclusive para quienes son inmortales. Algunos tienen problemas de personalidad por no saber manejar sus propios poderes (no hay terapia que los ayude), otros mantienen vínculos románticos bastante complicados y hasta los intereses pueden terminar chocando con las expectativas de los mismísimos Celestiales. No es nada que sorprenda para quienes siguen la evolución del mundo Marvel, caracterizado por personajes con superpoderes que viven esa condición con distinto grado de neurosis. La frase más feliz e ilustrativa de ese estado de cosas (“un gran poder entraña una gran responsabilidad”) es el común denominador que mueve a este universo y determina los comportamientos y las relaciones entre sus miembros. Esa consigna de hierro debe necesariamente reconfigurarse cuando las figuras que lo expresan tienen el atributo de la inmortalidad. En su momento y con distintos resultados la mayoría de los personajes de las fases previas de Marvel (empezando por Iron Man y el Capitán América) lograron entender, manejar o darle un sentido a su presencia en el mundo. En el caso de los Eternals, la conciencia de cargar para siempre con esas tensiones se convierte en un tema de primer orden. Pero en vez de sacarle todo el jugo posible a ese dilema, la tediosa Eternals se limita a plantearlo en voz alta, una y otra vez, como si hiciera falta explicar varias veces el nudo de un conflicto que en la mayoría de las películas previas se entendía por lo general a través de las motivaciones de personajes que estaban todo el tiempo en movimiento, decididos a actuar para resolver las tensiones. Aquí ocurre todo lo contrario. Cuando no entran en acción para someter a los Deviants, los Eternals sufren las tragedias irresueltas de sus respectivos destinos de manera extraordinariamente pasiva. Son contemplativos en el sufrimiento, recitan con solemnidad sus dramas y parecen sufrir eternamente con el lugar que les tocó en el universo. Solo Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), el Eternal de fisonomía india que adopta el aspecto humano de una estrella del cine de Bollywood parece escapar de esa autoinfligida trascendencia. El escape risueño que propone este personaje es uno de los pocos elementos que conecta a esta película con las etapas previas de Marvel. La otra es el cúmulo de escenas de acción, que como sabemos está a cargo de un equipo propio, ajeno al responsable de la dirección del film. Y aquí aparece el error más grande de Marvel: confiarle este grandilocuente proyecto, el más abarcador de su historia, a Chloé Zhao, una directora cuyo universo no va más allá de la observación humana de los viajes de cabotaje por las rutas estadounidense. Usar ese GPS tan limitado para llevarnos de viaje a través de toda la historia humana es una misión imposible. Creer además que Zhao, una directora de origen chino establecida en el cine independiente norteamericano es la más adecuada para contar una historia protagonizada por el grupo de superhéroes más diverso en términos étnicos, sexuales y aspiracionales es otro equívoco mayúsculo. No va más allá del alcance que tendría alguna bienintencionada declaración del estudio en apoyo a los nuevos lineamientos de corrección política avalados por la industria. Después de este paso en falso se abre el riesgo cierto de que Marvel, como ocurre aquí con varios personajes, camine hacia el futuro en medio de una nebulosa donde perderse es muy fácil. © Copyright 2024 SA LA NACION | Todos los derechos reservados.

Firpo, Ryan Firpo Fotografía: Ben Davis Sinopsis: Da la bienvenida a un nuevo y emocionante equipo de superhéroes al Universo Cinematográfico de Marvel. La historia, que abarca miles de años, presenta a un grupo de héroes inmortales forzados a salir de las sombras para reunirse contra el enemigo más antiguo de la humanidad, Los Desviantes. “¡Necesitamos escenas de acción!”, exclama Karun, suerte de Happy (el escudero del hombre de acero Tony Stark) de Kingo, deidad inmortal reciclada en estrella de Bollywood, en un profético y metarreferencial momento de Eternals. Quizás muchos seguidores del universo Marvel cinematográfico se sientan identificados con este comentario dentro de una arriesgada apuesta dentro del mismo: sentar las base de una nueva mitología cósmica utilizando los mimbres de la seminal Los Vengadores de Josh Whedon pero con mayor atención al making of (justo lo que Kingo y Karun han decidido que sea la misión de evitar el Apocalipsis) de ese disfuncional grupo que a la gesta llena de acción por sí misma. Secuencias de acción hay muchas y espectaculares en Eternals, pero su única utilidad es que estos dioses inmortales descubran su razón de ser y, claro, lo que les ata a ese ser humano del que han ejercido de vigilantes ángeles guardianes a lo largo de los siglos. En este sentido, que tal vez irrite a quienes le dan al fast forward cuando los superhéroes se ponen a hablar o a filosofar, Eternals sí que no traiciona a la insólita directora de esta superproducción de más de 200 millones de dólares de presupuesto, Chloé Zhao: vuelve a ser una historia de desarraigados sin un lugar en el mundo (aquí en plural: en los mundos) cuyos sentimientos actúan como una especie de ataduras invisibles. Que sí, que a la oscarizada firmante de Nomadland le gusta más una puesta de sol y un plano de granjas y figuras humanas recortadas contra el horizonte que a un tonto un lápiz, pero en Eternals este cliché que se revelaba postizo tanto en el film con Frances McDormand como en el anterior y peor The Rider se convierte en una metáfora no solo del ocaso de los dioses, sino del fin de toda una época Marvel. Eternals es igual de ambiciosa y dispersa argumentalmente que la serie comiquera original concebida, escrita y dibujada por el rey Jack Kirby entre 1976 y 1978. Hasta la inexpresividad de cariátide innata a Angelina Jolie y Richard Madden captura a la perfección los geométricos y extraños rasgos de los personajes de Kirby. Homenaje de lagrimita al genio de los comics, la película de Chloé Zhao es extremadamente fiel a la saga formada por los primeros 19 números de la colección, incluso en un cambio tan radical que en vez de molestar a los puristas abre la puerta a la tragedia casi wagneriana o Blade Runner de estos Eternos en el universo Marvel. Además de guiños a la adaptación que Jack Kirby había hecho para Marvel de 2001: Una Odisea del Espacio (ese monolito triangular, la intervención extraterrestre en la evolución humana…), lo que sorprende en Eternals es que no tenga ningún problema en citar al Kirby de la editorial rival DC (Darkseid), a Batman (y Alfred… que no deja de ser Happy o Karun) y a Superman. Y aunque no lleven capa, el instante de Ikaris flotando en el espacio mirando de manera extraña al planeta Tierra lo habría firmado con los ojos cerrados Zack Snyder. Eternals bien podría ser una película de la DC (Watchmen la que más) donde unos seres inmortales hablan de los superhéroes de la Marvel como si solamente fueran personajes de tebeos en cuatricomía. Es una película seguramente fallida, solidificada a partir de un fuego extraño en una isla desierta, y que sin embargo va a ser esencial (las dos escenas tras los créditos) en lo que está a punto de llegar.

"Nov 15, 2021"," One of the many criticisms of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is the feeling of sameness shared throughout two dozen films that have so far been released. There are cosmetic differences, obviously, but “the hero’s journey” usually hits familiar beats and almost always ends with CG shenanigans in the sky. The end results can still entertain and thrill, but the template is clear for both better and worse. The 25th entry in the MCU, Chloe Zhao‘s Eternals, has already been both praised and criticized for shaking things up with its brand new characters and old gods, but here’s the thing — it’s still every bit an MCU film through and through. Celestials are humongous, Iron Giant-looking beings responsible for shaping the universe, and for Arishem (voiced by David Kaye) that means creating the Eternals — a band of humanoid mini gods whose sole purpose is to fight and destroy reptilian creatures known as Deviants. After being sent to Earth around 5000 B.C. for just that purpose, the Eternals are left on the planet even after their mission is accomplished. Centuries pass — centuries of human trauma and tragedy in which they refused to intervene — until they’re drawn back together after a global earthquake and the return of the Deviants. The newly advanced monsters are far from their biggest concern, though, as the fate of humanity comes with universe-shaking revelations about the Eternals themselves. There’s a lot going on here as evidenced by the epic time span covered within, but for all the big reveals, human milestones mentioned and tossed aside, and implied ramifications, Eternals more often than not still comes down to familiar moral conundrums and a lot of the punch-blast-punch action that makes up the MCU. A threat, some arguments, and boom, we’re shootin’ lasers and fighting in the sky. To be clear, some of it entertains, but the film’s strengths rest instead on the mixed bag of characters and the actors bringing them to life. While the Marvel brand is character continuity, the Eternals gang are all new. Ajak (Salma Hayek) leads before retiring to the American Midwest, Sersi (Gemma Chan) scrolls Instagram in London with Sprite (Lia McHugh), and Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani) has become a Bollywood superstar. Gilgamesh (Don Lee) and Thena (Angelina Jolie) hang out in rural Australia, Druig (Barry Keoghan) lives in a South American commune, and Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry) has settled down with a husband and a child. The daily lives of Ikaris (Richard Madden) and Makkari (Lauren Ridloff) are less clear, but also irrelevant, as they’re all back together soon enough. Their various superpowers feel like they’ve been ripped from an introductory text on creating superheroes — laser eyes, mind control, super fast, super strong, etc — but once the fighting begins it all comes down to the same CG-driven antics anyway. Zhao, along with co-writers Patrick Burleigh, Ryan Firpo, and Kaz Firpo, ensures a big question is answered early on — where were these godly bastards when Thanos wiped out half the population? — but the answer flies in the face of the film’s own “grand” themes. The concept of blind obedience is so strong that they let carnage and chaos reign simply because stopping it was never part of their mission. Fine. Weak, but fine. But if that’s the case, why do their battles with Deviants always see them not just fighting the monsters but actively rescuing and saving humans? The script wants us to believe that some of the Eternals care deeply about humanity, but things flip again as it’s only when their own “lives” and current home are threatened that they finally decide to break free of authoritarian rule. Mini gods, they’re just as indecisive and inconsistent as the rest of us! Eternals goes out of its way to tell us how special and unique humans are compared to other species — a real “fuck you” to the MCU’s non-human heroes and characters despite Rocket’s arc in Guardians of the Galaxy delivering far, far more emotion than Zhao’s film can manage for all of its characters combined — but for all of the natural beauty that Zhao and cinematographer Ben Davis catch (and the CG wizards create), we see very little of humanity itself. Sure, their name is on the title card, but the Eternals make up the overwhelming bulk of the film’s arguably indulgent two-and-a-half-hour running time with barely a speaking role for mere humans to be found. The two real exceptions are both love interests, naturally, but even there the film can’t resist elevating one of them into something more “special” and part of the MCU’s never-ending world-building. While telling us that humans rock, the film also takes some time to show us how humans suck. Genocidal slaughters and mentions of war share the screen with one terribly ill-conceived beat that drops Phastos right in the middle of a still smoking, bombed out Hiroshima — so he can make it all about himself somehow. It’s unintentional but fitting as the film ultimately sees these characters as human despite their own truths. Sprite, an inhuman projector of sensory illusions, struggles as an Eternal trapped in a body that doesn’t match who she truly is. Sersi is torn between the love of two bland white guys, one of whom, despite living for centuries, still prefers missionary position. It’s instead a middle of the road entry in the never-ending cash cow that is a corporate conglomerate’s MCU, as far from the best (Captain America: The Winter Soldier) as it is from the worst (Iron Man 2). Some of the action is fun, the design of the Deviants is sharp and lends each of them a unique appearance, and the implications going forward suggest all manner of epic silliness. Ramin Djawadi‘s score adds to the big, international feel as well and offers a welcome change from the Zimmer-fication of blockbuster scores these days. For a grand epic, though, it’s those smaller beats and characters that make Elementals worthwhile. Nanjiani, Henry, and Harish Patel (as Kingo’s valet) ensure more than a few laughs, and Jolie takes her supporting turn in stride while still managing to carry herself like a star. Keoghan gets to break free a little from his career trajectory of playing weird little shits to embody a more complex character with an intriguingly conflicted persona, and while it’s not explored as well as you’d hope it’s good seeing the actor stretch and smile without malicious intent. McHugh and Ridloff are the two newest faces, and while again, their characters are left a bit wanting, their performances and personalities mark them as talents to watch. As mentioned earlier, Zhao ensures some attractive natural beauty throughout the film as we hop through time and around the globe. It’s an appealing looking film, albeit one that’s neither mind-blowing nor paired with the human weight that marks her earlier films like Nomadland and Songs My Brothers Taught Me. It’s difficult to fault Marvel’s habit of poaching indie filmmakers and offering them blockbusters featuring big-name stars in funny costumes, but the otherwise talented Zhao might want to consider returning to her more successful roots after this. She won an Oscar last year! Eternals teases some legitimately interesting conversations, dilemmas, and questions about blind obedience, the one versus the many, and moral obligations while soft shoeing around them to get to the expected beats and booms. Just as the title characters follow orders to their detriment, so do Zhao and her fellow screenwriters offer only mild pushback before giving in to their overlords. Some filmmakers have found ways around those obstacles to deliver supremely entertaining superhero fare whether in Marvel’s house or DC’s, but Zhao hasn’t managed the same. Instead, she’s delivered with Eternals an epic that feels far smaller than it should. It’s fine, but it probably won’t stay on your mind for all that long.",POSITIVE
"Nov 15, 2021"," According to the official count by Marvel Studios and Disney, there are more than eight thousand characters in the Marvel Universe. This number doesn’t necessarily count supporting characters and one-offs. If it did, we’d be somewhere in the neighborhood of over seventy-two thousand. With numbers like that, it only makes sense that most characters will remain somewhat anonymous. The general public hasn’t the foggiest idea who Jack of Hearts or Dr. Druid happens to be. Not every Marvel character is destined to be an icon, and even when the best is in the business of creation, sometimes their efforts can fall flat. An excellent example is Jack Kirby, who is responsible for at least co-creating The Fantastic Four, The Hulk, Captain America, the X-Men, and more. After numerous problems with fair pay and credit, Jack Kirby left Marvel to work for the competition, DC Comics.* While there, did he revitalize Superman or The Flash with his dynamic art and bananas plotting? He did not. Instead, Kirby created the sprawling quasi-fantasy/science fiction saga The New Gods, a concept so odd that the comics were canceled, forcing Kirby to return to Marvel. Even after his return, Kirby couldn’t shake loose certain concepts. His ideas were a fusion of Chariots of the Gods by Erich von Daniken and 60s-era psychedelia. They concerned genetic engineering, mythology, science fiction, and gods locked in endless combat with their foes. His ideas came hurtling out in the late 1970s in the pages of The Eternals. Consider that, in a universe populated with surly mutants, Asgardian deities, and a duck running for President, the base concept of the Eternals was too weird. Like the New Gods, The Eternals was canceled. Considerable talents like Neil Gaiman tried to revive the characters, yet they stubbornly remained in obscurity. Then, the MCU was introduced. Then, Disney and its rapacious appetites pushed for more, more, more, which is very much a good news/bad news situation. The bad news is that Disney knows the MCU is money in the bank and is perfectly fine cramming it down your throat. The good news is that the MCU is run by thoughtful people who are after more than a paycheck. That’s why Marvel Studios reached out to acclaimed filmmaker Chloe Zhao. They asked her what she was interested in. She came back to them with a very strong pitch. The end result is Eternals, a gorgeous and ambitious film cursed with being created in the wrong shape. In the beginning, Arishem created the heavens and the Earth.** They are a Celestial, a member of a race of space gods. They are also, unlike other gods you might be familiar with, flawed. During the creation of the Earth, an invasive species arrives, known as the Deviants. These fearsome thingies exist to slaughter early humans, who were probably thankful they never had to deal with dinosaurs. To counter the Deviants, Arishem created the Eternals, a band of immortal warriors. They are sent to battle the Deviants, live among humans, but never interfere in their conflicts. Sounds pretty straightforward, right? Not really! Somewhere in the 1500s, the Eternals finally defeat all of the Deviants, yet there’s no word from Arishem about what they’re supposed to do next.  They split up. Their leader Ajax (Salma Hayek) settles in the badlands of South Dakota. Sersi (Gemma Chan) and Sprite (Lia McHugh) head for London, where Sersi is in a tentative relationship with university professor Dane Whitman (Kit Harington). Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani) blends in by not blending in as a wildly popular Bollywood star. The deaf speedster Makkari (Lauren Ridloff) and the cynical psionic Druig (Barry Keoghan) withdraw from civilization entirely, while the inventor Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry) builds a family. Thena (Angelina Jolie) is afflicted by a kind of battle madness, and the kindly brawler Gilgamesh (Don Lee) takes it upon himself to watch over her. Then there’s Ikaris (Richard Madden), an earthbound demigod who’s more than a little reminiscent of a certain Kryptonian. He disappears for centuries, then conveniently reappears just as Sersi, Sprite, and Dane are attacked by a very tough Deviant. This is only the first in a chain of catastrophic events that forces the Eternals to come together and re-evaluate what their purpose on Earth truly is. Since Eternals first screened for critics, a somewhat gleeful narrative has popped up around the film. The conventional critic wisdom is that Eternals is the worst film in the MCU, due to Marvel Studios conscripting arthouse darling Chloe Zhao to make a movie about bottom-of-the-barrel characters. As a result, the conventional wisdom goes, the film will be a massive failure and ring the death knell of the MCU in particular and superhero films in general. Like most conventional wisdom, it’s totally wrong. Chloe Zhao has made a flawed film, it’s true, though it’s bursting with beauty and ambition. It’s possible this might be the best-looking film in the MCU, and Zhao gifts us with strong cinematography and numerous shots of gorgeous vistas. Too often, the MCU uses a house style that combines CGI void space with anonymous gray locations, such as airports and hallways. Zhao knows that mainstream entertainment can also be aesthetically pleasing. Her action scenes are clear, crisp, and often extremely cool. She makes sure that each action sequence has emotional resonance, so instead of simple punching, we understand how the characters respectively feel about doing battle. The root flaw is the extremely problematic pacing, and things often feel too slow or a little too fast. For a movie that’s a little longer than two and a half hours, that’s a nearly fatal issue. I think it’s due to the screenplay by Zhao, Patrick Burleigh, Kaz Firpo, and Ryan Firpo. Despite the strong characterization and moments of solid emotion, they have written a feature screenplay that yearns to actually be a miniseries like HBO’s excellent Watchmen. This screenplay has an enormous amount of heavy lifting to do, considering it has to introduce a number of wild-ass ideas such as the Eternals themselves and the Celestials. It also needs to show us who all the main characters are and their frequently volatile group dynamics. Additionally, the script keeps jumping back and forth through the entirety of human civilization. A common problem in screenwriting is not recognizing what format a story thrives in until it’s too late. If Eternals had been a nine-episode series on Disney+, it could have had time to breathe and let the story unfold organically.  It also bears mentioning that, for the most part, the villains of the piece are CGI monstrosities. As a result, most of the run time is spent with the Eternals, played well by a group of skilled and likable actors. Perhaps the most impressive aspect of their performances is the portrayal of the constantly shifting group dynamics. There are romances, almost romances, annoyances, loyalty, and a metric ton of bickering. Like any group of people who have been together for a little too long, they have transformed into a family. As I write this, despite a dismal 47 percent score on Rotten Tomatoes,*** Eternals has made $161.7 million theatrically. That ain’t bad, considering we continue to slog our way through a pandemic. Should we expect to see an explosion of merchandise and memes featuring the characters? I don’t think so. These characters and this film aren’t designed to be embraced by the general public, despite Disney’s herculean marketing push. While it’s a good film, Eternals is flawed, though I think time will be kind to it. I also think it’s likely to remain an outlier. If the MCU is a high school, the Eternals are the artsy-fartsy drama students, forever overshadowed by the jocks.
 ***A trick to learn is that the only time it’s worth taking a RT score seriously is if it’s hovering somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 percent. That’s where a number of interesting films live.",POSITIVE
"Nov 15, 2021"," Dos hechos distantes marcan la nueva película de Marvel, Eternals, la segunda en menos de un mes tras el triunfo comercial de la vulgar Venom: habrá matanza. El primero, que, según los especialistas, los cómics de los Eternos, creados por Jack Kirby en los años setenta y recuperados por Neil Gaiman en 2006, nunca formaron parte de la aristocracia de la casa ni fueron un éxito siquiera consolidado. Segundo, que al frente del proyecto, como directora y coguionista de la última versión del libreto, está Chloé Zhao, ganadora del Oscar a la mejor película y a la mejor dirección en la pasada edición de los Oscar, y autora de un cine en las antípodas en objetivo y estilo a las producciones de superhéroes, en un caso sin parangón en el cine estadounidense. El salto desde las muy sociales, austeras, humildes y en parte documentales —pues estaban representadas por intérpretes no profesionales en la mayoría del reparto— The Rider (2017) y Nomadland (2020), hasta el mastodonte de efectos especiales, fantasía y costo de Eternals es abismal. No se recuerda un giro de tal calibre en la historia del cine. Pero, ¿por qué razón alguien como Zhao, afianzada en la élite del arte de autor americano, decide aceptar una oferta tan extravagante como la de Marvel? Y, más allá, ¿cuáles son las intenciones de la poderosa casa de los superhéroes, parte integrante además del aún más opulento imperio de Disney, para reclutar a la directora? En el primer caso, aparte del dinero, consustancial y quizá siempre relevante y comprensible, está el reto; eso sí, también el riesgo. En el segundo caso, de nuevo con lo temerario por delante, quizá se encuentren los muy llamativos esfuerzos de Marvel por la diversidad, tanto en cuestión de género como de multiculturalismo. Aunque, por ahí quizá pida paso una razón algo más etérea y poco demostrable: la de dar carta de legitimidad, relumbrón de qualité y de entidad artística, a una película que por sí sola estaría lejos de semejantes apelativos. Y el hecho de que alguien también tan alejado del sello Marvel como la argentina Lucrecia Martel recibiera hace unos años una propuesta semejante para componer Viuda negra puede confirmar la teoría. Con independencia de todo lo anterior, extrínseco en principio, pero seguramente significativo, Eternals es una película pomposa y plomiza de más de dos horas y media. Una odisea cósmica sobre el origen de la humanidad, muy relacionada con la cultura greco-romana de los dioses y sus mitos, desarrollada a partir de una farragosa estructura anclada en algunos de los grandes acontecimientos y civilizaciones de la historia de la humanidad. Todo ello con un plantel de intérpretes y de personajes muy medido en cuestión de género, raza, opción sexual y cultura. Tan ajustado que parece más organizado por un algoritmo que por una mente libre y pensante. Las secuencias de acción resultan planas y casi ingenuas en comparación con las más espectaculares películas de Marvel, y aunque Zhao parece menos incómoda en las secuencias de clímax sentimental y el relato mejore en su segunda mitad, a este trecho se llega ya con el agua al cuello por la losa irrelevante y grandilocuente de la primera hora y media, por esa imagen de new age espiritual, y por esa elementalísima filosofía humanista sobre el libre albedrío.",NEGATIVE
"Nov 15, 2021"," Directed by Oscar-winning art-house director Chloe Zhao gives this a more stylistic tinge filled with firsts but with all the blockbuster superhero humour and fanfare. This multi-cultural motley crew of Eternals have made the earth their home for the past 7,000 years. Created by the cosmic gods known as Celestials, they were sent to earth to protect humankind from the Deviants – a kind of monstrous mammal that could be very closely related to Predator. Having killed the Deviants over many centuries, the Eternals – wry in their fight and their friendships with each other – part ways. When the present-day arrives the Eternals have to reunite once more with an event known as the Emergence that threatens everything they hold dear. Across the course of the global road journey, we come to know nearly each and every one of the 10 new superheroes with flashbacks over the centuries. Gemma Chan’s leading hero Sersi can turn anything (apart from humans) hard to soft. Living in London and working at the Natural History Museum she has a romance going with boyfriend Dane played Kit Harington – very much in the same vein as Chris O’Dowd’s role as Jane’s boyfriend in Thor: The Dark World. Low and behold, she was once married to the chiselled eyebeam throwing Ikaris (Richard Madden) – enter the first sex scene ever to appear in a Marvel film. Also in another first, the film plays witness to its first-ever gay kiss, not just hinting at it, Zhao does not attempt to vaguely hint at the idea but lovingly praises this love union. Contrary to rumours, no it hasn’t got anything to do with Madden’s character either. Kumail Nanjiani brings the humour, as expected, with Kingo, a polished and slightly vain superhero that has made himself a name as a Bollywood superstar. All the while Barry Keoghan’s Druig takes on the angry mind controller who questions what good is it being superheroes when they can’t even prevent humans from committing genocide. The remaining heroes make vaguely any lasting impact. Zhao brings her flair for the beauty of the eye shots over vast landscapes and setting suns but remains on the tinge of darkness in revealing the truths of worldly myths and historic events created by the Eternals. Least we not forget this is a CGI Marvel blockbuster and it still delivers on the celestial plains of epic proportions. It’s a cosmic opening for the next phase of the Marvel saga.",NEUTRAL
"Nov 15, 2021","It's a frustrating, occasionally fun, at points brilliant, frequently tiresome journey that never manages to reach any of the potential it so clearly had.",NEUTRAL
"Nov 15, 2021"," In creator/artist Jack Kirby’s original ""Eternals"" comic books, these immortal heroes have been living on Earth, steering, guiding, helping humans evolve for thousands of years and protecting us from mankind’s oldest enemy, The Deviants. And although they were able to blend in with earthlings, there was no mistaking these beings for what they are: gods. Now that Marvel has finally brought the Eternals to the big screen, under the direction of recent Oscar winner Chloé Zhao (Nomadland, The Rider), they call themselves gods but, for the most part, the reason they blend in so well with humans is that they’re just like us, with all the same flaws, egos, and foibles of those that they’ve sworn to protect. It may seem like a subtle change from comic to film, but it makes Eternals the movie seem slightly smaller and less-than than it should, despite it being one of the longest Marvel movies ever made. And this isn’t entirely a criticism of the movie, either. Part of the reason Zhao and co-writers Patrick Burleigh, Ryan Firpo, and Kaz Firpo have made these ancient beings seem so relatable is because, in a movie, having a story filled with nearly a dozen gods would feel so overstuffed with gravitas as to be unbearable. In this version of the Eternals, they are kind protectors, following the lead of their benevolent overlords, the Celestials (yes, even gods answer to someone), who have instructed them not to interfere in human business unless it involves the Deviants. That's why they didn’t step in when Thanos or Ultron made their intentions known, or when various wars and genocides happened, or when the Kardashians first got their own reality show. It’s a decent explainer as to how these super-powered beings could have been all around us yet never made their presence as heroes known. Eternals is as long as it is because there’s a lot of story to tell and a great many characters to follow, and I love that Zhao and her team aren’t in any hurry to rush to the next action sequence or overtly link this film with the bigger MCU (in fact, other than a few name drops of other Marvel characters, Eternals might be the least connected of these films to the bigger universe since the first Guardians of the Galaxy). So when the Deviants show up on Earth again after hundreds of years of them seeming to be extinct (and causing a major tragedy in the world of the Eternals), the troops are rallied, and the group must not only find these invaders but also figure out why this particular attack feels different and more targeted at them rather than humans. The mostly memorable cast of Eternals includes Richard Madden as the generally powerful Ikaris, who at first stands out as team leader, until his long-lost love Sersi (Gemma Chan) is given the mantle of leader by Ajak (Salma Hayek), the group’s direct link to the Celestials. Also on hand are the cosmic-powered Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), who has become a Bollywood star during his downtime, complete with an assistant, Karun (Harish Patel), who documents his every move; Sprite (Lia McHugh), the young-looking old soul; super-strong Gilgamesh (Don Lee), who acts as something of a protector to the warrior goddess Thena (Angelina Jolie), who is slowly losing control of her mind due to a unique ailment; inventor extraordinaire Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), one of the few Eternals who has settled down in a marriage, which can be tough for an immortal; speedster Makkari (deaf performer Lauren Ridloff); and Druig (Barry Keoghan), who controls minds and is something of a black sheep in the group. Together they roam the world looking for pockets of Deviants, at least one of whom seems to have the ability to suck the lifeforce out of Eternals, making himself stronger, smarter, and less monstrous in the process. Also hovering around the periphery of the story is Kit Harrington as Sersi’s love interest Dane Whitman, who will likely be far more prominent in future Marvel movies (look him up). Eternals also jumps around a bit in time, not just between world events that shaped human history where the Eternals were involved, but more recent history in which secrets about these new Deviants are revealed. More is uncovered about the internal dynamics among the group: who is more or less trustworthy than others; who is more or less devoted to the letter of the law set up by the Celestials; and ultimately, who wants to save the Earth from a pretty wild fate. Allegiances shift and then shift again, factions are formed, and lives are lost in the process. But very little of this film feels like a traditional Marvel film (a truth that may really bug some people), from Zhao’s emphasis on picturesque visuals to the way the battle sequences are handled. There are probably too many characters to give everyone their due in terms of character development, but that didn’t stop me from still falling for a great number of the Eternals team members. While Eternals does feel like it’s opening up possibilities in future Marvel movies, with its cliffhanger ending it feels like like the first part of something far more self-contained (again, not unlike the Guardians movies). I can’t say I appreciated every choice Zhao and her team make in terms of the presentation of the Deviants, and considering she’s meant to be the primary protagonist of this story, Sersi is probably the least interesting character here. But this one captured my eye as well as my intrigue for this continuing storyline in ways I had not anticipated, and based on the film’s two credits sequences, I’m exceedingly curious to see where these stories go from here. No filmmaker can please everyone, and I especially appreciate that Zhao made her style of film for herself; she's breathed a new, lived-in spirit into superhero movies while still keeping things entertaining and creative. I hope Marvel takes more chances like this in their future storytelling or at least lets Zhao direct the promised sequel. Did you enjoy this post?

"Nov 12, 2021"," Critics of the Marvel Cinematic Universe – and even some of its fans, in truth – often complain that the films have a tendency to play safe, to stay true to the tried and tested formula that has pulled in an impressive gazillion dollars (or something closely approximate) at the box office since Iron Man made his debut back in 2008. Marvel has generally clung to the ‘if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it’ truism but, after twenty-five hugely-successful films, it’s inevitable that, in an attempt to avoid audience fatigue and ennui,  Marvel are going to be tempted to rewrite their own rule book to give audiences something a little different, something they might not be expecting. Here comes film number 26, and it’s Chloé Zhao’s Eternals, loosely based on Jack Kirby’s frankly bonkers short-lived 1976  cosmic comic book series and it is indeed a marked change of direction – to an extent – for Marvel, most notably in that it’s not very good. Eternals is dull, it’s boring, and it’s quite epically uninvolving. The omens were really rather good for Eternals. An Oscar winner in the director’s chair (although the film was long in the can by the time Zhao picked up her statuette last year for the acclaimed Nomadland – kudos to Kevin Feige and the Marvel Bunch for spotting her potential and giving her the gig long before the awards started flying in her direction) and an impressively diverse and inclusive cast; what could possibly go wrong?  On the evidence of the achingly-long film now on our screens – this unwieldy, clumsy thing weighs in at over two and a half hours – almost everything beyond Ben Davis’ stunning, widescreen cinematography that gives the film a sense of the epic, its script and story never remotely lives up to. There’s precious little flair from the director’s chair up on the screen; it’s as if Zhao leapt at the challenge of directing a big-time, big bucks Marvel movie – she had a hand in the script too – but became quite overwhelmed by the process of actually delivering a pacey, interesting movie full of well-rounded, likeable characters. Eternals is the story of a bunch of superannuated space beings (apparently from the planet Olympia) who have been hiding on Earth for centuries, having seen off a race of bland beasties called Deviants. In Kirby’s original comic, the Deviants were a wily, intelligent species with their own society and civilisation but here they are little more than convenient, rather dreary cannon fodder.  The Eternals each go their own way once the Deviants are demolished but, having been unable to interfere with the affairs of Man in the intervening centuries,  are forced to regroup when the Deviants rear their ugly, CGI heads again… only to find that they themselves are not quite who they thought they were and that an even greater, more CGI threat is lurking under their very feet. As the Deviants break cover again and start to appear at the most inconvenient times in the most inconvenient places, the Eternals are forced to call upon their extraordinary abilities – the usual stuff; flying, throwing bolts of light around, laser beams from the eyes, etc – to keep the beasties at bay. Slowly they begin to reassemble from all around the world as they prepare to fight an enemy that threatens the future of the entire planet. It all sounds quite exciting if a bit generic, but the execution has none of the pace and excitement of even one of the weaker previous MCU entries (Thor: Ragnarok and Captain Marvel spring to mind) because the script is all over the place and the narrative is never allowed to build up any momentum. No sooner have we watched a noisy, rather samey CGI battle sequence that at least briefly piques our interest, than we are plunged into another interminably tedious talky bit where two of the Eternals stand somewhere very pretty – on a beach, on a cliff, on top of a mountain – and gaze dreamily into the middle distance whilst pondering the story so far and their place in the great cosmic plan and how hard it is to be a God hiding in plain sight on a planet of warlike primitives. Repeat and rinse for the better part of three hours. A game cast does its best to enliven the proceedings but they’re hampered by a wildly schizophrenic script that wants to be portentous and pretentious but has to throw in a few classic Marvel quips and one-liners as a bit of an insurance policy in case the audience is too jolted by the shock of the new.  Eternals is a film that would like to be new and bold and different but somewhere along the line Marvel has bottled it and decided that they’d quite like it to be a bit unusual but also quite similar to everything that’s gone before. Superhero movies really need warm, intriguing characters for the audience to invest in and to help them navigate that difficult ‘suspension of disbelief’ pitfall. Eternals really has none. Gemma Chan plays the empathetic Sersi but there’s precious little life in her dialogue or her performance and almost no conviction in her centuries-long love for Richard Madden’s Superman-ish Ikaris. Kumail Nanjiani’s Kingo, a Bollywood superstar when he’s not an Eternal, is tasked with providing the film’s humour but it’s Marvel comedy-by-numbers, jokes for the sake of it and none of them land with anything than other than a dull splat. Elsewhere we have Lia McHugh as the childlike Sprite, Brian Tyree Henry as Phastos, the MCU’s first openly-gay superhero, Lauren Ridloff as superfast Makkari and a handful of others who are really just there to make up the numbers. Angelina Jolie serves up the only real bit of charisma as the balletic, magic staff-wielding Thena who stands around in the background far too much and Salma Hayek is rather wasted the Ajak, the group’s wise spiritual leader. For all its bombast and its faux bluster, Eternals really doesn’t amount to anything much and certainly doesn’t amount to anything interesting. It commits the cardinal superhero sin of being really, really boring for a really, really long time. Marvel may be commended for realising that they need to ring the changes but they’re done nothing of the sort here and Zhao has simply delivered a slightly schizophrenic, horribly uneven and desperately pedestrian film that’s neither one thing nor the other. It’s a massive Marvel disappointment.",NEUTRAL
"Nov 12, 2021"," The twenty-sixth film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Eternals introduces a whole new  group of powerful heroes who’ve been conveniently lying low – until now.  Jumping from various points in history, from Mesopotamia to the fall of Babylon, we’re introduced to these almost-immortals through a series of snapshots detailing their lives on Earth over the last seven millennia. Unaging, and sometimes mistaken for gods, this powerful group of beings were created by Celestials to protect the Earth’s inhabitants from Deviants, a violent and monstrous race of aliens. However, the Eternals were issued with strict orders not to use their powers to interfere with human conflicts, a fact which causes contention between the free thinkers of the group and their leader Ajak (Salma Hayek). When the Deviants are finally defeated, the Eternals disband to the four corners of the globe, engaging in an extraterrestrial rumspringa as they wait to be called home.  The action really kicks into gear in what Marvel deems to be the present day: 2024. In London, our protagonist, the earthy and permanently late Sersi (Gemma Chan), is passing for human as she teaches in the Natural History Museum with the help of her colleague and love interest, Dane Whitman (Kit Harington). After being attacked by a Deviant, this one stronger than any faced in the past, Sersi only barely manages to escape thanks to the help of her all-powerful ex of 5000 years, Ikaris (Richard Madden). Realising that the Eternals’ mission hasn’t been completed, Sersi, Ikaris and Sprite (Lia McHugh) must get the gang back together for one last mission. However, not all of the Eternals are easily convinced, as the unstable warrior Thena (Angelina Jolie), and the angry, disillusioned Druig (Barry Keoghan) have a few objections.  A staple of any good superhero film is, of course, the quippy dialogue, which in this instance is delivered by the vain but lovable Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), who has used his powers and immortal good looks to become a huge Bollywood star. With POC in many of the major roles, this is the MCU’s most diverse cast yet and notably features Lauren Ridloff, a real life deaf actor, bringing charm and humour to the role of the deaf superhero, Makkari, while Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry) is the Eternals’ cosmic engineer, a loving parent and openly gay man. It’s worth a mention that our very own Barry Keoghan does us proud, channelling an Aiden-Gillen-esque intensity to his performance as Druig, along with all the bad-boy attitude that entails. The visual elements at play help to sell the subtle environmental themes. The locations are rich and real, yet in line with the MCU, as Zhao built the world’s aesthetic with cinematographer Ben Davis (Guardians of the Galaxy, Doctor Strange, Captain Marvel). There are moments of reprieve in nature, along with a gritty punch to the child-friendly violence. Zhao cites The Revenant (2015) as an influence on the film’s action sequences. It’s a shame that the CG elements detract from the visceral elements of the film, leaning into the cartoonish at certain points. With a run time of two hours and thirty seven minutes, and a very large cast of supporting characters, there’s a mountain of world building and character development to get through – let alone satisfy the required amount of MCU action. (Did somebody say “big powerful beam?”) However, Eternals just about manages to cover it all, and maintain emotional engagement, all while keeping the pace up, and the complex plot moving along. This is in itself no mean feat, and a testament to the Oscar-winning Indie darling director Chloe Zhao and co-writing cousin duo Matthew and Ryan Firpo. While the overall arc of this film is simple, there are deeper themes of systemic failures, challenging power structures, group politics, that will keep the bigger kids entertained, and even those unfamiliar with the MCU will find it followable.  Taking up space in such a well-mined universe can’t be easy, but Eternals not only manages to hold its own, but delivers something engaging, unique, funny and warm.

"Nov 12, 2021","The one exception to the film's utterly bloodless chemistry is a cameo by a post-credits pop star who, for all of 15 seconds, has a completely charming interaction with a CG creature. I believed that performance more than anything in the 2.5 hours.",NEGATIVE
"Nov 12, 2021"," So what happens when her singular vision meets the massive machine of the Marvel Cinematic Universe? In Eternals, Zhao brings the prestige, but working at the cosmic scale the MCU increasingly favours, with characters moving across galaxies and through thousands of years, she loses the intimacy and immediacy that made her interesting in the first place. Zhao and the MCU feel like a mismatch. Co-scripting with Patrick Burleigh, Ryan Firpo and Kaz Firpo, Zhao does manage to knock the Marvel formula out of its familiar tracks. She pulls off some fine individual scenes, raises a few intriguing ideas, but never finds a compelling vibe of her own. This overlong faux-epic is action-filled without being exciting and dense without being profound. The movie opens with the phrase, “In the beginning,” which sounds a tad biblical. A celestial entity named Arishem — very big and very red — sends the Eternals to Earth in 5,000 BCE, just as the Sumerians are forming towns. Immortal beings with a range of powers, the Eternals are there to protect humans from intergalactic predators called Deviants, singularly uninteresting baddies brought to the screen through mediocre CGI. The strong international cast does its best to power through material that is often stiff and sometimes preposterous. Ajak (Salma Hayek) is the leader. Her lieutenants, Sersi (Gemma Chan) and Ikaris (Richard Madden), have a convincing grownup relationship and — unusual for a Marvel movie — an actual sex scene. We also have the warrior Thena (Angelina Jolie being aloof), the jokester Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani being comical) and the super-strong Gilgamesh (Ma Dong-seok, billed here as Don Lee). Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry) is an engineer, Makkari (Lauren Ridloff) is a speedster, and Druig (Barry Keoghan) specializes in mind control. The odd-girl-out is Sprite (Lia McHugh), who may be millennia old but presents as a child and has romantic feelings for an adult man, a subplot that feels icky and off. Thinking of themselves as “Earth’s original superheroes,” the Eternals have been living among humans for 7,000 years, helping us develop art and lit, the plough and the steam engine. As we see, they have nudged along the founding of Babylon, the Gupta empire and the Aztec civilization. On the other hand, they’re not allowed to interfere with human conflicts, allowing all kinds of suffering and destruction to take place on their watch, which seems like an odd, unsatisfactory mission. At about the 90-minute mark, this apparent contradiction gets explained (sort of) in an awkward, momentum-stopping exposition dump, but the film’s mythology continues to feel arbitrary and unconvincing. Eventually the Eternals are torn between their celestial marching orders and their earthly loyalties. The film’s tone splits along similar lines. At times, the Eternals seem omniscient and omnipotent, serenely semi-divine. At other times, they gossip about the Avengers, gripe about cellphone service and engage in family feuds. Nanjiani is funny, but his funniness mostly shows up the leaden solemnity of everyone else. As a Chinese-born filmmaker, Zhao is able to convey a global history that feels truly global, not just American. She also helps to advance Marvel’s recent attempts at fuller representation. There are changes in gender and race from the original comics, with inclusion brought out in a low-key, matter-of-fact way. Makkari is a Deaf character played by a Deaf performer, for example, and Phastos is a gay man who gets a tender family storyline. There’s another crucial aspect of Zhao’s indie approach that makes it into Eternals. Zhao specializes in showing figures in wide open landscapes — the Dakotas, the American southwest — especially at that golden hour when the sun is just setting. Her feeling for the natural world extends to Eternals. Except for an opening sequence set in London, Zhao eschews the usual MCU city-wrecking sky battles, with key events taking place in the Amazon rainforest, the Australian outback and America’s Great Plains, often to breathtaking effect. Zhao works beautifully at that scale. Bring in the portentous overreach of the Eternals’ cosmos-shaking storyline, though, and her talent is diminished. For Zhao, bigger is not better.

"Nov 12, 2021"," Eternals is Chloe Zhao’s The Tree of Life. Ever since her debut, Songs My Brothers Taught Me, it’s been clear that Zhao’s visual style bears the influence of Terrence Malick. With Eternals, her unlikely Marvel Cinematic Universe entry after The Rider and the Oscar-winning Nomadland, that’s true in terms of theme, as well. An epic tale about a team of celestial beings who have presided over humanity’s evolution since the dawn of time, Eternals depicts figures amidst gorgeous natural backdrops, yes, but it also ruminates on the creation of life and a single soul’s place in the cosmos. At its best, this is galaxy-brain, comic-book stuff rooted in a tactile sense of place. Unfortunately, Eternals runs nearly three hours and is bloated with elements that have served other MCU installments well, but fall flat here: the team dynamic (there are far too many characters); an insistence on humor (Kumail Nanjiani is saddled with nearly all the Comic Relief); and ultimate faith, at the end of the day, in the sovereignty of CGI. As for the cast, Angelina Jolie has fun skulking about in the background of a few scenes as Thena, but in the lead parts of Sersi and Ikaris—whose relationship, like the father-son dynamic in Malick’s The Tree of Life, is meant to make the cosmic and personal converge—Gemma Chan and Richard Madden are complete blanks, both alone and in their scenes together. Eternals had the chance to be something distinct in the MCU and Zhao might actually have been the person to do it. But the project was doomed once it became beholden to franchise formula and saddled with this cast.",NEUTRAL
"Nov 12, 2021"," Marvel‘s most recent releases have been moving in bold, new directions (WandaVision, Loki, Shang-Chi). Knowing that Eternals would be part of Marvel’s next phase, it’s been that much easier to separate the MCU into the then and the now. And if there has ever been a sign that Marvel seeks to expand the variety of its content, then it’s perhaps the early reception to their latest franchise starter, which just might paint the future of the MCU.  There are valid critiques of this film, thus far—Eternals admittedly isn’t for everyone. As someone who’s waited for this film since San Diego Comic-Con 2019, I’ve certainly felt a waning connection to these new characters, like Sersi (Gemma Chan), since seeing the film over a week ago. There’s been a lot to process. A whopping 156 minutes doesn’t even give each Eternal the backstory or moment they deserve, and that’s considering two were already cut from the film.  We’ve seen Marvel on a cosmic scale before, but director Chloé Zhao knows how to truly approach this world on an epic scale, scanning thousands of years instead of thousands of light-years. Ben Davis’ cinematography helps complete her vision by showing the audience vast civilizations and the enormous might of the Celestials. A scale unfathomable when compared to the size of Thanos.  Another design highlight is the score of the film, composed by Ramin Djawadi. The Eternals theme is highly memorable, balancing triumphant yet angelic tones. The soundtrack helps convey the way humans view the beings who would inspire stories of Gods, who by the end of the movie, have a reverence for humanity in the same vein.  But what ultimately makes Eternals so powerful for some audiences is the way this family is portrayed, and the different love stories told via each Eternal archetype.  It’s not that love stories are new to the MCU, but they generally aren’t the focus in the way they are in Eternals. Sure, you can argue that Tony Stark sacrifices himself out of love for his daughter, surrogate son, wife, and the rest of humanity, but Eternals is a little bit more two-sided than the typical white-marvel-male-protagonist model.  When the film ends, the Eternals win the day by coming together and creating the unimind. Sersi couldn’t use her powers alone. These relationships give and take more than most do in the MCU. And while not an Eternal, the mild-mannered Karun (Harish Patel)—brought along as a friend and assistant to Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani)—also brings his own sense of warmth and humanity to fill up any room he’s in.  The main storyline revolves around Sersi and Ikaris (Richard Madden), whose centuries-spanning love story lands in the backstory arc of the movie and is kind of lost in the plot of the modern-day arc. Sersi feels passive in the end, but that doesn’t negate the chemistry Chan and Madden share. It is their dramatic tension that anchors the plot, as the story even ends with Ikaris flying into the sun. Very on the nose.  And while their story is romantic and will probably give you butterflies, at least in Marvel’s first sex scene that you definitely didn’t know about, there are several characters that are more compelling that take the spotlight in this movie.  Makkari (Lauren Ridloff) is the team’s deaf speedster (The MCU’s first disabled superhero) and Ridloff is incredible in the role. She got shafted a bit on screentime, but on the bright side, she’s set up for a bigger role in the Eternals sequel announced at the end of the film. She also has intense chemistry with Barry Keoughan’s Druig, who was portrayed as a possible antagonist in promotional material but really was the first one to say no to slavery. Their chemistry lit up the screen whenever they were on it, and some of the best emotional moments, particularly in the final battle, came from their love for each other. I can’t wait for the GIFs.  But seeing a deaf actress on the big screen, and even more, seeing her character happy and supported by her family, is something very special. Makkari doesn’t face ableism in Eternals, either, which is an issue when characters from certain groups are featured in films and television series. They tend to only exist to teach about the way they are disadvantaged and the plights they face.  Eternals also features the first gay superhero in the MCU, Phastos (the first canon gay character is actually played by Joe Russo in Endgame). His story is actually very representative of humanity as a whole as he grows cynical after helping humanity progress technologically. He goes through cyclical periods of openness and resclusiveness that are aided by the expansive timeline of the movie.  Thena (Angelina Jolie) feels like a character that is supposed to die, but instead, she ends up surviving and getting featured in the first post-credits scene (with yes, Harry Styles). Her relationship with Gilgamesh (Don Lee) is apparently platonic but is at least tied with Sersi and Ikaris’s relationships for what counts as the deepest love. Thena is also an interesting as a fighter type of character who becomes somewhat helpless. This juxtaposition makes her complexity gripping, and if there were anything that should have been delayed to a subsequent film, it’s perhaps taking Gilgamesh away so soon.  Eternals has a lot of heart and beauty that drips off the screen when you watch it. An intermission would be nice, but the characters and their love for each other, and love for us as a whole, kept me doe-eyed enough to not really care about the finicky criticisms that passed my mind on the way back to the car from the theater (and boy, did I miss that feeling). If this movie is any indication, the MCU is only growing in scale, and whether you’re a fan of Zhao’s vision or not, these characters and concepts are probably going to stick around for at least a little while.  Amanda is a twenty-something Texan now residing in Los Angeles. When she's not entrenched in a sci-fi series or a network procedural, she works as a stage manager for live theater throughout the city or is working with animals. Having experience in multiple entertainment industries, she's always been drawn to television and has an invested interest in fandom and the way fanbases interact with their media and its creators.",POSITIVE
"Nov 12, 2021"," Sent here 7000 years ago to battle an alien lifeform known as the Deviants by the celestial Arishem, the Eternals have lived on Earth, silently watching mankind through its greatest eras. However, after all the Deviants have seemingly been defeated but with no word from Arishem to move on, the Eternals decide to part ways, living separate lives until the sudden reappearance of their old foes forces them back together again to confront their complicated relationships and their very existence. Coming after the fantasy-skewed Shang-Chi, this new phase of the MCU looks certain to be taking a whole new direction and the latest installment, Eternals, is doing the same. With Oscar-winning Indie director Chloe Zhao taking the helm, a timeframe spanning 7000 years and covering the whole world (and beyond), Eternals really does set out to be different. And it is. Not only is its expanse far greater than we’ve ever seen from the MCU but we get a whole bunch of firsts. Our first deaf superhero. Our first sex scene. Our first gay kiss. Zhao effectively balances all these elements – we flit from ancient Mesopotamia, to modern-day Camden, to the gardens of Babylon in swift procession; the layered backstory is measured and thoroughly explained; and for a movie with ten protagonists, it’s impressive that each character is given a unique personality. The closest we have to a main character is Cersei (Gemma Chan) whose love of humanity serves as a nice anchor to the rest of our otherworldly characters, including Cersai’s ex Ikaris (Richard Madden) who has Superman-like powers, their leader and healer Ajak (Salma Hayek), the perpetually young Sprite (Lia McHugh), tech-man Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani) who can shoot energy beams from his hands, speedster Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), strongman Gilgamesh (Don Lee), mind-manipulator Druig (Barry Keoghan) and warrior Thena (Angelina Jolie) who is suffering from a superhero version of PTSD. Zhao’s Oscar-winning Nomadland (a substantive documentary-esque look at people in the American West) feels like an influence on Eternals. Indeed, that focus on humanity is certainly apparent, and Zhao does well to include her grounded sentimentality in the MCU, but when squeezed in between superpowers, literal world-building and eons of mythology, it feels out of place and wearisome. Zhao’s Indie lens also has a small place here, though jumbled in with CGI-heavy showpieces. Speaking of which, this isn’t all nuances and firsts. Eternals also touches upon those MCU tropes we know so well. There are wonderful ensemble fights (too few), a couple of laughs (far too few and only primarily via Nanjiani and his sidekick Karun played by Harish Patel) and superheros to root for (mainly the aforementioned Nanjiani and definitely Jolie’s Thena) but they’re sporadically littered under the weight of exposition and era-spanning traumas. Which isn’t to say that Marvel movies can’t confront in-depth themes. Comic book characters have long dealt with complex, divisive subject matters but with all these firsts, thorough narratives and superhero touchpoints, Eternals is too mixed up to be either overly entertaining or profound. That’s not to say that there aren’t some fantastic building blocks to work from here. The mythology is rich and opens a big gleaming door to a whole fresh direction for our new and established characters to go in. Now that Eternals has completed the burden of exposition, we’re looking forward to seeing some of these characters come into their own right to take on the rest of the MCU.",NEUTRAL
"Nov 12, 2021"," Such are the complexities of the ever-expanding Marvel Multiverse and its borrowings from the world’s mythologies that I’m betting some university somewhere is offering a doctorate in its geography and genealogy. Eternals marks the screen debut of a sub-group of superheroes created in 1976 by the Marvel Comics’ elder, Jack Kirby, with a little help from classical Greek legend. The Eternals hail from the planet of Olympia. Here, they were expressly designed by the Celestials, a godly breed of cosmic architects, to protect Earth and Earthlings from the Deviants. These nasties are rampaging CGI monsters out to gobble up anybody in their path. As far as I can tell – from a layman’s point of view – the Eternals are blessed with a standard set of super-powers. Collectively, they can fly, run down anything or anybody, fight furiously, assisted by weapons forged from cosmic energy, blast their enemies with cosmic beams, control minds and transform inanimate objects simply by thinking about them. They’re also very wise. At least, Salma Hayek is. Hayek is Ajak, the group’s den mother, who has healing powers as well as a hotline to the Celestials. Angelina Jolie is burdened with a more febrile temperament. As Thena, named for Athena, the famously formidable Greek goddess who included both wisdom and war in her portfolio, she’s missed out on the wisdom bit. Instead, she is suffering a nervous breakdown, brought on witnessing so many earthly atrocities without being able to do anything about them. For the Eternals are forbidden from interfering in any calamity which doesn’t involve the Deviants. Their main distinguishing feature is their ability to merge with everyday folk between assignments. When the film opens, they have been lying low for 7000 years, having adopted various occupations and interests. Sersi (Gemma Chan), the most intuitive of the bunch, has a handsome human boyfriend (Kit Harington). Thena is not the only one to feel helpless in the face of all the horrors they have seen. One of two others are beginning to feel distinctly mutinous. The action moves back and forth in time, starting and ending in the present day and stopping off at various points in history in between, but the most remarkable thing about all this is the identity of the film’s director. To pilot this grandiose piece of movie machinery, Marvel’s boss, Kevin Feige, chose Chloe Zhao, whose last film, the Oscar-winning Nomadland, was so firmly rooted in the specifics of what it’s like to be short of money in the backblocks of contemporary America that you could almost smell the dust. This decision pays off in one respect. Zhao has moved the action out of the studio sound stages where so much of the earlier Marvel movies were shot and gone on the road. The South Dakota shack where Ajak has been spending her downtime looks as if it could slot seamlessly into Nomadland. Zhao has also imported some of the Nomadland script’s dry and rueful sense of humour. Much of the film’s publicity has concentrated on the fact that its 10 superheroes represent a broad range of minorities. But more important is their ability to bring a conversational tone to the absurdities of their dialogue. They’re eventually defeated, however, by the cumbersome nature of the basic scenario. So, too, is Zhao. Walt Disney had a name for the element which persuades an audience to surrender its scepticism and temporarily believe in the fantastic or the outright nonsensical. He called it “the plausible impossible”, and every Marvel movie relies on it. But the pompous stretches of pseudo-metaphysics which take over the film’s second half are more than enough to break the contract. Over-burdened with good intentions, the film limps to a conclusion which leads straight into the projected sequel. Clearly, we’re supposed to leave the cinema filled with an urgent sense of anticipation. But all I felt was relief that the two-and-a-half hour running time had finally come to an end.",NEUTRAL

"Nov 11, 2021"," The latest set of superheroes to be added to the Marvel pantheon are aptly godlike. The Eternals – 10 of them for the purpose of the new movie and more as promised by the mid-credits and post-credits sequences – have protected humankind for millennia. Babylon, Hiroshima and even the Gupta period: the Eternals have been present through good times and bad, keeping a balance between humankind, their own creators known as the Celestials, and the malevolent aliens known as the Deviants. A crisis forces the Eternals scattered across the world to reunite and reassess their relationship with the Celestials and their adversaries. Indian viewers may get a kick from the marigold wedding, the Eternal named Kingo (who is apparently some kind of a Hindi movie star, although he can barely hold his own on the dance floor), and Harish Patel as Kingo’s Hindi-spouting “valet” (we would have called him a manager).  There’s also a touch of Bollywood to the family-above-all-else theme. The 155-minute Eternals has been directed by Chloe Zhao, beaming herself into the Marvel Cinematic Universe after an Oscar for the gritty road movie Nomadland. Zhao, who is also among the several writers, can possibly be credited for the multi-ethnic cast, the prominence given to female characters, the first gay and first deaf Marvel superheroes (the latter played by a deaf actor), and the concerns over genocide and warfare. But the real honours go to the visual effects and action teams. Good in the showing and poor in the telling, Eternals soars when superhuman abilities are in full flow and sags when the tortuous back story has to be explained (which is frequent). Led by Ajak (Salma Hayek), the Eternals have been watching over humans for centuries, on the condition that they do not intervene when their wards behave inhumanly. In the present, Ikaris (Richard Madden) finds his beloved Sersi (Gemma Chan) in a relationship with the human Dane (Kit Harington) in London. Sprite (Lia McHugh) is stuck at the age of 12 and hating every minute of it. While Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani) is making movies, Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry) is basking in domestic bliss with his husband and a kid with dimples. Gilgamesh (Don Lee) has been ensuring that Thena (Angelina Jolie) keeps her tendency to go rogue under check.  Druig (Barry Keoghan) seceded a while ago and is hiding out in the Amazon. Finally, there is Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), a hearing impaired Eternal who is in love with Druig. The enthralling action set-pieces have to be parsed from in-between awkward moments in which characters stand around waiting to explain themselves. The wildly inconsistent tone moves from laugh-out-loud to deadly earnest, sometimes right in the middle of a scene.  At its best, the diversity of faces and inclusivity of thought are an acknowledgement of how far Marvel movies have come. At its most cynical, the casting of actors who represent each of the major markets for Marvel produce is a nifty ploy to ensure a connection with audiences in any corner of the world. The actors with less screen time make the bigger impact. Brian Tyree Henry, Barry Keoghan, Lauren Ridloff and Lia McHugh are more impressive than the nominal leads Gemma Chan and Richard Madden. Kit Harington, who along with Madden and composer Ramin Djawadi represent the movie’s Game of Thrones connection, furthers his claim to romantic lead status. The effortlessly jovial Harish Patel outshines Kumail Nanjiani in every one of their scenes together. ",NEGATIVE
"Nov 11, 2021"," The Eternals Synopsis: The Eternals are a team of ancient aliens who have been living on Earth in secret for thousands of years. When an unexpected tragedy forces them out of the shadows, they reunite against their most ancient enemy, the Deviants. Disney’s fruitful partnership with Marvel has sprouted an unprecedented train of success. With their own cinematic universe totaling 20+ features, the two beloved properties have reinvented the niche appeals of spandex heroes into the Hollywood market’s core draw. It seemed the MCU was impervious to financial and critical struggles…until now.  Featuring Nomadland Best Director winner Chole Zhao behind the camera, Marvel’s latest, The Eternals, has drawn surprisingly divisive reactions considering the talent involved. Critics and fans alike have cried foul about the film’s unsuccessful departure from the brand’s traditional blockbuster formula, showing a rare sign of stagnation for Marvel’s ever-growing universe.  As someone with lukewarm sentiments about recent Marvel outings (Black Widow and Shang-Chi had their intriguing ideals suffocated by MCU formula), Eternals resonated with me as a much-needed breath of fresh air. Under Zhao’s restrained tutelage, the film elicits a clunky yet wildly sincere depiction of eternal beings grappling with their human vulnerabilities.  I didn’t know what to expect going into Zhao’s first foray into blockbuster filmmaking, as several MCU directors have sacrificed their auteur identity to step into the brand’s homogenized universe. While Eternals still packs the usual array of bombastic setpieces and hit-or-miss one-liners, Zhao thoughtfully balances superheroes’ grand allures with her eye for meditative, character-driven beats.  With a team that includes a Superman-esque juggernaut (Ikaris, played by Richard Madden), a titan warrior triggered by painful memories (Thena, played by Angelina Jolie), a quick-witted Bollywood movie star Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), a deaf super speedster (Makkari, played by Lauren Ridloff), Druig (played by Barry Keoghan), a mind-controlling man who wants to prevent humanity’s penchant for violence and discord, and Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), a technological mastermind regretting his world-changing advancements among others, Etenerals has a lot on its plate. Zhao intelligently blends her eclectic cast into a united unit reckoning with the consequences of their powers and hard-wired responsibilities to their celestial guardian.  Similar to what Zack Snyder accomplished with DC, Zhao digs beneath the armor of their grandiose superpowers to tap into emotionally expressive sentiments. Her screenplay with Ryan and Kaz Firpo finds a comfortable balance between the team’s shared angst with their eternal lifestyle while also developing character-specific nuances upon that foundation. Elements like Thena’s emotional outburst and Druig’s desire to control human cruelty help establish emotive textures rarely present in MCU films – with Zhao and company capturing a dysfunctional yet sincere family dynamic from her immortal beings.  Even with my praise, I can still see why Eternals hasn’t connected with audiences. The film gets tripped up by the familiar early 2000’s X-Man trap – boasting far too many characters to invest in for an origin story experience. In hindsight, perhaps this material would have worked better in the patient format of a streaming show, allowing the characters more time to stew with their insecurities without choppy interruptions.  Certain elements never really overcome the lack of development. Gemma Chan gives a commanding performance as newly-inducted team leader Sersi – but her new role and eternal relationship with Ikaris are largely brushed over despite their significance to the narrative.  Messiness aside, Eternals represents the kind of grand, open-hearted home run swings that Hollywood should be more willing to embrace. I left an MCU film for the first time in a while with encouragement about the brand’s potential to grow past its well-worn formula.  We hope you're enjoying BRWC.

"Nov 11, 2021"," George Wu holds a masters degree in cinema studies from NYU. He eats, drinks, and sleeps movies. Fortunately, he lives in New York City, the best place in the country for disorders of this type. He also works on the occasional screenplay when inspiration strikes, but his muses don't slap him around enough. Despite bringing on Academy Award-winning director Chloe Zhao, Eternals is surprisingly Marvel’s weakest film since The Incredible Hulk. Zhao’s three low-budget indie films simply did not prepare her for a special effects-laden mega-budget movie and it clearly spiraled out of her control. Zhao has cited Terrence Malick as an inspiration. If only that made it onto the screen because if Eternals suffers from anything, it’s a lack of vision. Malick is one of the most visionary of filmmakers and his films are often contemplative with a sense of wonder. Eternals could have used a lot of that as it is extremely ambitious, covering the origin of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But instead of showing this to us, Zhao does it all by telling in big exposition dumps. In Eternals, Celestials are immensely powerful cosmic entities that shepherd life across the universe. They use immortal aliens with superpowers called Eternals to fight against Deviants that prey on life on different planets. The ten Eternals on Earth are Sersi (Gemma Chan), who can transform matter; Ikaris (Richard Madden), who flies and shoots energy from his eyes; Sprite (Lia McHugh), who generates illusions; Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), who shoots balls of energy from his hands; Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), who invents superior technology; Thena (Angelina Jolie), who forms spears, swords, and shields out of energy; Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), who has super-speed; Gilgamesh (Don Lee), who has super-strength; Druig (Barry Keoghan), who can control minds; and Ajak (Salma Hayek), the leader of the Eternals who has super-healing. The story is about the Eternals learning a deep dark secret of their own and that they must save mankind from more than Deviants. This is told by jumping around the globe in flashbacks across 7,000 years of human history. The source material comes from another visionary, Jack Kirby, who had a hand in creating many of Marvel’s most famous characters and whose pet project in the 1970s was Eternals. Strangely though, the only thing the script retains from the comics is the relationship between the Celestials, Eternals, and Deviants. Nearly every other detail is changed. All the characters have very different personalities except for Thena. In the comics, Sersi is a flamboyant party girl. In the movie, she’s passive and demure. Druig goes from malevolent to benevolent. (Changes in Ikaris and Ajak would amount to spoilers.) The Deviants, mostly reduced to barely sentient monsters, are generic and boring. Kit Harrington appears as museum worker Dane Whitman but is only awkwardly shoehorned in as a teaser for the Marvel superhero he will become. He has little to do with the overall plot and disappears early in the film. Only Nanjiani’s Kingo, who is a Bollywood star and the film’s comic relief, and McHugh’s Sprite, who is stuck in the body of a child, have any kind of lived-in feel. Tyree Henry’s Phastos comes close but is limited by 90% of the character’s behavior being reluctance. Despite being 2 hours 37 minutes long, Eternals feels rushed, like it’s trying to squeeze a ten-episode series into one feature film. The biggest problem though is that Zhao is content to tell the story through spoken exposition instead of imagery. In the comics, Celestials don’t speak and retain a sense of mystery and awe. Here, both the head Celestial, Arishem, and the Eternals themselves are too anthropomorphized, and their story is conveyed through speech. Arishem needed to be the equivalent of 2001: A Space Odyssey’s monolith. The usual mid- and post-credits scenes are disappointing. One is used to introduce two Marvel C-list characters and the other is a poorly put-together teaser.",NEGATIVE
"Nov 11, 2021"," How much weight can a superhero movie bear? That seems to be the question driving director Chloé Zhao throughout “Eternals.” As Marvel has risen to the preeminent pop culture powerhouse in movies, a debate has raged over the validity of superhero films as “cinema.” Respected directors like Martin Scorsese have famously sparked fierce debate on the matter, especially when it comes to how much of the MCU roster is seen as an expensive factory product following a specific formula. “Eternals” feels like the studio’s biggest effort to answer that question. Zhao’s overstuffed epic tries to be everything for everyone. It’s a comic book adventure filmed with poetic arthouse visuals. It still follows the usual Marvel plot points but at the same time wants to be some grand meditation on God. Basically, it wants to be taken really, really seriously, while still featuring giant rock entities with multiple eyes.  The opening is quite literally a Biblical crawl describing the cosmos as being the work of entities called the Celestials. Apparently our planet is one of their creations, and is threatened by Deviants, who are snarling predators that look plucked from the jungles of “Avatar.” This is followed by an epilogue in which the title heroes, the Eternals, save some prehistoric humans from rampaging Deviants. You see, the Eternals have been here for about 7,000 years cleansing Earth of the monsters and succeeded, or so it seemed. But before we go too deep into the cosmology of this dense film, the plot really kicks off with Sersi (Gemma Chan), an Eternal fronting as a lecturing scientist in London. Her boyfriend Dane Whitman (Kit Harington) suspects there’s something different about her, but can’t figure it out. When they’re attacked by a Deviant, Sersi and fellow Eternal Sprite (Lia McHugh) are saved by Ikaris (Richard Madden), who was once Sersi’s lover. Sensing a looming threat, they reconnect with the rest of their old team, including Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), Druig (Barry Keoghan), and Gilgamesh (Ma Dong-seok), who has been caring for Thena (Angelina Jolie). They are all soon shocked to discover their leader, Ajak (Salma Hayek), has been murdered, revealing a greater cosmic threat beyond their imaginatio. Zhao’s evocative photography then has to somehow accommodate a screenplay co-written with Patrick Burleigh, Ryan Firpo and Kaz Firpo that is one of the most cluttered MCU entries in years. It’s a lesson in how attempts at being original within a genre clash with keeping the bankable formula intact. Before the central plot gets going, we get long flashbacks of the Eternals’ early days hanging around ancient Babylon and watching the Conquistadors rampage through Tenochtitlan, not to mention a wedding in ancient India. Endless exposition explains their mission, meaning protect the humans but don’t interfere in their plans, which irritates Phastos, who would like to introduce modern inventions. The murder of Ajak leads to both a search for answers and an existential crisis involving the Eternals’ sense of identity and reality, after Sersi is given mind-blowing revelations by their creator, Arishem (voiced by David Kaye), a massive deity with six eyes who appears over Earth and looks made of stone. It could be a metaphor for humanity beginning to question God, or certain ideas of God. Would a divine creator have the right to destroy their creation? Would the creation have the right to resist? It’s one of many possible themes the film has little room to fully explore. Angelina Jolie’s valiant Thena is suffering from a particular kind of mental illness as well, which is so hastily explained you might be grateful for the rewind option once “Eternals” streams on Disney Plus. Another running theme is the broken romance between Sersi and Ikaris, which never gets to turn into real drama because we have to rush along to cover every other Marvel base. As a result there are lots of sad stares and cheesy one-liners, but we never feel the heartache. Notice how Richard Madden’s expression never seems to change during the entire movie. He can’t even crack a smile during Marvel’s first ever sex scene, where Ikaris and Sersi make love on a rock in very PG-13 fashion yet still bold for this franchise. There are still moments in “Eternals” that have the old Marvel charm and even some truly groundbreaking touches. A newly-ripped Kumail Nanjiani steals the show as Kingo, who when the Eternals took a break became a Bollywood star. His assistant, Karun (Harish Patel), is a hilarious, scene-stealing delight who dutifully follows Kingo around with a camera to document his new adventure and offer moral encouragement. Phastos is gay and married to Ben (Haaz Sleiman). The two live with their son in a pleasant suburban neighborhood until Phastos’s old teammates show up with cosmic problems. It’s a great moment in which Marvel again shows how pop art can be at the forefront of progressive representation in media. There is also much more chemistry between Phastos and Ben than the boringly hetero Sersi and Dan, who is also played by Kit Harington as a guy always looking worried. Overall the only Eternal with vivacious energy is Ma Dong-seok’s Gilgamesh, who actually cracks jokes and shares drinks he’s learned to make through the centuries. Everyone else pace and stare like refugees out of a religious cult. The better moments in this film are soon caged in by the required action scenes. Visual elegance gives way to efficient CGI battles where the Eternals fight Deviants in the jungle and later, as required by every MCU film, gather for the final brawl. It’s an entertaining showdown set on a volcanic island with the expected build-up to one massive special effect, this one involving a gargantuan face and fingers ripping out of Earth’s core. This might all work better if it were also just a tighter film. Zhao deviates too often to long monologues explaining a certain point or feeling that was already expressed earlier, as if that will give the movie a more “serious” tone. When Marvel films reach some real pop poetics, it’s when the movie basks in its own genre. The ending funeral scene of “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,” where Rocket Racoon looks up at a cascade of fireworks with Cat Stevens’ “Father and Son” on the soundtrack is more eloquent than any moment in Zhao’s crammed metaphysical fable. “Eternals” can still be admired for its chutzpah. There are visual moments and ideas that one rarely finds in any comic book adaptation. Zhao remains a filmmaker capable of composing shots memorable for their sheer richness. It still falters next to another recent epic, “Dune,” which is both visually awesome but with a clear narrative where the ideas don’t clash with the technique. Denis Villeneuve’s sci-fi adventure is about as long as “Eternals” yet doesn’t feel that way. Zhao should be commended for taking a genre film and attempting to reach great heights. She tries to combine heroes in tights with theological musings. The ultimate fatal flaw is that along the way, even with great vistas rushing by on screen, “Eternals” also loses that all-important component to reading comics and watching them as movies— a sense of fun.",POSITIVE
"Nov 11, 2021"," It isn’t hyperbolic to say that Chloé Zhao is most likely Marvel’s biggest “get” since the casting of Robert Downey, Jr. as Iron Man. Hot off of winning both Best Picture and Best Director at the Academy Awards for last year’s sublime Nomadland, Zhao seems like the perfect choice to infuse something new into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, a painstakingly constructed Disney empire now a little long in the tooth and a little too comfortable in its own formula. Eternals is nothing if not ambitious: Aiming to combine Zhao’s specific brand of intimate, humanist drama with the galaxies-spanning scale of Jack Kirby’s cosmic creations, the film is the MCU’s attempt at bridging the auteur with wide-appeal. Does it work? Not particularly, but Eternals does give Marvel a fascinating failure - a gutsy mess that’s endlessly intriguing to parse.  The Marvel Cinematic Universe has long had issues trusting its most impressive hires: Edgar Wright parted ways from Ant-Man over creative differences, as did Scott Derrickson with Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness, and indie acquisitions such as Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck - who helmed 2018’s Captain Marvel - typically get their flair stomped out by the Marvel template. Even this year’s biggest hits for the studio lack their filmmakers’ unique voices; Cate Shortland’s Black Widow never really feels like a Cate Shortland movie, and Destin Daniel Cretton’s Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings - even with its refreshing kineticism - barely captures Cretton’s voice. So color me surprised that Eternals, at many junctures of its interminable runtime, does feel like a Chloé Zhao movie: From its deeply humanist themes to its South Dakota stand-in to its sprawling magic hour photography courtesy of cinematographer Ben Davis, Eternals fits right into Zhao’s wheelhouse. But Eternals doesn’t have a Chloé Zhao problem, it has a Marvel problem. At any given time, Eternals has plenty of interesting things going on, but any departure from rote superheroics is always fighting tooth and nail with Marvel’s formula, which has never been duller than it is in this film. Centered around a cadre of millennia-old superbeings, Eternals pits its titular heroes - at the word of their omnipotent Celestial overlord Arishem - against the monstrously flavorless Deviants, CGI beasties long-thought extinguished. The film finds itself at its best and most fascinating mining hefty existential pathos from these immortal beings, wandering without purpose and squabbling over the merits and worthiness of humanity, but its primary conflict has the consistency of indigestible cud. Even the film’s surprise big bad - in an effective reveal that is fair, telegraphed, and even sympathetic - gets his storyline usurped by the bland Deviants. The Eternals themselves are portrayed by a murderers’ row of talent, rarely used at full potential because of one simple fact: there are too many of them. A crowded lineup rarely afforded room to breathe, the Eternals represent an admittedly fascinating spectrum of attachment to humanity: There’s the empathic lead, Sersi (Gemma Chan), who has developed a deep bond with her charges over thousands of years; there’s the dutiful Superman pastiche and love interest Ikaris (Richard Madden); and there’s the hedonistic and flamboyant Kingo (a newly muscled Kumail Nanjiani), injecting comic relief and a fleet Bollywood dance number. There’s also the jaded engineer Phastos (Bryan Tyree Henry), the dementia-riddled warrior Thena (a severely underserved Angelina Jolie), the requisite heavy Gilgamesh (Don Lee), the perpetually childlike Sprite (Lia McHugh), the deaf speedster Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), and bitter mesmer Druig (Barry Keoghan), all led by the maternal Ajak (Salma Hayek). It’s a mouthful of a roster that leads to an awkward revolving door: characters disappear for long stretches of time, inexplicably sit out of climactic battles, and simply just don’t have enough to do.  It’s also a shame that one of Eternals’ weakest links is its leads. There’s a thin, fragile line between somber-slash-contemplative and tired-slash-lifeless, and Gemma Chan’s Sersi and Richard Madden’s Ikaris consistently find themselves on the wrong side of the demarcation. As immortal beings having spent eons as lovers and partners, there’s shockingly little spark or chemistry between them (in fact, none of the Eternals really feel infused with any sort of wisdom or prowess that thousands of years on Earth would grant). Eternals might boast the MCU’s first actual sex scene, but with its sterility and lack of passion, it’s pretty much a non-event not worth the hubbub surrounding it. Gemma Chan, in particular, is capable of much more than the dry, enervated material given to her, showing more verve and bite in her starter MCU role in Captain Marvel than she does as Sersi. The Eternals operate under the directive of their Celestial master, Arishem, and are strictly prohibited from interfering with Earth life unless Deviants are involved. It’s a rule that’s played with fast and loose - and sometimes not at all - and it gives Eternals some of its best moments, despite its obvious inconsistencies. Comics legend Jack Kirby’s original Eternals were meant to be the originators of Earth’s myths, legends, and religions, and even though the film jettisons much of Kirby’s signature bombast and eye-popping colors, it finds power in the quieter moments outside of comic book violence. From early civilization to ancient Mesoamerica to the Amazon Rainforest, watching the Eternals bristle against or nudge humanity brings a refreshing dose of weightiness and existential ponderings, even if it does lead to a hilariously overwrought and on-the-nose sequence in Hiroshima, Japan. But these humanist leanings clash particularly hard with Eternal’s ugliest and most weightless aspects: Any time we even get a morsel of the good stuff, we’re jaunted back to the present for another shoot ‘em up with some faceless baddies. It’s a frustratingly choppy pattern, especially across a bloated runtime. On paper, Marvel’s latest has all the requisite ingredients for a smash hit: An Oscar-winning director, megawatt star power, and a cosmic Jack Kirby veneer. Mix those together with a palpable gumption to finally do something adjacent - if not completely outside - of the the typical superhero formula, and you just might have the shot in the arm the MCU needs. Unfortunately, Eternals is all promise without the knowhow of assemblage, sandbagging its most potent threads with bloat and generic formula. It’s a lopsided mess and Marvel is far from finding the right balance between auteur and blockbuster, but Eternals has enough slivers of greatness for one to hope they never stop trying.",NEGATIVE
"Nov 11, 2021"," Habían muchas razones para estar emocionados por ver “Eternals”, la más reciente película de Marvel Studios. Su directora, la gran Chloé Zhao, ganó el Óscar a Mejor Dirección por “Nomadland”; representaba la primera aparición de un grupo de personajes de cómics poco conocidos; y parecía estar enfatizando, de manera completamente orgánica, lo diverso de su reparto, incluyendo actores de varios sexos y orígenes. Los tráilers, además, prometían mezclar el estilo sonámbulo y etéreo de Zhao, con los excesos visuales y la acción de una cinta tradicional de superhéroes. El resultado, pues, tenía el potencial de ser fascinante, una suerte de punto medio entre el cine arte al que Zhao está acostumbrada, y los blockbusters millonarios que inundan los cines —y ahora, los servicios de streaming— año tras año. Desgraciadamente, la película no logró cumplir con lo prometido. No me tomen a mal; a diferencia de otros fanáticos y críticos, no considero que “Eternals” sea una película terrible. La mayoría de secuencias de acción están dirigidas con elegancia, y el reparto hace lo que puede con sus personajes, por más de que la mayoría no estén particularmente bien desarrollados. Y Zhao sigue demostrando que tiene buen ojo para las composiciones de sus encuadres, enfatizando, también, la utilización de locaciones reales en vez de sets y pantallas verdes. Pero la película en sí no puede aguantar a tantos personajes, desarrollándolos de manera paupérrima, y abusando de las secuencias de exposición. Es así, pues, que “Eternals” termina siendo una experiencia entretenida pero irregular, y ciertamente inferior a lo que al MCU nos tiene acostumbrados. Se nota desde el inicio que “Eternals” tiene mucho qué explicar —comienza con un texto en pantalla, similar a los de las películas de “Star Wars”, pero un poco más largo y aburrido. En todo caso, lo que deben saber es que los Eternals del título son seres prácticamente inmortales, creados por los Celestials, seres enormes de poder incalculable. Estos héroes fueron enviados a la Tierra hace miles de años para acabar con los Deviants, criaturas monstruosas y sedientas de sangre. Pero no pudieron resistir la tentación de involucrarse en asuntos humanos, ayudándolos de cuando en cuando, y estableciendo lazos muy fuertes. ¿Pero quiénes son ellos? Está la líder, Ajak (Salma Hayek), la única capaz de contactarse con su creador, un Celestial llamado Arishem; de ahí, está Ikaris (Richard Madden), el Superman del grupo (la película también hace la comparación); Sersi (Gemma Chan) puede controlar y modificar la materia sin vida; Thena (Angelina Jolie) es una excelente guerrera; Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani) puede lanzar bolas de energía con sus manos; Phastos (Bryan Tyree Henry) es un experto con la tecnología; Sprite (Lia McHugh) puede crear ilusiones y tiene la apariencia de una niña; Makkari (Lauren Ridloff) tiene súper velocidad y es la primera superheroína sorda de la MCU; Druig (Barry Keoghan) puede controlar las mentes de otros, y finalmente, Gilgamesh (Don Lee) es… súper fuerte. ¡Uf! Como se deben haber dado cuenta, son muchísimos personajes, los cuales tienen que ser introducidos uno por uno (o en parejas) y con historias de trasfondo y motivaciones propias. Esto hubiera estado perfecto para una serie de televisión, pero se siente forzado y tedioso en una película de poco menos de tres horas de duración, tanto así que buena parte de su metraje está dedicado a “juntar de nuevo al grupo”, al más puro estilo de los Blues Brothers, pero con menos humor. ¿Y por qué? Pues, miles de años atrás, los Eternals se separaron luego de matar al último Deviant, pero ahora los monstruos han regresado y tienen que detenerlos. Después de todo, uno de ellos está obteniendo nuevos poderes, y podría estar relacionado al nacimiento de un nuevo Celestial… lo cual no es necesariamente una buena noticia. Sin lugar a dudas, “Eternals” es una película sobrecargada. Hay demasiados protagonistas, demasiadas subtramas, y demasiados flashbacks que tratan de humanizar a estos personajes, fallando en el intento. Quienes la pasan mejor son la Sersi de Gemma Chan (el corazón de la película, básicamente), el Ikaris de Richard Madden (una figura sorprendentemente compleja), el Kingo de Kumail Nanjiani (porque el actor cómico —y ahora musculoso— es carisma puro y muy gracioso), y el Phastos de Bryan Tyree Henry (por lo bien que está retratada su vida personal contemporánea, con su esposo y su pequeño hijo). “Eternals” no necesitaba diez protagonistas; debieron escoger algunos y deshacerse de otros, permitiéndole a la historia desarrollarse de manera menos apresurada, y sin abusar de las escenas de conversación donde “alguien le tiene que explicar algo” a los demás. Todo esto, pues, resulta en una película donde termina siendo muy difícil empatizar con los protagonistas. Si filmes como los de “Capitán América” o “Spider-man” funcionan, aparte de todo el espectáculo y los gags ya clásicos de Marvel, es porque al espectador le importan estos personajes —esto hace que los combates sean más tensos y emocionantes. En “Eternals”, hay tantos personajes y tanto con lo que ponerse al día en tan poco tiempo, que uno se queda sin conocer bien a cualquiera de estos héroes. ¡Y eso que ni siquiera he mencionado al Dane Whitman de Kit Harrington, quien seguramente regresará en filmes posteriores! Seguramente ya lo han leído en otros sitios, pero hubiese tenido más sentido que algunos de estos Eternals salgan primero en otros filmes, o que hayan convertido esta historia en particular en una serie de Disney Plus. Ni la talentosa Zhao puede hacer magia con este guion tan caótico. Pero al menos logró que “Eternals” luzca bien… la mayor parte del tiempo. La directora claramente tiene una fijación con la “hora mágica” (la luz del atardecer, anaranjada y cuasi-romántica), escenificando muchos momentos en dicha hora del día, el flare del sol rodeando a sus personajes. Y la mayoría de escenas de acción están muy bien coreografiadas y dirigidas, especialmente para estándares de Marvel —no abusan de las cámaras nerviosas ni de los cortes rápidos, más bien favoreciendo planos largos y de movimientos fluidos. Pero por otro lado, los efectos digitales son de calidad irregular. Los Deviants lucen extremadamente sintéticos y tienen diseños genéricos, y el filme incluye un plano de avión que simplemente no pude creer fuese parte de una blockbuster millonario del 2021 (sí, así de falso de veía). Los poderes de los Eternals, eso sí, lucen suficientemente espectaculares —y me sorprendió que Ikaris tenga tantas claras influencias del Superman de Zack Snyder (algo que la mismísima Zhao ha confirmado en entrevistas). “Eternals” es un caso interesante; una película de Marvel que no se siente siempre con una película de Marvel. Maneja un tono que mezcla lo melancólico con lo violento y gracioso, como una suerte de choque de estilos, el cuasi cine arte vs. la “manera Marvel”, con creaciones digitales caricaturescas y todo. No siempre combina bien, lo cual, junto a los personajes mal desarrollados (y demasiado abundantes), convierte a “Eternals” en una de las películas más fallidas del MCU. Sí, agradezco que hayan intentado hacer algo distinto, y sí, me encanta que traten la diversidad de manera tan natural, incluyendo personajes gays y superhéroes mudos y una líder mexicana. ¡La representación es muy importante! Pero la narrativa y el desarrollo de personajes también lo son, y es ahí donde “Eternals” falla un poco. No es el “desastre de Marvel” (™) que muchos han estado declarando, pero ciertamente pudo ser mejor. P.D.: Hay una escena en la película que se lleva a cabo en el Amazonas… y que cuenta con un actor español (¡!), cabañas que parecen europeas, y llamas (¡¡¡!!!).

"Nov 9, 2021"," Ian Simmons launched Kicking the Seat in 2009, one week after seeing Nora Ephron’s Julie & Julia. His wife proposed blogging as a healthier outlet for his anger than red-faced, twenty-minute tirades (Ian is no longer allowed to drive home from the movies). The Kicking the Seat Podcast followed three years later and, despite its “undiscovered gem” status, Ian thoroughly enjoys hosting film critic discussions, creating themed shows, and interviewing such luminaries as Gaspar Noé, Rachel Brosnahan, Amy Seimetz, and Richard Dreyfuss. Ian is a member of the Chicago Film Critics Association. He also has a family, a day job, and conflicted feelings about referring to himself in the third person. At some point during my two-plus-year education on Slow Cinema, under the tutelage of indie filmmaker extraordinaire Sujewa Ekanayake, Martin Scorsese made his infamous comments about comic-book movies not being “cinema”. Sujewa and I have returned to this point during many podcasts, never really settling anything, but prompting me at one point to ask if it would be possible for someone to make a Slow Cinema comic-book movie. For the uninitiated, Slow Cinema is not synonymous with glacial pacing or boring subject matter. It’s deliberate filmmaking with an indie-film sensibility, which eschews quick-cuts, celebrity cache, and special effects in favor of slice-of-life storytelling that speaks to themes greater than those of the fleeting pop moment. Chloe Zhao’s Eternals is now upon us, and I’m not prepared to call it “Slow Cinema” (maybe “Slow Cinema-adjacent…kinda?”), but it does move the Marvel Cinematic Universe further into the realm of heady, big-picture ideas that Disney+ TV shows like WandaVision and Loki began exploring with its “Phase Four” marketing storyteling plan. The film tells the story of the Eternals, a team of godlike beings sent by an even greater force called the Celestials to protect Earth from ravenous dog-like monsters called Deviants. Led by Ajak (Salma Hayek), the Eternals accomplish their mission and spend thousands of years apart, wandering the planet and awaiting permission to return to their homeworld of Olympus. Things go awry, of course, when a more powerful breed of Deviants pops up in modern times, forcing our heroes to reconcile, reunite, and reconfigure to save mankind. I absolutely love this movie. No, I’m not a Marvel shill (paid or otherwise). No, I’m not trolling the trolls who believe in the vast Rotten Tomatoes conspiracy. I am (or, more precisely, was) one of the foremost skeptics of Eternals going in. No one is more surprised than me that I not only liked what I saw but consider this to be one of the best films I’ve seen this year. I can feel the comments flooding in already (or maybe that’s just wishful thinking; nobody reads this site*). But before you burn a hole in your keyboard, allow me to present some rebuttals to the criticisms I’ve seen leveled at Eternals since its release last week. Read them all, or pick whichever ones speak to you, and enjoy my preemptive response to your invective—which also, strangely, counts as a review. Eternals is too long.  I could point out that, at 2 hours and 37 minutes, Eternals is only two minutes longer than Denis Villeneuve’s weekend-winning remake of Dune and 6 minutes shorter than the latest Bond outing, No Time To Die—and then ask, “What the hell are you complaining about?” Instead, I’ll point out that the MCU’s crown jewel, Avengers: Endgame, is 24 minutes longer than Eternals—and is actually the second half of a larger film that runs exactly 5-and-a-half hours. So, again, what the hell are you complaining about? Eternals plays with time too much. The main story of Eternals takes place over seven days. In classic Hero’s Journey fashion, the character roster increases as the story gains momentum, like a narrative snowball rolling down a hill of inciting incidents and crashing into what could very well be the end of the world.  As the disbanded Eternals are reincorporated, we get proper introductions. This often involves jogging back centuries or millennia to events that either expand upon or spin out of the prologue. From Babylon to the Amazon to Hiroshima, we catch up with triumphs and tragedies throughout the years, which informed each team member as a person (for lack of a better word) and as part of the larger group of stranded immortals. None of this is window dressing or filler. It all matters to our understanding of who we’re watching, why we should care, and how the climactic outcome might shape all Marvel movies going forward. Yes, you’ll have to pay attention; no, not every character gets a full arc (more on that in a minute); yes, Eternals lacks the “pew pew” panache of thrill-a-second comic-book-movie warfare. But it invites the audience to really think about what these characters are going through; how humanity has grounded and changed them (sometimes for the better, sometimes not); and even how we as mere mortals prioritize issues great and small in our own blips on the sacred timeline. Speaking of which, are you really asking me to believe that the same mainstream movie culture that venerates Quentin Tarantino and Christopher Nolan has trouble keeping up with nonlinear narratives? Eternals wastes Angelina Jolie. It’s true that one of the film’s marquee stars gets sidelined for much of the film. It’s also true that there’s a very good reason for it. Her character, Thena, is the inspiration for Athena, the Goddess of War, and in early battle scenes against the Deviants, we get a lot of energy-sword-wielding, CGI-Jolie-flipping action. Soon after the team achieves victory (keep in mind, I mean “soon” as in runtime; storywise, it’s probably thousands of years), she develops a sort of immortal Alzheimer’s disease, which leads to a self-imposed exile (as well as the deepening of a bond with another character, which comes back around in a truly noble and stirring fashion). It’s akin to the relationship between Black Widow and Hulk from earlier in the MCU; the key difference being we actually get to see the cause and effects of this relationship—rather than having a bizarre lovey-dovey dynamic sprung on us mid-movie. I’ve also read interpretations of Jolie’s performance that suggest she looked bored throughout the film. I can’t speak to the actress’s degree of engagement, but I can say that we get sparks of battle-hungry vigor early on and then settle into a more subdued portrait of a character losing sight of themselves—which necessitates their not taking center stage or being called upon to bear the story’s emotional heft. Indeed, there are a number of characters who either die too soon or offer up only a taste of their eons-spanning personality profiles—profiles that could very well be fleshed out in sequels, which Marvel has been known to dabble in. Remember how Joss Whedon wasted Elizabeth Olsen in Avengers: Age of Ultron? Remember how pissed off we all were at the Russo Brothers when they casually dropped “Stephen Strange” into some Winter Soldier dialogue—and we never heard from that character again? Eternals is too woke. This was actually my biggest concern heading into the movie. The marketing surrounding the film (which includes not only advertising campaigns but also press releases and interviews with talent and studio execs) went out of its way to taut Eternals’ diversity. Between race-and-gender-swapping characters from their comic-book incarnations, to highlighting the gay relationship of one of the central characters, and even rendering one Eternal deaf (in addition to race-and-gender-swapping them), I completely understood the suspicions of the Internet’s so-called “toxic trolls”: that the blockbuster would be more of a platform for social issues than a springboard for good movies (Patient Zero for these concerns is Captain Marvel herself, Brie Larson, whose public denunciations of “40-year-old white dude[s]” launched a million hate videos). Add to this the fact that the Eternals trailers did absolutely nothing for me (or for legions of other Marvel die-hards who were unaccustomed to Terrence Malick-inspired shots of beaches and wistful looks in their comics adaptations). I wondered if Marvel was trying to shield itself from criticism of a bad movie by playing the Diversity and Inclusion card—a card, I might add, that has already cost them vital overseas revenue, with bans in Chinese and Middle Eastern markets. The truth of the matter lies in the film itself, and it saddens me to say that a lot of this bullshit conflict could have been avoided had Disney/Marvel been confident enough in Zhao’s film to simply market it as a great new Marvel story, instead of a “groundbreaking” and “important” cultural milestone. Eternals does diversity right, by showcasing a wonderfully talented and charismatic cast of multi-ethnic performers banding together to save the world. Race is never made an issue. Neither is sexuality. That same-sex relationship is presented in as matter-of-fact a fashion as the straight relationship that anchors another key aspect of the story. Zhao and actors Brian Tyree Henry and Haaz Sleiman don’t resort to the flamboyant swishing about and lisping stereotypes that signify so much of how gay men are still signified in media.  When the much-ballyhooed kiss happens, it’s during a moment of genuine drama, a beautifully realized “come back to me” embrace that even the most bigoted loser would recognize as a love that transcends categories and judgment. As for Makkari (played by deaf actress Lauren Ridloff)—holy shit. This is the definition of an incredible character. She’s a speedster, meaning she runs super-fast, and she’s also a bit of a loner—though not necessarily by choice. Like Jolie’s Thena, Makkari doesn’t get a whole hell of a lot to do in the main web of stories, but she made me see past Ridloff’s so-called disability and marvel at her charisma, playfulness, and the deeper mysteries of her character, which will hopefully garner more attention later on. Watching a lot of the anti-woke reactions has been disappointing, but not very surprising. The commentary from those who’ve seen the film is indistinguishable from those who let their assumptions about the messaging keep them from watching it. Many of these folks claim that their problem with Diversity and Inclusion doesn’t stem from innate prejudice, but rather a perceived cultural tinkering that seeks to upend popular franchises by deconstructing classic films and replacing their (largely) white male protagonists with women and/or people of color. I’ve seen aspects of this play out in other movies, but not in Eternals—which celebrates the melting pot of humanity—wonders, warts, and all. Eternals is too derivative. I’m usually the first to cry “foul” when a movie nakedly and liberally cribs from other sources, and there’s no denying that Eternals is one part Prometheus, one part Transformers: The Last Knight, one part every other Marvel movie, and one part Slow Cinema. But there’s something to be said for stealing a bad idea and turning it into a good one. Ridley Scott raised a lot of very interesting questions in his long-denied Alien prequel, in which it was revealed that mankind is basically a failed celestial science project (and that the famous xenomorphs were deployed as gooey, toothy erasers). But he flubbed the landing and resorted to a lazy quasi-remake of his landmark sci-fi horror film with Alien: Covenant. Eternals answers those questions “the Marvel Way” and adds several layers of universal political intrigue for good measure. As for the Transformers connection, that involves a plot development that I won’t spoil here. Suffice it to say that Michael Bay lifted one of the most iconic characters from the 1986 cartoon and dropped it like a hot frying pan full of bacon grease. Eternals utilizes the same concept to much better effect, not only visually, but in posing profound ethical questions that haunt the film from almost the beginning to the very end. I’m not ruining anything by saying that this involves the inevitable, climactic, world-ending threat—but I hadn’t expected to wrestle with the notion that maybe the Earth should be allowed to die (or that the marquee heroes would take up the issue amongst themselves). The Eternals are joyless, overpowered, and unrelatable. That’s definitely the vibe I got from the trailers, but having watched the whole movie, I can only imagine that the people who still make this claim were sitting furrow-browed and cross-armed for two-and-a-half hours, bitching to themselves about the movie not being Avengers 5. Had they paid attention (or been honest with themselves), they would have picked up on the wide personality spectrum on display in Zhao’s film. From the resolute would-be leader Ikarus (Richard Madden) to his inquisitive and cautious-in-love ex-girlfriend, Sersi (Gemma Chan) to the Bollywood megastar, Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), and the sullen god-trapped-in-a-twelve-year-old-girl’s-body, Sprite (Lia McHugh), there is no shortage of emotion, humor, and tension coursing through the Eternals’ team dynamic. Look closely, and you’ll see characters switch roles over the centuries as the reality of their situation sinks in and their prospects for a long-promised future gradually dim. This is a fine tapestry of diverse (there’s that word again) performances that plays like The Avengers for adults. If you’re concerned about dreary, one-note characters, I’d invite you to check out Frances McDormand’s baffling Oscar win for Zhao’s previous film, Nomadland. Eternals is the antidote fo that movie’s stubborn helplessness in the face of adversity. Sure, McDormand might have been “relatable” to depressed Twitter addicts who assume everyone is as fed up with humanity as they are, but I found the movie to be an exercise in parody and futility. How many kind, outstretched hands can one person swat away before viewers say, “Alright, fuck you, too, I guess.” The characters in Eternals aren’t happy-go-lucky superheroes; they have more than their share of hang-ups, moral quandaries, doubts, and nihilistic fantasies. But they balance one another out in ways that average moviegoers may just find to be hopeful without being sappy; nuanced but not defeatist. Many Marvel films are insular to the point of ignoring the man-on-the-street POV (i.e. the mere mortals who have to live with the likes of Hulk smashing up their office buildings or Thanos snapping loved ones into nothingness on a whim). The Eternals find themselves in a between space; they’re godlike entities to the citizens of Earth, but they’re just as awed and afraid by the greater Celestial machinations as we would be by Asgardian politics. Eternals doesn’t really fit with the other Marvel movies. And this is a bad thing? First off, that’s not entirely true. We don’t get any cameos from Falcon or the Winter Soldier; Vision is nowhere in sight. But the events of Infinity War and Endgame directly impact Eternals’ main plot. And the mysterious post-credits scene definitely speaks to some potential Phase Five deliciousness. It’s refreshing to walk into a Marvel movie only having to know one or two key bits of information, rather than requiring several days’ worth of homework. I wouldn’t mind seeing how the Eternals gel with the reconstituted Avengers (or X-Men or Fantastic Four, for that matter), but I could also kick up my feet and smile at a trilogy centered on Sersi, Sprite, and Kingo (and Kingo’s humourous, heartwarming valet, Karun, played by Harish Patel).",POSITIVE

"Nov 9, 2021"," Let’s get this out of the way up top. Eternals is not a good movie. It’s not a good comic book movie, it’s not a good action movie, it’s not a good Marvel movie. It somehow feels overstuffed and empty at the same time. It’s muddled and convoluted. It’s a bland and boring and bewildering mess. It’s overlong but even with an hour cut out of its running time, Eternal would probably still feel too long. So, what is Eternals about? About 7,000 years ago, a bunch of superpowered beings were dispatched to Earth to protect humanity from the Deviants. They can’t interfere with anything else because that would be bad. But they can interfere in our technological evolution because… reasons. And hand on heart, they can’t interfere in humanity’s progress in any other way. Except romance. Romance is fine. But, really, no interference at all no matter what. So, yeah. I don’t know. None of it makes any darn sense. Anyway. The group of Eternals are sitting around on Earth and definitely not interfering except for the dating and tech and such when like 500 years after they killed the last of the Deviants another one shows up and we're off to the races. Did I mention the “world-wide earthquake”? No? Okay. There’s a world-wide earthquake. And then the new Deviant shows up. Stuff happens and there are twists and some of them don’t make a lick of sense. The movie has a structure that definitely looks good on paper. It jumps back and forth through time, showing the Eternals at different events in history. Problem in execution is that it’s like watching a high-light reel of a movie series that never was. Eternals is home to some of the worst dialogue in an MCU film yet. I’m not saying that the MCU films have been home to the great screen dialogue of the century, but for a genre where more time is spent on previsualization and stunt work than character moments, the MCU films have had some great character moments with some solid dialogue. The powers that be at the MCU have consistently recognized that the heart of a movie is almost as important as the set pieces. It’s like all of that has been forgotten with Eternals. But maybe I’m expecting too much from the people who have consistently delivered great moments over the past 13+ years. Maybe not everyone else is going to these to watch great actors do great work. That leaves us the set pieces, the action, and the stuff blowing up. But it’s all so murky and geographically confused that the set pieces just become noise. There’s no sense of place, of where the heck everyone is during the action. The set pieces are more confusion than exhilaration. So, yeah. But you’re asking, with nearly 3 hours of confusion and mud filtered action and blandness, the performances have to be great, right? Yeah, I’ve got some bad news. It’s rare to see a bench this deep perform so uninspired. I don’t know what went sideways during the production of Eternals. It’s not that Eternals is too ambitious and is a glorious failure that falls under the weight of what it’s trying to achieve. Like I said up top, it’s somehow both overstuffed and empty. Things that seem like they’re going to be important are never mentioned again. There’s little continuity between scenes, even in dialogue. Motivations make little to no sense. Twists come and go, and you find yourself thinking “that doesn’t make a lick of sense no-how”. But I can hear you asking, is Eternals the worst Marvel movie ever? As long as Howard the Duck and Blade: Trinity and the Ghost Rider movies exist, no. The basement is filled with some serious dreck based on Marvel properties. So, no, Eternals isn’t the worst thing ever. I mean, come on, the 2015 Fantastic Four exists. But, damn, it is disappointing.",NEGATIVE
"Nov 9, 2021"," Marvel Studios’ Eternals has divided critics and audiences like no other film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Previously, movies like The Incredible Hulk and Thor: Dark World disappointed many but still managed to wedge themselves in the “fresh” category on popular review aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes. The Chloe Zhao directorial, however, has a score of 48 per cent, which basically means less than half of the reviews thought it was worth their time. Even most of the positive reviews of the movie read as if they are apologising for absolutely excoriating it. On Metacritic, another review aggregation site that has a more nuanced system of awarding ratings to films, shows and games, Eternals fares slightly better, with a score of 53. What went wrong with Eternals, given it comes from the production house that has fascinated this generation like few others have managed to over the years? The criticism notwithstanding, Marvel Cinematic Universe is a behemoth with acolytes across the world. First, let’s briefly summarise what the film is about. Eternals says that the Avengers were only the second superhero team on the earth, and the titular superhuman, quasi-immortal beings called Eternals, have lived secretly among humans since 5000 BC, about 7000 years before the Avengers initiative came to be. They were told by their Celestial overlord called Arishem that they were earth’s protectors, and were tasked to destroy the Deviants, their destructive counterparts. But Deviants seemingly died, but the good guys ostensibly received no further communication from the Celestial. The premise certainly sounded interesting, and a capable director could have done a lot of good stuff with it. Zhao, however, in my humble opinion, is not one. I have seen only one other film of hers, the much-celebrated, Oscar-winning drama Nomadland, and have a few reservations about it. Marvel directors are often not given a lot of freedom, but it appears Zhao managed to prevail, for good or bad. There are aspects in Eternals where Zhao’s indie sensibilities do enhance the product. The film looks exquisite for the most part — the immense windswept landscapes, clever use of sunlight, natural lighting, and actual locations. Even the CGI and computer-aided visual effects do not seem as intrusive and are actually pleasing to the eyes. Zhao has said she took inspiration from Zack Snyder’s DCEU films, and it certainly feels true. Whatever your opinion of Sndyer, he certainly can create some memorable visual imagery. The action is pretty good too. In visual sense at least, Eternals is a step-up from most MCU movies. The cast also does not disappoint, with a few exceptions like Richard Madden. The man cannot act, at all. Angelina Jolie’s character, easily the most interesting character in the film, is weirdly given short shrift for some reason. The Celestials are suitably cosmic, and do truly feel inconceivably powerful and unknowable in a godlike way. There ends the good stuff. Eternals’ plot is obsessed with answering the question that the writers probably thought would be on every mind: why Eternals didn’t help Avengers in the fight against Thanos. Also, why did they not interfere during numerous destructive, violent wars, genocides, atrocities, Holocaust, and so on, asks Kit Harington’s character Dane Whitman to Sersi (Gemma Chan). The answer is as insipid as you would expect, that they were ordered by Arishem not to interfere unless the Deviants were involved. It is hard to imagine Sersi and Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), who are more connected to humans than their fellow Eternals, standing idly as people kill, raid, and rape each other around them, and destroy natural habitats to plunge the planet into the abyss. The real answer, of course, is Kevin Feige, the tsar of the whole thing, had not thought of including the Eternals storyline until the Infinity Saga and the whole shebang with Avengers: Endgame ended. The film could have leaned towards making the perils of blind loyalty its central idea, in the sense that Ikaris, basically Marvel’s Superman, adheres to his orders despite every other Eternal expressing dismay at all the impending death and destruction. Then, it could have been a movie worth engaging with. Zhao and other writers posit that war helps humans develop new technologies and grow, which is downright ludicrous, and this is why Arishem wanted Eternals not to interfere. It is revealed towards the end that Arishem sent the Eternals not to protect humanity as they thought, but let it populate the planet until the point it can feed the Celestial egg inside the earth’s core. The Celestial would then come out and destroy the planet in the process. Eternals would then be tasked with helping other planet nourish life, until it too gives birth to a Celestial and is destroyed. It seems like a clumsy nod to climate change. Clumsy because it is deeply flawed. The reason the baby Celestial would come out is no particular fault of humans, but simply because they are too many, enough to hatch a Celestial egg. Climate change, most climate scientists agree, is not because of overpopulation, it is because of overconsumption. Zhao appears to be fallen into the Malthusian trap that we saw play out in Infinity War and Endgame. While Thanos was clearly the Big Bad, his idea, that destroying half of universe’s life to make sure the other half would thrive, was shown as if it was not wholly devoid of reason. The humour is one thing that defines MCU movies. It is the the lack of it that defines Eternals. There are the usual one-liners, but they fall totally flat for the very reason that most of them are badly written. In one scenes, Druig (Barry Keoghan) taunts Kingo by saying something to the effect of, “Kingo, the movie star.” To which Kingo replies, “I’ve directed some movies too”. The dialogue is so bad, you would feel embarrassed for the cast, most of whom belong in much, much better movies. There are feeble attempts at representation, of course. Makkari (Lauren Ridloff) is superb, and is the highlight in the final act. But why did Arishem create an Eternal who is hearing impaired? Why isn’t every Eternal as powerful as Ikaris and as physically strong as Gilgamesh (Don Lee)? It certainly would have solved a lot of problems. Why do the Eternals have different accents? Why do they talk only in English when alone? There is a gay kiss, a first for MCU, but it is shot half-heartedly, the intention clearly being to pacify the members of the homosexual community but without discomfiting the predominantly straight audience. The kiss is also marred by the fact that Phastos, the gay Eternals, was partly responsible for obliteration of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, for he developed the technologies that led to humans inventing nuclear bombs. The excuse of a sex scene everybody is talking about is so awkward and so utterly bereft of chemistry between the actors, that it had been better if it were not there. The two participants, Sersi and Ikaris, have allegedly been in a relationship for thousands of years, and yet porcelain dolls have more expressive faces. Exacerbating every issue in Eternals is its uneven pacing, which sometimes stretches a lifeless scene for no apparent reason, and hurtles through sections that could have been thematically significant and would have given it more meaning. The after-credit scenes do promise good things in future. But then, you know a movie is bad when the best thing about it is the stuff that comes after the credits begin to roll. Eternals is a mess, a beautiful mess, but a mess nonetheless. There is a far more interesting movie under all that flotsam. In better hands, the movie could have been something special. All Zhao has provided is a bland, dull film.",NEGATIVE
"Nov 8, 2021"," Following on from 2017’s splendid First Reformed, Paul Schrader returns with yet another deep character study with The Card Counter. Here, we have Oscar Isaac in the role of William Tell, an exacting card counter with a...chequered past, who has been presented with two wildly varying paths in life – one that is smothered in vengeance and the other a simple road to validity. Tell needs card games and the associated lifestyle as a means of balance; at one point he says his need is simply to pass the time, but, in reality, it helps him to suffocate the sins of his past. Through Tell, the movie can broach themes relating to culpability, control, accountability, and redemption alongside a not-so-subtle damnation of the War on Terror and nationalism. The brilliance of The Card Counter comes from how Schrader plays out the suspense of Tell’s situation against seemingly drab backdrops of mid-level casinos and the relationships he forges with Haddish’s alluring stable host La Linda and Sheridan’s lost and vengeance-fuelled Cirk – vengeance that involves Tell’s past. There’s a seething tension whispering across each scene, the lingering feeling that the movie is leading towards something inescapable. Whether that be Tell’s ambiguity in the eyes of the other characters, his dark military background, his paranoia-fuelled motel room routine or Cirk’s sullen mannerisms, Schrader proves again that he knows how to craft a compelling narrative, and, whilst there is less visual flair here than seen in First Reformed, the coldness of the visuals only aids the tone further. The movie also provides three great performances, Oscar Isaac is excellent as the charmingly menacing Tell, Haddish provides some necessary stability and levity whilst Sheridan steps away from large-scale pop culture romps for something more subtle and affecting. The methodical pacing and lack of actual card playing may come as a detriment to some, but anyone familiar with Schrader’s work won’t be surprised with what they see. Powered by Isaac’s excellent performance, The Card Counter is precisely layered and fiercely executed. It’s always exciting to discover what the reigning Academy Award-winning Best Director will be following up their prized movie with and in Chloé Zhao’s case, it’s a Marvel movie – specifically, Eternals. The 26th installment in the MCU, Eternals introduces immortal superbeings into the universe, ones that have lived anonymously on Earth for millennia and who now must reteam to fight their evolving and returning nemesis, the Deviants. The plot of Eternals stretches much further than that top-level synopsis and other narrative elements include Celestials, jilted lovers, historical ramifications, and Kit Harington. In fact, one of the key positive aspects of Eternals is Harington being sidelined for the vast majority of the movie. So, the major question is...how successfully would Zhao’s specific and beautiful talents merge with Kevin Feige’s well-oiled but rigid machine? Sadly, the answer is not particularly well, and, frustratingly, the director's stamp isn’t overwhelming. Zhao is known for assuming writing and editing duties for her movies as well as having a large say in the visual feel and the lack of her touch in those areas is noticeable (in fact, some of the editing is simply poor). The drawn-out narrative fails to soar and the attempt to create a slower, pensive, character-driven piece buckles under the pedestrian pacing, heavy exposition, and frankly uninteresting characters - Zhao’s ability to bring real humanity and raw authenticity to her work is absent here which, to be fair, could be expected given the subjects and characters.  Through the vast amount of character interaction and conversations (not an unwelcome addition), Eternals strives to deliver a deep, existential experience when, in reality, there’s nothing here that will trigger any deep reflective thoughts other than to affirm that humans are essentially awful. Another plate to spin for Zhao was the introduction of so many new characters, and, whilst the cast is stacked with talent, only Kumail Nanjiani, Barry Keoghan, Angelina Jolie, and Harish Patel shine – the latter narrowly avoiding some ill-advised stereotyping. The rest aren’t bad but there is no real spark or charisma surrounding them. What Eternals does boast are some dazzling landscapes and expansive shots that create a sense of scope and awe. Whilst some of the CGI is janky, the natural shots look great. Unsurprisingly, Ramin Djawadi delivers a score full of gravitas and emotion, it’s just a shame the movie could not follow suit. With the talents of Zhao and the wonderfully diverse and talented cast, I was optimistic for Eternals (despite not being sold on the trailers) but I came out disappointed having witnessed an imbalanced, slightly messy, uninspiring, and sadly boring slog. How the MCU builds upon this will be interesting, but hopefully, they do it better. At the grand age of 91, Clint Eastwood is still going strong in front of and behind the camera, and his latest movie, Cry Macho, sees him take the lead role and direct once again – though this is mooted to be his final role. The movie sees his character, Mike, a grizzled old rodeo star tasked with retrieving his employer's son Rafo (Minett) from his alcoholic mother Leta (Urrejola) in Mexico and returning him back to the US. It is standard modern-Eastwood stuff, not too dissimilar from recent dud The Mule, where his old dog of a character must learn to connect with those around him. Though Eastwood has no problem crafting a beautiful-looking movie with a melancholy atmosphere, there is not a lot else to admire in Cry Macho. The characters are uninteresting, bar Natalia Traven’s Marta who injects a dash of life into proceedings, and Eastwood possibly wasn’t the best choice for the lead role. He is simply fine when emoting or monologuing, but the smatterings of action are painfully shot and edited to hide his limitations to the point of being genuinely jarring. That along with his character being a sex symbol for women a third of his age was just plain weird. It’s not his finest hour. Cry Macho is strongest when it concentrates on the relationship between Mike and Rafo and less so the contrived and uninteresting pursuit from Leta’s goons, a subplot that was present to insert stakes but one that does just the opposite. It’s by no means a bad movie, it’s just painstakingly average and one that proves Eastwood’s talents are now better suited to being behind the camera. Not exclusively bad, certainly not great or memorable, Cry Macho simply exists. Pablo Larraín’s Jackie was great. Featuring a fine performance from Natalie Portman as Jackie Kennedy, it provided a haunting psychological insight of a woman thrust into a startling moment of history. For his latest biographical drama, Spencer, Larraín is tackling another slice of time featuring a similarly iconic woman who spent most of her life in the glare of the public eye and one who faced more than her fair share of hurdles and sadness – the late Princess Diana. With Kristen Stewart in the titular role, Spencer is a self-proclaimed fable telling the story of Diana’s life in the immediate lead-up to her separation from Prince Charles (Farthing). The account takes place from Christmas Eve to Boxing Day in 1991 and we bear witness to the mental and physical anguish that Diana went through as the pressure and scrutiny from the press and, indeed, the Royals themselves piled on. At this point in her life, Diana wanted out of her marriage (Charles’ affair with Camilla is touched upon), she wanted to be the best mother to her children but had to contend with the smothering Royals and their dogmatic, suffocating lust for tradition. That said, Spencer does not act or exist as a ‘hit job’ on the monarchy – they aren’t presented as evil as much as Diana isn’t presented as entirely affable. Instead, Larraín opts for another psychological drama, but, whereas Jackie stumbled at points, it felt accessible enough, Spencer is a much colder movie. The characters are all presented in a very stand-offish manner and, at times, it’s hard to really feel connected whilst being held at arm's length. Some of this is certainly due to the overly lavish and detached existence the Royals lead but there are moments within Spencer that are far more human (the obvious intention) and allow for some excellent moments. Sequences with Diana and the young Princes William (Nielen) and Harry (Spry) provide warmth, humour, and a relatability whilst a wonderfully delivered beach sequence with Sally Hawkins’ Maggie (Diana’s trusted dresser) is another high point in a movie that struggles to break free of monotony and a sometimes-meandering narrative. As Diana, Stewart delivers a good performance. She looks the part and her mannerisms felt genuine, but she didn’t sound like Diana, the dramatic whispering that she adopted certainly matched the fabled nature but was frustratingly distracting at times (special mention to Timothy Spall who was great in a pivotal supporting role.) Unsurprisingly, the era is captured excellently, the early-90s being resurrected efficiently despite the muted visual palette, and Jonny Greenwood once again delivers an intricate and effective score which only furthers the feeling of mild disappointment with Spencer overall. It’s an extremely competent movie with plenty of positives, but, as previously mentioned, the distant atmosphere hinders Spencer. At times it’s touching and at others, it’s very on the nose (a poorly executed metaphor about pheasants and allusions to Anne Boleyn also...) but it never felt truly balanced or enticing. As the world’s largest streaming service, Netflix probably has a few quid to burn in their back pockets so why not spend some on assembling an expensive trio to head up your latest attempt at creating a decent movie? Well, in terms of assembling an expensive cast, it turns out this is just what they have done for Red Notice – a heist comedy starring Dwayne Johnson, Ryan Reynolds, and Gal Gadot. On the face of it, the trio and the premise seemed like a good fit but then, most things can seem great early doors. The truth is the three leads make the whole effort worthwhile because, without their charm and magnetism, Red Notice would have been awful. Instead, it is simply average. Everyone looks like they are enjoying themselves, safe in the knowledge that their bank balances received a sizeable increase for participating in what would be labelled an ‘exhibition’ in sporting terms. Johnson’s burly cop John Hartley and Reynolds’ art thief Nolan Booth gel effectively and Gadot is bubbly and competent as Booth’s equal/competitor, however, Ritu Arya’s Interpol agent Urvashi Das was frankly terrible. Given the talent, of course, there are some good gags but one of the fundamental issues is that they are smothered in throwaway improv jokes. This can work in smaller doses but there were times when Red Notice simply felt as if it were being made up on the fly. When you combine this with the fact that there are far too many attempts at twists, shocks, and reveals, the movie spends a lot of time suffering because of its strange writing process (or lack of). ALSO factor in that it looks cheap as hell and...well...you get the picture (the poorly dressed sound stage in the climactic scenes barely attempted to disguise itself). Inversely, some of the action is well choreographed and the first half is arguably very solid before it crumbles under the weight of its own silliness and overreach. Red Notice isn’t quite the success Netflix would have been banking on for one of their biggest releases of the year even if it isn’t entirely awful. It isn’t far off though, and it can thank its lead trio for barely keeping it afloat. I’ll start this off by saying I’m a big Ghostbusters fan. It wouldn’t be a stretch to say that bustin’ makes me feel good. My hopes were high for Ghostbusters: Afterlife and this comes from someone who doesn’t dislike either Paul Feig’s 2016’s version or Ghostbusters II - I didn’t approach this as a last throw of the dice for a dying franchise. Directed by Jason Reitman (son of the original two movie's director, Ivan), Afterlife takes place in present-day Oklahoma, far from the streets of New York, and sees the descendants of Egon Spengler (the late, great Harold Ramis) inherit the former Ghostbuster’s derelict farmhouse following his demise in order to obtain much-needed funds required to kickstart their lives. Callie (Coon) bears no love for her estranged father whilst her children, Phoebe (Grace) and Trevor (Wolfhard), know nothing about the man who once saved New York City...twice. When strange earthquakes begin and bustin’ is required, the kids, alongside local podcaster...Podcast (Kim) and diner-worker Lucky (O’Connor), must band together to prevent the ultimate evil from returning. After the wait and anticipation, I was relieved that Afterlife delivered and, in fact, over-delivered for me in most areas. It acts as a pure love letter to the 1984 movie and that’s not a bad thing at all - however, the cries of many that fan service destroys the movie is folly, I’m a fan, I felt serviced, and that’s OK...nostalgia isn’t a dirty idea. For a film that is dealing with legacies, why not honour the series legacy? The story functions well enough to pay homage to the old and introduce the new which Afterlife does effectively but with some exceptions. Trevor and Lucky feel very much like bit-players against the terrific Mckenna Grace and great supporting roles from Coon and Rudd. The first half takes its time to introduce the characters and the new Spielberg-esque setting and the restraint is welcome for a movie that could have gone in full throttle from the get-go but decided to allow for a build-up. Things ramp up when the ghosts need bustin’ leading to the also-restrained finale (another welcome choice) and it would be foolish not to acknowledge the similarities to the 1984 version but it’s also necessary to state that Afterlife isn’t a reboot or carbon copy. It serves as an homage as mentioned but there’s enough here to stand alone (moving from New York City was a major change). Returning characters are treated with respect and don’t feel as if they are peddled out cheaply - if the movie is good, as Afterlife is, then the surprises/fan moments feel like treats - which only adds to the warm tone of the movie. Afterlife also pays tribute to Ramis in a way that felt well-handled but also emotionally satisfying (tears were shed) and a lot of that is due to the fact that Reitman, Gil Kenan, and crew allowed the movie to grow and develop to afford these moments greater weight. The score from Rob Simonsen helped in that respect too, however, at times it did feel as if it leaned very heavily on the original score. Ghostbusters: Afterlife isn’t a perfect movie, it has bumps along the road that Ecto-1 must navigate, but it delivered so much to this fan. The story is solid, the performances are mostly great, the majority of the comedy clicked, visually the movie is appealing and the fan moments were fist-pumpingly good. Call it fate, call it luck, call it karma, call it whatever - Ghostbusters: Afterlife is a fun, fan-pleasing, and surprisingly emotional ride. It’s an endearing tribute to what came before and I loved it. Lin-Manuel Miranda has been a busy boy over the past few years. The phenomenal success of Hamilton allowed for Miranda to leave his scent all over 2021 - his production In the Heights receiving a cinematic adaptation alongside him taking the lead role in Vivo and various writing credits on Encanto. However, Tick,Tick...Boom! represents his first foray into film direction as he depicts the story of prodigious playwright Jonathan Larson in all its triumph and tragedy. Larson was a man with a furious focus and determination and TTB doesn’t shy away from showing him at his most destructive, how his linear vision affected his relationship, life and, indeed, career - and it's portrayed by a terrific leading performance from Andrew Garfield (who knew that guy could sing?!). Garfield plumbs the depths of his emotions to deliver a performance racked with depth and nuance whilst capturing Larson’s passion excellently and it may just be his finest work to date. Not to be overshadowed, Robin de Jesús as Michael delivers the emotional heartbeat of the movie and the reveal surrounding him late on was a devastating rug pull that fuelled Larson’s thematic and societal writings that included Tick, Tick...Boom! and Rent. For what she has to work with, Alexandra Shipp is very decent and lends her voice to one of the movie's better songs and performances (alongside Vanessa Hudgens). Miranda has a knack for writing and staging great songs and TTB is no different. Not all of the songs are great (looking at you Sunday and Therapy) and not all of the choreography is stellar (...looking at you Sunday and Therapy) but bangers such as 30/90, Play Game and Why far outshine the efforts that don’t quite hit the heights. By presenting the narrative in a slightly unconventional manner, Miranda allows for the gonzo spirit of the story and Larson himself to really come to life whilst still permitting for moments of genuine emotion and sadness (of which there are surprisingly many) - there’s a real Broadway feeling to the movie in terms of structure, settings, framing and performance which will delight those with a penchant for the theatrical. Tick, Tick...Boom! is another example of the talent Miranda possesses and also provides an exquisite showcase for the abilities of Andrew Garfield. Toe-tappingly good. Sordid. Filthy. Controversial. Criminal. OK that’s enough about the accents unleashed throughout House of Gucci, Ridley Scott’s bio-drama on the life and murder of Gucci majority shareholder Maurizio Gucci orchestrated by his estranged ex-wife Patrizia. The chequered history of the Gucci brand is anything but conventional and it’s fair to say that House of Gucci follows suit. It’s pure soap opera madness at times, highly entertaining for the most part, but there are lulls scattered throughout it’s overly-stretched runtime - it’s Ridley, it’s going to be long, we know that, but it doesn’t need to be. The story begins with the fated lovers first meeting, through their marriage and eventually messy divorce as Patrizia’s lust for money and power distorts the company hierarchy and mentality of Maurizio (who is no saints, either) and the evolution of the two central ‘characters’ is highly intriguing. Lady Gaga plays the villain of the piece deliciously, full of seduction and death stares whilst Driver is reliably excellent as the self-effacing heir who harbors no desire to take up the mantle. It’s Jared Leto’s pantomime turn as the eccentric sibling, Paolo, that stands out horribly. There is an element of camp permeating every scene, however, Leto cranks it up and it’s frankly distracting. Additionally, the era-appropriate music lends a helping hand to the camp aspect sitting alongside dramatic operatic pieces that amplify the theatrics of it all. It’s that tonal mismatch which, at times, threatens to derail the movie. There’s a lingering feeling that Scott couldn’t quite land on a tone that he fancied so instead just went for broke - you could say that the extravagance and bizarreness surrounding Gucci required a similar narrative feel, however, House of Gucci does suffer from that lack of required vision. A special mention must go to the movie’s editor Claire Simpson who elevated many scenes and had some fun with some mischievous editing. House of Gucci is by no means a bad movie because of its flaws, in fact, it’s very good mainly thanks to Gaga’s brazenly big performance and the seedy machinations that unfurl throughout with just a hint of winking to the audience. It may not be Ridley’s best but it certainly is entertaining.",NEUTRAL
"Nov 8, 2021"," Hot off her extraordinary success with the Oscar-winning Nomadland, director Chloé Zhao orchestrates the latest entry in Marvel’s supersized superhero series. Producer Kevin Feige has said that Eternals will forever change the Marvel Cinematic Universe, promising an epic scope and scale hitherto unseen in the long-running saga. The Eternals are an ancient race of guardians, bidden by a collective called Celestials to protect the Earth from the Deviants: monsters from deep space who threaten to destroy all life. Led by Ajak (Salma Hayek), the Eternals have protected humanity for centuries, waiting to be called home to Olympia. But all is not as it seems, and our heroes, spread across the globe, are to learn there is more to their Earth-bound mission than they thought. It’s up to Sersi (Gemma Chan), Ikarus (Richard Madden), and their disparate friends to uncover the mystery and stop a threat much greater than the deviants. The MCU has long been criticised for the drabness of its visuals, from the washed-out colour palettes in supposedly colourful worlds to uninspired action sequences shot by second units. Uber-producer Feige clearly sees Zhao as his secret weapon against the charge of mediocre cinematic vision. And it works, up to a point. Damning with faint praise, perhaps, but there’s no doubt that Eternals is far and away the best-looking entry in the MCU to date, helped in no small part by the decision – fought for by Zhao – to shoot on location. The richness and texture that Zhao brought to The Rider and Nomadland’s landscapes is in evidence here, from a key scene’s ranch in dusk-lit South Dakota to the climactic showdown on a beach, aptly framed by an erupting volcano and a sleeping, gargantuan terror. The promised epic scope is delivered too, with a story that spans millennia and offers glimpses of the Celestials, billion-year-old gods the size of continents who control the ebb and flow of life in the Universe. Against this backdrop, even Thanos and his infinity stones seems like small stuff. So why, then, does Eternals never feel as gargantuan as it should? Why does its nearly two-hour and 40 minute runtime feel padded and meandering when it should feel full and expansive? Part of the problem is in rooting all the key action in the present, which leads the frequent flashbacks to Ancient Mesopotamia or Babylon just feeling like exposition dumps, grinding the present day story to a halt. The present day sequences fare better – especially when the film allows itself to slow down, but only fitfully. The trappings of Zhao’s signature style are there, and indeed there are a handful of shots comparable to the evocative compositions of her other work, but too impatient is the film to get us to the next bit of exposition that it ever allows us to just feel what is on screen. Dangling plot points, limited chemistry between the cast and a superfluous love interest existing purely to set up a sequel all distract from Zhao’s touted visuals. Compounding the problem is Eternal’s drab, off-the-shelf score, which always seems to interject just at the moment an authentic emotion threatens to keep us in the moment, telling us precisely what we’re supposed to be feeling instead of just letting us, you know, feel it. There is a great deal to admire about Eternals: on the surface at least it really does feel different from much of the rest of Marvel’s output and the film makes a game gesture towards an interesting ethical quandary about what the greater good means on a cosmic scale, while the uniformly god-tier gorgeous cast bring a heap of talent, humour and pathos to their colourful roles. Twenty-odd films in, the studio remains about the best there is at what it does: even a middling entry is still going to be a broadly enjoyable and entertaining ride. Eternals should be commended for the positive creative decisions it has taken and in allowing at least some of Zhao’s directorial vision to creep in. For all its flaws, it is far from the worst entry in the MCU, but it is, perhaps, the first of Marvel’s films to be less than the sum of its parts.",NEUTRAL
"Nov 8, 2021"," Expectations were high from the start for ""Eternals,"" the latest installment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's explosive fourth phase, and not just because the movie has been widely marketed as ""different"" from the usual fight scene and explosion-heavy Marvel flick. The hype around ""Eternals"" also benefited tremendously from the allure of Chloé Zhao as director, fresh off her Oscar win for ""Nomadland"" earlier this year, and with her well-earned reputation for magically bringing to life the stories of everyday people. It also didn't hurt that the cast of ""Eternals"" was stacked, featuring big names ranging from hunky ""Game of Thrones"" alums to Hollywood titans like Angelina Jolie and Salma Hayek. To that end, ""Eternals"" certainly lives up to the promise of being unlike other Marvel projects — but it falls short of living up to the rest of the hype. Picking up shortly after the events of ""Avengers: Endgame,"" a group of supernatural beings known as Eternals must reunite to confront a new threat to humanity after spending hundreds of years apart. The Eternals were originally brought to Earth thousands of years ago by even more powerful, god-like, intergalactic beings known as Celestials, with the purpose of hunting down reptilian-like monsters called Deviants. Furthermore, the Eternals were instructed to never interfere with human affairs — including the recent battles against Thanos..  But even after destroying all Deviants, the Eternals remain on Earth, waiting for their next orders from their Celestial master Arishem (voiced by David Kaye), and trying to blend in as ordinary people along the way. Over the course of their time on Earth, spent periodically traveling to new civilizations to avoid suspicion about why they don't age, they bear witness to some of the most defining moments of human history, from landmark innovations like irrigation and the wheel, to devastating wars and disasters. Zhao's cinematography takes us on a resplendent, brightly colored journey through time, space and human civilization, all while delivering what Instagram influencers might call golden hour-galore: sunlit shots over pyramids, rivers, mountains, fields and charming little ancient villages. The Eternals comprise Ajak (Hayek), their leader and maternal figure; Sersi (Gemma Chan), who has the ability to manipulate cosmic energy and change matter; Ikaris (Richard Madden), the strongest of the Eternals; Thena (Jolie), the beautiful but troubled goddess of war; Gilgamesh (Don Lee), who has what can only be described as super-strength, and acts as Thena's protector; Druig (Barry Keoghan), who has the power to control people's minds; Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), who can shoot lasers from his hands and takes on the lofty task of providing much of the movie's comedic relief; Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), who has super speed and, like Ridloff, is deaf; Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), a literal tech wizard and the MCU's first openly gay superhero; and Sprite (Lia McHugh), a tricky illusionist trapped in an adolescent girl's body.  Some of the Eternals have adjusted to life among humans more smoothly than others. Sersi in particular develops a deep love and kinship with humanity and Earth, as a teacher at London's National History Museum. Thena, on the other hand, begins to suffer from an existential sort of mental illness that can come with being an immortal being. But when Deviants mysteriously reappear on Earth, the Eternals must reunite for the first time since a devastating event pushed them apart hundreds of years ago, for a race against time to save the planet they've grown to love. In many ways, what it means to be human is the central question that drives ""Eternals,"" as our heroes struggle to reckon with what makes this planet worth saving, and who and what they really are beyond soldiers sent by the all-powerful Celestials. But the movie's dizzying star power and twisty backstories render it too clunky and overstuffed to concisely answer said central question.  The Eternals watch as over time, humans commit shockingly atrocious and shockingly gracious acts, and come to understand that humanity's mistakes, bonds, and ability to evolve are what make them human. It's a beautiful message, especially as the exciting diversity of the cast speaks volumes about the breadth and range of humanity in its own way. Unfortunately, this uplifting message about humanity gets lost, somewhere between trying to remember who has what superpowers, what the Deviants want, and the chronologies of varying flashbacks.  None of this is to say ""Eternals"" doesn't have its bright spots. In some ways, the movie draws its strengths and weaknesses from the same source: its large, brilliantly talented cast. Henry's Phastos may not be the main protagonist of ""Eternals,"" but his cynicism and heartbreak with the ways humanity has weaponized innovation ground the movie in reality more deeply than many other Marvel projects. From Hiroshima to Facebook's role in elections, we continue to witness and struggle with the devastating pitfalls of technology every day. As Phastos, Henry's alternating performances of intense emotion and subdued pessimism mirror our own conflicting feelings about living through what feels at times like the end of days.  Chan's Sersi is decisively the main protagonist of ""Eternals,"" and stands out as a promising and triumphant new leader in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Her devotion, compassion and uncertainty with her own leadership and powers make her one of the most relatable members of the MCU's growing roster of feminist superheroes. But while Sersi is the heart and emotional core of ""Eternals,"" she's well supported by other immortal scene-stealers. As Kingo, Nanjiani begins to fill the void of humor, wit and charisma left by the late Tony Stark, with the zesty, added twist of plentiful Bollywood references, and a dazzling Bollywood dance number that joyfully reminds us the age of all-white superheroes is over. Kingo's banter and charming obsession with image and self-promotion help ""Eternals"" along as it suffers at times under the weight of its heavy, existential themes. Opposite Kingo, Jolie's resonant performance of Thena offers a convincing portrayal of mental illness and guilt. Those who struggle with trauma and loss can relate to Thena's simultaneous aloofness and intense vulnerability, stemming from distrust of herself and her own power.  Ridloff as the charming, witty and determinedly independent Makkari is destined to be a new MCU fan favorite. Makkari's deafness is neither treated as unimportant, nor made into a focal point that otherizes and dehumanizes her, as many well-meaning portrayals of characters with disabilities often do. Her deafness is instead treated as a beautifully normal part of who both Makkari and Ridloff are.  Ultimately, brilliant performances from a dynamic cast can't save ""Eternals"" from its rushed, almost claustrophobic conclusion, during which a number of characters' actions and decisions either feel illogical or inconsistent with everything else we've seen from them. It's not unusual for MCU films to end with cliffhangers or direct setups for sequels and future Marvel projects, but the conclusion of ""Eternals"" hardly feels like a conclusion at all — it's more like a rapid, congested sequence of awkwardly choreographed fight scenes, and revelations that leave audiences with more questions than answers. Since ""Avengers: Endgame"" marked the end of the road for some of the most beloved heroes of the MCU, Phase 4 has focused largely on exploring who will fill the voids they've left. ""Eternals"" stands out as a triumph for diverse storytelling and representation, but its depth and pace are severely hindered by the same cast and outstanding star power that give the movie its spark. Still, ""Eternals"" lays exciting groundwork that hints at just how enormous and unexplored the rapidly expanding multiverse is, and also introduces us to some of the MCU's most charming and nuanced new heroes yet.  Kylie Cheung is a staff writer at Salon covering culture.

"Nov 8, 2021"," One thing that really surprised me about Eternals was the film’s choice of pop-culture references, and other coincidences that were just kind of amusing for various reasons. I really enjoyed Eternals despite it being too long, and one of the reasons was the humor. Another was just that it felt kind of quirky and different from most Marvel movies these days. In the MCU it’s very common now for characters to talk about Iron Man or Captain America or Spider-Man because these are all superheroes that exist in this fictional reality. They’re not comic book characters, they’re actual flesh-and-blood people (and aliens) who are basically the world’s biggest celebrities (something Amazon’s The Boys leans with dark parody). Both Superman and Batman are brought up during Eternals, and I’m not sure about this but I don’t think any other MCU film has so brazenly referenced DC characters like this before. I had always assumed that in the fictional MCU’s reality, DC characters and comics just didn’t exist at all. In a world with Captain Marvel you don’t expect to hear about Wonder Woman; in a world with Tony Stark you don’t expect to hear about Bruce Wayne. This surprised me, though not in a bad way. I just found it curious. But in Eternals, Kumail Nanjiani’s character Kingo is also a Bollywood mega-star and he has a valet named Karun (Harish Patel) and when he reveals his job another character says “Oh, like Alfred?” which is a reference to Batman’s butler in the DC comics and films. These actors played Jon Snow and Robb Stark respectively in Thrones, half-brothers of the North and sons of Ned Stark. They play Dane Whitman and Ikaris respectively in Eternals, and both have a romantic relationship with Gemma Chan’s character whose name is—hilariously—Sersi. This is all out of the comics, of course, but when you have Jon Snow and Robb Stark telling someone named Sersi “I love you” it’s pretty damn funny for anyone who watched or read Game Of Thrones. In GoT, Cersei Lannister is one of the most diabolical, vile and cruel villains in the Seven Kingdoms; and of course Cersei and Sersi sound exactly the same. In fact, the very first sex scene in the MCU takes place between an actor best known for his role as Robb Stark and a female space god named Sersi. That cracks me up. Eternals is a slower, more brooding film than most MCU entries—though End Game was pretty bleak at times. But it still has lots of comic relief. All the Bollywood scenes with Kingo were hilarious, as were his and Karun’s attempts to make a documentary about the Eternals’ new fight against a resurgent Deviant menace. And of course, there was that Harry Styles cameo. Styles plays Eros, the diminutive brother of Thanos, and is accompanied by Pip the Troll, voiced by comedian Patton Oswalt. Quite a few people in the theater screamed and cheered over this scene. I had no idea there were so many Patton Oswalt fans out there! I also loved how the toughest of the Eternals, the group’s muscle, Gilgamesh (Don Lee), was actually just a big softie who likes to cook and bake and make beer with his own saliva, all while taking care of his mentally ill girlfriend, Thena (Angelina Jolie).

"Nov 8, 2021"," Myth, legend, and theology come together like they never have before in Marvel’s newest entry, Eternals. Academy Award-winning director Chloé Zhao brings her intimate, personal style of storytelling to cinema’s most sprawling universe, introducing new characters and new ideas to the familiar franchise. The Eternals are a race of immortal beings from Olympia who were sent to Earth some 7000 years ago to protect humans from a rival race of mutants known as Deviants — strange, sinewy creatures that look like both something from very far in the past and very far in the future. Over the centuries and millennia, the Eternals have fulfilled their mission to protect the world from Deviants while witnessing mankind descend into war and famine, chaos and pain of their own making. But the Eternals have loved them anyway, walking among them, inspiring myths and legends as they wait for the call that their work is done and it is time to return home.  Zhao, whose films tend toward quietly introspective portraits from middle America, was an unlikely choice to helm a big, green-screened, action/fantasy franchise movie. And while the hallmarks of her usual work are absent (for instance, her cast is full of Hollywood stars rather than non-professional actors), we still glimpse some of the elements that make Zhao’s films feel so definably hers. As the centuries unfold, the team of Eternals goes on to live their own mostly separate lives, scattered to the winds, some clinging to the memories of what used to be when they were all together. Their love for humanity only grows with the rise and fall of each civilization and they keep themselves somewhat tethered between what once was and what is to come. Where the script is overburdened with exposition and a sometimes sluggish pace, the cast is beautifully assembled and watching these ten new heroes work together and apart and back together again is a delightful odyssey.  There is plenty to be said about the two biggest stars,  Salma Hayak’s Ajak, the Prime Eternal who leads them, and Angelina Jolie who plays Thena, who is suffering from “Mahd Wy’ry” (pronounced “mad weary”), a debilitating and dangerous condition caused by too many memories. But the beating heart of this ensemble is Gemma Chan, whose Sersi loves deeper and more fully than any of the others could. As Sersi begins to grow and change, so too do we see an evolution in Chan who moves from supporting player to a leading lady in her own right.  There are two men vying for Sersi’s heart. Her former flame and fellow Eternal Ikaris (Richard Madden), and her current beau Dane Whitman (Kit Harington), a mortal Londoner who works at the Natural Museum of History. Ikaris is her past and in many ways present. Dane is a symbol of the life she could have if only she can let go. Dane fades into the background as the Eternals face a new threat, but even when he’s gone from the screen, he always feels like a lingering presence, a whispering to Sersi that she needs to make some decisions. Some of the cast of this big ensemble may stand out a bit more than others, but no one is fighting over the spotlight. Brian Tyree Henry delights every time he is back onscreen, his Phastos always wanting to give human technological evolution a little nudge. He now lives the quiet, suburban life with his husband (Haaz Sleiman) and their inquisitive son (Esai Daniel Cross) and he doesn’t want anything — especially not his old friends — disrupting that. Lauren Ridloff’s Makkari, blessed with superspeed, is charming and funny, and also the MCU’s first deaf character. Kumail Nanjiani plays Kingo, a wisecracking Bollywood star who would give Deadpool a run for his money if the two ever got together. Lia McHugh is Sprite, Don Lee is Gilgamesh and Barry Keoghan is Druig, all three with different goals and dreams, but all three are much more compassionate and caring than they might seem. Despite the action and the visual effects, there’s little to remind us that this is a Marvel movie. Apart from a passing mention of Dr. Strange and the leaderless Avengers, and a bit of exposition involving Thanos’ genocide (mercifully not called “The Blip” here), not only do the Eternals keep themselves out of the general affairs of humankind, but the film also keeps itself at a distance from the 25 that came before it. For this reason, some diehard fans may feel it’s not a “real” Marvel movie or that it doesn’t fit. But in setting itself apart from the others, it serves as a curious addition to the collection and an exciting peek into the future of the franchise. It is a future more reflective of the world we live in, with grander ideas and new types of storytelling. In that way, Eternals is an exciting next step in a franchise that may just go on forever.

"Nov 8, 2021", Welcome to the SiftSwift! A quick no frills movie review for current movies! Does Eternals feel like a movie that will last through the ages or does it just feel like a movie that actually DOES lasts through the ages? Here’s a few thoughts!,NEUTRAL
"Nov 8, 2021"," Why am I here? What is my purpose? Who am I… really? These are essential questions in life and if you stop to think about it, they’re also the backbone of practically every superhero origin story. A hero discovers their gift. Grapples with how to use it and what kind of person they are and what kind of hero they can be.  With great power comes great responsibility. Etcetera. The reaction to Marvel’s Eternals suggests that it’s the first “spiritual” or “existential” superhero film which is, quite frankly, the opposite of the truth.  Where did this impression come from? Perhaps it’s only that most superhero films asks these questions in a less “I’m asking these questions!” kind of way. Or, even when they're obvious about the questions, they quickly jump back into the action setpieces. Eternals wants to be more of a sober meditation but it can’t reconcile the weightiness of contemplation with the weightlessness of frequent CGI action setpieces... Icarus and Sersi are in love. They are the first and last Marvel superheroes to have sex because the sex scene took place 1000s of years ago. The basic premise goes like so: Eternals are immortal godlike beings who serve Celestials, other immortal godlike beings, and are assigned to a planet to protect it from The Deviants (beasts so deadly they can sometimes outmatch the gods). Otherwise the Eternals aren’t supposed to interfere. (There are many flashbacks to ancient history in which they do interfere making the awkward exposition scene about their rules and why they didn’t interfere with Thanos's snap a particularly clumsy bit of Marvel-Machine nonsense!) These particular Eternals are praiseworthy for being the most diverse group of super heroes we’ve ever seen on film. Their superpowers though are considerably more homogeneous. They all are super strong. They all are immortal. They all seem to be able to either shoot lasers or manipulate energy in some way. So let’s take them in the order we enjoyed them most: super fast Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), mind-controlling Druig (Barry Keoghan), warrior goddess Thena (Angelina Jolie), super strong Gilgamesh (Ma Dong-seok), Superman like Icarus (Richard Madden), inventor Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), energy manipulator Sersi (Gemma Chan, the ostensible lead of the film), illusion-master Sprite (Lia McHugh), healer and team leader Ajak (Salma Hayek), Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), and wise-cracking Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani). Why is Kingo last? Well, he gets a musical number as a Bollywood star and I wish I could say it was a highlight (i live for musical numbers in film!) but Nanjiani’s winking 'isn't this silly?' performance felt vaguely insulting since Bollywood stars are infinitely better dancers than this.  But back to plot (ever so briefly). These particular Eternals have been with us for thousands of years and have basically retired from super-powering when the Deviants suddenly reappear. But why? The team reunites to face their old foes only to have the rug pulled out from them in a very existential “have we been doing life wrong?” kind of way. Cue epic chaos and fate of the world stakes because you always have to get there in superhero films. I watched it last night. Such an endless bore. And the interior scenes are so dark you can hardly see the faces of the actors. I just saw it and while I enjoyed it.  I will agree to the fact that it was seriously flawed as I think it wanted to be more than just a Marvel film which I have no problem with.  I think the problem is that it wanted to be a Marvel film and an art film of sorts and it didn't mesh well.  I think it spent too much time on exposition and trying to get all of the characters together and not enough time in just establishing them as a whole. I liked parts and I think its a good effort at something grander, but it is very long and the final act is all a bit much. Still, I prefer its ambition to the Tom Holland Spider-Man movies or Thor The Dark World among others. The one thing at a time critique strikes me as maybe a challenge someone like Chloe Zhao had. Her films have always been written by her, so I wonder if she just has trouble thinking through all the layers in a story developed by someone else? That's an incredibly difficult skill for a director and there are only a few directors who regularly do both. Maybe she's better off sticking to directing things she's written herself.  Eternals is a messy movie but I enjoyed it. I have watched all of the MCU movies (have not re-watched them, I'm not a fanboy) and they follow the same formula, therefore, sooner or later, you're bored out of your wits. When I watched Black Widow I thought ""why do I keep spending good money on mediocre movies?"" Shang-Chi made me feel the same way.  And then Eternals comes along and it's somehow off-beat when you compare it to all of the other Marvel movies. Thor: Ragnarok is probably second. Saw it and liked it, but it's definitely a complicated film to take in. I appreciate that Zhao and co did try to do SOMETHING different, but I also think servicing 10+ (new!) characters over 7000+ years is just an IMPOSSIBLE task. My biggest issue for me was the lack of momentum. IT seemed we were still on Act 1 after 75% of the movie's runtime. That said, I'm so glad you mentioned the expressive chemistry between Ridloff and Keoghan. I *loved* their characters and together, as brief and seldom as it was, they were magic. I do have to disagree about your thoughts on Kingo (his banter with his valet was a highlight for me) and especially on Kumail's ""winking 'isn't this silly' performance"" because I think he was just channeling lead Bollywood actors (see Shah Rukh Khan) who do the same thing. Ryan -- yeah, maybe i'm too harsh on him. I did like his interactions with his employee. And yes Act 1 is forever. I'm like ""get to the story!""",NEGATIVE
"Nov 8, 2021"," Now the masses have been schooled in Eternals, the latest super-powered adventure through space and time that layers a whole new mythology onto the Marvel Cinematic Universe and introduces eight or 10 major characters. It's a lot to take in, and if given an Eternals pop quiz, it’s likely that most viewers — including this reviewer — would flunk it. Even MCU completists are likely to leave the film with their heads spinning from the onslaught of new heroes and information — and not exactly in a hurry to sort it out. That shrug response comes as a major surprise, especially with a likable cast and reigning Best Director winner Chloé Zhao (Nomadland; The Rider) behind the camera. However, beyond a few scenes shot in her go-to setting of South Dakota, her mark isn’t present on this overlong, frequently dull film. Nevertheless, she juggles the movie's many plot threads and characters reasonably well, partly thanks to at least three versions of the screenplay with four credited writers, the final script by Zhao alone. The whole thing boils down fairly simply: A group of about 10 immortals, each with a different superpower, was sent to Earth 5,000 years ago to guard humanity against some CG-standard tooth-and-claw monsters called Deviants. Since the Eternals believed the Deviants were all defeated 500 or so years ago, they split up and blended into different human communities around the globe. Then the Deviants come back, and the Eternals regroup, eventually learning that their mission has a darker side. It’s a fine basic premise, but the whole “getting the band back together” approach takes forever. Fellow 2021 release Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (132 minutes) set a new record for longest MCU introductory chapter and mostly warrants the length, but Eternals’ 157 proves excessive and unearned. Mixed in there is one of the most drawn-out info dumps from a modern comic book film — and even with the padded runtime, it’s difficult to have a good sense for who any of these characters are. Nevertheless, a few make their mark, namely Marvel’s first gay superhero, inventor Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry, Atlanta) — who even gets to kiss his husband onscreen — and Sersi (Gemma Chan), whose struggles with cosmic morality make her as close to a protagonist as we get. The bigger names — Salma Hayak as Ajak and Angelina Jolie as Thena — do their best to project star power from less developed roles. Elsewhere, Kumail Nanjiani is his usual hilarious self as Kingo, who's spent the last century posing as multiple generations of Bollywood stars, and Harish Patel earns plenty of laughs as his trusted assistant Karun, who's in on the Eternals' secret. But the draggy pace, Superman stand-in — prototype, technically — Ikaris (Richard Madden, Game of Thrones), and other elements makes it feel like Marvel’s first DCEU movie. Though the special effects work is impressive and clearly the next step up the MCU’s technical ladder, and there's a decent amount of MCU-style humor in this, er, MCU film, the lack of a worthy narrative makes it feel like a clunky new direction for the studio.",NEGATIVE
"Nov 8, 2021"," Gorgeous and vacant, “The Eternals” is the most numbing entry in Marvel’s 13-year-old MCU franchise — even as it struggles to be its weirdest and most philosophical. An Oscar-winning director (Chloé Zhao of 2020’s “Nomadland”) and exciting ensemble cast are no match for corporate demands in the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe, which is clearly building to another Infinity Saga-style climax after 25-odd movies. But Disney isn’t necessarily to blame for the movie’s Swiss-cheese plot holes, oppressive cinematography and flat delivery (of everything, including action sequences). That’s on the filmmakers. Set throughout modern human history, “The Eternals,” opening on Nov. 5, stars a diverse ensemble as the title-beings, with most of the focus on the slight, stoic Sersi (Gemma Chan) and similarly fleet, expressionless Ikaris (Richard Madden). Their fellow Eternals — a.k.a. super-powerful buildings living secretly on Earth for the last 7,000 years — are led in their shiny, form-fitting suits by Ajak (Salma Hayek), who also lords over Thena (Angelina Jolie), Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), Sprite (Lia McHugh), Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), Gilgamesh (Don Lee) and Druig (Barry Keoghan). Add to that a hunky love interest (“Game of Thrones” co-star Kit Harington as Dane Whitman, who will soon become the MCU’s Black Knight), a comic-relief Harish Patel (as Kingo’s manager, Karun) and other gods and monsters, and you’ve got a mess of script. And yet Zhao at least gets this part right, giving all characters their due as they grapple with orders from their celestial, Marvel-demigod master, Arishem (David Kaye), who first dispatched the Eternals to Earth to defeat the Deviants. The latter are a squishy, skinless bundle of neon muscle that need to be eradicated to protect humankind. Having been scattered centuries ago, the Eternals must now reunite to confront the resurgent, mysterious Deviants. But there’s little agreement on how to do that. Thena’s grappling with the weight of thousands of years of memories; Druig and Phastos are breaking the Eternals’ pledge not to interfere with human history; Kingo is clinging to a career as a Bollywood star. Their clashing personalities — some like children, others like wizened owls — make for agreeable sparks, especially with comic masters like Nanjiani and Henry delivering solid, affecting performances. Still, the general sleepiness dulls otherwise appealing scenes as the movie takes an enormous amount of time to say almost nothing. My enduring sense of it is tiny people set against huge landscapes, dwarfed by nature, history and the unrelenting, same-y cinematography. “Doctor Strange”-style spells and visuals feel pat at this point. It’s the inverse of most MCU films, which can sound inane or arbitrary on paper but which can also translate beautifully to the screen (think “Guardians of the Galaxy,” for starters). In real life, though, it’s a depressing waste of its $200 million budget. As with its last few genre-shaped MCU widgets (the wuxia-influenced “Shang Chi,” the spy-thriller “Black Widow”), “The Eternals” would have looked better without the Marvel logo, which figuratively undermines Zhao’s languid pace and Ben Davis’ hazy, beachfront frames (he also shot “Guardians” and “Captain Marvel”). By contrast, Denis Villeneuve’s new “Dune” masterfully dispatches with this sort of complex, atmospheric world-building by leaning away from the blockbusters’ tentpoles. You know them well: crowd-sourced, toy-friendly designs (“Eternals” Happy Meal toys are already out); a puzzle-piece script; and an unintelligible, CG-driven third-act. Suspension of disbelief frequently pancakes in “The Eternals,” with gods acting like spoiled Gen X’ers and soulless white-collar workers.

"Nov 8, 2021"," It is simply unlike anything the genre has produced with its sweeping cinematography, biting action sequences, and carefully curated humour. The contemporary lens of this cosmic ballad and refusal to let this unfathomably large-scale run amuck creates something more beautiful and intriguing than surface flaws suggest. It dares to be intelligent in ways previous Marvel movies could never, nurturing a love letter to the superhero manifesto and its more tasteful mythology rather than the blunt force of super soldiers. The typical superhero formula is present, fighting against Chloé Zhao’s efforts to embrace a sleeker aesthetic. Eternals is not for the current fanbase; it does not initially appeal to the young fans that fell in love with Iron Man all those years ago. It will, however, introduce audiences to something entirely new and whimsical. It will strip the classic Avengers romp of its appeal and rebuild something more emotional and meditative in its place.  Just as this ensemble looks to evolve the genre, audiences will have to be willing to adjust their expectations to enjoy the melancholy addition. For those capable of appreciating this experiment and how it rises above its flaws, the film will leave you with an entirely different kind of child-like wonder.  Not everyone will be willing to accept this blockbuster rule-breaking as groundbreaking. They will find themselves bogged down by the heavy sci-fi lore and off-put by a cast that refuses to fall into the familiar beats of the Avengers banter. Eternals will no doubt become a divided front for moving against the tide, unable to satisfy everyone but also incapable of underwhelming cinema. You may not like what it attempts to do here, but you have to respect this sprawling fantasy’s devotion to delivering on a vision so epic and sure of itself.  This fully formed identity of character-driven worlds and mind-blowing scope suggests Marvel is on the cusp of storytelling that could bring meaningful evolution to the blockbuster format. That is the irony of Eternals. Many of the complaints Marvel movies have generated over the years are touched on here.  The cast is the most diverse and colourful it has ever been, the characters are capable of real emotional growth, and the special effects are stylish. The story boasts heavy but enriching threads, giving this dysfunctional family ample screentime, to the point where the CGI monsters hunting them become fleeting antagonists. That is entirely up to this phenomenally casted ensemble. These super-powered aliens are tangible with honest moments of hate and admiration for each other. They share unique connections that are not fueled by stereotypes or restricted to romantic love. It is the most range any Marvel movie has shown to be capable of, and it is what saves this premise from drowning in the dense effects-driven plot like so many movies before it. The plot is cleverly interwoven into the introductions of this motley crew, allowing for characters to drive the pacing forward. That means a good chunk of the film substitutes out quippy one-liners and external conflict for emotional turmoil, something a blockbuster rarely does. Heartbreak fuels the Eternals struggles and brings an emotional depth to what would otherwise be another project about emotionally-stunted gods. Kumail Nanjiani’s Kingo provides fans with familiar comedic beats, but his observational skills are imperative in narrating subcontext. Gemma Chan’s underdog Sersi is the perfect foil to Richard Madden’s reserved Ikaris. Lauren Ridloff’s Makkari and Barry Keoghan’s Druig defy all expectations, becoming instant favourites thanks to their electrifying chemistry — not to mention Makkari is one of the finest incarnations of a speedster in any superhero film. Salma Hayek, Lia McHugh, Brian Tyree Henry round out this ensemble with notable performances and first impressions that are not all that they seem. Yet, it is Ma Dong-seok’s Gilgamesh and Angelina Jolie’s Thena that will take audiences by surprise with one of the most beautiful relationships to be featured in a Marvel film thus far. Their connection is a masterclass in emotional payoff and a prime example of how non-romantic dynamics can be the richest storytelling to explore. Eternals does not struggle in this grief. Instead, the film embraces its layers of stifling trauma, transforming into a showcase of beauty that compliments the stunning cinematography. This shift leads to many small victories for the story as the conflict builds and this large ensemble is able to survive their anti-climatic boss battle. It helps to lean on the couple who encompass the haunting beauty of this film best — Sersi and Ikaris. Their love is forever doomed and in that tragedy is a painful beauty. Ikaris was falling in love with Sersi as she was falling in love with the planet, and when faced with an ultimatum, he couldn’t betray that love. The way his eyes flicker and suddenly this very stoic male figure slips into tears is powerful beyond words. Sometimes the best love stories are tragedies, and Eternals seems to understand this all too well. If you are looking for faults, it is not in this cast. That said, one cannot champion the success of this character study without acknowledging its failures — because these immortal beings are not without their flaws. This film is leaps and bounds more progressive than other attempts to be inclusive. It does not pander to women as blatantly as other projects, but it considers the female gaze. It allows for cultures to live and breathe in harmony. Yet, to champion it for doing what is expected of most projects these days does not sit right. For the superhero genre, a sex scene and one adorable gay couple is a spectacular start. It is also a cruel reminder of what we have missed out on for too long.  Then there is the issue of formula. We can celebrate all the ways this addition to the MCU breaks the rules. Unfortunately, it still clings to the winning (and painfully predictable) superhero format in its crucial moments. The end battle throws in a few exciting curveballs, however, even special effects this gorgeous become tedious to watch when they entirely eclipse the conflict. And once again, the end of the world resolves itself all too easily. As someone that could care less about the importance of one-note alien antagonists to the over-arching plot, I have to, unfortunately, admit when their absence leaves a glaring plot hole. Marvel loves to throw in these CGI creatures to create conflict for the early acts, and yet, aside from a key reveal in the Eternal lore, these invincible plot tools are the weakest element of this expansive storytelling. Eternals is a cursed concept from conception. The idea that Marvel would ever successfully take this bloated crew of invincible beings and relate them to an audience willing to suffocate under the dense lore of their property is near impossible. It is the failed Inhumans TV series on a much larger and expensive scale.  On paper, Eternals has terrible odds of producing something worth embracing. However, the choice to have Chloé Zhao at the helm of this project is how this bizarre romp through superhero territory will thrive as a cult film in the coming years. It was a risk to give an independent filmmaker complete creative license to bring this franchise to life. Regardless, Zhao is a risk Marvel will be relieved to have taken.  Despite losing itself in the trappings of the genre at the worst possible times, Zhao’s vision is rock solid, her direction aiming true. The essence of her directing shines in every shot, with familiar themes driving the political undertones of the plot and carefully placed threads carrying through the entire story, presenting a more cohesive front than the non-linear time jumps would suggest. Like many, I enjoy the Marvel formula for its comforting predictability, and this film is a step outside that comfort zone. It is a step so many of us were sure to regret, yet the film negates these fears by not allowing moviegoers to fend for themselves. The strength of this other-worldly tale lies in the meticulous world-building that refrains from overwhelming its audience with information dumps. The lore operates within a series of calculated plot twists that unravel the backstory at a steady pace; the reserved Madden rears his head as a surprise antagonist for the final act, and the good guys reckon with their villainous roles throughout. No one could expect to enjoy this polarizing concept less than this critic right here. In return, Eternals demonstrated to hordes of stubborn fans how genres transform without taking away the core values of the hero journey. The fact is Eternals has the world talking. It is forcing genre veterans to take a step back for the first time in twenty-six films and ponder whether they are willing to embrace new forms of comic-book storytelling. This cosmic divergent is subjective just as art should be and flawed as cinema often is. Yes, this film’s success suffers under the weight of its dense property at times. It also thrives in the quiet, melancholy suffering of its capable cast. This grander exploration may disappoint audiences for being too different and not different enough, but its accomplishments are too significant to call a failure. This exploration of grief through the lens of eternal beings gifts fans a change of pace without the risk of it invading campier titles. It offers people on the outside an invitation to see their refined tastes reflected in blockbuster action. For society to finally see this diverse cast of exceptional storytelling vessels reflect the world as we want to know it. Eternals is a flawed experiment years ahead of its industry but, sooner or later, a film has to break the mold and prove superheroes are worthy of deeper, richer cinematic retellings.  Chloé Zhao molded the superhero genre in her image, and when critics dared to say she flew too close to the sun, her trailblazing storytelling persisted. Who could have predicted Marvel would one day introduce Harry Styles into the MCU? It is a bold casting that understandably has theatres shook as the famous singer-turned-actor pops up at the end of the first credits. Bizarrely enough, Eros comes to life immediately in his presence, and once movie-goers get over the initial shock of this casting, they will find the royal prince of Thanos, brother of Titan, certainly is something to behold. And in an exciting move, we see the franchise prepare to go medieval with a hint at Kit Harrington’s ominous Black Knight. This final tease is expertly built up through the film and finally comes through as the voice of Mahershala Ali stops Dane from revealing too much. It is a cheeky tidbit that is years away from valuable payoff, but in true Marvel fashion, this end-credit scene is still exceptionally cool. Alicia is a writer, editor, and library technician from Ontario, Canada. Her passion for TV and film can be credited to superheroes, workplace comedies, and coming-of-age stories.",POSITIVE
"Nov 7, 2021"," The most heavily promoted Marvel's Avengers-like movie has finally graced the theaters. Are the Eternals the next generation of Avengers?  Not quite.  Although the movie's trailers make it look like a close-knit family of immortal superheroes, the story goes totally sideways. The Eternals were created 7,000 years ago by the Celestials, who oversee the universe. Ajak (Selma Hayek), the leader of the Eternals, can communicate directly with Arishem, Prime Celestial, the deity who created the first sun and brought light to the universe.  Under Ajak's titulage are Ikaris (Richard Madden, “Cinderella”) and Sersi (Gemma Chan, ""Captain Marvel,"" “Crazy Rich Asians”) - whose on and off romance spans for centuries, Thena (Angelina Jolie, “Maleficent,” ""Salt,"" ""Wanted""), Druig (Barry Keoghan), Gilgamesh (Don Lee), Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), Phastos (Bryan Tyree Henry) and Sprite (Lia McHugh). Ikaris is the MCEU's Superman; he can fly and shoot laser beams out of his eyes. Sersi could transform objects into other matters.  Thena is the goddess of war and skilled in weaponry; she can conjure up a golden sword and spear from thin air and fight with balletic grace. Druig is mind-controller. Gilgamesh, with his hulking frame, is super strong. Kingo could form fire balls with his hands.  Makkari is the Flash here; she's a deaf super-speedster. Phastos is a technology inventor. Sprite is an illusionist and has the body of a perpetual teen.  Kudos to Marvel for pulling together the most diverse cast (races, genders, ages, orientations, impairments) onto the big screen! The Eternals were sent by Arishem from Olympia to travel to Earth to watch over and protect humans from the monstrous Deviants. They're first seen in 5,000 B.C. in Mesopotamia. They have lived through centuries of civilizations. While they have marveled by the wonders of this beautiful planet and human progress, frictions have emerged over time, as they have also witnessed wars, destructions and deaths.  Per Arishem's order, these superpowered beings are strictly prohibited to interfere with human affairs in order for mankind to develop as they are meant to be. But after thousands of years have passed, some have begun to question their purpose and why they can't help, even though they have the otherworldly abilities to make the world a much better place. At the same time, aren't flaws what make humans truly humans? This central moral conflict, combined with one of the Eternals suffering from a memory overload, which is a mental condition, split the Eternals apart and they go on their separate ways.  After all, the Deviants were defeated and they're just waiting around for Arishem's order to return home to Olympia.  The present day brings the story forward to London, where human-loving Sersi is now a museum curator and in a stable relationship with a human, Dane Whitman (Kit Harrington). She also lives with Sprite as her roommate. After a surprised attack by the Deviants, whom they thought had been exterminated long ago, Ikaris shows up to lend a hand. Not only these modern-day Deviants turn out to be stronger and seem to have self-healing ability, they are also targeting the Eternals this time around, not humans. This prompts Sersi, Sprite and Ikaris to band together and track down the other Eternals. As someone who loves history, whether real history or historical fiction, I actually wished the backstories were much longer. I wanted them to stay in the past and explore their lives there first.  I wanted to know more about these characters, the family-type of relationships, the friendships and the romances.  However, this wouldn't be possible due to the length of the movie, already at a staggering 2 hours and 37 minutes.  It would have been neat to have another movie that lays out the foundation and tells the stories that led to this ""Eternals"" movie.  The Avengers had the benefit of having solo movies prior, so you're invested in the main characters and their journeys. The Eternals does not have this advantage, and as a result, so many expositions are crammed into the movie and the scenes jump from one to another with super quick cuts. While the pictorial shots of real landscapes in natural light and historical places are sweepingly stunning, the scenes feel rushed because of how quick they are.  They’re gone in a flash before we could digest them. The story goes far beyond a typical dysfunctional family. It touches on free will and destiny, blind faith and loyalty, duties and betrayals, convictions and morality, purpose and meaning about who they really are and what the right thing to do is. And it's not simply a familial conflict; it's a full-blown existential crisis, treacheries and tragedies to the point of no return. ",POSITIVE
"Nov 7, 2021"," Welcome to film #26 in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Eternals has a large amount of buzz and hype and is ready to share a different vision of a Marvel film. Creates the opportunity for a wealth of new characters to emerge, as diverse and representative as ever before, and breathe new life into the Marvel Cinematic Universe moving forward. For many, who are used to a particular style, look, and feel of Marvel movies, Eternals is going to feel like a dramatic diversion which may seem out of place and disappointing to MCU diehards. The biggest surprise and disappointment here is that the story seems to evaporate in real time. For all the globe-hopping and stunning real-world locations the film shows us, the story falls flat and never quite resonates. I am not sure where this falls as the most ambitious moves so far within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), but the hiring of groundbreaking Academy Award winning filmmaker Chloé Zhao has to rank at or near the top. Eternals, with a $200 million budget, gives Zhao the opportunity to introduce an entirely new foundation of characters within the confines of her first blockbuster, part of the most popular movie franchise in the world. Potentially, this could just be one of those “crazy ideas that just might work out.”Zhao’s previous work, comprising three beautiful, moving, small-budget films, shared a combined production budget of roughly $8 million dollars. A commonality among 2015’s Songs My Brothers Taught Me, 2017’s The Rider, and the 2020 Best Picture winner Nomadland, is that these are films which feel slightly invasive, vulnerable, engrossing, and documentary-like at times. Zhao is one of this generation’s great storytellers; she embeds with her subjects, locking arms with them, never with judgment, and investigates how tragedy and obstacles define their next steps.Characters grow and evolve in Zhao’s films. And so...if you are introducing a massive new ensemble of cinematic heroes, why not take her unique approach, nestle in with these characters, and get to know their backstories and connections?The problem is Zhao, for all her talents and gifts, doesn’t quite vector up to full clarity within a Marvel superhero movie setting. At least not here. And that is not to say Eternals is a disappointment - I actually think it is a better film than many are giving it credit for - but this is not what mainstream MCU devotees are likely anticipating. And that will undoubtedly prove to be something of a letdown for those who like the men spidery and iron-clad, their widows black and hulks incredible.25 previous films in the MCU have taught us to expect bombast, engaging exposition and world-building, a blend of comedy and tension, and a dazzling escapism that makes so many of these Marvel characters’ fantastical adventures so entertaining. What we are not accustomed to within the MCU is dense, dialogue-heavy scenes where people question their purpose, contemplate decisions, and action scenes coming at something of a premium.In Eternals, a decagon of superheroes have origins back to 5,000 B.C. Sent from their home planet of Olympia, Eternals were created to fend off the nasty, vicious Deviants - CGI creatures who exist seemingly to destroy all that is good in humanity. As time goes on, these Eternals, when not demolishing Deviants, are essentially watchdogs or gatekeepers over the world. They can travel to any time period, do their business, and jump to somewhere else. Zhao, writing this adaptation with fellow screenwriters Patrick Burleigh, Ryan Firpo, and Kaz Birpo, takes the time and effort for us to see how these characters entangle with each other across centuries, decades, even millenia. Our de facto main character is Sersi (Gemma Chan), who has a modern-day love affair with kindly chap Dane (Kit Harington), but has had a long-standing connection to Ikaris (Richard Madden) through the centuries. Ikaris closely resembles Superman, at least as shown here, while Dane is an archaeology nut in present-day London.

Zhao shows she can clearly direct a powerhouse action sequence or two and Eternals has a very specific direction and vision. Eternals is a platform, or springboard, for new characters and individuals to populate the MCU. And it should be celebrated for the diversity presented both in front of, and behind the camera. Zhao, the second woman ever, and first woman of color, to win an Academy Award for Best Directing, is the first female of color to helm a Marvel film. We have Black and Brown actors, an openly gay superhero, a character who appears genderfluid, the first fully deaf superhero, and more representation in a superhero film than ever before.Diversity does not automatically make a film good. However, it does continue to open up doors and break down stigmas in the types of films which, pandemic or otherwise, draw the largest audiences. This is meaningful and Eternals come by the choices it makes honestly and matter-of-factly. This is progress.Stunning visual effects work, strong sound design, and beautiful cinematography make this a more accomplished film than some want to admit. Eternals offers plenty to embrace. Sadly though, and perhaps the film’s largest surprise, is that Zhao and team have crafted a story that evaporates from the mind almost in real time. There’s simply a lot to keep track of, in these cumbersome 157 minutes. Though one can easily enjoy Eternals as a standalone film, with minimal to no knowledge of what the MCU has previously been, the overall production is just not bold enough, “big” enough, or effective enough to move into the upper echelon of Marvel films.  Druig (Barry Keoghan) can alter thinking, while Sprite (Lia McHugh) presents as a 12-year-old child who can create illusions.

"Nov 7, 2021"," As if the Marvel universe couldn't get bigger, enter the Eternals, immortal gods who protect Earth from powerful, mutant antagonists that threaten to wipe out human civilization completely. They also have to protect humans from...themselves. To say it's complicated is an understatement, and, honestly, as I type those words, the premise lands shakily on its extraterrestrial feet.  The backstories of the Eternals, as with most properties in MCU, are convoluted, changing with each iteration and often dependent upon the creative hands in which they fall. This time, under the tutelage of freshly awarded Oscar winner Chloé Zhao, the Eternals receive their own feature film treatment with aptly-named ""Eternals,"" a clunky installment of the billion-dollar comic book series that attempts to cover 7,000 years in two and a half hours, introducing ten new formidable guardians of the world without the time and scope to offer an interesting mission or fully develop each new persona with proper inaugurations. Zhao, a talented director who has shown her prowess with a penchant for golden hour shoots and guerrilla filmmaking, out in nature, often alone with just the talent and camera operator, is in the mouth of the Marvel beast with this one. It can devour even the most able-eyed filmmaker, which is exactly what ""Eternals"" does. It distracts the audience with a slow pace, juxtaposing nifty magic with the shooting realism Zhao conquered in ""Nomadland"" before firing off into a frustratingly shallow mission. With a script that Zhao helped write, ""Eternals"" stars Gemma Chan as Sersi, the unwitting heart of the immortal brethren. The intergalactic beings, which appear like a diverse cast of circus performers, traveling across the world and helping humans grow, learn and innovate for century after century, report to their maker Arishem, the leader of the oldest race of sentient beings in the universe known as Celestials. He's all-powerful and appears like an oversized robot floating in space with six glowing orange eyes and high expectations for his minions.  Ajak (Salma Hayek) is the fearless leader of the Eternals, guiding each on their mission to help the human race. She oversees a cast of colorful, all-star heroes with unique abilities of their own: Ikaris (Richard Madden) can shoot lasers from his eyes and fly; Thena (Angelina Jolie) has superhuman strength, sharp reflexes and unstoppable fighting abilities; Sprite (Lia McHugh), the only Eternal trapped in a child's body, can create illusions; Druig (Barry Keoghan) controls minds; Makkari (Lauren Ridloff) is super fast; Gilgamesh (Ma Dong-seok) is the strongest, physically, of the Eternals; Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), in addition to being the first gay hero in MCU, is the tech wizard of the group; and Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani) can shoot cosmic energy from his fingertips and has also found fame as a Bollywood writer/director/star. It is truly an ensemble endeavor, though Sersi is the one we root for. We follow her immortal journey breaking up with Ikaris after hundreds of years as a couple and testing the waters with dating human Dane (Kit Harington). The Eternals parted ways sometime before but are forced to reunite when the Deviants make a dramatic return. It seems that their resurgence is timed with another monumental event that threatens the existence of the planet: a Celestial, placed in the core of the Earth by Arishem thousands of years before, is finally prepared to break through the surface, taking out the population of the world with it.  Though this has happened on other worlds for who-knows-how-many years in the past, some of the Eternals, who have completed this exact same mission on other planets, are conflicted this time around. Humans are different than other Celestial-food they've sacrificed before, and they become determined to stop Earth's extinction, even if it means going against their purpose and their master. Speaking as a human who would hate to die in the event of a Celestial birth, the case made for the emergence of the Celestial and the end of humanity is strong. According to Arishem, a new Celestial, though detrimental to its host, will go on to create other universes, resulting in many more lives born than are lost. It's hard not to take Arishem's side. The case for saving the humans is weak, and what's more, we spend over two hours living with the Eternals, hardly a human in sight. They don't really mean much in this story. The weaknesses of Sersi's case, despite how much we may enjoy Chan as the Eternal and yearn to root for her, are overpowering. The task of reassembling the cast of powerful Eternals is far more fun and rewarding than the big prize battle, which pits them against each other for a mission that, frankly, is a feeble cause with an unrewarding end.",NEGATIVE
"Nov 7, 2021"," Anyone who hoped that recruiting Oscar-winning director Chloé Zhao (Nomadland) to the Marvel stable might herald a radical change of direction is likely to be disappointed by Eternals. At its most effective, Zhao’s film-making is delicate and intimate, capturing fragile human connections with warmth and naturalism. Exactly the kind of thing that gets crushed to oblivion by the steamroller action onslaught of a comic-book movie. Certainly in terms of the look of the film, aside from a few wistful magic-hour shots, there’s little to indicate that Zhao’s guiding vision was able to swim against the tide of prevailing genre conventions. But elsewhere, there are hints of Zhao’s sensibility, not least in the diversity in the writing and casting of the Eternals: a group of immortal humanoids billeted on Earth and tasked with protecting humanity from the destructive appetites of the Deviants (depicted in the film as part lizard, part rage, part high-tensile cable). Leader of the Eternals is Salma Hayek as Ajak; the most powerful is Ikaris (Richard Madden); the most accomplished warrior is Thena (Angelina Jolie), but it’s the empathetic Sersi (Gemma Chan) who is central to the story. Kumail Nanjiani is hammy fun as Kingo, who has hidden out on Earth as a multi-generational Bollywood acting dynasty and insists on saving the planet with his valet in tow. The cast also includes deaf actor Lauren Ridloff as Makkari, and has Brian Tyree Henry playing Marvel’s first openly gay superhero. But for all the effort that has gone into ensuring representation in the casting, the storytelling, with its forced flashbacks and synthetic sentiment, lets the whole thing down.",NEUTRAL
"Nov 7, 2021"," Even before the arrival of Eternals, critics were raising concerns. In Hollywood, the force more powerful than Uatu the Watcher — the Rotten Tomatoes score — started dropping, with the film currently ranking as the lowest in MCU history.  ELI:  The Eternals are supposed to introduce something majestic, a new galactic scale to the Marvel Universe, beginning with the arrival of massive celestial beings who we're told are responsible for essentially seeding the cosmos.  Like bespoke Power Rangers, the Eternals arrived thousands of years ago, hovering above the Earth in their sleek triangular spaceship.  With their colourful costumes and array of powers, they were designated as our planet's protectors, keeping the evil deviants in check. Similar to Star Trek's prime directive they were told not to interfere in human affairs, but have lived among us for thousands of years waiting for the deviants to return.  Gemma Chan has the most screen time as Sersi, the Eternal who can change the physical properties of objects.  She works at a museum during the day (I guess Wonder Woman gave her career advice). But the return of the deviants brings her old flame Ikaris back. Richard Madden played the stoic hero who flies about with a flapping loincloth zapping people with his eyebeams.  But this is only the latest version of these superpowered protectors.  JACKSON:  For sure. The Eternals has been through numerous reboots and retcons — the age-old comic book tradition of altering old plot points at will —  throughout the years. While main character Sersi — and, to a degree, Richard Madden's Ikaris — remain mostly consistent, the rest are barely recognizable. The characters Ajak (Salma Hayek), Makkari (Lauren Ridloff) and Sprite (Lia McHugh) have been gender-swapped from their most common depictions. Brian Tyree Henry's Phastos is depicted as a married gay man with a child, and others — including the comic's original ""prime Eternal"" Zuras — are completely ignored. While changing aspects of their source material is nothing new for Marvel, the extent to which the characters are altered here speaks to why The Eternals never really worked. The comics did not see mainstream popularity, largely because the truly ensemble-style story never landed on a clear main character — instead dragging up a different one of the Eternals' 100 members to focus on for each outing.  For that reason, readers had a hard time even latching on to a favourite member, as it was always so difficult to pin down who any of the heroes really were. ELI:  It's a pity because the idea of secret celestial sleeper agents living among us certainly has potential.  But the film's biggest problem is there's just too many of them.  There's a good reason the modern Marvel era started with Iron Man, then Hulk and Thor,  slowly teasing out the characters' backstories and connections. Imagine if The Avengers was the first Marvel film and spent half the time introducing Black Widow, Hawkeye, Captain America and more. Eternals has that problem multiplied by ten and without the pre-existing pop culture familiarity. Many of us had heard of the Hulk at one time or another, but Thena? Phastos? Ajak? Druig?  JACKSON: I can't say I'm surprised. The Eternals was never supposed to fit into the Marvel superhero world, and required an incredible amount of exposition over multiple years to do so.  Comic book legend Jack Kirby was first inspired to write The Eternals after reading Chariots of the Gods? Unsolved Mysteries of the Past,  a 1968 book about alien contact with a prehistoric Earth. He meant to keep the final product separate from the universe of Iron Man, Captain America and Thor, but was pressured by editors to meld them together.  ELI: If there's one element that marks a great superhero film, it's a villain who can hold their own. Consider: the chaotic energy of Heath Ledger's Joker from The Dark Knight. Killmonger nearly stole the show from Black Panther. Heck, even the Scarlet Witch had Agatha all along. While Eternals features the all-powerful celestial Arishem pulling strings behind the scenes, too much of the film is about battling forgettable deviants — snarling creatures that are powerful but lack any personality.  But Jackson, you see some possibilities there?  JACKSON: While it was a challenge to force the square pegged-Eternals into the round hole of Marvel, it does allow them to significantly up the ante. The various MCU heroes have already saved their respective cities, countries, planets, and galaxies — how do you keep things exciting when you've already clawed back half the population of the universe? While we don't see all the scariest aspects of Arishem, the spooky space gods certainly open up the playing field for Marvel. And while the deviants may lack personality, they offer a potential way for the franchise to finally introduce another property: the similarly altered mutants of X Men.  ELI:  After the Oscar-winning triumph with Nomadland, it was exciting to imagine what director Chloé Zhao could bring to the Marvel movie universe. With her films such as The Rider and Nomadland she showed an instinct for blending documentary with drama, recruiting real people for moments on film where the boundaries between fact and fiction blur.  But like Galactus gobbling a planet, Zhao's unique filmmaking style has been subsumed by the mighty Marvel maw. The movie shares some superficial similarities to her previous works.  Her love of natural landscapes and a certain Western esthetic, even going so far as to have Salma Hayek kicking back at her own private ranch as the leader Ajak. JACKSON:  Zhao's final product may not have reached the heights we hoped it would, but there are some wonderful additions. Her commitment to diverse characters is a more-than-welcome change for Marvel: Phastos' unquestioned and unemphasized representation as a gay man was both powerful and empowering, while Ridloff's turn as Marvel's first deaf actor to play a superhero was a remarkable milestone.  At the same time, blurring fact and fiction when talking about human history can be a fraught endeavour. The Eternals are to thank for many of humanity's accomplishments, instead of real people and their cultures, while tragedies — such as the 1945 atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki — are mined for shallow character development.  ELI:  I would like to briefly praise what worked for me.  I'd watch an entire film with Brian Tyree Henry as Phastos the technologist. As the IT guy for the Eternals, Henry added such a soulful and heartbroken component to the character it gave us a glimpse of what the movie could have been. Also, for all the attention of Kumail Nanjiani's new physique, his greatest asset is still his funny bone.  As Kingo the part-time Bollywood star, he added much needed levity to the overly earnest production.  JACKSON: Eternals the movie suffers from the same thing The Eternals comic did — it focuses more on a concept than it does on characters. For that reason, I'm less impressed by Sersi's ability to turn someone into a tree, and more enamoured by the characterization when it does peek through — like the fascination Ma Dong-seok's muscle-bound Gilgamesh has with cooking, or the PTSD-like affliction Angelina Jolie's Thena struggles with. If I could stretch our definition of who counts as an Eternal, my hands-down favourite would be Karun, played by veteran stage and screen actor Harish Patel. Patel's depiction as Nanjiani's dedicated (though under-equipped) assistant is the highlight of the movie for me.  ELI:  I wouldn't describe Eternals as an absolute failure, but more a disappointment considering the talent involved. If you want a film that has something to say about our place in the universe, I think 1997's Men in Black did it better.  Eternals has moments of awe, but mostly it's a celestial bore.  JACKSON: I'm disappointed by the movie, though not surprised. The epoch and galaxy-spanning story's original comics run was never a commercial success, and almost every other attempt to make The Eternals work has either failed, or found lacklustre response. Still, this movie is sure to become required viewing for the committed MCU fan — though you may be better served by simply reading the Neil Gaiman comics and calling it a day. It is a priority for CBC to create products that are accessible to all in Canada including people with visual, hearing, motor and cognitive challenges.",NEUTRAL
"Nov 6, 2021"," With 10 superheroes to introduce and millennia of backstories to plough through, this 157-minute slog requires superhuman levels of endurance. The hard work begins with opening Star Wars-style text which introduces the god-like Celestials, led by the mighty Arishem, who created and controls the universe. Richard Madden's Ikaris flies and fires laser beams out of his eyes, Sersi (Gemma Chan) manipulates objects, Druig (Barry Keoghan) controls minds, Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani) shoots fireballs, Makkari (Lauren Ridloff) is super fast, Gilgamesh (Ma Dongseok) is strong, Sprite (Lia McHugh) creates illusions.  As the prophet-like Ajak (Salma Hayek) is the only one Arishem talks to, she operates as a sort of manager figure, orchestrating the action from the sidelines. Most of the film takes place in the modern age as the banished Deviants return to usher in the Apocalypse, and the Eternals come out of hiding to trade weak banter.",NEUTRAL
"Nov 6, 2021"," The MCU reaches a low point with “Eternals,” an odd team-up adventure that teases a franchise the future of which might be better suited for Disney’s streaming service. Boasting an all-star cast, “Eternals” follows an inconsistent collection of immortal beings who protect planets from the destructive forces of the monstrous Deviants. After dispatching the Deviants from our world, the Eternals are instructed to wait anonymously on Earth for future instructions. Thousands of years pass, and the villainous creatures reemerge. Naturally, the Eternal gang of superhero types must get back together. Featuring a grouping of primarily unknown heroes, “Eternals” attempts to develop their origin stories while also delivering the typical action essentials that culminate in a slam-bang conclusion. And to be fair, some fun is had with the individual personalities. While the center of the narrative focuses on Gemma Chan’s Sersi, it’s Kumail Nanjiani as Kingo who steals the Show. Kingo is the most relatable of the cold, inhuman Eternals. We meet him in India, where he’s become a Bollywood star. His constant companion and all-around best pal is a human, the hopelessly devoted Karun (a standout comedic performance by Harish Patel). As comic relief, this duo is welcomed, but they also come off as the most authentic in the bunch. Less successful is Angelina Jolie, making her MCU debut as Thena. Because the character is emotionally disturbed, Athena is continually losing herself in a violent trance. It’s a frustrating distraction as Athena tries to kill everyone around her, including fellow Eternals. A lighter, less dramatic approach may have made this character more appealing. The failure of “Eternals” shouldn’t rest exclusively at the feet of Oscar-winning director Chloé Zhao (see last year’s transcendent “Nomadland”). The film does possess the qualities of the soft and filmic pastoral imagery that marks the director’s previous successes (see her amazing 2017 movie “The Rider”). But because there’s so much going on in this movie, it devolves into a hopelessly convoluted affair. And by the closing act, I found myself giving up on trying to keep track of the characters and their motivations. An odd fellow with remarkable artistic talent, his life was impacted by the unfortunate illness and untimely loss of his loving partner Emily (played by “The Crown’s” Claire Foy). And, after that, by throwing himself into his work, he became a sensation. But despite his significant talent, his career was affected by schizophrenia. A very gaunt Cumberbatch is terrific as the tweaked Wain. The attractive and diverse cast includes Andrea Riseborough as Wain’s sister Caroline. “The IT Crowd’s” Richard Ayoade also shows up. And don’t adjust your television set; the movie is presented in 4:3 aspect.",NEUTRAL
"Nov 6, 2021","Even acclaimed filmmaker Chloe Zhao, who collected Best Picture and Director Oscars for last year's 'Nomadland,' can't save her first venture into the MC Universe from being laughable too often in all the wrong places.",NEUTRAL
"Nov 6, 2021"," The word “auteur” is used to refer both to independent filmmakers displaying their originality under conditions of artistic freedom and to filmmakers who assert their individuality within the confines of the studio system. Chloé Zhao, the director of “Nomadland,” has always been the first kind of auteur, and with “Eternals,” which opens today, she takes her place among the second. Such a transition can be fascinating. Ryan Coogler’s artistic hand was unambiguously strong in “Black Panther,” as was Peyton Reed’s in the first “Ant-Man.” But directorial personality—and, even more so, originality—is generally hard to come by in the stringently produced, tightly interlocking Marvel domain. Zhao has said that she actively sought out the chance to direct a Marvel film. She was also one of the four writers of the “Eternals” script, and it shows: far from being an impersonal film, it blends her sensibility and the franchise’s, albeit to the advantage of neither. The problem is hinted at from the start, with an elaborate crawl of text setting forth the backstory of the Eternals. They are introduced as a superhero team whose main purpose is to save the human race from monsters called Deviants. In this mission, the Eternals are under the quasi-divine reign of a group called the Celestials and its head, Arishem, and under the practical leadership of the foremost Eternal, called Ajak (who is played by Salma Hayek). The question of identity and purpose, which the opening text lays out, will ultimately be central to “Eternals” and will provide it with its few jolts of intrigue. Yet, strangely, the extensive world-building that the project demands appears to be no obstacle for Zhao, because she is an essentially expository director. Whether in “Nomadland” or “The Rider,” she tends toward contemplative observation of her characters’ interactions but does so with a tightly focussed sense of dramatic purpose: she rarely stops long enough to hear out her characters, lest she risk perturbing her unambiguous narrative frameworks. The quieter action that Zhao has filmed in the past and the turbulent action inherent to a Marvel movie prove surprisingly similar. True to their name, the Eternals have been around for what seems like forever. They’re first seen in action in 5000 B.C., in Mesopotamia, where some Eternals who live in benign anonymity among the people there and others who fly down from a marble slab in the sky team up to fend off marauding Deviants. (Some Deviants are like dinosaurs, others are like wild animals, still others are like giant humans, and all are made of pleated strands of tentacular bio-stuff in lieu of solid bodies.) In Mesopotamia, two Eternals, Sersi (Gemma Chan) and Ikaris (Richard Madden), meet cute on the shore, introducing themselves to each other but having nothing more to say. Something already feels wrong, and not only because of the stilted absurdity with which the action and the interactions are staged. (The fights, involving golden glows of swords and golden laserlike beams, are the familiar visual gobble of churn that marks almost all of the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s battle scenes.) “Eternals” then flits to present-day London, where Sersi, now a scientist, is fending off the romantic entreaties of a close friend and colleague named Dane Whitman (Kit Harington), and she refers to a mysterious previous relationship as the reason. No spoiler: it’s with Ikaris. Sersi’s hidden identity as an Eternal (and that of her adolescent roommate, Sprite, played by Lia McHugh) emerges momentarily when the city is attacked by a new horde of Deviants, who are making their reappearance for the first time in centuries. (Hint: it’s because of global warming.) Ikaris flies down (Superman-like but without a cape) to take part in the battle, and Sersi decides to reunite the Eternals—all of whom are living scattered across the globe, in the guise of humans—to fend off this new global threat. The Eternals have always lived embedded among humans, but their role is solely to defend humanity from the Deviants—they are forbidden to use their superpowers to intervene in human affairs. The Eternals are eternal in their identity and in their appearance, too—they never age (Sprite, for instance, is a perpetual adolescent) and are therefore immortal, at risk only of being killed by an attacking Deviant. Yet from their proximity to humans, over the span of millennia, they have developed a warmly sentimental attachment to the species (even if little suggests their attachment, in the past, to individual humans). This tempts some of them to defy orders and become liberal interventionists. One in particular, Druig (Barry Keoghan), wants to protect the people of Tenochtitlan from Spanish conquerors in 1521, and declares, “It’s genocide!” Druig is right, of course, but his very use of the word—which was coined in 1942, by the historian Raphaël Lemkin—hints at one of the peculiarities of “Eternals” over all. The film’s narrative hops back and forth through time, but the Eternals themselves don’t appear to have the power of time-travel or the virtual omniscience that would go with it. Instead, their knowledge seems to advance in step with their experiences through time—and, for all their wealth of worldly experience, they come across as terminal bores with nothing more (indeed, much less) to say than a random person on the street. For all their endurance through time and their zipping through space, the Eternals don’t seem to have learned much of anything at all. At the same time, “Eternals” is among the talkiest of superhero movies, and it’s here that Zhao’s sensibility makes itself most strongly felt—while, at the same time, succumbing to the strictures of Marveldom. The core of the drama is the conflict between the Eternals’ assigned mission and their inherent sense of responsibility. They have to decide who is worthy to be followed as a leader and why, when to obey orders and when to defy them, and, ultimately, what is worth living for and dying for. In “Eternals,” there is much more discussion of these big questions than in most superhero movies, and in that sense the film reminds me a bit of George Lucas’s wrongly damned “Star Wars” prequels. But unlike Lucas’s prequels, which he wrote with a majestically florid, faux-Shakespearean dialectical complexity that’s up to the visionary grandeur of his conceit, the copious dialogue in “Eternals” is as thudding as is usual in Marvel-land. What’s more, Zhao’s way of directing these dialogue scenes—similar to the way she directs far better dialogue scenes in her far better movies—reveals the absurdity of the script and the limits of her humanistic, observational style. Much has been made of the fact that the production of “Eternals” involved an unusual amount of on-location shooting. In other dramatic features, such as Zhao’s earlier works, the sense of documentary-like discovery that comes from filming on location helps the characters connect to the lived experience of viewers outside the frame, to conjure a feeling of common humanity. Zhao has previously worked wonders with nonprofessional actors, whom she listens to and films attentively (even if she’s in the habit of paring their remarks down to dramatically emblematic lines). In “Eternals,” Zhao relies on a similarly spare manner to listen to her characters—but because they have little of significance to say, and because they say it with the portentousness that befits the dialogue’s hollow abstractions, the result is closer to the rigid declamations of soap operas or fifties B-movies, minus the ingenuous and hectic charm. In “Eternals,” Zhao’s spareness with dramatic scenes has an unintentionally ridiculous effect. Whatever “authenticity” the on-location shooting achieved is undone by the utter detachment of the actors from the settings; the complete lack of physicality suggested by the movie; the generic battle scenes pitting Eternals against Deviants; the ludicrous grandiosity of the intergalactic marble slab that delivers the Eternals, and of the vague Celestial realm in which communication with Arishem takes place; and, especially, by the comedic gigantism that bloats Earth’s geology, via C.G.I., with colossal rock loaves with golden-glowing seams emerging from the sea and a conveniently placed volcano that spews on cue. The filming might as well have all been done via green screen, for the little tangibility and texture that it offers the characters and viewers alike. Among the most laudable aspects of “Eternals” is the diversity of its cast, which also includes Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry, and Lauren Ridloff, who is deaf. The Eternal played by Henry, named Phastos, is gay and married to a man named Ben (played by Haaz Sleiman, who’s Lebanese), a feature that has reportedly prompted Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to ban the film. Yet even this news item suggests what the movie itself doesn’t—namely, that diversity and identity mean different things to different people in different times and places, including the many eras and settings depicted in the movie. What the Eternals’ identities mean to them, and what their experiences have been in the many places they’ve gone, is completely effaced in Zhao’s film. As for memory, it crops up only in a strangely negative form: an Eternal named Thena (Angelina Jolie) is debilitated, even deranged, by an overload of memory, rendered nearly unfit for the group’s mission. But there’s no corresponding concern over the effects of a deficit of memory—a far greater danger in current-day political life. Regardless of Zhao’s (and Marvel’s) intentions, “Eternals” is a parade of faces without experience, a movie that reaches back and forth through history and comes back empty-handed.

"Nov 6, 2021"," By Lynn VenhausTrying to save the world shouldn’t be boring, but “Eternals” is one big giant yawn — and easily the worst film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Eternals are immortal beings from the planet Olympia, who came to Earth 7,000 years ago, shaping history and civilizations—but are not to interfere with any conflicts or alter human events — unless it’s their nemesis, the Deviants, so says their creator, Arishem, a Celestial.After what transpired in “Avengers: Endgame” in 2019, these ancient aliens, who have been living in secret, must come out of the shadows and reunite to battle Deviants, their ancient ferocious winged enemy that they thought was vanquished but has reappeared, more vicious than ever. The lines blur between who is good and who is evil. A cumbersome, confusing, and unexciting plot sets up a battle for world domination, attempts to explain why this course of action is necessary and tries to assert itself in a superhero world. Question: if they didn’t help when Thanos wreaked havoc, but name-drop Avengers, then why aren’t any of our beloved ‘other guys” there? As they zip around through time, space and continents, The Eternals explain their places and fix things, as rivalries and romances emerge. However, it’s a lot to absorb, and are we caring by now?The story is based on comic book characters created by Jack Kirby in 1976, and follows the same trajectory of the familiar debates of destiny and free will, and is living forever a blessing or a curse – or both? The main problem, besides this overblown spectacle feeling average, is a too-large unnecessarily complicated cast that appears based on Greek gods, with riffs on those names. Sersi not Circe, Ikaris not Icarus, Ajak not Ajax — get it? These generic characters, in various shades of virtuousness and villainy, are created from a grab bag of qualities and mass produced in a comic book assembly line. To its credit, Marvel has assembled its most diverse cast yet, including a gay character who is in a same-sex marriage. While the ensemble has some very talented and interesting performers – including the versatile Brian Tyree Henry as Phastos, a genius scientist, and the poorly used Barry Keogan, so creepy in his breakout role in “The Killing of a Sacred Deer,” as a very crabby Druig whose superpower is mind control, several are under-utilized.  Angelina Jolie seems like a waste of money as window dressing playing Thena, who can wield a sword and a spear very well in intense combat but has memory issues. And I couldn’t figure out Selma Hayak’s Ajak, for she is set up as the leader but mystery ensues about her intentions. While others took on more than they could handle: Gemma Chan is one-note as omnipotent Sersi, who is desired both by her British professor boyfriend  Dane (Kit Harrington aka Jon Snow in “Game of Thrones,” barely in it) and her former lover Ikaris (Richard Madden, also a “Game of Thrones” alum), who is in full swagger mode. Nevertheless, a few charmed in their roles, including a buff Kumail Nanjiani humorous as Kingo, a Bollywood superstar and Lia McHugh as the shapeshifter Sprite. Don Lee has fun as the hulking Gilgamesh, who has turned into a skilled chef/homebody taking care of Thena. Despite the gifts of Oscar-winning director Chloe Zhao, known for her visual style and was so distinct in “Nomadland,” this film has an undistinguished look. Sure, there are shots of beautiful landscapes, but we’re globe-trotting so much that it begins to look like stock footage advertisers use to entice us on vacations. She was part of the screenwriting team too, that included Patrick Burleigh and Ryan Firpo. Complex and unwieldy, the script features lots of exposition inserted in between the customary superhero banter. The computer-generated graphics are repetitive, the battles are bloated, and two hours and 37 minutes later, I could not wait for it to end (and with a Foreigner song?). But you have to stay for the obligatory revelation scene during the credits. “Eternals” is a 2021 action-adventure-sci-fi-fantasy directed by Chloe Zhao and starring Gemma Chan, Richard Madden, Brian Tyree Henry, Angelina Jolie, Barry Keogan, Kumail Nanjiani, Selma Hayak, Kit Harrington, Lia McHugh, Don Lee and Lauren Ridloff.

"Nov 6, 2021"," The one problem that has plagued Marvel films is a lack of story development over time. Too often, movies have relied too heavily on special effects and not enough on humanity. In the Eternals, director Chloe Zhao turns the entire formula on its head. Pink Floyd's Time is used so effectively to begin this new chapter in the Marvel Universe. This isn't your typical Marvel movie. This is a more complicated story about our newest heroes. The beginning of the Eternals is not a smooth ride. We learn that our new friends have been keeping an eye on humanity for over seven thousand years. We lose some focus in telling the audience how they came to be because of the lengthy history lesson. Once that portion of the journey is told, we get into the crux of the film. We learn that our new friends have been keeping an eye on humanity for over seven thousand years.  Zhao created the script with Patrick Burleigh and Ryan Firpo. Ajak (Salma Hayek) leads the Eternals and ensures that they follow the rules. One of them is not interfering with human growth. Rounding out the team are Sersi (Gemma Chan), Ikaris (Richard Madden), Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), Druig (Barry Keoghan), Gilgamesh (Ma Dong-Seok), Thena (Angelia Jolie), Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), and Sprite (Lisa McHugh). Their mission is to help humanity develop into being better beings and hence creating a more peaceful world. In theory it’s a great idea but as we know human beings are complex and aren’t always collaborators. The wonderful thing about our new spiritual guides is that they are beginning to develop feelings for humans. It can be difficult to sit back and watch humans succumb to their demons at times. Unfortunately, our new friends discover that not everything is as it appears. Many of them have built lives and become attached to those they were sent to protect while living among humans. This section of the film is what distinguishes the Eternals from their other super friends. It also provides a satisfying twist and aids in the film's action. Zhao does an excellent job of allowing each hero to shine. We get to see each Eternal in his or her natural habitat. One surprise is that Hayek is leading the troupe rather than Jolie, who is more in the background. What's more, Hayek passes the baton to Chan's Sersi, who is the most Intune Eternal. She, more than the others, has formed the strongest bonds with humans. The best surprise is Brian Tyree Henry as Phastos. He's the Eternals' creator and technician, and he's also openly gay. He's the hero we're rooting for not because he's the strongest or fastest, but because he's the most resilient. He also serves as the film's comedic relief. Many people who have never been fans of the MCU will enjoy these new heroes and the direction this film takes. It's a complete 180-degree turn from what they're used to. Eternals is far from perfect, but when you hire a director like Chloe Zhao, you're stating unequivocally that you're open to innovative ideas, and in the end, it's up to the audience to decide whether or not those ideas work.",POSITIVE
"Nov 6, 2021"," Director Chloé Zhao’s celebrated Oscar turn directing Nomadland fails to excite and emotionally challenge her new MCU characters, despite putting them into physically intimate scenes for the first time in a Marvel film product. This not very merry band of heroes has been in the background, watching over the development of Earth and its inhabitants for thousands of years. This story fits into the MCU Timeline just after Avengers: Endgame when half the population of Earth returns following the reversal of Thanos’ culling. This script by Zhao, Patrick Burleigh and Ryan Firpo take Marvel down a new path as another of its lesser known comics woven into its other movie property timelines. In this case the Eternals are a collection of super-powered beings who have been protecting Earth and humanity for thousands of years. They are forced to “put the band back together” when the Deviants, who were supposed to be extinct, suddenly appear. The Eternals’ main directive has always been to protect the planet from this primordial threat to humankind. The Deviants are snarling, slightly canine-esque demons with the obligatory scary, long, razor sharp teeth.  The Eternals take their orders from an omnipotent, god-like power, Arishem, who calls the shots. He’s visualized as an oversized, ghoulish multiple red-eyed version of the children’s classic cartoon character “The Iron Giant.” It struck us that saying Arishem’s name resembles , Hashem, the Hebrew word Jews use to refer to God. Ajak is the team leader played by Salma Hayek who suffers from displaying a droll, dour, sourpuss face syndrome much like the others display. They’re all just very serious. Even with their powers, there’s not a one in this boring bunch you’d like have a beer with at the tavern. And CGI streaming gold weapons from their hands and eyes meant to be lethal is a poor use of special effects and used so repetitively, you start to hope that a more exciting secret weapon will appear.  It’s hard to imagine that any of these new heroes will become fan favorites, mainly because they have a mostly vanilla, bland aura. It starts with Thena (Angelina Jolie) whose eyes sometime cloud over which turns out to be a metaphor for the whole team. Take Richard Madden (Game of Thrones) as Icaris. He can fly and shoot lasers with his eyes while looking good in his special suit, but he has a constant dull, sullen look. That facial expression must be viral because Gemma Chan’s (Crazy Rich Asians) Sersi exhibits the same vacant facial feature. She’ absolutely stunning, and can transform objects on a dime, but can’t seem to make her face come to life.  Then there’s Druig (Barry Keoghan) who can get inside heads and control minds. Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani) gets to deliver a few good laughs and provides some comic relief as a fire throwing Bollywood star. Makkari (Lauren Ridloff) is a female speedster à la Flash. Compassionate strongman Gilgamesh (Ma Dong-seok) teams up with Thena. Finally, spiky red-haired Sprite (Lia McHugh) can create optical illusions while looking like Peter Pan and yes, she dreams of growing up to become an adult! Bryan Tyree Henry does the best job exhibiting emotion reacting as Phastos, the master inventor who slowly doles out technological advances for humans. But even he hits a clunker in this time-bouncing plot line when, standing among the ruins of Hiroshima after the 1945 nuclear bombing, he wails, “What have I done?” It’s groan worthy.  Introducing all of these characters at once was a big mistake. None of them seem well-developed, nor fascinating or extraordinary. Slingling gold beams just wasn’t enough. One of the highlights was seeing the Star Wars comic in the hands of Sprite. But that’s not enough either. The best part of the experience, after waiting more than 2 and a half hours, are the mid credit scenes. Chloe Zhao is a very talented director, but perhaps it was too much to expect her go from the sparse, quiet life of Nomadland to this special effects driven action blockbuster with a huge cast of characters who are not very exciting. This Eternals is not one for the ages.",NEGATIVE
"Nov 6, 2021"," What would an Academy Award-winning director do with a Marvel movie? “Eternals” provides the answer: More of the same. Chloé Zhao, who won the Oscar for the low-key drama “Nomadland,” mounts an impressive two-and-a-half-hour spectacle with all the over-the-top action one would expect from a Marvel opus. The problem with “Eternals” is its big, unwieldy and convoluted storyline about an immortal alien race of petulant god-like beings charged with protecting mankind from an evil race of alien “Deviants.” It’s hard to tell the players without a program and the players are rather humdrum. While it delivers the action and eye candy, “Eternals” is middling Marvel. “The Harder They Fall” is an outlandish tongue-in-cheek homage to Spaghetti Westerns with an all-black cast and a torrent of grindhouse violence. Jonathan Majors, Idris Elba and Regina King lead a terrific ensemble in a decadent, but stylish revenge tale set in the remote 19th-century American West. Rival criminal gangs battle for dominance in an impressive first feature directed by British hip-hop star Jeymes Samuel, better known as The Bullitts. “The Harder They Fall” is a fierce guilty pleasure for fans of the genre. Clint Eastwood and Sergio Leone would approve. America’s dad, Tom Hanks, stars in an offbeat post-apocalyptic sci-fi drama, “Finch.” He plays a dying scientist, one of the last survivors of a natural cataclysm, who builds an AI robot to care for his beloved dog. The trio jumps in a high-tech Winnebago and embarks on a cross-country road trip in a last-ditch survival effort. Hanks is exactly the right actor for this role, and he elevates what is otherwise a somewhat dour movie. The efforts to tug on our heartstrings don’t always work, but “Finch” is a sweet-natured comic drama about what it means to be human.",NEUTRAL
"Nov 6, 2021"," In case you don’t know the deal with the Eternals, they’re a diverse group of humanoid entities from the planet Olympia who have been on Earth for thousands of years and possess the usual amazing abilities such as super strength, levitation, teleportation and shooting deadly laser beams from their eyes and hands. Oh, and they’re on the right side of history, as they’ve been charged by their creator, Arishem, with protecting humanity from the monstrous Deviants. The Eternals live in the same Marvel Cinematic Universe as the Avengers. We even hear references in this movie to the likes of Iron Man and Captain America — which leads to the question of why the Eternals were nowhere in sight and didn’t lift a single, supercharged finger when Thanos snapped his fingers and wiped out half the population of the Earth (and the rest of the known universe). Glad you asked, says the screenplay. Turns out Arishem has decreed the Eternals should never get directly involved with the course of human events, and never intervene in any type of conflict or threat, unless that threat comes from the Deviants. Got it? Fine, but when the stuff hits the fan in “Eternals” and the very future of the planet is at stake, why don’t the Avengers show up to lend a hand? Are they going to address that in a future “Avengers” movie? COME ON, MAN! Sorry. It’s just that we get so much exposition in the ambitious, occasionally entertaining but bloated (the running time is 2 hours and 37 minutes), underwhelming, rambling, forgettable and average “Eternals,” it’s maddening a big question is unanswered. As it is, there are so many moments when the action grinds to a half so we can get further explanation of the history of these characters (they’re basically nearly immortal takes on the Greek gods) and why this one is doing this thing and that one is doing that thing. Not that the action scenes are particularly memorable, either; despite the promising presence of the brilliant Chloé Zhao (Oscar winner for “Nomadland”) behind the camera and some breathtaking location shots, the big battle sequences in “Eternals” have the same “light,” obviously CGI look we’ve seen in countless big-budget superhero movies. All these beings and creatures zip about, causing great destruction and zapping and biting and wrestling with one another, and it all feels so weightless and low stakes, even though the future of the planet is at stake and blah blah blah. Based on the comic-book series introduced by Jack Kirby in 1976, “Eternals” hops back and forth through the centuries to ancient civilizations such as Babylon, Mesopotamia and the Gupta Empire, as we learn how the Eternals are on Earth to protect humanity from the rainbow-colored, winged, snarling, voraciously violent Deviants. After the Deviants have seemingly been extinguished, the Eternals scattered to all corners of the globe and have been living quiet, anonymous lives — but when the Deviants emerge again in present day with more powerful capabilities than ever and start targeting the Eternals by taking down one of their key members, the band has to get back together, which means old rivalries and potential romances will rekindle. It’s like “Big Chill,” only without the Temptations and the Rolling Stones on the soundtrack (though there is a fantastic use of “Time” by Pink Floyd). Oh, and Madden’s fellow “Game of Thrones” star Kit Harrington is along for the ride as the obligatory Mortal Love Interest for Sersi (like Cersai!), who might be concealing a secret or two of his own. There are lot of players to keep track of in “Eternals,” and we haven’t even discussed the ridiculously overblown Arishem (voiced by David Kaye), who sounds like something out of a bad B-movie with his booming Voice of God pronouncements.  It’s a shame “Eternals” devolves into such a run-of-the-mill superhero movie, given it features some groundbreaking and/or relatively unusual elements, including a deaf character, an openly gay character and an actual lovemaking scene between two otherworldly entities (although it’s tamer than what you’d see in a 1950s romance). Regrettably, that’s not nearly enough to overcome the usual mix of sitcom bantering about cell phones and respective personality quirks alternating with ponderous debates about free will and genocide and the simultaneous blessing/curse of living for centuries — especially if you happen to fall in love with a mere mortal.",NEUTRAL
"Nov 6, 2021"," It took 13 years and two “Phases,” but friends, those crazy fiends at Marvel have finally done it: In Eternals, the latest dispatch from our most prolific purveyor of spandex cinema, two people finally got to have sex. The scene itself ends almost as soon as it begins, so a “detailed” description would be difficult to conjure. Let’s try it this way: Have you ever seen a 6-year-old lay a Ken doll on top of a Barbie doll and then just kind of stare at them because they don’t really know what happens next? That’s basically what we’re working with here. It’s not just that the scene is awkward—although it definitely is. Or that it’s comically brief and bereft of any actual passion. It’s not even that Richard Madden and Gemma Chan, whose characters we’re supposed to believe have been in love for 5,000 years, share about as much chemistry as a gynecologist and their patient during a Pap smear throughout the film. (But seriously, how do two people that hot produce such a chilly, clinical vibe the second they touch?!) At the risk of sounding like one of the Marvel obsessives who will likely whine about the sex scene on Reddit for completely different reasons, it was the purposelessness of this moment that made it so mind-numbing to watch. It seemed to exist solely to make people stop making fun of Marvel for never doing these scenes in the first place—which might be why everything about the moment, from the bored expressions on the actors’ faces to the dull, lifeless cinematography, land like a deep sigh muttering, “Well, here you go.” The discourse surrounding Marvel’s apparent allergy to intimacy has existed for about as long as the MCU, as have conversations surrounding the films’ general lack of diversity and squeamishness around portraying openly gay characters on screen. Eternals seems determined to right these wrongs and continue Phase Two’s promise to improve on the limitations of Phase One. (You know, now that the series has already made its creators billions.) If only the film had anything to say. Eternals revolves around a group of quasi-immortal beings who cosplay as humans on Earth while essentially serving as the crappiest babysitters in the galaxy. They’re here to make sure things run smoothly but not to protect humanity from itself—a goal that makes little sense even to this puny human brain but that these millennia-old beings never bother to so much as question. When the group finally realizes their real purpose on Earth, however, they’re left with some Big Questions about what to do next.  At the center of it all, ostensibly, is an exploration of humanity—its nobility and its monstrosity. This is where the aforementioned plasticine sex scene comes in. The lack of intimacy between Chan’s matter-shifting Sersi and Richard Madden’s Superman-adjacent Ikaris highlights a deeper problem within both Eternals and the Marvel canon more broadly. There are actually three romances in Eternals. Brian Tyree Henry’s Phastos is one half of the MCU’s first same-sex couple, and Lauren Ridloff and Barry Keoghan’s Makkari and Druig share an ongoing flirtation throughout the film. Just like Sersi and Ikaris’ supposed love affair, however, none of these relationships feel believable—in part because the film itself seems so uninterested in them beyond whatever implications they might carry for the plot. Calling the MCU a plot-oriented machine feels hacky at this point—like pointing out that a lot of Star Wars takes place in space. That these films tend to lack emotional depth with only some exceptions is not necessarily a problem on its own; plenty of genre films root themselves in other corners of storytelling. But it does seem a little strange for a film that supposedly wants to say something about humanity to seem so uninterested in a crucial human experience. Maybe it’s nitpicking to wonder why, at the possible end of the world, Brian Tyree Henry’s character is kissing his lover without tongue—or why despite the actual chemistry Ridloff and Keoghan’s characters share, their relationship seems to receive the least attention from both the script and director Chloé Zhao. Just like the film’s awkward attempts to time-jump its way through human history, these relationships unfold through broad-strokes storytelling that erases any possibility for texture and nuance—qualities that set Zhao’s previous work in the indie world apart. Marvel’s brand is tackling “big themes” via superhero metaphor, a strategy its fans frequently invoke whenever another bad-faith discussion about Martin Scorsese ensues. WandaVision is all about grief, Black Widow is about trauma, and so on. But metaphor can only express so much, and at times Marvel’s abstraction can feel like a cop-out: Are the Eternals, a group of superhuman beings whose conversations revolve around whether or not humanity is worth saving, really the best vehicle for a nuanced commentary on humanity itself? These “people” apparently can’t even have sex right! If Eternals feels especially empty, perhaps it’s because it reveals the extent to which this cinematic universe’s “big themes” are mere window dressing. The ideas these films claim to explore feel increasingly like packaging for the actual product—a never-ending plot machine designed, above all, to sell movie tickets and Disney+ subscriptions for as long as people will keep paying.

"Nov 6, 2021"," Marvel finally does everything right—cool director, inclusive cast, new vibe—and gets slammed with bad reviews. Maybe “Eternals” isn’t that bad. Maybe we’re just tired of Marvel. This is a preview of our pop culture newsletter The Daily Beast’s Obsessed, written by senior entertainment reporter Kevin Fallon. To receive the full newsletter in your inbox each week, sign up for it here. In our new reality, there are life’s simple truths. Very famous, very rich people will be “immunized” idiots. Here in Pete Davidson’s New York, yet another celebrity woman will be photographed on dates with the comedy world’s most eligible tattooed noodle. And, if it’s a Friday, a new Marvel movie is premiering. That’s barely an exaggeration. This weekend, Marvel’s Eternals is released. That comes just two months after Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings premiered. Black Widow was two months before that. That’s not to mention the four TV series this year that produced weekly episodes—WandaVision, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, Loki, and What If…?—and the upcoming Hawkeye, out later this month. But for this oh-so brief window, the spotlight is on Eternals, the $200 million, 156-minute (lololol) entry into Phase Four of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It’s a peculiar one in the studio’s canon. We’ve become accustomed to talking about these movies in a way that’s almost become as streamlined as the aesthetic that the universe fastidiously adheres to. Yet we don’t seem to know quite what to make of this one. Outside of The Avengers-connected films, which turned its actors into global superstars, it features one of the studio’s most celebrity-stacked casts, with Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Game of Thrones alums Richard Madden and Kit Harrington, and Kumail Nanjiani’s discourse-igniting jacked body leading the credits. It is the first film from director Chloé Zhao after she made history at this year’s Oscars with Nomadland. It’s tracking to have, at least in pandemic-era terms, a stellar box-office debut. Yet it’s also, apparently, terrible? According to Rotten Tomatoes scores, so take that metric with a grain of salt, it is officially the worst movie Marvel has ever released. It is the first Marvel movie to be given a “rotten” rating. The Daily Beast’s own Tirhakah Love called it “one of Marvel’s emptiest movies yet,” ruling it “all bland fight sequences, cold flashbacks, and blank faces taking in stunning vistas.” Listen, The Eternals lost me at the phrase “156 minutes.” But hear me out: Is it really the worst Marvel movie yet? (Thor: The Dark World is right there.) Or are we just tired? Let’s first talk about that indifference. I’m so old that I remember when, 26 Marvel movies ago, they were call-all-your-friends, buy-your-tickets-ahead-of-time, let’s-chug-some-Red-Bull-and-go-at-midnight once-a-year events. Not only are these movies now being released in a saturated pop-culture market, competing against the roughly 300 TV shows released on streaming services each week, they are battling their own buzz. Or, maybe, Marvel doesn’t care about that buzz anymore; a two-month half-life is now enough time to cycle through people caring about a new Marvel movie and then forgetting about it. But I say people don’t necessarily forget about it; they get overwhelmed by it. Marvel fatigue is real. What we’re learning is that there is a treatment, too. It’s not caring about the new Marvel movie. Anecdotally, it seems that’s how many people seem to be medicating ahead of the release of Eternals. Once in a while, Marvel does something genuinely cool. The studio will actually recognize its place of power and, let’s face it, monopoly in the film industry and its influence, and take that responsibility seriously. With Eternals, Marvel seems to be listening to the conversations we’ve been having culturally… or, at least, pandering to them. A female woman of color was hired for the director’s chair and allowed to let her aesthetic disrupt the sometimes ridiculed visual formula mandated for Marvel movies. It features an inclusive cast, including Nanjiani, Gemma Chan, Brian Tyree Henry, and Lauren Ridloff, who is deaf. There is—gather your pearls for clutching—a sex scene. Not only is there a gay superhero, but he has kids and a husband, and is even allowed to kiss him! Then, after checking every box of what critics and commentators have said they wanted—even demanded—the movie is panned to the point of “worst ever” labels? If you listen closely, you can almost hear a Marvel executive bellowing in his office, “WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME??!!” Obviously, when you’re doing “firsts” on a scale at the level of a Marvel movie, you’re going to get side-eyed by people who aren’t satisfied. Yes, Zhao’s sunbursts and landscape shots are stunning, but are they compatible with a superhero movie? Yes, there are major strides happening in representation. At the same time, congrats to all women who look like Salma Hayek, who finally can feel validated. Then, too, there’s the question of at what cost? Marvel made Kumail Nanjiani extremely hot. And also possibly gave him body dysmorphia? It’s about time for there to be sex in a Marvel movie. We are finally acknowledging that, beneath those spandex suits, there are pee pees and vajayjays. More—and would you believe it—the people whose lives exist on a level of adrenaline normal humans may never know would actually use those body parts after a busy day of saving the world. That said, according to my colleague Laura Bradley, the sex scene is not worth it: “Have you ever seen a 6-year-old lay a Ken doll on top of a Barbie doll and then just kind of stare at them because they don’t really know what happens next? That’s basically what we’re working with here.” And I think we’re all tired of film studios acting like they threw the first brick at Stonewall because they dared do something as brave as acknowledge that there are gay people in the world. Hooray, the MCU’s first gay superhero! And he knows how to kiss! Also, the movie apparently blames him for the bombing of Hiroshima. So let’s all just take a minute to unpack that. The annoying thing about the Marvel onslaught and the ensuing exhaustion is that it makes things that should be important so messy and, as reviews show, so easy to criticize. There’s the classic Hollywood cautionary tale, that if you try to be progressive and it isn’t well-received that no one will try again. That’s an obvious fear here, given the lukewarm critical reception. But then there is the way fans are reacting. The extremists seem to be split. Some tried to “review bomb” IMDb with one-star reviews out of homophobic outrage that there is a gay character. Others have accused critics of being racist or homophobic themselves by not supporting a film that is inclusive. Those two things would ordinarily be written off as sideshows amidst a groundswell of excitement for a tentpole Marvel movie, except, in this case, the groundswell doesn’t exist. The studio has stopped bothering with tents, so now the circus runs free. Those distractions become the story. So does the indifference.",NEGATIVE

"Nov 5, 2021"," Eternals, the latest entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, arrives today with a great deal of fanfare and curiosity. While Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings was certainly a relatively unknown character, Eternals takes it a few steps farther by bringing a whopping ten new heroes into the MCU, all at once, all without any prior appearances. And while — spoiler alert, sort of — not all ten of them make it out of the film, it’s still a somewhat overwhelming ensemble introduction.  Combine this with the wild, intergalactic nature of the characters — the Eternals are ancient beings sent by the Celestials (the ancient, galaxy-building entities who created the universe, sort of?) millennia ago to protect new planets from the voracious Deviants — and you’ve got a lot to take in. From there, you’ve got the Eternals fracturing and scattering themselves across the globe, the return of the once-extinct deviants, and a whole mess of other, densely plotted machinations, all crammed into 157 minutes.  It’s no surprise then that despite all that’s happening in Eternals, one never quite feels caught up. Cramming that much history into one film is a challenge, and certainly one that director Chloé Zhao seems game for. She’s painstakingly crafted a niche for these strange, immortal heroes, giving them each a vibrant story of love and loss and how they’ve grown to embrace humanity in different ways — some teach them, some entertain them, some protect them, some simply watch them. But those individual stories are the real heart of Eternals, but also its greatest misstep. Because while this isn’t an origin story — thank goodness — it is a history of the Eternals, and frankly that’s a long-ass history. So just as you’re starting to feel a connection to them, you’re quickly whisked away to the next location and the next character as they rapidly try to rebuild the team in the face of the looming threat. That looming threat is the next problem. Much like the faceless monster hordes of Thanos, the Deviants aren’t characters so much as they’re filler, creatively designed beasts with no will or personality. While that does change farther into the film, it’s a far cry from their comic book counterparts — the Deviants are distinct, intelligent, malevolent lifeforms in the comics, not mindless wild beasts. It’s a frustrating departure for readers, but equally frustrating for new viewers because there’s just … not much there beyond they’re bestial nature and the mystery of their return. All of that said, Eternals is also a stunningly beautiful film, filled with natural cinematography and less reliance on CGI than a lot of its predecessors. Its set design is lovely, the costuming is sumptuous and vivid, and the locales that they travel to are all startlingly gorgeous. It’s wonderful to look at, as is its cast — and what a cast it is. Gemma Chan, Richard Madden, Kumail Nanjiani, Lia McHugh, Brian Tyree, Angelina Jolie, Don Lee, Barry Keoghan, Salma Hayek, Kit Harington, Lauren Ridloff — it’s an absolute murderer’s row, full of diverse faces and talents and backgrounds. The way that Eternals effortlessly embraces that diversity is nothing less than heartwarming, not just the main cast, but the way they travel through the ages and across the globe, observing different cultures and languages. If you made the film into a TV series simply about the Eternals travels through history, learning about other cultures? I’d absolutely watch it. Perhaps that’s the problem, though. There’s simply too much stuffed into the film, and while it’s lovely to look at and filled with admirable performances, it somehow never resonated. That lack of resonation is mostly due to pacing issues that plague the film, dragging to unexpected halts here and there, and then dizzying and abrupt take offs. There are twists aplenty, but it’s hard to care about them too much because frankly, you’ve never been given enough time to care about the characters and story in the first place.  It’s odd to say that you don’t have enough time in a two-and-a-half-hour film that’s stuffed to the gills with ideas, but that’s what causes it to stumble — despite its variety and its length, you never have time to actually just enjoy the characters. Maybe it needed separate, Avengers-style origin entries, either films or TV shows or web-series. I would never say that Eternals is a bad film — there’s too much beauty and grace in Zhao’s storytelling to give it so crass a descriptor. It’s enjoyable, and it’s funny, and its actors truly are terrific. Perhaps it’s too much of what it doesn’t need, and not enough of what it does. Or maybe it’s something simpler — maybe it’s that Marvel’s reach finally exceeded its grasp. ",POSITIVE
"Nov 5, 2021"," Marvel fans, myself included, rejoiced and celebrated the studio’s first lead Asian superhero film Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings when it was released. It was a moment of excitement, of finally seeing ourselves represented on the big screen, and in arguably the biggest movie franchise right now. This pivotal moment, and subsequently how well the film performed at the box office, proved that Asian leads and our stories are worth investing in. Months later, Marvel’s newest film, Eternals, helmed by Academy Award-winning director Chloé Zhao, proves to be their most ambitiously diverse film yet. When I wrote about Shang-Chi, I praised the film for how much it helped me connect with my Asian roots. Growing up in an Asian household in Latin America had made me feel “othered.” Shang-Chi spoke to the Asian side of my intersectional identity, one that I had dreamed of seeing on the big screen ever since I was young. And while it helped mend a gap between me and my identity, the film wasn’t able to represent me in my entirety.  The beauty of Eternals isn’t just the breathtaking cinematography or the jaw-dropping fight sequences, but rather its deep connection to humanity. Zhao devotes herself to making sure the film is full of organic representation, from having a kind and empathetic Asian woman as the protagonist, played by Gemma Chan, and a strong and nurturing Latine woman as the leader of the Eternals, played by Salma Hayek.  Zhao’s commitment to diversity doesn’t stop there, as she continues to explore intersectionality through Makkari, Marvel’s first deaf superhero, played by Lauren Ridloff, who perfectly embodies the complexities of intersectionality as she’s a deaf, Afro-Latine woman. Furthermore, Zhao introduces Marvel’s first openly gay superhero to the big screen, Phastos, played by Brian Tyree Henry, in an effort to show that everyone’s story matters.  Eternals accurately represents just how diverse humanity actually is. And our heroes diversity allows them to do just that. What’s even more impressive, is that the film’s representation is present all the way throughout the film by having tough conversations about mental health, what toxic and healthy relationships look like, and what it means to be human. Zhao even manages to showcase Asian men with Kingo, played by Kumail Nanjiani, and Gilgamesh, played by Don Lee, demonstrating that Asian men can have a range of personalities, motivations, and even body types.  Ultimately, Eternals proves that anyone can be a superhero, it doesn’t matter what we look like, who we choose to love, and the disabilities we have. Our differences aren’t divisive, but rather can bring us closer together. And while Zhao’s film will not be for everyone, it doesn’t have to be.  This movie will resonate with the people that need it the most, like me. Because every last bit of who I am, from my cultural upbringing to what I look like and my sexuality, are all represented in this film. And that is why this film, this story, and these characters matter so much — because every human being out there deserves to have every facet of their identity validated and represented in the heroes they love. ",POSITIVE
"Nov 5, 2021"," In Marvel’s busy, little pen of comic book films, Eternals is the stallion kicking at the gate. It’s the most independent-minded of the lot, though you can sense it smacking up against the limits of the form time and time again. That has a lot to do with the figure behind the lens, director Chloé Zhao, who’s followed up her Oscar-winning Nomadland with a blockbuster that strives for the same expansive soulfulness, but discovers there’s room enough only for the occasional burst of it. That’s not to say that a comic book film can never achieve profundity, and there are moments both here and in the wider Marvel canon that possess a sincere and simple beauty – the calling cards of love and sacrifice, duty and empowerment. But these films, after all, are the union between art and commerce at its most tempestuous, locked into a cycle of franchise expectations, box office receipts, and merchandise sales. The hiring of Zhao, a thoroughly independent filmmaker at heart, reads as a bid for the kind of artistic ambition that Martin Scorsese clearly thought was lacking when he dismissed the entire genre as non-cinema. And while I don’t ultimately agree with his sentiments, Eternals does beg the question: what exactly do we want from our comic book movies? Marvel has already landed on top – does it really feel the need to disguise itself as something else in order to be taken seriously? Zhao’s own interest in Eternals is clear. Her work is thoroughly invested in the core decency of humanity and here she gets to revisit those same themes through the lens of the outsider, cosmic beings known as the Eternals – the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s own guardian angels. Created by a celestial named Arishem, who oversees the birth and death of entire worlds, they’re given a single task in life: rid planet Earth of an invading alien species known as the “Deviants”. They must not intervene in any other matter, no matter how much it pains them to see humanity suffer. They'd crop up whenever and wherever Deviants attacked – Mesopotamia, Babylon, the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan, the Gupta Empire – but have since scattered across the globe and integrated into society, believing the Deviants to finally be defeated and gone. Until now, of course, though why they’ve returned is a mystery. The closest thing Eternals has to a protagonist is Sersi (Gemma Chan, who shoulders her second role in the MCU after 2019’s Captain Marvel with grace). She serves as a figurehead for Zhao’s own empathy, with an added ability to transmute matter. The rest of the team feels nicely balanced – there’s Ikaris (Richard Madden), Sersi’s brooding ex, and Sprite (Lia McHugh), who’s stuck forever looking like a 12-year-old child. Then there’s their leader Ajak (Salma Hayek), inventor Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), speedster Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), Bollywood star Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), the brawny Gilgamesh (Don Lee), and the emo Druig (Barry Keoghan). Angelina Jolie, as Thena, quietly paces the edges of the frame, exuding cinematic regality. It’s a weighty cast of characters and familiar faces, and Zhao’s simplest, most impressive achievement is the ability to give them all discernable personalities beyond a few strung-together quips. In fact, what comes through strongest in Eternals isn’t, necessarily, the look of Zhao’s films, but the spirit of them. Her usual cinematographer, Joshua James Richards, has been replaced here with Marvel regular Ben Davis – and, more crucially, the earthy spirituality of her camerawork has to contend with the aggressive sheen of far too much CGI. It gets particularly awkward in the action sequences, where the division between what is purely Zhao, and what’s already been processed through teams of previs artists planning out special effects shots, makes it feel as if we’re cutting between two entirely different films. But the filmmaker has enjoyed more freedom elsewhere. Eternals has been praised as the MCU’s most diverse film yet, and not just in terms of gender and race – Makkari is its first deaf superhero, played by a deaf actor, and Phastos kisses his mortal husband (Haaz Sleiman) onscreen without the camera cutting nervously away. It’s also the first instalment to feature a sex scene, and there’s some genuine romantic tension throughout the film – even if it’s of the very solemn kind that only the deathless and lonely ever truly experience. The irony of Eternals is that, despite its characters explicitly tussling with their own lack of humanity, Zhao has delivered one of the most emotionally grounded entries in the entire franchise. She puts into full view the kind of moral quandaries that Marvel’s only ever really danced around in the past – the cost of individual life, or whether humanity is even worth saving in the first place. But there’s only so much room for that kind of thought, and an attempt to explore technology’s complicity in evil, by invoking the bombing of Hiroshima, sits uneasily next to gags about vibranium and Captain America. If Marvel wants to change up its game, it’s going to take a hell of a lot more than simply hiring the hottest indie talent around and slotting them into the same old system. Is that a risk the studio’s ever going to be willing to take?",NEUTRAL

"Nov 5, 2021"," This was bound to happen at some point, a filmmaker goes from winning Oscars for Best Director and Best Picture to helming a Marvel Comics movie. The studio did hire Chloé Zhao to make Eternals before Nomadland had even come out in theaters, one of a string of perspicacious director hires that has helped make this film series so successful. If you figured Zhao would do something unorthodox with Eternals, you are pretty perspicacious yourself. This is easily the strangest of the Marvel films, one that uses the formula to ponder cosmic questions about the meaning of human existence. It’s like the Marvel version of The Tree of Life. It should be much worse than it is. The title characters are a group of 10 ageless, godlike alien beings dispatched to Mesopotamia in 5000 B.C. to aid the development of human civilization by exterminating the monsters called Deviants, which killed the dinosaurs. The alien beings seem to have succeeded by the 16th century A.D., so the one named Sersi (Gemma Chan) is quite surprised in the present day when a Deviant attacks her and her boyfriend (Kit Harington) while they’re walking home through London one night. The boyfriend, who only knows her as a museum curator, is even more surprised when she saves his life by transmogrifying an oncoming bus into a heap of rose petals. To face the new threat, she has to reunite the Eternals from their far corners of the globe: Thena (Angelina Jolie), once the group’s fiercest fighter, is now a PTSD case living in the Australian outback; Druig (Barry Keoghan) has, unsettlingly, become a god to his own cult in the Amazon jungle; Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani) is, hilariously, hiding in plain sight as an Indian movie star. This story isn’t tied down to a single time period or place, which allows Zhao to bring all of Disney/Marvel’s resources to bear in re-creating Babylon in the 6th century B.C., where Sersi and Ikaris (an Irish-accented Richard Madden) fall in love, or the Gupta Empire of Northern India a thousand years later, where they are married in a Hindu ceremony. The group and the marriage both break up in 1521 over the leader (Salma Hayek) preventing them from intervening when the Spanish conquistadors massacre the Aztecs in Tenochtitlán. The Eternals are expressly forbidden from taking sides in such matters, which is also why they didn’t join the Avengers against Thanos, but Sersi soon discovers that her kind aren’t meant to be much better than those conquistadors. These historical settings are rendered vividly enough to turn you hot and cold, and Zhao films a Bollywood dance number like it’s something she always wanted to do. (This movie has more Indian stuff than you might expect.) Still, her transition from the grit of Nomadland and The Rider to the maximalism of this movie has its rough patches. The pacing is noticeably off during the early going, and the central romance doesn’t hold — Chan shows more chemistry with Harington than with his Game of Thrones co-star Madden. You could fairly say that the Marvel films have never been good with romance, but we saw The Avengers handle the “getting the band together” part of the story more adroitly. The movie takes its cue from Kingo’s personal documentarian (Harish Patel), who says, “We need action sequences!” while filming a fight against the Deviants. Those are dutifully included and executed reasonably well on their own, but they don’t fit the rest of the film’s tone of wonderstruck awe at the history of human accomplishments. Nevertheless, Eternals enjoys fitful moments of inspiration when dwelling on the latter. It’s a brave thing to take the series into mystical territory, and I can’t help but admire how elastic the Marvel formula has proved, accommodating the racial commentary of Black Panther, the antic comedy of Thor: Ragnarok, and the teen drama of the Spider-Man films. Then, too, having an Asian woman glimpse the secret of the universe (and having Angelina Jolie give her a pep talk about how she needs to be the group’s new leader) is something Hollywood hasn’t given us until now. This crazy ambitious move from the reigning Hollywood franchise is a mess where the Dune remake is tidier, but given the choice between them, I’d watch Eternals again first.",POSITIVE
"Nov 5, 2021","Zhao's deep sense of the rhythms that pass unspoken between people... are exactly what makes Eternals such a memorable, unfamiliar and refreshing film to watch.",POSITIVE
"Nov 5, 2021"," Before we get into anything else, it must be said that Marvel’s Eternals tries very hard to do something new and interesting with the studio’s long-established formula. For this, at least, it deserves some credit.  Chloé Zhao is a smart, compassionate, humanistic filmmaker, and those aspects combined with the subject matter—ageless humanoids sent by an all-powerful celestial being to protect Earth from intergalactic nasties—creates a uniquely heady dramatic springboard.  All this aside, Eternals definitely doesn’t jive with the context of the Marvel universe we’ve been given thus far, and tonally it’s a bit of a mess. It’s a real oddity in the studio’s canon, perhaps the first unsuccessful attempt at a Marvel franchise-starter. Eternals is unwieldy and exposition-heavy in a way that makes you appreciate the drawn-out nature of something like Denis Villeneuve’s Dune.  However, there’s something unavoidably interesting going on here that’s hard to dismiss out of hand. To paraphrase Daniel Craig’s Benoit Blanc, it makes no damn sense, but it does compel me. Summarizing Eternals is no easy feat, but let’s see if we can do it. Long ago, Earth was created by a giant being called Arishem, and it was good, except that in addition to humans, it was also populated by a race of creatures called deviants, who are violent and dangerous.  To take care of the Deviants, Arishem sent the Eternals, superpowered heroes from a planet called Olympia. The group, led by Prime Eternal Ajak (Salma Hayek), lands on the planet in prehistoric times, and sticks around for its entire history. When the Deviants reappear in modern times after centuries of dormancy, the now-dispersed Eternals must come back together to save the planet. The pat answer the film gives is that they were instructed only to interfere in Deviant-related incidents. The longer answer takes us on a journey that addresses questions of divine planning, human suffering, and free will.  That philosophical edge is new territory for Marvel, and the questions it raises are good ones that feel appropriate to Zhao’s wheelhouse. They’re complemented by some of the most interesting landscape photography we’ve seen in a Marvel movie yet, another distinctive contribution by Zhao.  Some of the characters, like Angelina Jolie’s warrior Thena, have arcs that address the long-term existential issues of living through centuries of battle and human tragedy. Others, like Gemma Chan’s more maternal Sersi, consider the dual nature of humanity’s capacity for love as well as cruelty. Unfortunately, the film’s strict adherence to the Marvel formula keeps the whole enterprise from really working. The Eternals and their world don’t fit well into the reality the series has given us thus far, as exemplified by the fact that the events of previous Avengers movies are only brought up in passing, and nothing in these films directly connects us to any institutions, characters, or locations in that universe.  There’s a lot of backstories here that get explained in novel-length exposition dumps. Were Eternals its own independent entity, rather than beholden to the Avengers framework, it might have had more space to breathe and gradually develop. The requirement that Eternals be a four-quadrant blockbuster in the Marvel mold also means that its more introspective tone clashes with a need to throw in lighthearted jokes and bombast. Kumail Nanjiani’s Kingo, for instance, is an excellent character in his own right, but feels out of place beside Chan, Jolie, Hayek, or characters like Richard Madden’s stoic hero Ikaris, who seems like sustained smiling might make his face crack. You can’t help but appreciate the intention behind Eternals, which feels like it has an actual artistic vision that brings something refreshingly thoughtful to the superhero genre.  It’s hard, however, not to feel like this was a doomed prospect from the start. This is an uneven movie that’s still fascinating to unpack and consider—both the parts that work and the parts that don’t. I suspect that regardless of its financial success or initial reception, it will remain an interesting cultural artifact. ",NEGATIVE

"Nov 5, 2021","Eternals tries to work with a lot of moving parts and takes some really big swings. Sometimes it hits, and sometimes it doesn't. For that reason, Eternals and Chloé Zhao deserve credit for giving the MCU something more original.",POSITIVE
"Nov 5, 2021"," Well, it’s been a couple months since the last one, so I guess it’s time for another entry from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This time, we’re introduced to an entirely new team known as Eternals. Eternals are superpowered beings from the planet Olympia. They were brought to Earth in 5000 BC by Arishem, who’s part of a race of supreme beings called Celestials, to protect the planet from horrible creatures called Deviants. The Eternals defeated the last Deviant around five hundred years ago, and have been living among humans all this time, waiting for word from Arishem that they can finally go home. After a global earthquake, new Deviants appear, ones with vastly superior strength and abilities than their predecessors, making them much harder to kill. The Eternals, spread across the globe and living their own lives, must now reunite to defeat the Deviants once and for all. Yet, it’s a fight that will lead them to the truth about their own existence. The major hurdle, of course, is how it needs to introduce a boatload of characters to the general audience, along with introducing how they differ from their comics counterparts to those with more knowledge of the source material. While they handle this well by sprinkling the main story with flashbacks, it’s still a lot for one single movie. There’s another issue that I can’t really go into specifics on since it would have a touch of the spoiler to it. Suffice it to say, part of the plot has a what is/what isn’t back and forth that a day later I still can’t decide if it’s problematic for the plot or an interesting creative choice. This all sounds like I didn’t like Eternals. In fact, for the most part, I really enjoyed myself. I wasn’t as blown away by it as I was when I walked out of Shang-Chi, but I was similarly impressed with how well director Chloé Zhao stepped from the role of independent filmmaker to blockbuster franchise filmmaker as I was with Black Widow director Cate Shortland, who was in the same boat. The action and the lighter moments are ultimately what save the film. While there’s plenty of heaviness to the plot, given its millennia of history, the actors bring to the table that fun, snarky needling that happens between friends who’ve known each other a very long time. It really drives home the idea that, despite their differences, they all love each other somewhere deep down inside. The action sequences are well-executed, too. Nothing’s overdone or too fast to tell what’s actually going on, a trap some CGI battles have fallen into over the years. They also have a clear motivation and clear consequences. Not everything about the film has a happy ending. For her first time in the blockbuster game, Chloé Zhao doesn’t exactly hit it out of the park, but she still gets an A for effort.

"Nov 5, 2021"," When Doctor Strange came along, the MCU moved from the world of people with powers into the supernatural realm of magic. Likewise, Chloé Zhao’s Eternals now pushes us further into concepts of religion, mythology, and “where the hell did we all come from?” We were first introduced to the cosmic beings, the Celestials, in Guardians of the Galaxy. For the sake of simplicity, Celestials are god-like beings that exist in the universe holding the suns and planets together. The Celestial Arishem oversees Earth and sent ten Eternals, immortal beings, to protect the Earth from the deviants — vicious creatures that are not native to this part of the galaxy and steal the soul/energy of humans — 7,000 years ago. The leader of the Eternals is Ajak (Salma Hayek). She has healing powers and is Arishem’s direct conduit to the Eternals executing all his commands. Thena (Angelina Jolie) and Gilgamesh (Don Lee) are the warriors. Both have extraordinary fighting abilities. Thena can summon a sword and shield on command, and Gilgamesh has brute strength. Thena also has intergalactic PTSD. Makkari (Lauren Ridloff) has Quicksilver-like speed, and Ikaris (Richard Madden) is basically Superman… a joke told in the middle of the movie. The eternally adolescent Sprite (Lia McHugh) can manipulate perceptions through illusions. Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry) is the engineer and builder of new technology. Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani) captures energy and turns it into a powerful weapon, while Druig (Barry Keoghan) can control minds. But, most importantly, there’s Sersi (Gemma Chan), who can change the state of organic matter. With a single touch, she can turn water into wine, or metal., or wood, and so on. While an ensemble team, Eternals is Sersi’s story, and the main narrative opens with her posing as a historian and archaeologist in London. She’s dating Dane Whitman (Kit Harington). After an awkward date where Sersi rebuffs Dane’s request to move in with him, Sersi, Dane, and Sprite are attacked by deviants. But these deviants have evolved, and now Sersi needs to get the gang back together.  We now begin to flashback and forth to the Eternals’ first appearance on Earth, thousands of years ago, and the present day. In comic book fashion, the rest of the crew have integrated themselves into human society as well. Now our heroes must defeat the deviants once and for all. Naturally, issues arise with a very twisty, spin-you-on-your-head complication. But honestly, this heady story exists solely to fulfill the superhero content we demand from Marvel Studios. Honestly, I get slightly annoyed at big cultural events. There's only one reason why Marvel Studios made Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, and... Perhaps incorrectly, I'm assuming that you have seen all of the other films in the MCU if you're reading this Black Widow review. It makes the most... So, we’re now two films in on the third iteration of Spider-Man. I love the Tom-Holland Spider-Man so much. The big difference with the third go-round is...

"Nov 5, 2021"," CHICAGO – At some point, everything evolves. This isn’t something that’s exclusive to Pokemon, but a process that all of us have undergone to get to where we are. Evolution is always gradual, only made noticeable to us in retrospect. Are you exactly the same person that you were 10 years ago? Hopefully not. There will come a point when we look back at Eternals with much more generous eyes and realize that not only is this a good film, but a necessary one.  I won’t say that this comic book property is an obscure one because I don’t want any of the ire from fanboys yelling reasons at me for why this property is so well-known. What I will say is that it is not one I’m at all familiar with, at least not to the caliber of some of Marvel’s other juggernauts like Iron-Man, Captain America, Thor, etc. Part of the excitement I had going into Eternals stemmed from not knowing a single thing about any character or knowing what role they played in the MCU as a whole. Nothing is going to prepare you for what it is like to experience this film, and that is where the biggest problem arises.  When you’ve seen as many films as I have, you begin to notice patterns or formulas that live in the genetic make-up of certain movies. DC film fans appreciate their darker, more tonally serious approach because the grit feels more real-world, making the stakes feel more personal. Marvel film fans tend to love the more lighthearted, humor-heavy tones in their films, appreciating being transported to other worlds and all the fantasy elements that come with them. Very rarely will you find someone who likes both, and this is where the preference for one over the other will dominate how you end up viewing this film. Director and co-writer Chloé Zhao creates a superpowered experience that hasn’t been done on such a big-budget scale. That is not to say that this hasn’t been done at all because some of my favorite films from that specific genre, like Fast Color and Chronicle, all employ similar approaches, but were all considered indie films. It makes sense that Zhao would use a similar technique, especially since the focus of her films is always on natural beauty, both in location and in the spirit of the people/characters involved. There is an undeniable muted approach—when compared to other Marvel films—she uses in Eternals that both remind us that these stories are set in our world, but also that they involve beings that are not from it. While the visual style might be enough to alienate those who have come to expect the typical candy-colored comic palette, my biggest issue comes from the narrative structure.  We all remember when Justice League rushed out of production in order to compete with the monumental box office success of the Avengers, trying to run when most of the characters hadn’t even learned how to walk. The myriad of plot issues aside, the biggest issue with Justice League is that they didn’t lay the groundwork for this in the way Marvel did for their epic team-up. There was little to no attachment to these characters because we hadn’t seen these iterations before, and the brief introductions to them were obviously and necessarily rushed. Enter the Eternals, full of characters we are meeting for the first time, already geared up and with a history we’re not privy to (at least not until later in the film). The narrative structure, while essential for the type of story it is trying to tell, comes with risks. Since we can’t know about the history of our characters, we don’t get to see much, if any, individual development that would endear them to us. Even when we do see one of them on-screen by themselves, they are almost immediately joined by a team member or other main character.  If you’re not put off by the ponderous pacing or the humble lack of gaudy flair, this film offers not only an evolution of the comic book film genre but also a revolution in representation. A diverse cast consisting of stars like Salma Hayek, Gemma Chan, Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry, Lauren Ridloff, and Ma Dong-seok (Don Lee) is already a great start, but being able to see that representation on-screen is monumental. Without going too into specifics, we see great queer and deaf representation, something Marvel/Disney has shied away from in the past. This film, although flawed in a few ways, is the essential next step this genre needs to take. Supporting this film and the promise it has delivered is important because the time is fast approaching where the same old approach will bore even the audience that currently clamors for it. I can only hope that Marvel will let other auteur filmmakers take a crack at some of their properties because while the status quo well hasn’t run dry just yet, it is getting very close to not being able to quench our thirsts.

"Nov 5, 2021"," ""Poetic."" ""Contemplative."" ""Malickian."" The adjectives used to talk about Chloé Zhao's films tend to be recycled, a testament to a signature style that's earned her rave reviews on the festival circuit, a history-making Oscar, and one of the most lucrative invitations in the industry: to direct a Marvel Universe film. But aside from a few more nature shots than you'd find in a typical superhero movie, Zhao's hallmarks are suspiciously absent in her first outing for the MCU, the ensemble film Eternals, out this Friday. With a $200 million budget — nearly 40 times that of Zhao's second-most-expensive feature — Eternals was doubtlessly subjected to the same short leash that has led to a number of other stylish auteurs to split with Disney over ""creative differences"" in the past. But Zhao's willingness to play ball apparently cost the film her considerable talents as well: Eternals is an uncharacteristically sloppy misfire. Zhao's fingerprints aren't entirely absent, especially in portions of the story that take place in her geographical comfort zone, South Dakota. An astonishing establishing shot of the prairie at sunset is particularly Zhaoesque. Writing for The Atlantic, ​​Shirley Li also positively credits the film's ""singular humanistic vision"" to Zhao. But this is a film that runs over 150 minutes, and those glimpses of Zhao are few. In between, there are an exceptional amount of unnecessary cuts; rarely does the film hold a shot for more than a few seconds. One dialogue scene, in which a character confesses love for another, is stitched together from nearly 20 different shots no more than a second or two apiece. That's a cobbled-together method which tends to suggest a lack of confidence in the actors — or significant script rewrites in post. Either way, it's unusual in a Zhao film; she once let a camera roll on the set of her sophomore film The Rider ""for two 40-minute takes,"" RogerEbert.com reports, just to get the footage required for 20 much slower, more purposeful shots. That's the sort of creative gamble you have the freedom to take on an independent film. But Marvel is in the business of making a profit, which means Zhao was almost certainly subject to production constraints and steered away from any aesthetic risks that might alienate fans. Take the action sequences: Marvel has historically struggled with its fight scenes, and Eternals doesn't escape the dynamism problems that come from having superheroes battle CGI monsters on a green screen. While Zhao's talent for natural lighting is on display in all her previous films, in these scenes the light is flattening and uniform, and her color palette is drab. In fairness, there may be no director in the world who could've made these sequences look good without investing in a high-quality fight choreographer, the time and talent to properly light each shot, and more practical effects. Those are all expensive and time-consuming asks, and, to cut costs and maximize profit, Marvel would usually rather get the job done using a non-union CGI shop. ""We're treated as a disposable short-term workforce"" is how one VFX veteran put it to The Independent. Zhao, for her part, reportedly had to ""really [fight]"" for the practical locations she did get on this film. I don't blame Zhao for taking the job and trying to make the best of it. It's difficult to finance a ""poetic,"" ""contemplative"" film like The Rider — but a whole lot easier to do so when you're a director with a Marvel blockbuster under your belt. When the cards are stacked against you as both a woman and a minority filmmaker, you take the opportunities you get. Still, a filmmaker as proven as Zhao doesn't forget how to make movies. Only, hand-in-hand with Marvel, you just might think she has. Jeva Lange was the executive editor at TheWeek.com. She formerly served as The Week's deputy editor and culture critic.

Marvel’s been going through an experimental phase of late. TV shows WandaVision and Loki went really high-concept, with good results. Shang-Chi was more fun buddy comedy than action spectacular. But experiments don’t always work. Departing from Marvel’s snarky, wham-bam formula, Eternals is an attempt to do straight-faced sci-fi. Sadly, the result is over-stuffed and underpowered. Marvel nabbed director Chloé Zhao before she won her Oscar for Nomadland. You can see why she was picked. Eternals is a story about humanity and nature versus nurture. Zhao likes unhurried stories that dig into the human condition, but she has little time to scratch beneath the surface with Eternals. With ten new heroes and a story that covers all human history, there’s simply too much to get through. The Eternals are God-like alien beings, sent to Earth by a bigger God-like being to protect humankind from not-entirely-explained monsters called Deviants. Eternals have been on Earth for 7,000 years, sworn not to interfere unless Deviants are involved. They’ve watched wars, genocide and endless destruction, reluctantly letting humans make their own mess. After millennia on standby, they’ve gone their separate ways. Then the Deviants return. With a script that’s largely exposition, many actors struggle here. Poor Gemma Chan and Richard Madden don’t stand a chance with Sersi and Ikaris. She’s the earnest heart of the group, with the ability to transform matter and the inability to enjoy herself. He has the powers of Superman but not the humanising Clark Kent personality. Their romance has all the fizz of 7,000-year-old lemonade. Brian Tyree Henry is the most fleshed-out as a mechanical genius who grows tired of humans using technology to kill each other and just wants to live quietly with his husband and child. Angelina Jolie, an old hand at bringing oomph to poorly-written blockbusters, shows everybody how a movie star does it, swaggering about as warrior Thena. There are beginnings of interesting-ish stories for the others, exploring how Gods might amuse themselves on Earth – Barry Keoghan’s mind-controlling Druig builds himself a small cult – but they’re abandoned before they’ve begun. Many MCU movies tail off toward the end, as CG fisticuffs take over. Eternals improves in its last half-hour, finally creating some meaty conflict within the group and pulling out grand, odd imagery after hours of flat visuals that get poor value from the $200 million budget. It’s a late, small reprieve for a movie that has some bold intentions but dreary execution. You have to commend the effort to take the MCU in a different direction, but there’s little else worthy of applause.

"Nov 5, 2021"," The 10 alleged superheroes that make up this ""Avengers"" knock-off, costumed as if headed to an ABBA reunion concert, spend much of the film's 157-minute running time standing around, bickering about what they're supposed to be doing. One of them is admonished by another to stop playing with her smartphone, dammit, and just focus.  These infernal Eternals include solemn Sersi (Gemma Chan), arrogant Ikaris (Richard Madden), scattered Thena (Angelina Jolie), stoic Gilgamesh (Don Lee), clowning Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), pissed-off Druig (Barry Keoghan), athletic Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), frustrated Sprite (Lia McHugh), conflicted Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry) and finally noble Ajak (Salma Hayek), their fearless leader.  Sersi is the smartphone addict, perhaps distracted by the fact she has a regular-dude boyfriend (Kit Harington) whom she can't decide whether to move in with and an Eternals ex-boyfriend, Ikaris, whom she dated for a thousand years and still can't quit.  They were sent down from the heavens thousands of years ago, riding a spacecraft shaped like a giant fanny pack, to rid Earth of a menace called Deviants, prehistoric wolf-lizards that appear to be made out of roadkill and bundles of elastic bands. Marvel's piggy bank is enormous; why is it suddenly cheaping out on monsters?  One of the great things about Zhao's low-key filmmaking style, very much in evidence in last year's Oscar champ ""Nomadland"" (my favourite film of 2020) and in her earlier ""The Rider,"" is her ability to  make the personal seem universal. She inverts this with ""Eternals,"" her Marvel debut, attempting and failing to make the universal seem personal. This  gambit might work in some circumstances, but it surely doesn't here, in a comic-book fantasy that mistakes lethargy for profundity. There are few laughs to be had, a fatal error. The running jape about Nanjiani's Kingo being a Bollywood star who wants to make an ""Eternals"" doc starring himself gets old immediately.  Zhao introduces welcome diversity to the Marvel Cinematic Universe — there are gay characters and a deaf one — and also some decorous superhero sex. It's one of the movie's few pluses. Yet these advances end up as just part of the expositional pile-on, in a script Zhao co-wrote with a committee of oh-so-serious cookies.  Nobody wants to watch superheroes standing around arguing — and arguing — whether they should bother saving the planet. Not helping one bit is the twilight hour cinematography, which looked evocative in Zhao's earlier films but just seems under-exposed and lifeless here.",NEGATIVE
"Nov 5, 2021"," Both grandiloquent and deeply silly, Eternals posits that the mammoth designs of intergalactic beings determine whether or not earthlings live in harmony or descend into chaos. Ergo a gaggle of godlike humanoids have quietly watched over the planet like guardian angels since the dawn of civilization. They’re on the lookout for creatures called deviants, who want to ravage humanity. Why exactly? Not sure, except that they’re a glitch in the matrix of master builders called Celestials who commanded the Eternals to be Earth’s sentinels while they seed the universe so that future Celestials can be born. One assumes that a different set of Eternals are watching over similar planets menaced by other deviants? Maybe that’s another movie. Does any of this make sense? Not really, nor does it make for zingy action-packed fun. There’s action, to be sure, but it’s not fun, and it doesn’t have much zing. Eternals is the first Marvel movie to open with literally four paragraphs of exposition, which it presents soberly in white text on black.  It feels like homework, and over the course of 156 minutes, the film regurgitates more information that seems important but really isn’t. Basically, mighty powers beyond their control have double-crossed our heroes, and there are only seven days left before Earth is torn asunder. Never have the stakes been higher or as instantly forgettable in a Marvel movie as this. Same goes for these immortal beings, ten souls with marginally interesting superpowers. She runs fast! He shoots fireballs! She…manipulates inanimate matter? He…designs technology? They also have pompous, stumble-off-the-tongue names like Sersi (Gemma Chan), Ajak (Salma Hayek), Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), Makkari, and Druig. Catchy, right? One is a wise woman warrior whose name sounds a lot like Athena, even though it’s actually spelled Thena (Angelina Jolie). How do I know? She literally says so, correcting a well-intentioned person who had basic exposure to Greek myths. Speaking of which, Classics majors will fume that the Eternals come from an ostensible home planet called Olympia. And that Marvel has named another character Icarus, except it’s spelled Ikaris (Richard Madden). At least that dude does fly, albeit without any feathers or wax. No matter. They’ve all been on earth for 7,000 years even though they act like emo millennials. So much for cumulative sagacity or any weighted sense of zen enlightenment that might have come from such time-worn consciousness. They’d rather wise-crack than actually be wise. Plus, ex-lovers Sersi and Ikaris smashed a few thousand years ago, but they’re cool about it, except she now has a new boyfriend (Kit Harrington) and the dynamic is awkward. And Kingo is a Bollywood superstar whose manservant follows them around making a documentary about the group’s exploits. Huh? The Avengers, this is not. At least that supergroup had the decency to let audiences get to know each member individually before they assembled to fend off a different intergalactic threat. Eternals throws you stone-cold right into the melee, giving you more people to keep track of and less emotional investment overall. Multiculturalism and representation get big boosts, though: the first Indian superhero, the first deaf superhero, the first Korean superhero, the first Mexican superhero, the first black gay superhero. Having comic-book movies reflect the world’s demographics is significant, and probably gives a nice little boost to the global box office as well. It’s just a pity that such an overstuffed cast doesn’t give anyone a chance to really shine. And that’s what makes Eternals, despite its prog-rock psychedelic visuals and astronomically high stakes, ultimately kind of dull. Did I mention that the director is Chloé Zhao?

"Nov 5, 2021"," With some films, finding one intriguing character is a challenge, so it's somewhat disappointing that co-writer-director Chloe Zhao's adaptation of ""Eternals"" seems to have too many of them. Yes, this is a Marvel movie, but much of the reason your Halloween was filled with characters from that universe is because six decades ago, Stan Lee and legions of collaborators gave superheroes real world neuroses and had them deal with issues we mortals face every day like drug addiction and racism. Autuers like Federico Fellini and Alan Renais loved Marvel Comics (Renais even tried to make a movie with Stan Lee), and some of the stories and characters give actors just as substantial a workout as the movies they make without a lot of special effects. Michael Keaton's turn in ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" or Michael B. Jordan's performance in ""Black Panther"" are equal to anything else they have done. In this movie, Salma Hayek brings a wonderful maternal touch as Ajak, the leader of a group of ageless warriors from a world known as Olympia, who are told to use their skills to protect the fledgling human population of Earth against a ravenous race of predators known as Deviants. Hayek's husky voice exudes warmth and understanding and makes her seem just a hair wiser than the rest of her team even though all of them can live indefinitely. The rest of her team consists of Ikaris (Richard Madden), who can fly and shoot death rays out of his eyes. He takes out lots of Deviants, but his impulsiveness makes him a questionable commander. Part of the reason he fights so fiercely is that he's carrying enough baggage to fill La Guardia. Thena (Angelina Jolie) can spontaneously generate glowing blades and has a cardio regimen no other being on earth can match. If her weapons don't kill you, she'll exhaust you with her refusal to quit. Sadly, outliving Chinese dynasties carries a huge psychological toll, so she can turn on her peers without warning. Sprite (Lia McHugh) resents her status because she'll always be a child, but when you can change your own form or make illusions, there are advantages. Gilgamesh (Don Lee) could probably level cities with his punches, and Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani) can make fireballs when he's not starring in Bollywood hits. He may be the only film star for whom special effects are optional. Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry) can invent more things than Thomas Edison, Eli Whitney and Nikola Tesla combined, and the Makkari (Lauren Ridloff) doesn't let deafness stop her from outrunning anything else on the planet. Each of these characters could have a movie of his or her own, and that's sometimes a problem. If the cast had been cut in half, it might have been more thrilling to watch them struggling to take out Deviants while Thena is having a psychotic episode. Jolie plays breakdowns well, and this would be a great showcase for her skills. One of the charms of the early Marvel comics is that the Fantastic Four were bickering with each other when they weren't fighting Doctor Doom. Most of the story is told from the point of view of Sersi (Gemma Chan), who teaches history when she's not turning potentially dangerous objects into innocuous ones. She's attached to a fellow teacher Dane Whitman (Kit Harington, ""Game of Thrones"") and can't quite tell him that she has superpowers and will outlive him. This in itself could have been a great storyline. Is it possible to fall in love with someone who won't be there any longer than 30 or 40 years. The Captain America movies toyed with that possibility, but Harington and Chan barely get any sparks flying before the computer-generated images show up. Running almost long enough for a pair of films, Zhao flits between her characters and only occasionally gives them room to shine. If she cut her team down to the size of a basketball squad, there would be more room for chemistry and character development. A villain with some type of flesh would be helpful, too. Tony Leung's tormented father in ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,"" Josh Brolin's Thanos in ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and Jordan's Killmonger in ""Black Panther"" are infinitely more gripping than the wiry Deviants. The digital overkill at the end seems more like a laser light show than a finale. Because thousands of people worked on this film, it's hard to tell if Zhao should have been more forceful in conveying the human side of her characters or if Marvel mastermind Kevin Feige should have given her and her co-writers more room to work. ""The Death of Stalin,"" ""A History of Violence"" and ""Ghost World"" are masterful films that were made from comics. ""Eternals,"" while still moderately entertaining, should have been in the same league.

"Nov 5, 2021"," On the heels of the Avengers, the X-Men, the Justice League, the Fantastic Four, and others, Eternals is the latest superhero conglomerate off the comic-book adaptation assembly line. Indeed, a whiff of familiarity and formula pervades this big-budget behemoth in which all of the effects-driven spectacle serves a silly and overwrought story that leaves little room for meaningful character development or emotional depth. Spanning centuries into both past and future, the story tracks the titular collection of immortal, and basically invincible, superheroes trying to preserve peace in a world where humans are pawns in an intergalactic power struggle. Long ago, having been dispatched by the ruling cosmic creators called Celestials from a distant planet, our humanoid heroes eradicated a race of apex predators known as Deviants, which enabled the Eternals to disperse and assimilate on Earth. However, as the Deviants rise again in the present day, the Eternals must hastily reassemble for Round 2. They also must confront hints about Celestial motives, wondering if their true mission isn’t what they thought all along. Oscar-winning director Chloe Zhao (Nomadland) greatly expands her canvas while retaining a sense of stellar visual craftsmanship. It doesn’t seem like she’s overwhelmed by the scope of the material as much as she’s compromised by a screenplay more intent on fitting into the Marvel Cinematic Universe than standing out. This convoluted origin story is overstuffed with chronological shifts, half-hearted moral complexity, and high-minded references to creationism and ancient mythologies in an effort to appear ambitious. Interspersing philosophical mumbo-jumbo with some amusing one-liners, it’s ultimately just setting the table for a parade of elaborate action sequences staged with a certain self-referential smugness while inventing the rules along the way. Even with some lazy expository plot devices, those unfamiliar with the source material might struggle to keep track of all the characters, their powers, and how they fit together. Things improve once the film becomes more focused on the second half, leading to the obligatory final showdown with the future of the universe at stake. There are some highlights, of course, such as the lavish costumes and the appealing performances from a diverse ensemble cast topped by Angelina Jolie, Gemma Chan, Brian Tyree Henry, Richard Madden, and Kumail Nanjiani. However, while it scores points for inclusivity, Eternals egregiously emphasizes bombast over substance. Like its title suggests, the characters will live on regardless.",NEGATIVE
"Nov 5, 2021"," The Church publishes the Monitor because it sees good journalism as vital to progress in the world. Since 1908, we’ve aimed “to injure no man, but to bless all mankind,” as our founder, Mary Baker Eddy, put it. Here, you’ll find award-winning journalism not driven by commercial influences – a news organization that takes seriously its mission to uplift the world by seeking solutions and finding reasons for credible hope. The director of “Eternals,” the new Marvel extravaganza, is none other than Chloé Zhao, the indie auteur whose last film was the microbudgeted “Nomadland.” The road movie about rural itinerants won Oscars for both best picture and director, and for star Frances McDormand. In style and substance, I can’t think of two more disparate films. Unlike some of my colleagues, however, I don’t regard Zhao’s Marvel makeover as a simple case of selling out. But before I elaborate on that, here’s a more pressing question: Is the film any good?  I’m not a big Marvel person, but I recognize the need for these films to exist; they’re the cinematic equivalent of the circus coming to town. A few of them, such as “Iron Man,” “Black Panther,” and “Avengers: Endgame,” were good. “Eternals” is subpar in comparison. It comes across like the B side to the “Avengers” movies, with almost none of their star power or CGI pizazz. The Eternals are shadow warriors sent to Earth thousands of years ago to save it from the monstrous Deviants, who resemble befanged supersize renegades from “A Quiet Place.” Thanks to the Eternals, earthlings have never heard of Deviants but, alas, they’ve returned – after 500 years – more ferocious than ever.  If Oscar winner Chloé Zhao pivots from her indie roots to make a big-budget Marvel film like “Eternals,” does it make her a sellout? The Monitor’s film critic weighs in on that – and the new movie.  The Eternals include Sersi (Gemma Chan), first seen in modern-day London and looking happily human paired with her earthly lover (Kit Harington). Her Eternals lover, Ikaris (Richard Madden), with whom she has had an off-and-on romance for millennia, suddenly shows up to complicate matters. He and the other superheroes, scattered around the globe in their various guises, are roused to once again decimate the Deviants. It’s noteworthy that the Eternals are, by Hollywood superhero standards, remarkably diverse, with several other Asian actors besides Chan – including Don Lee’s rollicky Gilgamesh and Kumail Nanjiani’s wisecracking Bollywood heartthrob Kingo – in starring roles. Brian Tyree Henry’s genius inventor Phastos not only is an openly gay Black man but also is married and a father. Lauren Ridloff, who is deaf, plays the deaf speedster Makkari. But, except for Angelina Jolie, who plays the warrior Thena, none of the film’s performers is especially luminescent. Even Jolie, in her too-brief role, seems a bit distracted. She periodically goes murderously rogue against her helpmates, which turns out to be more tiresome than thrilling. Even if Zhao and her co-screenwriters were more adept at establishing the family-style togetherness of the Eternals, the emotional continuity is shattered by the incessant time tripping and globe hopping. Just when you think you’ve got your bearings in South Dakota, you suddenly find yourself in Mesopotamia.  Still, I don’t think Zhao should be chided for attempting a film so seemingly outside her comfort zone. (She has professed a love of manga.) No director – least of all a female director, for whom job opportunities are particularly unplentiful – should have to commit to a career of specialization. The only qualm I have about “Eternals” is that it’s not better. (And, for the record, I was mixed on “Nomadland” and her earlier indies.) Is Zhao perhaps the victim of a double standard? There was no big selling-out hoo-ha when Ryan Coogler, who made his name with the powerful indie “Fruitvale Station,” graduated to “Creed” and “Black Panther.” The combined budgets of Christopher Nolan’s first two films, “Following” and “Memento,” wouldn’t pay for the caterer on his “Batman Begins.” It’s also quite possible to achieve moments of emotional intensity in superhero movies matching anything in the indie realm. Case in point: Tony Stark’s death scene in “Avengers: Endgame,” which features Robert Downey Jr. at his most moving. In an ideal world, I would wish for filmmakers to mix it up micro and macro, the way, say, Steven Soderbergh does. But that’s just me. If indie filmmakers want to exit the byways and enter the circus tent, there will be others to take their place. In the end, the only thing that really matters is that the movies be good. Monitor journalism changes lives because we open that too-small box that most people think they live in. We believe news can and should expand a sense of identity and possibility beyond narrow conventional expectations. “Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives. And I’m going to argue that we change lives precisely because we force open that too-small box that most human beings think they live in. The Monitor is a peculiar little publication that’s hard for the world to figure out. We’re run by a church, but we’re not only for church members and we’re not about converting people. We’re known as being fair even as the world becomes as polarized as at any time since the newspaper’s founding in 1908. We have a mission beyond circulation, we want to bridge divides.

"Nov 5, 2021"," It’s hard to imagine that, less than a decade ago, Guardians of the Galaxy was seen as a risky prospect for Marvel Studios. Now, it’s one of the most popular and recognisable parts of the franchise, and the Marvel Cinematic Universe has only continued to get bolder and weirder since. As Phase Four continues to show what a post-Endgame MCU looks like, the studio takes yet another step into the less explored parts of its source material to present Eternals to the masses. A property than even most comic book fans have little more than a passing familiarity with, it represents an opportunity to really break the conventions of the series and present something wholly unique, and if that was the brief then they have succeeded. Whilst it’s certainly not going to be to everyone’s taste, and far from the conventional crowd-pleaser audiences may be expecting, Eternals adds complexity, nuance and diversity sorely needed in a series that has gotten all too predictable. Right from its opening moments with a foreboding opening crawl and stunning shots of deep space and prehistoric Earth, it’s obvious that Eternals wants to set itself apart from its forbearers. Its epic story spans centuries, its tone is more contemplative and world-wearier, its pacing more precise and composed, and it takes as many cues from the likes of Terrence Malick and Alejandro Jodorowsky as it does modern blockbusters. Though it certainly connects itself to the past, present and future of the MCU, for the most part it stands on its own and has far more interest in exploring its own ideas than riffing on those that have come before. In a franchise that has such a pre-established format that it often more resembles a television series, having such a completely different perspective this time around is thoroughly refreshing. However, it does face some growing pains. The first half is noticeably weaker than its second, as it struggles to find the right balance between its Hollywood and artistic influences. The stop-start nature of the plotting and pacing is jarring at times, with many scenes either dragging on far too long or brushing past moments that needs more room to breathe. Much of the present-day story is spent simply assembling the cast, jumping from one locale to the next to introduce yet another character, interspersed with flashbacks throughout history to show the Eternals in their prime and explore how they disbanded. That said, once the film finds its groove and starts digging deeper into its multifaceted characters, timely commentary on socio-political and environmental collapse, and philosophical exploration of concepts like morality and determinism, Eternals finally begins to be the movie it set out to be. It’s a film far more interested in asking questions than providing answers, which may frustrate more mainstream viewers, but after so many spoon-fed good vs. evil stories it’s wonderful to have a blockbuster that leaves the audience the chance to think about its content rather than simply react. In spite of its barren setting, the third act is an absolute feast as not only the action reaches its peak, but the character conflicts and thematic undercurrent empower it all to a satisfying crescendo and a fittingly bittersweet aftermath. By the tale’s end, it becomes clear that Eternals’ true aspiration is to be an arthouse blockbuster in much the same vein as the works of Denis Villeneuve and The Wachowskis. Whether you think that its connection to Marvel is holding it back from being truly itself, or that it strays too far from the MCU formula to feel like a contiguous part of the grander tapestry, that is for you to decide. It certainly took far longer than necessary for Marvel to diversify its world, and it certainly has plenty of opportunities to improve, but Eternals has certainly one of the more fascinating and distinctive cast of characters in the series yet. Even with its beefy runtime, the film has a lot of new faces to introduce and not all of them get the attention they deserve, but it’s hard to say anyone turns in a bad performance. After being short-changed by her blink-and-you’ll-miss-her role in Captain Marvel, Gemma Chan gets a second shot at superheroics as nominal lead Sersei and does a fantastic job as the emotional core of the team. She’s perhaps not got the most eccentric or unique personality compared to her co-stars, but Chan brings a relatable and down-to-earth perspective as someone truly caught between two worlds. Richard Madden fits comfortably into the boots of Ikaris, who functions as much as an allegory for the prototypical superhero as he does his mythological namesake, giving a reserved but commanding performance that takes on new meaning as we learn more about his past. Angelina Jolie is perfectly cast as warrior goddess Thena, bringing both gravitas and vulnerability to a character struggling with trauma in an all-too-human way, whilst Salma Hayek makes the most of her limited screentime as the nurturing and wise Ajak. Despite being the youngest cast members, Lia McHugh and Barry Keoghan are saddled with the most morally complex characters as the trickster Sprite and the manipulative Druig, with McHugh showing an intelligence beyond her years that brought to mind Kirsten Dunst’s star-making turn in Interview with the Vampire. There’s also plenty of comic relief to go around courtesy of Kumail Nanjiani as the boisterous but self-obsessed Kingo, but even he too has his moments of introspection that ground him, as does his valet/ sidekick Karun (played wonderfully by Harish Patel). The short straws are ultimately drawn by Bryan Tyree Henry as inventor Phastos, Lauren Ridloff as speedster Makkari, and Don Lee as tank Gilgamesh, but they all get at least one standout moment and the actors acquit themselves with gusto; it’s great to finally see queer and disabled heroes brought to the MCU, and the representation is brief but tastefully done. Then there’s Kit Harington as Chan’s love interest Dane Whitman, who might as well have a giant “I’ll be important later” sticker on his forehead for the whole film, because his role here is little more than an extended cameo. If you know your comics, you’ll know Whitman’s importance to the Marvel lore and that Harington is an apt choice, but it’s the one element of the film that really feels like a relic from a more conventional MCU version of this story. Throughout its production and marketing, it’s been stressed that Eternals is as huge a step away from the MCU formula on a technical level as it is story-wise, and that is certainly reflected in the aesthetic presentation. Though of course still stuffed to the brim with state-of-the-art CGI, the line between fantasy and reality is certainly more blurred by the increased amount of on-location shooting and natural lighting compared to most modern blockbusters. Director Chloé Zhao’s independent eye is all over every frame of Eternals, managing to show her directorial influence in a way few other MCU helmers have other than Taika Waititi and James Gunn, and it’d be fascinating to see what else she could accomplish if she continues down this big-budget path. Despite being having been behind the camera on four prior MCU outings, cinematographer Ben Davis gives the film a distinct look that retains a similar palette to previous films but ups the grit and verisimilitude of the visuals. The production design is audacious and inventive, especially the cold halls of the Eternals’ spacecraft and the grotesque look of the Deviant race, and Ramin Djawadi returns to Marvel for the first time since Iron Man to deliver a suitably sombre but triumphant score. It’s absolutely amongst the most visually satisfying films in the franchise so far, and one can only hope Marvel starts to allow its future filmmakers similar freedom to go beyond the boundaries and experiment with more flavours beyond the base MCU taste. Eternals doesn’t always succeed in its ambitions and will likely leave some viewers cold, but for those who can get past its shortcomings and see the potential beneath, it’s an experience absolutely worth seeing on the biggest screen possible. Zhao absolutely has the chops to compete in the blockbuster space should she so wish, and hopefully the stumbling blocks of pacing and focus are ones that’ll be overcome in future ventures. Even if it doesn’t end up being a property as popular as The Avengers or Guardians of the Galaxy, the Eternals themselves are characters crying out for further exploration and will hopefully find a comfy corner of the universe to call their own, and they’ve certainly set the stage for a lot of potential threads to come. If you’re already on the MCU train, you’ll have likely decided to see this movie long before you read this or any other review and can appraise it for yourself. However, if you’re someone who has never really gotten the fuss or become tired of the formula, Eternals is certainly worth a gander. You may not end up liking it, but it’s hard to argue that it’s at least one of the most unique blockbusters of 2021. I think for me the problem with it is that sure, it has flavours beyond the MCU taste… but those are the flavours of the DCEU.  Or as I’ve seen a few other critics describe it… “Marvel’s first DC film.”",POSITIVE
"Nov 5, 2021"," What is it that people thought was going to happen when an indie filmmaker known for quiet, thoughtful character dramas made a massive blockbuster Marvel movie? Apologies to Thanos, but this is the outcome that was truly inevitable. Eternals is a cinematic Frankenstein’s monster that invites fascination before pleading for its own death. Ambitious, creative elements are hobbled by having to stop and explain cosmic theology at a kindergarten level. Gorgeous, hauntingly cold visuals are interrupted by ugly, forgettable fight sequences. An amazingly talented cast – playing surprisingly nuanced characters – is forced to dial every performance to “I can’t believe Tide got the stain out!” levels. It’s Shakespeare by Cliff’s Notes, a Kidz Bop Nirvana cover, a musical episode of The Wire. To their credit, writer/director Chloé Zhao and cowriters Patrick Burleigh and Ryan Firpo certainly tried to get away with what they could. Eternals features the first tangible proof that coitus exists in the Marvel universe and has a third act that legally counts as plot-heavy, character driven narrative. But to please the Marvel masses, it also features immortals cracking modern one-liners about 7,000 years before slang was invented, multiple “OMG cell phones are so addictive” discussions, and a post-credits cameo that feels like the product of an online poll or tween focus group. Given the absolutely relentless ad campaign, you almost certainly know the film’s conceit. A sentient giant space phallus tasks immortal beings who have superpowers with guarding humanity against the evil deviants. Wait, does that also work as a summary of the Mormon faith? The movie has like eleventy billion characters, but the important to know are Sersi (Gemma Chan) and her sorta-ex hubby Ikaris (Richard Madden). After centuries split apart, they must gather their old gang together again before an earth-ending event occurs. To Eternals’ credit, saying more would ruin some legitimately compelling surprises. Superhero escapism has long been compared with mythology cosplay. This is the first time in film form that divinely powered beings were actually forced to deal with a true God-level moral quandary. Perhaps part of the reason why folks aren’t resonating with the flick as much is because it hinges on the notion that human beings are inherently special and worth saving. The last few years in real life have sure felt like “Exhibit A” in the legal counterargument to that defense. Whatever credit can be given to Marvel for wanting to step outside their formula, which Eternals inarguably completely does, gets immediately docked for a failure to fully commit to going bonkers weird. Every clever, artistic choice is undercut by mainstream red meat. Druig (Barry Keoghan), who has near-limitless mind control powers, grapples with whether cleansing thoughts of genocide from humanity is morally just. That’s riveting AF! So, of course, he also turns into a doe-eyed cute and flirty dipshit whenever Makkari (Lauren Ridloff) is around. Each time the film’s intentionally melodramatic self-seriousness finally feels comfortable, somebody drops a pie, asks about Captain America, or namechecks Ikea. Even the length of the movie would be fine, had it not felt like a heady space opera bloated only by a requirement for a specific number of punches. Honestly, Eternals would have felt more comfortable as a 10-hour series than a nearly 3-hour blockbuster. The whole thing feels like a beautiful promise poorly kept. Is it bad? No. Should it be praised for bravely stepping out of the Marvel box? Also no. Letting a dog out of its cage while chaining it to a short leash isn’t the same as giving it a chance to run free. This feels like a coldly commercial creative calculation instead of letting a talented group of artists play in an infinite sandbox. No harm, no foul, but also no big whoop. Angelica Jade Bastién at Vulture says “Marvel has grown so powerful in part because of how it treats diversity and identity as a checklist; the Eternals characters indeed range in ability, race, and sexuality. But what does it matter to have, say, a gay kiss onscreen, when there’s no heat behind it? What does it matter if the women are of various hues and ages if you don’t care about their interiority?” Ruben Peralta Rigaud at Cocalecas.net says “One wishes that Zhao had been allowed to do an existential superhero drama instead of putting up this strange compromise.” [Full review in Spanish.] Glen Weldon at NPR says “The film stops dead, from time to time, for beautiful people to debate the fate of the planet and their respective roles in it.”",POSITIVE
"Nov 5, 2021"," Still riding the high ofÂ Avengers: EndgameÂ and the breakout success of their many Disney+ shows, Marvel is slowly but surely stacking its ranks to create the next era of superheroes that will inevitably replace the Avengers, andÂ ChloÃ© ZhaoâsÂ EternalsÂ is the latest entry in the studioâs roster-building exercise. While itâs refreshing to see a director maintain their identity as a filmmaker and take risks to break away from the typical Marvel formula,Â EternalsÂ struggles under the weight of its own lore and the sheer volume of characters present â resulting in a muddy, tepid film that feels like a valiant but ultimately disjointed attempt at striking bold new ground in the MCU. Starring Gemma Chan and Richard Madden,Â EternalsÂ follows the centuries-spanning journey of the titular Eternals: a group of 10 supernaturally powerful beings created and sent to earth by the Celestials to protect humanity from the equally as powerful Deviants, a race of power-consuming monsters. After living in secret and watching humanity from the shadows for thousands of years, the Eternals are forced to reunite and emerge once again when the deviants grow eerily powerful, threatening humanityâs very existence. In many ways,Â EternalsÂ seems like a film doomed from its very conception: to introduce a whopping 10 new heroes (and a few sidekicks, to boot) in one film while also advancing the MCUâs larger overarching narrative and still remaining a cohesive, entertaining watch on its own is a tall order for any filmmaker â itâs difficult to imagine the script truly working in any capacity, regardless of director. The scale and the scope are simply too massive, and at several points in the film.Â EternalsÂ threatens to buckle under the sheer amount of exposition, which in turn makes for a dizzying, dense viewing experience: EternalsÂ certainly isnât a film to be viewed casually. That being said, to Zhaoâs credit, she managed to craft (from the chaos and enormity that is the filmâs premise and script) as coherent of a film as can be expected which, though not entirely successful, is a feat that should be acknowledged. Not only does she find a way to anchor such a sprawling concept and find a somewhat cohesive throughline, but she also does so while maintaining her own very clear identity as a filmmaker, certainly a rarity when it comes to MCU directors. The Marvel Cinematic Universe comes under frequent fire for its films subscribing to the same systematic formula that churns out hit after hit â andÂ EternalsÂ feels very much like a deliberate buck against this idea, both on the part of Zhao and studio president Kevin Feige. That Zhao is able to retain her directorial style and visual flare is commendable, and the stylistic and narrative risks she takes withÂ EternalsÂ certainly break the mold, but the issue is that simply breaking from tradition isnât enough â the film must also beÂ goodÂ in its own right. Unfortunately forÂ Eternals, this just isnât the case â itâs a swing and a miss, though we dread to think thatÂ Eternalsâ ultimate failure may be pinned on this willingness to break from tradition, in turn preventing future MCU films from taking risks â but this isnât the case, the real culprit here is the script. From the opening crawl of jargon-heavy exposition,Â EternalsÂ feels as if itâs introducing a new name or concept that the audience is expected to remember every 15 minutes, regardless of the fact that weâre still struggling to keep the bakerâs dozen of main charactersâ names straight. When it comes to the characters themselves, they all show glimmers of personality and promise that makes us wonder how they wouldâve fared had Marvel taken the time to give them each their own solo films a-laÂ Avengers, but as it stands, they all feel relatively ambivalent: Not flat out bad, sure, but even the charisma of Kumail Nanjiani or Brian Tree Henry feels muted and unremarkable when each character only gets fleeting moments to develop a sense of identity before the film is zipping away to work on someone elseâs backstory. EternalsÂ boasts a diverse cast thatâs riddled with talent, and though the majority of the ensemble is wasted due to the sheer volume of content to work through over the filmâs runtime, a few figures do manage to stand out: the ever-statuesque Angelina Jolie as battle-hardened goddess Thena is a particular bright spot, alongside her steadfast protector Gilgamesh (Don Lee). The other dynamic duo worth remembering is the effortlessly endearing Lauren Ridloff as speedster Makkari, and her on-again-off-again paramour, the rough-around-the-edges Druig, played byÂ Barry Keoghan, Hollywoodâs go-to guy for shifty figures. The rest of the cast, though certainly serviceable, struggles to remain memorable among the cacophony of other voices, and the uninspired monochromatic costumes donât help anyone to develop a personality or sense of self beyond their individual abilities/powers. The CGI is some of the franchiseâs shoddiest, and the third act is truly an arbitrary final battle if weâve ever seen one, which feels particularly jarring when contrasted against the rest of the filmâs willingness to break from the franchise formula. Though itâs unfortunate to have to criticize a film that stands as one of the MCUâs few attempts at originality and genuine auteurism, lest it discourages the studio from taking similar risks in the future,Â EternalsÂ is a frustratingly dense and heinously overcomplicated film that loses Zhaoâs delicate filmmaking sensibilities in its rush to introduce swathes of new Marvel heroes. Though Jolie, Lee, and Ridloff stand as bright spots and the cinematography IS second to none in as far as the MCU goes,Â Eternals is too overcomplicated to be enjoyable, and too muddled to feel truly daring.

"Nov 5, 2021"," People are saying Chloe Zhao’s “Eternals” is the worst Marvel film yet. How can they tell? There have been so many “worsts.” This is not very good for sure, and at 2 hours 37 minutes, it’s a stretch. Based on the 1976 Marvel comic book series created by the legendary Jack Kirby, “Eternals,” which was co-written by Zhao, Patrick Burleigh (“Peter Rabbit 2: The Runaway”) and feature film first-timers Ryan Firpo and Kaz Firpo, is a queasy mix of problematic and confusing myth and soap opera issues. In opening scenes, we learn that Eternals are almost immortal super beings created by Celestials and left on Earth 7,000 years ago to live alongside humans, whom they resemble, and to protect humans from Deviants, who were also placed by the Celestials. The Deviants in the film take several beastly forms at first. The first one we see looks like a water dragon, which attacks primitive humans on a beach. One of the Eternals, a handsome man named Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), uses his powers, in this case, explosive fireballs that he fires to repel the dragon and save the endangered humans. Are these fireballs symbolic of Kingo’s other superpower, scathing observations of his fellow Eternals? Maybe. When he isn’t battling Deviants, Kingo is a Bollywood film star, who has followed in the footsteps of his father, his grandfather and his great-grandfather on the screen (all really just semi-eternal Kingo). When Eternals are not battling increasingly powerful, self-healing Deviants on the streets of — say — present-day London, they are hanging together. We see two of them meet for the first time in some distant past. “I’m Ikaris” (Richard Madden, speaking in his Scottish burr), says one male Eternal. “I’m Sersi” (Englishwoman Gemma Chan) the female Eternal responds. Ikaris can fly and fire laser-like blasts from his eyes. Sersi rhymes with Circe, the beautiful witch who wanted Odysseus for herself in “The “Odyssey.” Ikaris’ rival for Sersi’s affection is a London museum worker (Kit Harrington). Thankfully, his name is Dane. Another Eternal is named Thena (Angelina Jolie), and is obviously the Greek goddess Athena. Her superpower is using energy beam weapons to battle Deviants while she dances in the air in skintight silver armor. Thena suffers from a form of dementia called “Madd Wy’ry,” which is pretty much how I feel about these films. Another Eternal named Sprite (Lia McHugh) has the appearance of an androgynous 12-year-old and is this film’s Tinkerbell. The charming Eternal Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry) has a human male spouse and likes giving humans tips about technology. Gilgamesh (an appealing, charismatic Don Lee) is the strongest Eternal and has a bond with Thena. As the head of the Eternals, Ajak (Salma Hayek) is maternal and lives in South Dakota. The Eternals’ superhero costumes suggest a marching band with outfits by Bob Mackie. The film offers the usual CG spectacle, but I had almost no interest in it. Been there. I was thankful for Nanjiani and Indian stage actor Harish Patel as his videographer for their wit and comedy. Madden, who is terrific as Robb Stark and in “Bodyguard,” is a dud as Ikaris, who seems like the X-Man you forgot about. The film’s diversity with gay and deaf members is refreshing. But diversity does not make the dull and complex story any better. “Eternals” ends with the usual hugs and surprise credit sequence. Zhao, who directed the Academy Award-winning “Nomadland” (2020) and even better 2017 effort “The Rider,” has succumbed to corporate film-making anonymity. “Eternals” has little heart and almost no fingerprint.",NEGATIVE

"Nov 5, 2021"," You can tell “Eternals” is going to be epic right from the opening crawl line: “In the beginning...” That’s right, the film actually swipes language from the Book of Genesis. The Marvel Cinematic Universe just got biblical. The reach sort of fits, in a way: “Eternals” isn’t just another origin story for a clutch of new superheroes but the creation myth for the entire Marvel universe itself. The film spans from 5,000 B.C. to present day and describes god-like, gigantic beings shaping the galaxies. One almost longs for the good old days when a Marvel movie’s biggest drama was hoping Spider-Man could stop Doctor Octopus from wrecking New York. It all starts simply enough. Directed by Academy Award-winner Chloé Zhao, “Eternals” introduces 10 members of a race of immortal beings who have spent 7,000 years on Earth defending it from rivals known as Deviants, who look a lot like the beasts from “Aliens” on steroids.  The film jumps back and forward in time to key moments in human history — Mesopotamia in 5000 B.C., Babylon in 575, Tenochtitlan in 1521 and Nagasaki in 1945, among them. The Eternals watch warily from the sidelines as violence reigns, forbidden to interfere, helped along with a soundtrack of clever songs that includes Pink Floyd’s “Time” and Foreigner’s “Feels Like the First Time.” Marvel has reached deep into its archives for this film — the 26th film in the universe, after all — but has to be applauded for its inclusion. Four of the Eternals are white, three are Asian — one is the first Asian American woman protagonist — two are Black, and one is Latina. One is gay and one is deaf. There’s more: “Eternals” contains the first gay kiss in the Marvel film universe, a kiss between superheroes and — remarkably quickly thereafter — the first superhero sex. It’s a pity all these firsts have taken so long and are now crammed into an arguably third-tier bunch of characters. They are: Sersi (Gemma Chan), who can transmute matter; Ikaris (Richard Madden), with the gift of flight and laser eyes; Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), who shoots energy blasts from his hands; and Sprite (Lia McHugh), who can cast illusions but is trapped in a tween’s body. There’s also Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), a superhuman inventor; Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), who has super speed; Druig (Barry Keoghan), with mind control powers; Gilgamesh (Don Lee) with super punching strength, and Thena (Angelina Jolie), who can summon weapons from thin air. Leading the bunch is Ajak (Salma Hayek), a sort of Den Mother to the others who possesses healing powers. Their names — especially Gilgamesh, Thena and Ikaris — resemble names from ancient myths and the film thrillingly hints that they may be the real figures behind our ancient legends. Eventually, each Eternal goes their own separate way. One goes to a run-down South Dakota farmhouse, a pair end up on a dusty spot in Australia, another teaches history in London. Nanjiani’s Kingo becomes a vain Bollywood star who explains away his lack of aging by hiding in a false lineage of actors.  The final third of the film — and with a 157-minute run time, “Eternals” feels sometimes eternal — elevates all the Earth-based stuff into another dimension with the re-introduction of the Celestials, which first appeared in “Guardians of the Galaxy.” These are massive cosmic beings looking like giant toy robots that consider humans and Eternals mere playthings and have a hidden agenda.  Zhao, whose film “Nomadland” was everything this is not — spare, naturalistic, moody — struggles with so much going on. The fight scenes are repetitive and the dialogue often stilted (“When you love something, you must protect it,” one Eternal says). The use of tendrils of light connecting the superheroes is impressive and the special effects at the end are truly mind-blowing, but the film is mostly saved by Nanjiani, whose humor and delivery makes him seem like he’s in another movie. Without him, there’s a lot of superheroes standing around in cool suits squinting a lot. The film never really finishes, merely setting up the next installment, as Marvel fans are used to by now. “Eternals” is like the vegetables we need to eat before we can get to the dessert. And if you stick around during the credits, you’ll find it: Harry Stiles. Stand by. “Eternals,” a Walt Disney Co. release that hits theaters Friday, is rated PG-13 for “fantasy violence and action, some language and brief sexuality.” Running time: 157 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four. ",POSITIVE

"Nov 5, 2021"," ""Eternals"" is a movie of grand sweep. The story it tells begins in Mesopotamia in 5000 B.C. and concludes in the present day. By the end of the picture's talky two and a half hours, you may feel like you've lived through those seven millennia in real time. Marvel is surely to be congratulated for spending $200 million on a film of such assertive diversity. The 10-member team of the title includes actors whose roots range from British Chinese (Gemma Chan) to Korean (Ma Dong-seok) and Pakistani American (Kumail Nanjiani). There's also one Mexican actor (Salma Hayek), one Black and Mexican actor, and, what the hey, a couple of Celts (Richard Madden and Barry Keoghan). One of the characters (Brian Tyree Henry) is gay, another (Lauren Ridloff) is deaf, and three have survived the trauma of being gender-swapped (males in the comics, now females in the film). In addition, there's Angelina Jolie, as a woman of many weapons, who unbalances the picture a bit with her vivid, big-star presence.  Chinese director Chloe Zhao, who won an Oscar for her luminous 2020 movie ""Nomadland,"" was a nervy pick to helm a gigantoid MCU action-fantasy film. Sadly, though, the gamble of hiring her has not paid off; making a Marvel movie may require an enthusiasm for bombast that she doesn't possess (and may never again need, unless a clearly hoped-for sequel to this film comes to pass, and she's called back into service). The story is an unintriguing muddle. A long, long time ago — a million years ago, in fact — a shadowy group of space beings called Celestials created two new races on Earth: the noble Eternals and the disgusting Deviants. The Eternals took it upon themselves to gently guide the human race (without interfering in its affairs, which could have triggered a Butterfly Effect) and to protect it from the Deviants. The Deviants — who look like snarling armatures for half-finished monsters — took it upon themselves to rampage and rend flesh wherever possible. It doesn't take long before you begin to realize that there are too many damn superheroes in this picture, and that the occasional mentions of the Avengers (the story is said to be taking place five years after the big Thanos snap that wiped out half the universe) are probably unwise. The Avengers were a ton of wisecracking fun compared to the semi-obscure, C-team crew we see here, and it would probably be best not to mention them anywhere in the vicinity of this movie. It doesn't help that Zhao's naturalistic lighting tends to muffle whatever snap and sparkle the movie might have had. And while it's nice to have all the progressive representation on screen that we see here, it remains to be determined whether people are willing to pay for it, when all they really want is to see a good movie.

                print and digital media outlets, dedicated to reporting the truth in light of the Gospel and the
                Catholic Church. ‘Eternals,’ the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s sprawling new ensemble origin story, takes a key Marvel theme — skepticism of authority — pretty much to the absolute top, in the process raising inevitable questions not only about why any of this matters, but even what ‘mattering’ means. One of the most enduring raps on the Marvel Cinematic Universe is its villain problem. After more than a dozen years and some 25 films featuring dozens of superheroes, the MCU has produced just two memorable, enduring antagonists: Tom Hiddleston’s mercurial Loki and Josh Brolin’s emo nihilist Thanos. Not to slight Michael B. Jordan’s incandescent Killmonger, among maybe one or two others who stand out amid a deep bench of forgettable mediocrities like Malekith and Taskmaster — but even the best of the rest have, so far, been one-and-done baddies of the week. Eternals — a sweeping ensemble origin story spanning thousands of years of human history and introducing a record-breaking 10 new costumed heroes at one go — adds a number of new forgettable antagonists, primarily the mindless monstrosities called Deviants. At least one of the non-Deviant antagonists is officially a spoiler, but you’ll probably spot the other one out of the gate if you’ve been paying attention. He’s a culmination of an archetype running through Marvel movies from the beginning: an apotheosis of the MCU’s most consistent idea, if not their only idea. This archetype can be broadly called “The Man” or “the Powers that Be.” Always a powerful, patriarchal establishment figure, like Obadiah Stane, Nick Fury or Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford’s character in Captain America: The Winter Soldier), The Man is often the protagonist’s actual father, like Howard Stark or Black Panther’s father T’Chaka. Sometimes Dad is a literal higher power, a being of quasi-divine status, like Odin of Asgard, Ego the Celestial (father of Star-Lord), or the immortal Wenwu (father of Shang-Chi). In The Eternals, The Man is something more exalted still — and this has unavoidable existential and dramatic consequences. Incarnations of The Man vary from one MCU movie to another in terms of how sympathetic or compromised he is. Always, though, The Man has damaging secrets, misrepresents his true intentions, and can’t be trusted, at least not completely. Even if The Man himself is more sympathetic than not, the institution, legacy, program or domain he represents is fundamentally compromised or corrupt. “Let’s just say the greater good has rarely outweighed my own self-interest,” Howard Stark himself eventually admitted to Tony in a poignant, time-bending final encounter. Howard left his son a legacy of war profiteering, and the way he dispatched his unscrupulous colleague Anton Venko — who helped invent Stark Industries’ greatest nonviolent achievement, the arc reactor — was ruthless at best, and had grave consequences for both men’s sons, especially Venko’s. Taking this tainted legacy to a new level, Tony’s surrogate father figure Obadiah Stane sold weapons to terrorists. Behind Nick Fury’s dissembling about S.H.I.E.L.D.’s super-weapons program, among other things, may have been humane motives, but S.H.I.E.L.D. itself was secretly rotten from within, infiltrated and subverted by Hydra, a terrorist secret society with Nazi ties. Odin and T’Chaka were largely depicted as benevolent rulers, but their regimes papered over their leaders’ unacknowledged crimes: Odin’s campaigns of genocide and murderous conquest; T’Chaka’s cover-up of the killing of his radicalized brother N’Jobu and the abandonment of N’Jobu’s young son, the future Killmonger. (Wakanda’s historic isolationism in the face of African suffering and turmoil is a further stain on its legacy.) These are storytelling choices with moral and thematic potential. The Winter Soldier’s “Who watches the watchmen?” theme — unaccountable government agencies amassing too much power over the lives of citizens — evokes real-world political concerns such as the excesses of the Patriot Act. Revelations of Asgard’s shameful founding have topical resonance in our day, with civil and ecclesiastical authorities being called to account for their complicity in what have been called genocidal acts against Indigenous Americans. (I consider Thor: Ragnarok morally vacuous storytelling, but not because of its anticolonial vibe.) The potential moral heft of such stories depends on the reality that the misdeeds of establishment figures, potentates and even godlike beings can be judged by higher standards. All fathers have obligations to their children. Corporate bosses are bound by the law; even kings are not above international law. Odin explicitly acknowledges in Thor: The Dark World that the Asgardians are “not gods.” Star-Lord’s dying mother declared his father to be “an angel composed of pure light,” but the Celestial Ego smilingly accepts the designation of god with a “small g — at least when I’m feeling humble.” In Eternals, we learn more about the beings called Celestials. Opening titles directly reference Genesis 1, starting with “In the beginning…” Before the “the dawn of creation,” this Marvel creation myth continues, “came the Celestials.” The “Prime Celestial,” whom we will come to know as Arishem, brought “light to the universe.” Among his other worlds and works, Arishem created the Earth and human beings. Then, following the initially unexplained appearance of the Deviants, described as “an unnatural species of predators,” Arishem created the Eternals — the first superheroes — to “restore order.” In this seemingly dualistic mythos, Arishem is something a lot like God, and the Eternals and the Deviants are like angels and demons — except that the Deviants, instead of being fallen Eternals, apparently appeared out of nowhere, and the Eternals were Arishem’s response plan. (Comics legend Jack Kirby, who created the Celestials and the Eternals, was Jewish, and it may not be a coincidence that the name Arishem is vaguely suggestive of Hashem, a Hebrew circumlocution for God literally meaning “the Name.” That said, Kirby’s “Arishem the Judge” in the comics isn’t nearly the primal creator-figure that the movie’s Arishem is. More obviously, the Jewish prayer called the Shema, from the Hebrew word meaning “hear” or “listen,” is echoed in the name of another Celestial, Ashema the Listener.) The Eternals, we are told, follow Arishem’s will with unswerving faith — which is, of course, another way of saying that, by the end, that faith will be at least shaken, if not shattered. That’s what happens when you trust The Man. When the stakes are this high, questioning The Man also means cross-examining the Grand Design — a motif previously seen on the small screen in the Disney+ series Loki. Loki opened with the premise that the integrity of spacetime is monitored and regulated by a bureaucratic organization called the Time Variance Authority, or TVA. TVA agents see themselves as protecting “the sacred timeline,” a quasi-religious trust prescribed by supposedly divine beings called the Time-Keepers.  All of this is ultimately revealed to be a lie: The Time-Keepers are only figurehead androids, and no timeline is any more “sacred” than any other. The mastermind behind the lie, a mortal called He Who Remains, is merely a survivor of a temporal war between alternate realities and has taken to pruning variant timelines in order to preserve temporal peace. (At the end of the last episode, He Who Remains is killed, triggering an explosive temporal multifurcation and presumably threatening new temporal wars.) The Grand Design, as the Eternals understand it, calls for them to combat the Deviants, allowing humanity to thrive — or to engage in war, conquest and genocide; the Eternals, like the Federation with their Prime Directive in Star Trek, are not to interfere in the affairs of primitive beings. It’s a rule that, much like Captain Kirk, the Eternals don’t entirely follow, from their arrival in Mesopotamia circa 5,000 B.C. to the rise of the Babylonian empire to the slaughter of Aztecs at Tenochtitlán by Cortés.  Finally, Arishem’s dark secrets are revealed: First, it turns out the Deviants, too, were created by the Celestials, with the intention that they should help intelligent life develop by eliminating dangerous predators — but when they became out-of-control predators themselves, the Eternals were created as damage control. It also turns out that the Eternals are not living organisms, but machines with false memories that are routinely reset for each new assignment. But the big twist is that the Celestials aren’t altruistically interested in intelligent life for its own sake. They create and foster inhabited worlds like the Earth as a means of … growing new Celestials. Such a planet is essentially a giant egg with an embryonic Celestial at its core — and what incubates it is the collective life-force of intelligent species like ours. So when the intelligent population of a world reaches a given level, there’s an apocalyptic hatching event, and the shattered, dead world is left behind. And, naturally, the time is now. Bracket, for a moment at least, the absurd, incipiently Malthusian resonances of this conceit. (This is a movie that proposes that global warming comes from the planet’s core, due to the quickening of Celestial life; it’s not a movie with a coherent environmental outlook.) Consider, instead, how the Eternals (or most of them) react to these revelations: Realizing that their whole worldview was a lie and that the humans they have come to care about and admire are doomed, they contemplate an audacious plan to abort the hatching Celestial in order to save the Earth and humanity. (Bracket, too, the question of a Celestial abortion to save all life on mother Earth — and also, while we’re bracketing things, the hero in a same-sex relationship and the same-sex kiss. There are more fundamental issues.) The moral implications of the Eternals’ conundrum are considered from a number of angles. For one thing, just as every chicken hatched means more eggs, so more Celestials means more Earth-like worlds — so if the Earth is saved, how many inhabited worlds that might have existed will never be? No one asks why we should care about such worlds, which are also destined to be snuffed out once they become populous enough. More fundamentally, the business of hatching new Celestials is what the whole system — the Earth, human beings and the Eternals — was created for, what it is designed to do. The Eternals are literally machines designed to fight Deviants. The Earth, and terrestrial life, are a more complicated sort of machine. This includes human beings, who were fashioned by their creator, not in his image or out of love, but as expendable parts of a planetary hatchery.  Who is anyone, human or Eternal, to call this system wrong or unjust? By what standard? “Will what is molded say to its molder, ‘Why have you made me thus?’” (Romans 9:20). Decades of science fiction have conditioned us to assume that an entity, even a machine like Data on Star Trek: The Next Generation, that has self-awareness must be recognized as having moral dignity and personal worth. But this assumes that personhood itself has dignity and value — an assumption Arishem evidently doesn’t share. What rights can we have that he is obliged to recognize? What law or value system binds him? “I respect your grand design,” Ajak (Salma Hayek), leader of the Eternals, ventures to say to Arishem before adding that there’s “something special about this planet.” Arishem, though, warns her not to become attached to humans. Later Sersi (Gemma Chan) remarks, if I recall correctly, that the reversal of Thanos’ genocidal snap erasing half of all beings in the universe (Avengers: Endgame) attests the specialness of Earth. Who decides that such “specialness” matters? In the end, Arishem shows up to announce that he will evaluate his rebel Eternals’ actions by judging humanity to see if they deserve to live. What criteria apply? Reinforcing the idea of Arishem as the God of the Bible, iconography accompanying the closing titles identifies the Eternals with other legendary and religious figures — including St. Michael the Archangel. This kind of crass deconstruction of Christian belief is a striking departure for Marvel, which until now has been careful to demythologize its own heritage to avoid religious complications. (For example, Doctor Strange explained sorcery as a technique analogous to computer programming.) DC’s Wonder Woman suggested that Zeus (not the God of Abraham) created mankind in his image, a move that struck me as notably different from the cautious Marvel approach. That caution is not in evidence in Eternals. C.S. Lewis, in The Abolition of Man, cites an old joke about a man who, learning that a new stove would cut his fuel bill in half, concludes that with two such stoves he can heat his house with no fuel at all. There are things that can be done by halves, but not by wholes. There is plenty to criticize in Eternals — and some things that I might praise, in another story set in another universe — but I’m not sure any story set in this universe could possibly offer anything to care about one way or the other.

"Nov 5, 2021"," The captivating Netflix series The Crown has set a high bar for all screen dramatisations of the royal soap opera, a bar that Spencer regrettably fails to reach.  Set on the Sandringham estate during three days over the course of Christmas 1991, with the marriage between Charles and Diana ruptured beyond repair, Spencer, like The Crown, is a work of fiction woven from fact.  A caption at the start of the film, portentously declaring it to be a fable drawn 'from a true tragedy', does at least imply that what follows is mostly whimsy.  Kristen Stewart plays Princess Diana as a gibbering, dysfunctional wreck (but in a good way), while Jack Farthing gives us a Prince Charles so callous and cold that he could offer your average Nazi commandant a run for his Deutsche Marks.  Director Pablo Larrain has form with tragic female icons. He made Jackie, the 2016 picture about the world's most famous widow, set in the wake of the Kennedy assassination.  One of the wackiest episodes comes during dinner on Christmas Eve, when a despairing Diana tears off a pearl necklace identical to one she knows Charles has given Camilla. The enormous pearls then plop into her soup, whereupon she promptly starts scoffing them before later, inevitably, throwing them up. In the vast Sandringham kitchens, the head chef (Sean Harris) reminds the staff to abide by a sign reading 'Keep Noise To A Minimum — They Can Hear You'.  Yes, these royals are like the monsters in the alien-invasion thriller A Quiet Place, only it's Diana who is depicted as the alien, entirely at odds with the stuffy formality mostly embodied by the Queen Mother's hide bound equerry Major Gregory (Timothy Spall).  One of those buttoned-up, patrician Scots for whom sex is what they deliver the coal in, the major has been sent from Clarence House to keep a stern eye on Diana, whose outsider status is rammed home from the start when she loses her way driving herself up to Norfolk.  Here is a woman lost in more ways than one, is the unsubtle message. Her only real soulmate is her favourite dresser, Maggie (Sally Hawkins), although even that relationship turns out to be more complicated than it appears.  The film is at its sweetest when showing us Diana's warm embrace of motherhood, and in truth Stewart does a fine job, nailing the breathy voice and Sloaney accent.  At first all you see are the differences, but gradually all you see is Diana, even though Stewart is considerably shorter than the princess was.  The Queen (Stella Gonet) looks as if she's been stuffing herself with steroids. She is nearly as tall as the Duke of Edinburgh (­Richard Sammel), who incidentally seems to spend most of the movie as an elective mute, another spectacular swerve from reality.  The crashing irony of this film, and its greatest flaw, is that in trying so hard to make us feel sorry for Diana, it leaves us feeling more than a little miffed on behalf of the others, especially Charles.  Well, it did me For all his missteps, Charles is no Henry VIII, hard as Larrain hammers the parallels with Henry's ill-fated queen Anne Boleyn, with whom Diana, we are led to believe, felt a powerful spiritual kinship.  Kinship also looms large in Eternals, the latest Marvel blockbuster, during which only the gift of eternal life will stop you looking at your watch, willing the final credits to hove in to sight.  The eponymous Eternals are a band of superheroes created by the Celestials to protect humanity from the Deviants, which is all very well, but there's surely no need for it to take them quite so long.  Director Chloe Zhao, whose last film was the Oscar-winning Nomadland, gets terribly carried away showing us that she can do outrageous fantasy as well as gritty authenticity, and better still, not at the expense of her liberal credentials.  There is even a split personality and a deaf-mute in their number, to remind us that mental and physical disabilities are not incompatible with living for ever and saving the planet.  The CGI-augmented action whisks us on a dizzying tour through history and geography from ancient Mesopotamia to modern-day Camden Town, in a story that fuses with Greek myth and legend in a way that would be streamlined and thrilling if it wasn't so bloated and boring. My favourite release of the week is the least glitzy by a very long way. It's a documentary called Men Who Sing (★★★★✩, 78 mins, 12A) and it's a real charmer, made with manifest devotion by Dylan Williams, who also made a lovely film 11 years ago called Men Who Swim.  That was about the camaraderie within Sweden's all-male synchronised swimming team, of which Williams was a member. This, too, is deeply personal: inspired by Ed, his elderly father in North Wales, who has been singing with the same male-voice choir for 65 years. Unsurprisingly, there is a melancholic feel to all this, but it is also tremendously life-affirming in its way, full of humour and warmth, not to mention a glorious finale as the choir competes again for the first time in 15 years. I would defy anyone to watch with dry eyes.  The Card Counter (★★★✩✩, 15, 111 mins) is a hard watch for very different reasons, as it gradually becomes clear why a brilliant professional gambler (Oscar Isaac) suffers from a form of post-traumatic stress. The writer-director is Paul Schrader, to whose long list of illustrious credits (he wrote Taxi Driver and Raging Bull for Martin Scorsese) this is a worthy addition.  I couldn't quite shake off a sense that the two distinct narratives would have been better served by separate films, but Isaac is splendid and gets top-notch support from Tye Sheridan, Tiffany Haddish and Willem Dafoe.  Red Notice (★★★✩✩, 12A, 115 mins) is a tongue-in-cheek art-heist caper starring Ryan Reynolds, Dwayne Johnson and Gal Gadot. Reynolds does his standard jaunty turn as a wisecracking rascal, and there's nothing particularly original about any of it — apart perhaps from an unexpected glimpse of The Great British Bake Off.

"Nov 5, 2021"," It seems as if the Marvel empire, in a greatly accelerated echo of its Roman predecessor, is entering the early stages of decadence and monied complacency. At least those ancients had some fun. The superhero conglomerate tempts the gathering Goths with an entertainment so po-faced you half expect it to come with footnotes and a study guide. Large parts of Chloé Zhao's film find the impressively starry cast – Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Richard Madden, Barry Keoghan, many others – sitting in dark rooms discussing the film's gimcrack theology. If they weren't dressed like members of Earth Wind & Fire you could be forgiven for thinking you were watching a left-wing book group in a trendier corner of Portland. ""Just relax and have fun,"" critics of Marvel are often told. I would if I could, darling. This is not to suggest the film is afraid of taking big swings. Putting the kitchen sink ambitions of Avengers Endgame to shame, Eternals is about nothing smaller than the birth of the universe and the potential death of God. I would continue ""if you've read the comic..."" but as almost nobody has read the comic, I'll just explain that a being named Arishem conjured the cosmos from near nothing and engineered our creation alongside an unimpressive herd of evil lizards called the Deviants and the quietly protective beings who give this film its title. If – as I wasn't – you were wondering where the Eternals were during the Endgame rearrangements there is an explanation here that makes as much sense as the question deserves. Anyway, now Kingo, Phastos, Druig, Ajax, Dozy, Beaky, Mick and Tich (not all these names may be correct) really do have to protect the world from an existential threat. Look, there are choices worth celebrating. It's nice that one of the heroes is deaf (Lauren Ridloff plays a Billy Whizz sort called Makkari). It is about time a franchise built on cartoon violence allowed a modestly sweaty sex scene. It shouldn't be worth commenting that another character lives in suburban familial bliss with a partner of the same sex. We like that someone is allowing Chloé Zhao, recent Oscar-winner for Nomadland, enough money to build her own solar system. But the sluggishness and drabness is unforgivable. Two thirds an eye-wateringly enormous ""let's get the gang back together"" story – passing through versions of Earth's ancient past that resemble cut scenes from Sid Meier's Civilisation – and one third an underlit apocalypse, Eternals will succeed only with those open to vigorous special pleading.",NEUTRAL
"Nov 5, 2021"," I have been a Marvel Comics fan ever since I was a kid. I haven’t collected the actual comics in a while, but I was a pretty avid reader back in the day and consider myself an old-school fan. I still have the entire catalog of the 80s RPG on hand, even all the old “official handbooks” just for the lore and character info. I follow the new adaptations, and I’ve consumed the entirety of the MCU. Even with all that, I barely knew who the Eternals were. And after having seen a movie all about them, I still barely know who they are now. The Eternals film starts out with a text crawl which…was a choice. But it does let us know that the Eternals are super-powered, near-immortal individuals sent to protect planets from monsters called Deviants by the Celestials, the cosmic creators of the universe. These specific Eternals have been on Earth for 7,000 years fighting the Deviants but otherwise not engaging in humanity’s conflicts. When the Deviants re-emerge on Earth, the scattered Eternals must band together to fight them again, but there is an ever bigger threat on the horizon.  The film focuses mostly on the Eternal Sersi (Gemma Chan), who serves as both the emotional center and a sometimes audience surrogate, but the actual team includes a whopping ten Eternals and a handful of supporters. It’s a large cast to throw at the audience all at once, and to say that it’s a lot to digest is being generous. That’s even before getting into the massive amounts of lore and background information necessary to process even a fraction of the film’s plot. There’s a lot going on here, and despite the best effort of everyone involved, it doesn’t always work. Eternals is something of an odd beast in the MCU. It’s the first film directed by the winner of an Oscar for Best Director*, that being Chloé Zhao, who picked up the award for Nomadland between the filming and release of Eternals. And it was Zhao who approached Marvel, being a fan of the franchise. On top of directing, she also contributed to the screenplay. That all sounds like a formula to create a singularly unique entry in MCU, something distinct and expressive. I just wish that could be how the final product could be described. To be fair and to be sure, Zhao doesn’t do anything wrong here. It’s clear she was trying to put her own stamp on the MCU, and she has her heart in the right place. But her voice comes out only about half of the time, often being drowned out by the MCU’s overriding, inflexible formula. Nothing here from a visual or purely cinematic sense is bad; like everything in the MCU, it never falls below a certain level of quality. The action scenes are well-framed, the CGI well-executed, the colors and frames and set-ups well-planned. The designs of the Deviants are especially intriguing, creatures seemingly made entirely of sinew and malice. The frustration lies in seeing what Zhao could have made and should have been allowed to make being smothered by the Disney/Marvel brand.  This often leads to film that looks beyond reproach but can be a task to watch. There is a tremendous amount of story crammed into the film’s runtime, and it doesn’t always seem to fit properly. The narrative is constantly shifting back and forth in time from the present day to flashbacks highlighting vital parts of the Eternals’ personal histories. Given the lifespans of the Eternals themselves, this was probably something that couldn’t be avoided, but the flashbacks are extended almost to the point of self-indulgence, pulling us away from the immediate conflict that we should be getting hooked into. Because of this, it’s hard to be concerned about that conflict because any time momentum is built, it seems to get derailed by a trip down memory lane. That isn’t even getting into the Lore, and it does seem like it deserves that capital letter given the weight it’s delivered with. Eternals concerns itself with nothing less than the creation of the MCU itself and the reason Earth and humanity exists in the first place. It’s a level of cosmic perspective that’s familiar to fans of the comics but has never been touched on in the films, at least not to this degree. It seems like we’re jumping a few stages of evolution to get to it though, and the sheer enormity of the shift makes it hard to swallow. Like the planet-sized Celestials themselves, it’s a lot to take in all at once. It might sound like I’m ragging on the movie, and I kind of am, but I want to point out that this is not necessarily a bad movie, just a kind of disappointment. There is a lot of potential for an excellent film here that gets squelched by the Marvel formula and its own narrative weight. This is a film that should not have been a film but a six-episode Disney+ series that gives us more time to live with the characters, their story, and their background. Why this was condensed into a movie and Falcon and the Winter Soldier stretched into a series is beyond me, but those circumstances should have been reversed in the green-lighting womb. What makes the film keep going however, what makes it truly rise above itself is the cast. This is a good cast, a talented cast, and a cast that deserved that six-episode series to really shine. It’s clear that everyone has a good grasp on their characters, and it’s another facet of frustration that we don’t get to see more of them. Gemma Chan is a fantastic lead, and Sersi is probably the right Eternal to focus on here. She’s the member of the team most in love with Earth and humanity, and Chan gives her a strong, complicated heart. Sersi is very emotion-driven, and of all the Eternals exhibits the most potential for growth and evolution. Chan is simply wonderful in the role, and if Marvel is smart, they’ll utilize her again very soon. Other standouts from the cast include Angelina Jolie as the team’s weapon expert Thena, who struggles with the weight of her own memories, and Kumail Nanjiani as Kingo, the film’s comic relief. Jolie is of course radiant and powerful as always, and she was sculpted by the universe to play warrior-goddesses. Nanjiani more than anyone seems thrilled to be there, and that’s not just the PEDs he took to get in his supremely super-buff shape talking. Kingo adds a very welcome amount of levity to film that otherwise doesn’t engage in as much of the MCU’s characteristic humor as we might be used to. Special note should be made of the huge amount of diversity in the Eternals themselves. Most of the character’s incarnations are based on more modern versions of their comics counterparts, leading to a team of mixed genders, mixed colors, and mixed abilities. We have our first deaf MCU hero in super-speedster Makkari, played by deaf actress Lauren Ridloff. We also have our first openly gay** MCU hero in the mechanically-inclined Phastos, played by Phillip Tyree Henry. Not only does Henry get to play a powerful, creative character who’s a courageous fighter, Phastos’ primarily emotional arc involves his human family. We get to meet both his husband (played by gay actor Haaz Sleiman) and their adopted child. Phastos and his husband even share a kiss on screen. Credit should be given to Zhao and Marvel for integrating Phastos’ family in a way that makes them important enough to the film’s emotional narrative that they can’t easily be cut out for…shall we say specific audiences.  Despite the great cast, and despite Zhao’s best and clearly sincere efforts, Eternals is still a bit of a task to get through. There’s so much stuffed into the film’s runtime that even at 157 minutes, it feels like it’s not enough. There are long stretches where there’s a lot of drama but little movement, and it just seems like there’s an imbalance of cinematic energies throughout. It’s a noble effort, and there’s clearly a seed of brilliance lying deep in the film’s heart that gets unfairly inhibited by Marvel and Disney’s reluctance to let go of its formula. Instead of soaring into the cosmos like it should, it strains against its limitations in a very visible way. Although it’s ultimately enjoyable, a film this epic shouldn’t feel like just another step in the MCU timeline.  * Directors Joe Johnston (Captain America: The First Avenger) and Taika Waititi (Thor: Ragnarok) are both Oscar winners, but neither won for Best Director. Johnston won for Best Visual Effects for Raiders of the Lost Ark while Waititi won for Best Adapted Screenplay for Jojo Rabbit. ** Valkyrie in Thor: Ragnarok was supposed to be portrayed as openly bisexual, but those scenes were allegedly cut before the film was released. In addition, there was an unnamed gay character in Avengers: Endgame, but he was a regular human and not an MCU superhero.

"Nov 5, 2021"," Perhaps it was too big a burden for one film to bear. The origin story of 10 superheroes. An entirely new mythology about godlike aliens called Celestials who create the Eternals to protect humanity from monstrous beings called Deviants. A laudable attempt at inclusivity and representation – one of the Eternals is hearing impaired, another is in a same-sex relationship and yet another is a Bollywood hero. An Oscar-winning director, Chloe Zhao, attempting to seamlessly blend the demands of making an MCU movie with her own artistic instinct for sweeping landscapes and intimate human drama. These varied strains tug at the film's screenplay which hopscotches across several millennia – the story takes place over 7,000 years. It starts in ancient Mesopotamia at the beginning of civilisation, then moves to ancient Babylon in 2500 BC and we even get a few scenes set in the Gupta Empire in 400 AD. Other than English, the languages spoken in the film include Babylonian, Sanskrit, Spanish and Hindi. Eventually it all proves to be too much. Eternals is a lumbering, mystifying film that occasionally sparkles but never soars. The film is part of the MCU's Phase Four. It's based on Jack Kirby's 1976 comic series and takes place after Avengers: Endgame. In fact, the events in Endgame act as a catalyst for Eternals. The Eternals have been silently keeping watch over humanity for thousands of years. Some have integrated into society. Sersi, played by Gemma Chan, works as a museum curator while Kingo, played by Kumail Nanjiani, is a Bollywood hero. It's a lovely idea to acknowledge and include another style of mainstream moviemaking. Besides, the traditional Bollywood hero is a superhero without a cape, so a superhero playing a superhero has wit baked into it. But the film doesn't do enough with this. Kingo is introduced with an insipid dance number. I have no idea why Marvel didn't just hire Farah Khan. The film exhibits the most superficial understanding of the Hindi film industry but Harish Patel playing Karun, Kingo's valet, infuses some fun into the plot. And Kingo, who has been posing as his own great-great-grandfather to explain his longevity, gives a whole new twist to the nepotism debate. Does the same person pretending to be different people related to each other over hundreds of years qualify as nepotism? Not all the Eternals are having this much fun. The leader, Ajak, played by a somber Salma Hayek, lives alone in the dusty outback of South Dakota. Gilgamesh and Thena, played by Ma Dong-seok and Angelina Jolie, are also stationed in the middle of nowhere because she can get violent. And then there is Ikaris, played by Richard Madden, who was once married to Sersi but then disappeared for a few thousand years. Essentially, it's a large dysfunctional family with wounds and grudges being nursed over millennia. The screenplay by Zhao, Patrick Burleigh, Ryan Firpo and Kaz Firpo juggles between setting up the various tensions within the group and their relationship with Arishem, the celestial being they take their orders from. Like the Greek gods, the Eternals are powerful but flawed. They are wrestling with the burden of immortality, their role as protectors, their desire for love and happiness and their ultimate destiny as pawns manipulated by Arishem. The story throbs with ache in a way that MCU films rarely do. Zhao has an uncanny talent for locating the poetry in loss. But she is unable to effectively marry these moments of emotional stillness with the cacophony of three-eyed CGI beasts or the more down-to-earth comedy that is a part of the MCU DNA. The Deviants are personality-free bad guys and the battles with these creatures soon become eye-glazing. The film also has too much exposition. The various complicated relationships are explained rather than shown. And then there is the figure of Arishem, a rock-like being with holes where a face should be. Arishem is designed as an imposing patriarch but he comes off as petulant and slightly silly. The screenplay isn't able to imbue him with enough gravitas or menace. Ramin Djawadi's haunting background score adds scale and sweep to the stunning landscapes captured by DOP Ben Davis. In interviews, Marvel Studios' president Kevin Feige talked about Zhao fighting for practical locations and practical elements. The film has been shot mainly on location. In the production notes, Davis explains that wide-angle spherical lenses and deep focus were used ""in order to explore the relationship between the characters and the world they live in."" When the Eternals gather against the horizon, Zhao constructs the required majesty. There is an imposing beauty about them. But the film never finds its pulse. By the time we get to the idea of the Uni-Mind — the ability of the Eternals to connect and amplify the power of any single Eternal — deep fatigue has set in. There is ambition and beauty here but despite its many singular traits, the film feels bereft of a singular vision. It's neither properly a Chloé Zhao film nor an MCU film. The film is the cinematic equivalent of the proverbial dhobi ka kutta. Na ghar ka na ghat ka.",NEGATIVE
"Nov 5, 2021"," Eternals is a little long, slightly overstuffed, concerned with the worries of gods rather than mortals, and shot with an eye that, when its allowed to roam, occasionally captures something quite beautiful, every frame a painting, every character a figure to be moved about on a distant horizon to suggest the immensity of it all. Sitting in my local Drafthouse on opening night, it quickly became clear why this film is on track to earn the MCU its first splat on Rotten Tomatoes: Chloé Zhao has made a movie that apes the concerns (and thus ponderousness) of the DC films, yet every action scene is shot in the flat MCU house style that feels weightless (and thus stakes-free). Spanning the whole of recorded human history, from 5000 B.C. to the present day, Eternals opens with a crawl explaining that there are “celestials” and the celestials made “Eternals” to protect intelligent life from “deviants.” And boom, there’s the whole crew: Superman-lite Ikaris (Richard Madden); “Prime” Eternal Ajak (Salma Hayek), with the power to heal herself; Thena (Angelina Jolie), a warrior goddess; Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), who has the powers of Goku; Sersi (Gemma Chan), who … you know what, it doesn’t really matter, and I've only listed half of them. The point is, they’re a bunch of superpowered folks whose appearance on Earth is the source of our legends and myths, and they all have different abilities that they use to fight the CGI lizards that emerge from the ocean and try to kill humans. They’ve been sent by a planet-sized celestial named Arishem to protect humanity from the deviants. But there’s a secret and things aren’t quite what they seem and they have to figure out what’s going on in order to save the world. You know, typical hero stuff. Let’s set all the story mechanics to one side—once you take a look at the writer credits on this film you get a sense of just why everything feels remarkably disjointed and tossed together, as if the plot were remixed by blender—and instead just focus for a second on the moment-to-moment. On the one hand, there are a handful of very nice turns. Kingo and his valet, Karun (Harish Patel), are a clear highlight, providing traditional MCU comic relief. Though Gilgamesh’s (Don Lee) happy warrior routine gives them a run for their money. I don’t think it’s quite enough, though. Despite being immortal lovers reuniting after centuries apart, Chan and Madden have no chemistry. Salma Hayek and Angelina Jolie aren’t given anything to work with; they feel adrift. Barry Keoghan gives it a fair effort as Druig, his brooding scowl a fair effort at illustrating the problem of gods, goodness, and free will—but Eternals never feels as though it’s actually interested in the question of human self-determination in the face of divine obliteration. The score by Ramin Djawadi—best known for his work on Game of Thrones—is forgettable, even by Marvel standards. The less said about the special effects, the better; again, there’s a weightlessness to every fight, and the villain design just feels slapdash, almost an afterthought. As one might expect from the auteur behind The Rider and Nomadland, the pacing is fairly described as slow; this is a movie that feels every one of its 157 minutes. Despite the fact that Eternals has the opposite problem of Zhao’s other films—too much plot rather than too little—I still found myself getting a little itchy, wishing things would move along a little quicker. I also found myself desperately wanting to like this movie a little more as it dragged on. When I wrote above that this feels like the MCU doing a DC movie, I don’t intend it as an insult; I like most of those movies, even the ones that don’t really work, because at least they’re attempting something interesting, philosophically. But the result here is really disappointing. Yes, it has some pretty shots; no one would ever suggest that Chloé Zhao doesn’t know how to use a horizon or a sunset or a sunrise. But it’s a bit of a mess.",NEUTRAL
"Nov 5, 2021"," All superhero movies are ridiculous. That’s where the super part comes in. With the good superhero movies, you don’t notice the ridiculousness — or it doesn’t matter. With “Eternals,” you notice. “Eternals” sounds like a line of perfumes. That’s never a good sign in the title of a superhero movie. It’s the latest roll-out in Marvel’s post-“Avengers” brand extension. In July, Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow got a movie of her own — and it set up her kid sister, played by Florence Pugh, for a new one. In September, there was “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings.” That was a two-fer: a new story line with a new hero, the title character, with both clearly aimed at the Asian market. “Eternals” offers a new story line with a set of new heroes. Note that the movie is currently only in theaters. It’ll be at least another 45 days before Disney+ makes it available for streaming. The 10 title characters are like the Avengers, another superhero cluster, only gone cosmic. The Eternals (good guys) were created by the Celestials (all-powerful guys) to defend the human race from Deviants (bad guys). The Eternals are ageless and have supernatural powers. They look like us (only much more attractive). As for Deviants, they look like a combination of overgrown lizard and undergrown dinosaur, with a bit of wolf thrown in. It was Deviants, we learn, who made the dinosaurs extinct. Imagine what they’d do to us humans. Thankfully the Eternals, who have been around since the dawn of history, haven’t given them the chance. They arrived here on a spaceship called the Domo, which looks very cool if aerodynamically improbable. There are flashbacks to ancient Mesopotamia (which, oddly, seems to have acquired an ocean), Babylon, India’s Gupta Empire, Tenochtitlan, at the time of the Spanish conquest, and Hiroshima, when the atomic bomb was dropped. That one seems a bit grotesque and more than a bit self-aggrandizing. Back in the present, the movie visits London, South Dakota, Alaska, Australia, Mumbai, Brazil, and Iraq. Be glad you’re not the Eternals’ travel agent. All that jumping around in both time and locale gives the movie sweep. It also gives viewers whiplash. “Eternals” has a pretty tricky narrative structure, and lots (and lots) of exposition, which does little for understanding and even less for pacing. The couple of “Avengers” references are nice to hear — they do pay attention at Marvel — and the name Thanos is heard. No wonder he caused such trouble in the last two “Avengers” movies: He’s an Eternals/Deviant hybrid. The Deviants have been under control for a while, but now they’re looking to make trouble. “Something’s happening to Earth,” Gemma Chan’s Sersi says to fellow Eternal Ikaris (Richard Madden). “It can’t be a coincidence.” She’s got that right. Sersi? Ikaris? Some Eternals have names derived from the ancient Greeks. Angelina Jolie is Thena. Salma Hayek is Ajak. Brian Tyree Henry is Phastos. Other names come by way of Mesopotamia (Don Lee’s Gilgamesh), ancient Celts (Barry Keoghan’s Druig), and the Coca-Cola Company (Lia McHugh’s Sprite). Besides the fanciness of their names, Eternals differ from Avengers in various ways, though feuding with each other is not among them. Half of them are female. They know sign language, since one of them, Makkari, is deaf, as is the actress who plays her, Lauren Midloff. Another is gay. Several Eternals, not to name names, aren’t exactly superheroic in their physiques. The group is matter-of-factly multiracial; whether this is a function of enlightenment, further brand extension, or both, is impossible to say. Either way, it’s welcome. “Eternals” also includes the first instance that this viewer can recall of sex between two superheroes. “Eternals” has another first, a comic-relief Marvel superhero, Kumail Nanjiani’s Kingo. This is a type different from a witty Marvel superhero (Robert Downey Jr.’s Ironman) or comical one (Paul Rudd’s Ant-Man, Chris Pratt’s Star-Lord). It doesn’t work, especially a subplot about a documentary Kingo is filming about his fellow Eternals. That said, the movie does have a pretty funny Ikea joke; and when some Eternals show up unannounced at a no-longer-active colleague’s door, he introduces them to his family as, um, “my friends from college” (shades of the Coneheads’ “We’re from France”). One of the smartest things the Marvel people have done in the past is bring in talented young non-action filmmakers to direct their movies: Ryan Coogler with “Black Panther”; Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck with “Captain Marvel.” That tradition continues here, with Chloé Zhao, who won an Oscar earlier this year for “Nomadland.” Is her presence behind the camera discernible? Nanjiani aside, the actors are all fine, if not more than that. The movie emphasizes personal relationships as other Marvel movies haven’t, and it has a vaguely religioso quality. That’s about it. Zhao has said she’s up for directing the sequel, a follow-up which the end of “Eternals” all but announces. Fire up the Domo. Let’s hope “Eternals II” is more aerodynamic. Directed by Chloé Zhao. Written by Zhao, Patrick Burleigh, Ryan Firpo, Kaz Firpo. Starring Gemma Chan, Richard Madden, Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Kumail Nanjiani, Lia McHugh, Brian Tyree Henry. At Boston theaters, Kendall Square, suburbs. 136 minutes. PG-13 (fantasy violence and action, some language, brief sexuality).",NEUTRAL
"Nov 5, 2021"," Fresh off winning best picture and director at the last Academy Awards for her masterpiece “Nomadland,” Chloé Zhao delivers the most unusual Marvel film in some time. Unusual is a welcome diversion from the familiar superheroes, whose origin stories have been played out to exhaustion. While the big question is how these “Eternals” fit into the Marvel Comics Universe, that concept becomes less interesting as we dive into this new, complicated superhero story.

"Nov 5, 2021"," It was supposed to be different, wasn’t it, with its commitment to real locations and imagery not wedded to the artificial? Trailers teased as much — lush jungle, water cresting over gnarled rocks, sunsets peeking through outstretched hands. A reflection of the sensibilities director and co-writer Chloé Zhao developed in films like the evocative The Rider and far less evocative Nomadland. Eternals, the latest installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, has been poised as her powerhouse, meant to push this slick, tangled universe further than ever before, into a realm where an auteur’s visuals stick and the characters — played by the likes of Angelina Jolie and Salma Hayek — seem soulful, rather than like action figures with scant interiority beyond what the narrative needs to push a story along. But for all its bluster and its vastness of time, Eternals feels strangely vacuum-sealed. Spanning 7,000 years of human history, the film follows an immortal superhero group from a faraway planet tasked with shaping humanity’s development and fending off the big bads — the Deviants, a group of colorful CGI monsters that look like countless other colorful CGI monsters— with a variety of matter-manipulating, energy-harnessing, weapons-transmuting abilities. Ajak (a criminally underused Hayek) is the ballast for the group, a maternal font of support leading them through all these centuries. She’s joined by Sersi (the ever-gorgeous Gemma Chan), perennially late and a bit of a phone addict, who, in scenes with her former romantic partner of 5,000 years, Ikaris (Richard Madden), is all clenched jaws and downcast gazes. Thena (Jolie, forever deserving better) is a warrior who physically struggles with the weight of thousands of years of memories curdling in her brain. The dynamic between Thena and the bruiser Gilgamesh (Ma Dong-seok) could have teased out some tender intimacy, but the film doesn’t spend the time to really dig in — to this relationship or any other between its ten or so main characters. There are battles in Mesopotamia and Babylon, and trips to the twilight expanse of outer space. There’s a drably choreographed and shot Bollywood dance number introducing Kumail Nanjiani’s superpowered movie star, Kingo. But as the film grows more convoluted (with references to Celestials and Avengers and even some DC characters, if you can believe it), the actors struggle to bring the world-weariness necessary for us to care about any of them. You would think this an impossibility, given how effective and charismatic they’ve been elsewhere. But even the best actors among them seem to strain to find a way to stand out and add the touching foibles that make a superheroic character memorable. Perhaps most notably, and despite Nanjiani’s strenuous effort, the comedy in the film doesn’t suit any cast member’s distinct talents. It’s a reminder that asking wildly different actors to do the same thing — deploy the kind of irreverent banter that’s come to define MCU dialogue — only serves to flatten the franchise’s supposedly expansive worlds. Zhao has neither the deftness nor the interest in elevating this homogenous speaking style, but the reliance on quippy humor speaks more to how Marvel and its stakeholders misunderstand the allure of stars in the first place. Here, they are interchangeable; the cutesy, digestible comedy presence of Nanjiani cranes toward the angled glamour of Jolie until there’s almost no distinction between them. Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), Marvel’s first deaf character, has some spunk when she’s given anything to do, but it’s not enough to distract from the banality around her. The grander Eternals story, littered with MCU plot holes that get carelessly papered over as more and more heroes and villains make themselves known (where have they been?) and the most powerful figures in MCU’s known arsenal remain absent, doesn’t help to ground the stars or dialogue in their cosmic backdrop. In a conversation with her little-seen mortal boyfriend, Dane Whitman (Kit Harington), Sersi explains why the Eternals didn’t help in “all the other wars,” specifically when Thanos snapped half of humanity out of existence. “We were told not to unless Deviants were involved,” she says with that same level, silken tone Chan uses no matter the tension or shape of a scene. (Nonetheless, we get a shot of Phastos, played by Brian Tyree Henry, in 1945 Hiroshima, crying about aiding the technological development that led to genocidal results. Yes, you read that right.) Dane, comic readers might note, is the alias of the Black Knight, but he unfortunately factors very little into this narrative. (That he’s nonplussed by his girlfriend’s status as an ancient alien will give you a sense of how he functions in the plot.) That doesn’t stop him from getting his own end-credits scene. For all the talk about Eternals standing on its own, Marvel still can’t help but tease out upcoming properties. Endless foreplay without climax — this is how Marvel has shaped audiences, to always be eager not about what you’re currently watching but the next thing. A star is a powerful tool in a director’s arsenal. They bring rich, complicated histories that can be subverted, played with, even alluded to in film. They can bend light, move their bodies in that exceptional way. But if they aren’t used properly, they become nothing more than marketing tools. Zhao and cinematographer Ben Davis’s camera understand that the actors are beautiful, but in a clinical way — the way you might admire a particularly lush red rose in a photograph. Given that the script doesn’t treat the actors as individuals, but rather as vehicles for bland jokes and exposition, one might turn to the action sequences to glean any idea of who these people are. But in the first major set piece, the camera is static, lacking a kineticism to make the punches reverberate. There are minute touches — Thena has a balletic brutality that would be more intriguing if CGI didn’t render her body weightless. But whether the Eternals are fighting in desert terrain or hurtling through space, no one character is permitted to stand out or evoke awe. A sex scene between Sersi and Ikaris fares no better, filmed from the chest up, chastely focusing on their faces. It’s ten seconds of loving missionary, not exactly the sort of groundbreaking sensuality these films are in desperate need of. For all its commitment to magic-hour sunlight, the film’s quiet gestures at beauty fail the requisite MCU love story. Once again, Marvel has ensembled an undeniably gorgeous array of actors only to have the sexual chemistry between them be slim or nonexistent. Of course, a franchise obsessed with deities and aliens continues to fumble one of the greatest pleasures of being a human being. Eternals is buoyed along by questions about the worth of humanity. Why do these superpowered aliens care at all about humans, beyond the fact that they were told to? Sure, Phastos has a husband and a young kid. But what about the rest? What drives them beyond a murky desire to do the right thing? There’s gristle to Druig’s (Barry Keoghan) slim portion of the story. He can control people’s minds and has been doing so with Indigenous folks in the Amazon for generations. It’s a queasy turn that the film never unpacks, shuffling it offscreen before we spend too long grappling with what it might mean. Marvel has grown so powerful in part because of how it treats diversity and identity as a checklist; the Eternals characters indeed range in ability, race, and sexuality. But what does it matter to have, say, a gay kiss onscreen, when there’s no heat behind it? What does it matter if the women are of various hues and ages if you don’t care about their interiority? With Eternals, Marvel proves itself to be nothing more than a staid, lumbering black hole. What’s the point in pulling in Hollywood stars if you’re just going to obliterate them? Jolie is one of the most fascinating, complicated, and high-profile celebrities to have ever existed. Her history can’t help but shape a film — a franchise, even. Her physicality can’t help but bring dimension to an action scene. She can’t help but make a movie her movie. And yet despite the heft of Eternals, it’s marked by emptiness. In the end, Eternals is nobody’s film.",NEGATIVE
"Nov 5, 2021"," ★★☆☆☆There’s a strange self-sabotaging energy at the heart of this landmark blockbuster. On the surface the 26th instalment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is about conspicuous reinvention and interrogation of formula. The aesthetics are refined and the historical sweep is ambitious — from Mesopotamia in 5000BC to today, via Gupta-era India and 16th-century Mexico. Even the film’s villainous monsters, the “deviants”, are conceived with originality, as huge sinuous quadrupeds, like a robust collection of man-eating computer cables. It is the characters, however, who represent the biggest shift away from the swaggering, mostly white, mostly male, mostly straight, mostly neurotypical and mostly hearing ensembles (think Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, etc) that have defined the Marvel brand thus far.",NEUTRAL
"Nov 5, 2021"," The latest from Marvel Studios introduces ten new lead characters, following their stories over 7,000 years, features multiple cosmic entities, and answers questions fans have had for years. Luckily, the film is in good hands with director Chloé Zhao. How can a big-budget superhero film go bigger AND smaller at the same time? It’s no simple task, but the answer can be found in Eternals – the 26th entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.  The third film of Phase Four seeks to answer not only questions about the franchise, but about humanity and life itself. Tapping director Chloé Zhao (who won the Oscar for Best Director with Nomadland last year) to helm the project is a huge key to its success. The filmmaker focuses on character development and existential questions about the universe, while managing to balance all the big-budget action fans have come to expect from the biggest franchise in history.  Filmgoers and casual comic readers may be unfamiliar with The Eternals, created by prolific comic creator Jack Kirby (co-creator of The Fantastic Four, Hulk, Iron Man, The X-Men, and many others). They are a group of superpowered beings sent to protect Earth by The Celestials – cosmic entities introduced in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. In Eternals, they are sent to Earth by Arishem (David Kaye) to safeguard its inhabitants from creatures called Deviants. The film’s Eternals are: Sersi (Gemma Chan), Ikaris (Richard Madden), Thena (Angelina Jolie), Ajak (Salma Hayek), Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), Sprite (Lia McHugh), Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), Druig (Barry Keoghan), and Gilgamesh (Don Lee). Eternals feels like a breath of fresh air, unlike anything we have seen before in the MCU. The film is contemplative in pacing, thoughtful in its examination of each character and their motivations, and explores the meaning and existence of humanity on a galactic scale. Meanwhile, it packs all the heavy-hitting, spectacular action that fans would expect from a Marvel movie. The way Zhao manages to blend arthouse and blockbuster cinema is masterful.  Ben Davis’ cinematography takes viewers around the world, across several millennia, highlighting dozens of locations in breathtaking fashion. Cameron Early’s fight choreography is cleanly captured and easy to follow – from hand-to-hand combat to superpowered beings soaring through the air. And when it comes to smaller moments, of which there are many involving each character, they are beautifully captured through an intimate lens. The film features one of the most diverse casts in history, not only for just superhero films, and is packed with terrific performances. Each actor brings their A-game to the table, and it’s impressive how many big names Marvel was able to enlist for their most ambitious origin film yet. While all of the leads do a great job, Gemma Chan truly shines as the protagonist the film focuses on the most. She’s proven herself in film and television over the past decade, but the role of Sersi definitely cements her star power. It’s difficult to get into the movie without giving too much away, so I will say it is best to see it for yourself and judge where it lands in the MCU. The film has certainly been divisive amongst critics so far, with many saying it feels too strange, or that it feels too much like a Marvel film to be as different as it yearns to be. But I say the uniqueness and thoughtful storytelling is its biggest strength, and that there is plenty to appease both hardcore fans of the franchise as well as those feeling burnt out by the inundation of comic book movies.  Eternals is exactly how we can continue to get Marvel movies without the formula feeling stale, while still scratching the itch audiences have for big, bombastic, superpowered action. The film introduces an impressive amount of new heroes, answers questions about their existence in relation to established characters and events, and still manages to craft a compelling story and character study. And while it feels different than anything else we’ve seen before, it is familiar enough to fit firmly into the well-established franchise. ",POSITIVE
"Nov 5, 2021"," Si tuviese que señalar una única gran virtud gracias a la que el mundo del cómic ""pijamero"" ha logrado atrapar en sus redes a infinidad de lectores —incluyendo a un servidor— a lo largo de su longeva historia, esa sería, sin duda, sus personajes. Un surtido de héroes y heroínas que trascienden a sus poderes y naturalezas superhumanas para ofrecer un reflejo de la marginalidad, el trauma y el desamparo que suelen encerrar los alter-ego mundanos que se ocultan tras capas, máscaras y antifaces.  Es este cariz humano el que invita a congeniar de forma instantánea y hace que nos veamos proyectados en los Peter Parker, Bruce Banner, Hal Jordan o Barry Allen de turno; incluso en unos Thor o Superman cuyas condiciones de Dios del Trueno y salvador mesiánico alienígena quedan en segundo plano una vez se profundiza en unos problemas muchos más terrenales de lo que cabría esperar. Lamentablemente, los 'Eternals' con los que Marvel Studios ha decidido continuar su Fase 4 se encuentran en la otra cara de la moneda, presentando al público una suerte de deidades milenarias con cuya gélida y condescendiente mirada sobre la humanidad es casi imposible de conectar, y que protagoniza el largometraje con más personalidad del estudio. Aunque esto no es, necesariamente, algo positivo, ya que se traduce en más de dos plomizas y deslavazadas horas y media que convierten en realidad lo que parecía imposible: que una película de superhéroes, además de aburrida, sea tremendamente pedante.  Quienes me conozcan o me hayan leído sabrán que la deriva del Universo Cinematográfico de Marvel una vez concluida la Saga del Infinito no está siendo, precisamente, santo de mi devoción. Las producciones catódicas me han dejado a medio gas y, en el ámbito cinematográfico, únicamente 'Shang-Chi' ha logrado disipar mínimamente —y a golpe de entretenimiento puro— la sensación de estar ante creaciones salidas de una fábrica de producción en masa; pero si hay algo que reivindicar incluso de los títulos menos inspirados es que nunca han llegado a aburrirme completamente —después de todo, la fórmula está sobradamente calculada para impedirlo—. Sabiendo esto, podría decir —no con poco pesar— que 'Eternals' ha sido la primera cinta del MCU que me ha hecho sentir incómodo en la butaca del cine. Gran parte de culpa la ha tenido una narrativa con unos niveles de caos y densidad inesperados para una cineasta de la talla de Chloé Zhao, cuyo salto del panorama independiente al blockbuster de gran presupuesto llega marcado por las toneladas de exposición oral con las que se pretende presentar, en casi 160 minutos, una mitología demasiado vasta y compleja. Y es que en la primera aventura cinematográfica de los Eternos, que arranca con una buena dosis de información en forma de texto no demasiado digestible, el motor del relato no es la acción. En su lugar, todo se articula en torno a unos diálogos tremendamente engolados que subrayan emociones, que verbalizan revelaciones y giros dramáticos —sin ir más lejos, uno de los twists principales se desvela en una secuencia de montaje con voz en off—, que canalizan un discurso humanista de garrafón, y que me han hecho entornar los ojos en no pocas ocasiones ante su efectista artificialidad. Si a esto le sumamos un tratamiento de personajes, interpretados con gran convicción por un reparto entregado a la causa, pero que vira rápidamente del exceso de sensibilidad a la antipatía y hace más sencillo empatizar con un alivio cómico prescindible que con el grupo protagonista, la dificultad para entrar en la propuesta de 'Eternals' es demasiado alta. Y, para salir, hay que pasar por un trámite demasiado largo. Si 'Eternals', aunque no logre desprenderse plenamente de la plantilla marca de la casa Marvel, merece ser calificada como la obra más atípica del MCU es, además de por su indigesta narrativa, por una apuesta formal que choca frontalmente con casi todo lo visto hasta la fecha. La mano de Chloé Zhao se infiltra entre los tics industriales habituales, proyectando el cariz seudodocumental y el gusto por el naturalismo, que ya lució en su extraordinaria 'The Rider', sobre un universo superheróico ambicioso y rico en matices. De nuevo, la directora vuelve a emular el espíritu de Terrence Malick en un ejercicio de estilo encomiable, pero que termina antojándose como un envoltorio vacío y algo cargante para un filme que parece gustarse demasiado a sí mismo, que satura después del enésimo plano rodado a contraluz en hora mágica con los rayos del Sol filtrándose a través de la lente, y que es mucho menos libre de lo que aparenta a simple vista —no es casual que la solvente dirección de fotografía corra a cargo de un veterano en la franquicia como Ben Davis—. Por otro lado, y aunque vuelvan a reincidir en clichés de planificación, montaje y uso de entornos, personajes y cámaras virtuales, las setpieces lucen sorprendentemente bien y muestran unas dinámicas de grupo que evocan por momentos a las de 'Los Vengadores' de Joss Whedon, haciendo de 'Eternals' una experiencia digna de pantalla grande y sistema de sonido atronador —mención especial para la banda sonora de Ramin Djawadi—. Siendo alguien que ha señalado en numerosas ocasiones la falta de coraje de Marvel Studios para salirse del molde y ofrecer algo diferente, ha sido un verdadero jarro de agua fría que la primera gran desviación del camino marcado por la 'Iron Man' de Jon Favreau en 2008, pese a sus virtudes, haya acabado decepcionándome hasta tal punto. Puede que, después de todo, más allá de fondos, formas y técnicas narrativas, lo verdaderamente importante sea algo tan abstracto como establecer una conexión emocional lo más directa posible entre obra y público a través de los personajes, y en el caso de 'Eternals', esta es tan endeble como los primeros pasos de la Fase 4.",NEGATIVE
"Nov 5, 2021"," Following the events of Avengers: Endgame (2019), an unexpected tragedy forces the Eternals, ancient aliens who have been living on Earth in secret for thousands of years, out of the shadows to reunite against mankind’s most ancient enemy, the Deviants. Could superhero fatigue be on the horizon when it comes to comic book films? With Marvel Studios/Disney producing over 25 films with the same familiar formula, one might assume so. Especially since the mentioned production house isn’t the only business making superhero films. However, there’s something fresh and new about the 26th Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film, the Eternals, from Academy Award-winning director Chloé Zhao (Nomadland). Whether fresh and new will appeal to wide audiences around the world is up for debate, but at least the auteur behind the camera left her signature stamp of filmmaking style within the most successful franchise in history. That opens up possibilities that are beyond your wildest imagination. Within this overarching comic book story, half the universe was wiped away by Thanos, then suddenly brought back five years later by the heroes of earth. There has to be something special said about these people achieving such an amazing feat that no other group was able to accomplish. With universal ending catastrophes as this that have come and gone, what other threats in the cosmos could possibly measure up or supersede it? One of the best aspects of Eternals is it answers that question in a vast number of ways. Eternals treats the MCU as if everything that came before is meaningless! It makes you feel as if everything done so far was only scratching the surface. There’s a feeling that these stories can continue to unfold for decades, crossing over different species of life, civilizations, planets, and galaxies without feeling too old or repetitive. The most exciting thing is knowing that there is so much more to explore. Zhao knows how to shoot a film too. While this may not be the best overall MCU film, it has some of the best cinematography that’s out on the market even outside of the MCU. This is a remarkably beautiful film to look at, especially on a giant IMAX screen. The wide shots of rural landscapes and the contrast of colors were some of the best eye candy. This is especially noticeable when each different Eternal is using their unique powers. One of the highlights of the film is the old gold that stands out like the yellow brick road in the Wizard of Oz. The colors from the characters’ costumes pop out at you even more. Marvel is known for having a great make-up and costume department, and it looks like they stepped it up a couple of notches this time around. This could easily be a new fashion statement down the runway from looking as great as they did. Though while I did love each Eternal’s costume, I don’t feel that way about each of their personalities. They’re all very difficult to attach yourself to or feel as if they’re relatable. This may be by design since they’re not human, but I’ve had more of an emotional connection with previous MCU characters that weren’t human either. On the flip side, it does make sense to take this route from a story point of view, being that our lives are perceived meaningless to individuals whose powers are on a completely different level than the ones on earth, but it felt like a missed opportunity to connect with the audience or get them to care about the main cast of the film. Not only that, but the acting also suffered tremendously from at least four out of the ten main Eternals. This is something Marvel has never had an issue with in the past and was a big surprise while watching the film. Of course, that aspect is completely subjective, but the delivery from the characters of Sprite (Lia McHugh), Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), Ikaris (Richard Madden), Druig (Barry Keoghan) were not horrible, but did stand out as the weakest in the bunch. I found myself not caring about them as much as others. Druig is an exception, however. There was something worthy about him, but again the acting was a misfire. The action however was not a misfire. That aspect was a true hit. I enjoyed every moment of that especially the end when all the Eternals show up for the final showdown. Plot within action is necessary so that all of the kicks, punches, and explosions amount to more than pointless visual noise and they knocked those moments out of the park. The film is also very long, running over two hours and thirty minutes, and a second viewing may be necessary to get a full comprehension of the story to even see if it all makes sense. This may seem like a delight for some, but a chore to others, which is a testament to how the pacing of the film could’ve been much better. Though the absolute most astounding moments of the whole film were the depiction of beings known as the Celestials. My goodness gracious did they look amazing! These massive giant thousands of feet tall space gods beings were dominant, powerful, and outright scary looking. The sheer mass, scale, and scope of these tower houses of sentience were mind-blowing. It’s just another example of how much more of the MCU there is to dive into before it’s all over. Eternals will raise a ton of questions as far as what Marvel has next up their sleeve planned for release. While Eternals is different than any other MCU film, it’s still an achievement. Most audiences won’t feel that way, due to its foreign nature, but mixing up the pot just a little may be beneficial in the long run. It is surely debatable whether the subject matter is entertaining, but what is completely unobjectionable is the technical achievements that Zhao was able to deliver.",POSITIVE
"Nov 5, 2021"," I wasn’t all that familiar with Eternals as I never read the comics, but I was excited as soon as I heard that Chloe Zhao was announced as director and the casting news starting to pour in. I started reading a bit more about just what/who these super-beings actually are in preparation for the movie. The Eternals are powerful cosmic beings and they as well as their nemesis the Deviants are cosmic race that were created by Celestial Hosts. As far as the timeline within the MCU, the events in Eternals is set following the Blip, that is when half of earth population returns after Thanos wiped them out. The movie begins on earth, in London specifically, where one of the Eternals Sersi (Gemma Chan) is on her way to an Oxford university lecture. She is running late and on her way up the stairs, she makes a quip to a Charles Darwin statue and calling him ‘Charlie.’ It’s a pretty casual and whimsical way to explain that these Eternal beings have lived for centuries, having survived multiple destructions and renewal of various planets in the multiverse. From 5000 BC Mesopotamia, moments after the atomic bomb went off in Hiroshima and Nagasaki to modern day London, the film jumped around multiple timelines to show how the Eternals are practically immortals and each has its own unique superpowers. It doesn’t take long before the threats that Eternals have feared for thousands of years finally show up on earth. First there’s an earthquake where Sersi used her powers that enables her to turn matters into another form, in order to save one of the students from having a huge rock-wall fall on them. That same night, Sersi, her young compatriot Sprite (Lia McHugh) and earthly-boyfriend Dane (Kit Harrington) encounter a Deviant monster, a tall, weird-looking creature that look like they escape from a BODY WORLDS exhibit. After they survive that ordeal, Dane asks Sersi the pivotal question of WHY they never helped humans when bad things happen throughout history. Well apparently they were specifically instructed by their boss Arishem the Judge not to interfere with human conflicts unless Deviants are involved. As if encountering Deviants weren’t weird enough, poor Sersi also has to deal with the appearance of a very-hot-looking ex-boyfriend who can fly and shoot lasers from his eyes like Superman. After a few millennia of being apart, the one who got away, aka Ikaris (Richard Madden) has also been living in England. The whole encounter between Dane and Ikaris is especially surreal given both actors were in Game of Thrones. Apparently Ikaris has been connecting with the leader of the group Ajak (Salma Hayek) and is aware the Deviants are coming, hence they need to get the old gang back together. Most of the first act is basically just regathering of the Eternals gang… from the UK to the US to track down the super-smart Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), the super-fast Makkari (Lauren Ridloff) and the one with hypnotic powers, Druig (Barry Keoghan). Then they travel then India to find Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani) who can shoot lightning bolts out of his hands. In their journey, they also find out that Thena (Angelina Jolie), who can conjure up glowing, transparent sword at will, has some mental issues. She suffers some kind of a Bipolar disorder after centuries of having her memories/identity wiped out and restored over and over, and she’s been living on an island with Gilgamesh (Don Lee) who serves as her butler/protector. Soon we learn that Thena is the key as to the Deviants’ attacks on earth and a fight ensues between the Deviants and Eternals on the island. One thing for sure, Eternals looks and feels different from the rest of the MCU… for better for worse. Let me start with the good: the visuals are gorgeous to look at, filled with stunning landscapes shot during magic-hour (Zhao’s trademark). DP Ben Davis definitely shares her visual sensibilities and the production design team all create some mystical and ethereal look that sets itself apart. The not-so-good … well, I find the whole Eternals journey to be pretty devoid of thrills and suspense. Plagued with too many flashbacks that makes for a stagnant pacing that never finds its rhythm. Even when the biggest twist is revealed in the third act, it didn’t have as big an impact as I expected. The entire celestial beings seem really concerned with humanity, especially Sersi who has maintained connections with humans for centuries while living on earth. The thing is, I just don’t feel their love as the film shows them constantly bicker and fight amongst each other whenever they’re not fighting the Deviants. The humans are barely featured in the movie and when they are, it’s treated almost like an afterthought, or in the case of Dane, it’s only a ‘teaser’ to what’s to come with his character who’s described as the Black Knight in the comics. Despite the amazingly-diverse cast, I’m really underwhelmed by most of them. Richard Madden in particular, is devoid of charm as the Superman-like Ikaris (there are even DC references that would likely amuse or irritate comic-book fans). I’ve enjoyed Madden’s work in other projects, but here he is as wooden as a marble statue of Michelangelo’s David, which makes it impossible for me to care about Ikaris’ journey nor his centuries-spanning romance with Sersi. The first ‘love scene’ in the MCU sadly lacks any real heat that it makes the chaste kiss between Captain America and Peggy looks scorching. It’s just so awkwardly-staged and the cheesy dialog between them makes it even worse. Gemma Chan wowed me in Crazy Rich Asians, but despite some heartfelt moments, she didn’t fare that much better compared to Madden. Brian Tyree Henry is a reliable actor and as the first LGBTQ character in the MCU, he’s got a few memorable moments, but it’s not exactly his best work. Pakistani-American Kumail Nanjiani is inspired casting as a Bollywood star and he got super jacked to portray the first South Asian superhero. I think his physique got way more attention even though he didn’t get to do much acting-wise in the movie other than delivering a few amusing one-liners.  I think out of the entire Eternals, Lauren Ridloff is the one who appeals to me the most, so I’m glad she got quite a bit to do in the movie. The two more veteran actors, Jolie and Hayek, don’t really get much screen time and their characters just aren’t that interesting. In fact, I find Jolie’s Thena quite aggravating and I remember just spacing out during all her fight scenes with both the Eternals and Deviants. At the end of the day, I just wasn’t as engaged as I simply didn’t care for any of these characters. Despite being portrayed as saviors of humanity who care about us mere mortals, the filmmakers seem to forget to give us a reason to care for any of them. I mean, it’s not the first time Marvel gave us a film filled with a bunch of superheroes. After watching this, I gained even more appreciation for the Russo brothers for their astounding work in The Avengers movies, especially Endgame which takes a large group of seemingly-unrelatable super beings and make me care for their journey. But to be fair, many of the Avengers had the benefit of being introduced separately in their own films. Perhaps is we were suddenly watching The Avengers before we see the standalone Captain America, Iron Man, The Hulk and Thor movies, the movie might not be as effective. As with any heroic tale, it also helps to have a formidable villain and the Deviants just didn’t seem all that menacing despite their grotesque appearance. Arishem, who actually decides whether a planet’s civilization should live or die, is supposed to be this ominous, powerful being, but it’s hard to take him seriously when he looks like a child’s toy made of of LEGOs. For the most part, what we get to see are equally-powerful creatures fight each other in low-stakes battles that feel overblown and pointless. The philosophical themes it grapples with, particularly its ‘woke’ message of challenging the status quo and one’s purpose in life, seem timely for today’s audience. That is when it isn’t buried under its overlong CGI-laden action scenes. The score by Ramin Djawadi was good when I listened to it before I saw the film, but now I can’t even tell you what it sounds like in the movie. Now, I wouldn’t say Eternals is a bad movie per-se, it’s just an immensely underwhelming one. I suppose after 25 films, the MCU is allowed to have one bad apple. I never thought it would be THIS one however, but I’m curious where Phase Four will go from here. I can’t help wondering if Eternals might have worked better as a Disney+ series given the complexity of the multiverse and the world of Celestials, but as it stands now, it’s far from being marvelous. I’m curious what you think of this, Steven. There are definitely still plenty to like here, I was just expecting more, so much more, from Chloe Zhao & team. After reading some not so great reviews of this film, including yours here, I’m just going to wait till it hits Disney +. The 2 and half hours runtime also turns me off. Movies are getting increasingly long these days!! I wish there are more movies made that are 90-minute long, or even under 2 hours would be nice. It seems ALL the big movies released lately have a 2.5 hour running time. Yeah, I sat in theater for both Dune and No Time To Die for over 3 hours. Previews are almost half hour in theaters. Hopefully the new Spider-Man and Matrix aren’t that long. 2 hours is a perfect time for movies like this. Yeah! The last time I was at a movie theater they had like 10 previews!! Crazy! That’s why I like going to press screenings as there are no previews ahead of the actual movie. I will see this movie, because I’m a fan of the weird, fantastic and super hero movie. Not because it is so rich with diversity. That is the very last reason I would see it. Other then Hollywood, I suspect nobody really cares. Hello! Welcome to FC! Yeah, go see a film which subject matter interests you, the diversity shouldn’t be the main reason to see a film, though of course more art form should be more inclusive. I do care about diversity in films, but of course I also realize it doesn’t automatically the film is good just because it has good representation. Great review Ruth! I enjoyed Eternals more than I thought I would, but my expectations were really low. There were so many things this movie did right, the diversity being one of them as you’ve highlighted, but overall it wasn’t great. A lot of the jokes didn’t land at all with the audience I was sat with. I think having a more um, reserved expectations always helps in films with huge hype like this one. DUNE delivered for me but I was left kind of underwhelmed w/ this one. It’s not good when you left the theater going ‘meh’ … I think diversity is great but it cannot compensate for a good storytelling and acting.I really did not care for Richard Madden at all, him and that kid Sprite were the worst of the bunch. I enjoyed the change of pace and felt like it was a breath of fresh air compared to some of The Infinity War films where they got pretty relentless and full on. Kumail Nanjiani and Lauren Ridloff were the highlights for me, and having just seen Barry Keoghan in The Green Knight a few days before, it was great seeing him in a very different role.

"Nov 5, 2021"," No one bats 1,000, so if the Marvel Universe strikes out every now and then, it can be forgiven. What can’t be forgiven is sending some of the best players money can buy to the plate and realizing too late they play hockey. Eternals may well have been in trouble from the start, when immensely talented director Chloe Zhou was put at the helm. As much as we loved her work in Nomadland, whatever made the Powers That Be think writing and directing a superhero movie might be in her wheelhouse? The storyline had potential. Ten ageless and diverse extraterrestrial beings with different, intriguing powers, are sent to earth to protect humans from beasties called Divergents. It was thought that the Divergents had been ultimately defeated, but apparently that finger snap in the Avengers’ timeline woke up the Divergents, so the Eternals, who have been resting in place on Earth for thousands of years, are again called to action. An awkward series of murky flashbacks provides a disjointed Eternals origin story while attempting to build to the obligatory Armageddon-like battle at the end. The narrative never seems to coalesce. It’s a shame that the same director who worked so brilliantly with Frances McDormand in Nomadland was unable to find much to do with favorite actors like Kit Harrington, Ma Dong-seok, Emma Chan, Salma Hayek and Angelina Jolie. Their characters and stories are vapid, irrelevant and confusing. Jolie’s part was particularly frustrating — she does little more than prance around in frothy white dresses, using weapons that look like renderings of realistic CGIs that will be added later. That’s just one of many surprising faux pas made by the special effects department. I will say that Zhou showed a flair for comedy with Kumail Nanjiani. He played an Eternal who bides his time on earth as a Bollywood phenom, and his character and performance are among the film’s few highlights. Another highlight is the Eternals’ diversity, ethnic and otherwise, including gay and hearing impaired superheroes. If they only had some chemistry, and didn’t line up ten across so often — everyone knows that’s horrible offensive or defensive positioning, but I suppose it gives them all equal glaring/flexing opportunities. Eternals was lowest rated of all Marvel movies when I wrote this review (51% on Rotten Tomatoes) and it may sink even lower still. The good news is that by comparison, even Thor: Dark World, the second lowest rated at a 66% rating, is starting to look better.

"Nov 4, 2021"," *** Fans of cats and Benedict Cumberbatch, get ready to purr. With manic charm and moving grace, The Electrical Life of Louis Wain welcomes us into the psychedelic world of Wain (Cumberbatch), a real-life English artist who brought whimsy and wonderment to the Victorian era with his feline-filled drawings and paintings. The film begins with an elderly Wain withering in an asylum, but it swiftly skips back to his marriage to Emily Richardson-Wain (Claire Foy), a fellow cat lover. When she dies of breast cancer, Wain becomes such a cat fanatic that his mind starts to reshape the world to his liking. When he looks at people, their heads sprout fur and whiskers, and when he looks at cats, they talk to him via subtitles. These fantastical touches are not standard biopic fare, but the film’s last half reveals the fragility of its decadeslong narrative—it’s so anxious to get to Wain’s death that it doesn’t take enough time to savor his life. Yet the gleam of Louis and Emily’s love brightens the movie long after she’s gone. When he tells her she makes the world beautiful, she simply tells him that the world is already beautiful. By finding sweet silliness in everyday life, The Electrical Life of Louis Wain proves her right. PG-13. BENNETT CAMPBELL FERGUSON. Amazon Prime, Living Room. **** The place is France. The time is the Middle Ages. The crime is rape. That’s the premise of The Last Duel, director Ridley Scott’s thunderous cinematic portrait of Marguerite de Carrouges (Jodie Comer), a real-life noblewoman who accused Jacques Le Gris (Adam Driver), a squire and knight, of sexually assaulting her. Each of the film’s three acts is filmed from the perspective of one character—first Marguerite’s husband, Sir Jean de Carrouges (Matt Damon), then Le Gris, then Marguerite. While the male perspectives were written by Damon and Ben Affleck, the scenes that peer into Marguerite’s soul were scripted by Nicole Holofcener, who emphasizes the tension between monstrous masculine delusions and brutal feminine realities. The Last Duel understands the fluidity of memory—in one scene, Le Gris willfully misinterprets Marguerite’s mocking smile as a flirtation—but it unequivocally states that only Marguerite is telling the whole truth and nothing but the truth. The trial by combat between Carrouges and Le Gris that decides whether Marguerite will be vindicated or burned alive is exhilaratingly brutish, but the film keeps cutting away from the bloodshed to show us her haunted, hardened features. The greatest war in The Last Duel is the one she wages against the patriarchy, proving that Scott—who also directed Alien and Thelma & Louise—is still a feminist to his core. R.

Bridgeport, Cedar Hills, City Center, Eastport Plaza, Fox Tower, Movies on TV. ***1/2 Of all the spectral menaces bedeviling Ellie (Thomasin McKenzie), fresh-faced protagonist of the marvelous new paranormal thriller Last Night in Soho, the worst moments of vicarious dread occur early on as the rural scholarship student first braves her couture-draped classmates at a chic central London fashion institute. Soon fleeing an insufferable roommate (Synnove Karlsen), our plucky homespun heroine chances upon a boarding house flat with a stern landlady (the ever-imperious Diana Rigg’s final role) and dusty furnishings. The first evening Ellie lays herself down to sleep while spinning 45s, she’s transported back to swinging ‘60s Soho, where she meets Sandy (Anya Taylor-Joy), a striving chanteuse whose perspective Ellie giddily adopts during what become nightly visitations. Even without Matt Smith’s heel turn as Sandy’s abusive manager/paramour, the storyline’s guiding conceit threatens an all-too-Whovian clever-clever irrelevance, but director Edgar Wright (Baby Driver, Hot Fuzz) pivots gracefully from rom-com to sumptuous period musical to snark-free Hammer horror, committing fully to each disparate genre. Whatever whiff of glib vacuity lurked beneath the sleekened charms of Wright’s earlier films, Last Night in Soho leans into every stylistic flourish as further illustration of the retro delights binding Ellie to the past while also seamlessly disguising the plot’s inevitable twists. Audiences needn’t be oversold on the dangers that await a damsel falling head over heels for the wrong man or the wrong era. The trick lies in convincing us why she’d keep coming back. R. JAY HORTON.

A reporter beds a budding activist. A police commissioner’s son is abducted by a criminal called The Chauffeur. Those are the stories that define director Wes Anderson’s The French Dispatch, a perky anthology of tales from a fictional publication called The French Dispatch of the Liberty, Kansas Evening Sun. The film was inspired by articles from The New Yorker, but its blend of pastel colors and deadpan wit is pure Anderson. His direction is painfully precise—even a clash between protesters and police looks like a series of still images—and it threatens to squeeze the life out of a cast that includes Bill Murray, Benicio del Toro, Timothée Chalamet and Jeffrey Wright. Yet Anderson’s fussiness isn’t half as troubling as his attitude toward the film’s female journalists, including J.K.L. Berensen (Tilda Swinton) and Lucinda Krementz (Frances McDormand). Both of them lust after the subjects of their articles, a toxic trope that Anderson deploys without a hint of his trademark irony. Some of his early films—particularly Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums—have aged with good-natured grace, but The French Dispatch proves he has a long way to go if he wants to be the clever and compassionate comedian he once was.

To bore moviegoers until they lose consciousness. His name? Director Denis Villeneuve. After the haunting poetry of Arrival and the dreamy romanticism of Blade Runner 2049, Villeneuve seemed incapable of creating a bad sci-fi film. Yet he’s done it with his adaptation of Frank Herbert’s hulking 1965 novel Dune, which follows the ponderous adventures of the callow nobleman Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) on the desert planet Arrakis. The film keeps hinting at Paul’s potential to become an interplanetary messiah, but Chalamet is so wan and lifeless it’s difficult to care whether the character lives or dies. Rebecca Ferguson adds some fiery charisma as Paul’s mother, Lady Jessica, but Villeneuve buries her performance beneath a seemingly endless stream of information about the politics, rituals and ecology of Arrakis. He cares more about world-building than storytelling, which is why watching Dune feels like reading an excruciatingly dry textbook instead of experiencing a movie. Some people will see the existence of a big-budget, 155-minute art film as a sign of hope in a cinematic landscape strewn with superhero bombast, but Dune isn’t salvation. It’s a stark reminder that pretentiousness can be just as punishing as commercialism. PG-13. BENNETT CAMPBELL FERGUSON.

A generation grew up trusting feature films told in the Mighty Marvel Manner to guarantee damnably effective pop operas brimming with inventive action, droll charm and uncommon verve. With great power comes great responsibility, alas, and Eternals proves nothing lasts forever. Ostensibly fleshing out the origins of yet more legendary heroes remembered only by the superfans, this latest MCU release follows the path of immortal warriors and sages sent earthward millennia ago to protect a young humanity from the Deviant, a scourge of planet-hopping alien beasties. It becomes clear that scattershot casting created this ensemble—mujer fatale Salma Hayek’s all-mother Ajak, indie horror tot Lia McHugh’s illusionist Sprite, sitcom vet Kumail Nanjiani’s energy bolt-wielding Kingo, fan-fic fave Richard Madden’s superishman Ikarus. The result is an utter failure to convey even the uneasy intimacy of long-term co-workers, much less supposed family. (Angelina Jolie’s Thena, icily drifting through her scenes like a botoxed glacier, seems always to be meeting the others anew.) As a popcorn-munching spectacle, the 2D characters and garbled narrative drain rote punch-’em-ups of emotive purpose, and director Chloe Zhao (Nomadland) leans into a tonal confusion overly fond of the reflective pause that renders every explosion more disconnected. Bloated with artless pretensions and self-important sanctimony, beholden to a convoluted backstory that could never justify the endless exposition, Eternals arrives as Marvel’s greatest failure and feels like the worst Power Rangers adaptation yet conceived.

"Nov 4, 2021"," One thing Disney keeps doing that gives some Marvel fans fits is turn movies into think pieces about moody demi-gods and powerful women. All these fans really want are quips, tights and fights, with everything fronted by - as others have put it - ""a white guy called Chris"". The result will have them sobbing in the fan forums. Oscar winner Zhao has turned in a movie fronted by a gender-, race- and age-balanced cast about - you guessed it - moody demi-gods. There have been movies about superheroes tormented by their god-and-human dual natures, such as the first and second Thor movies (2011 and 2013). Tellingly, Marvel hired gifted comedy director Taika Waititi for the third one (Thor: Ragnarok, 2017). He stripped away the navel-gazing, creating a critical and commercial hit. The source comics for Eternals were heavily influenced by ideas of ancient aliens, popular in the 1970s. There are believers still around today, tuning in to cable shows featuring ""experts"" attributing every technological innovation in ancient civilisations in Africa, the Middle East and the Americas to after-school coaching from extraterrestrials. Thankfully, such racist ideas do not enter Zhao's vision. While her Eternals are indeed ancient aliens, a race of guardians put here millennia ago, their only job is to protect humans from Deviants, monsters created at the same time as them by an even more powerful race of galactic beings. Sersi (English actress Gemma Chan) can transmute one inanimate material into another; Ikaris (Scottish actor Richard Madden) can fly and project power beams from his eyes. Having wiped away the Deviants, the team of 10 become purposeless, split up and go incognito. The events of Avengers: Endgame (2019) awaken a sinister force and the team is reactivated. Zhao, an arthouse director known for her award-winning dramas that imbue working-class struggles with poetry (cowboy biopic The Rider, 2017; and the Oscar-winning portrait of the gig economy, Nomadland, 2020) was hired to add a touch of prestige drama to a comic-book tale. She elevates the material in some places - she is fond of static establishing shots that underline the team's dignified, semi-divine status - but only so much can be achieved before plot and exposition kick in, especially in a work that is just one thread in the larger Marvel Cinema Universe fabric. ""You've been a bad, bad boy, Gabriel,"" says a doctor as one might to a labrador puppy, after the person she is addressing has turned his wardens into a mutilated mess. Malignant, released in cinemas in September this year and just added to HBO, comes from director and co-writer James Wan, who helmed horror hits Saw (2004) and The Conjuring (2013) as well as action blockbusters Furious 7 (2015) and Aquaman (2018). As shown by this dialogue snippet, the Sarawak-born, Australia-raised Wan likes his edgy jokes inserted at random. While this reviewer did not have a problem with Wan's spasms of under- or over-statement, one can understand how the sudden mood swings might lead one to conclude that he has lost control, as other critics have claimed. British actor George Young - a face familiar to Asian audiences for his television work in the region, including Singapore - plays detective Shaw, the cop assigned to look into the string of deaths. Wan is not a fan of subtlety. From its supervillain origin story opening to its monster-hunt middle to its bonkers climax, Malignant is in-your-face literal. This is a film-maker who knows his lane, sticks to it and obviously loves his material. The result is an idiosyncratic but highly watchable mix of gore, supernatural chills and mystery. This work of animation is a follow-up to the 2016 original, which had a story and characters based on graphic novels by Chinese rock star Zheng Jun. Aspiring musician Bodi (voiced by Graham Hamilton) and his band True Blue have achieved some success, but yearn for more. When a businessman offers a shot at fame, but at a cost, Bodi and his band are torn.",POSITIVE

"Nov 4, 2021"," Los hermanos Strugatski imaginaron la posibilidad de un dios. Pero no de uno cualquiera, sino de una divinidad rigurosamente científica. En un futuro improbable en el que el desarrollo tecnológico y los viajes intergalácticos facilitarían que la civilización más desarrollada estudiara a las demás, la historia dejaría de ser una disciplina más bien blanda sujeta a todo tipo de contingencias ideológicas para gozar del rigor de pedernal de cualquier ciencia dura y experimental. Bastaría con observar y tomar nota de qué ocurre, por ejemplo, en la Edad Media en la que seguro vive algún planeta perdido. Y de ahí, extraer consecuencias sobre el futuro de los otros que no es más que el pasado del que observa. Por motivos evidentes, el observador sería algo así como un dios para los objetos-sujetos de estudio. La novela, que luego sería magistral película de Aleksey German, atiende al nombre, como no podía ser de otra manera, de Qué difícil es ser dios. La saga Eternals, creada por Jack Kirby en 1976 y que ahora ve su adaptación en la pantalla grande de la mano de la directora todopoderosa (casi divina) Chloé Zhao, es algo así como una recreación inconsciente (en en el más amplio y riguroso de los sentidos) de la hipótesis de los siempre geniales Strugatski. Es, en efecto, una película de seres superheroicos, pero que, en su invulnerabilidad, nada tienen que ver con el alegre y pueril antropocentrismo de sus colegas de la factoría Marvel. Se diría incluso que la característica de seres ajenos al tiempo y de estudiosos, además de defensores, en la distancia de la raza humana (eso son los Eternos) los acerca más al misticismo divino de la factoría DC con Superman al frente y a las maneras siempre despampanantes de Zack Snyder que a cualquiera de las criaturas superpoderosas y superresponsables a las que nos tenía acostumbrados la familia de los Vengadores. Definitivamente, es muy, pero que muy difícil ser dios. Digamos que la película, por resumirlo mucho, es toda ella una paradoja. O, más preciso, un disparate. Se trata de una producción eminentemente Marvel, pero con las pausas y monólogos en blanco más propios de sus rivales de DC. Estamos ante el penúltimo intento de Disney de llevar a sus criaturas titánicas un paso más adelante en la hiperconquista de la taquilla, pero de la mano de una cineasta independiente, oscarizada hasta el empacho y especializada mayormente en puestas de sol (en su más amplio sentido crepuscular). La idea, una vez más, es componer un espectáculo testosterónico de mamporros desaforados, pero desde un perfil demográfico tan rigurosamente inclusivo que la maldad es más una opción de vida como cualquier otra que un defecto. Y, desde luego, nunca censurable. Definitivamente, ser dios es complicado.  La directora de Nomadland compone así un adefesio (no es tanto insulto como descripción) al que cuesta mirar a los ojos sin tropezarse en algo: sea esto una reflexión vacía sobre el vacío o unas criaturas vocacionalmente raras de anatomía incomprensible. ¿Por qué esos efectos digitales tan feos? ¿Por qué esa ampulosidad operística en cada mirada? ¿Por qué esos diálogos tan cargantes y pretendidamente simpáticos? Por momentos, se escucha cómo crujen los dedos de los guionistas entregados a la labor descomunal de atrapar, concentrar y exponer en poco más de dos horas y media milenios enteros de un mito sin pies ni cabeza. Nadie dijo que ser dios fuera breve. Si uno se toma un segundo para analizar la trama, pronto cae en la cuenta de que algo cuadra. Cuesta dar con ello en el caos argumental, pero algo hay con sentido. Reconozco que es más intuición que certeza. Nuestros protagonistas han sido enviados a la Tierra por los Celestiales liderados por Arishem y su función es la de combatir a los Deviants, mezcla de dinosaurios y monstruos marinos en la mejor tradición japonesa del 'kaiju'. No pueden interferir en los quehaceres de los humanos de la misma manera que el 'historiador' de los Strugatski del principio no podía avisar a sus objetos de estudio que después de la gris Edad Media les esperaba un florido Renacimiento. Simplemente han de acabar con el mal, pero en abstracto, sin que nadie se entere. Se trata de un grupo variopinto en el que hay de todo, procedentes de todas las latitudes y, por si fuera poco, capaces de todo, incluso, y con perdón, follar. Este último punto no es baladí. Por primera vez el espectador verá una escena de sexo en una película de superhéroes y, también de manera inédita, presenciará el hecho estadísticamente vulgar, y siempre oculto pese a ello, de que uno de los protagonistas -Phastos (interpretado por Brian Tyree Henry)- es abiertamente gay. Sin duda, es un avance y hasta alivia pensar que por fin estos seres tan musculados y tan preocupados por el futuro de la Humanidad (incluida España) son en su divina excentricidad individuos capaces tanto de la emoción como del orgasmo. Se agradece, sin duda, el esfuerzo por atender y crear otro canon de belleza, bondad y sexualidad a distancia del modelo uno-grande-libre o hetero-macho-facho. Y hasta aquí las virtudes no necesariamente teologales.  Pero no nos despistemos. De eso ya se encargan los Eternals sin ayuda de nadie. Por momentos, uno cree comprender las motivaciones de la directora. Se puede llegar a entender que una cineasta tan preocupada por la mitología que conforma y condena Estados Unidos después de dedicarse a analizar las claves del western tanto en The Rider como en la película más premiada de la pasada temporada, Nomadland, quiera ahora desentrañar el misterio del superhéroe como encarnación de un dios pagano árbitro 'rooseveltiano' y piadoso en la jungla neoliberal. Pero eso es lo único inteligible: la intención que no los hechos. Duele ser economista, pero más duele ser dios. Cuando el protagonista de la novela de los Strugatski caiga en la cuenta de que su simple presencia en el mundo que estudia es una interferencia de consecuencias imprevisibles, ya será tarde. La Edad Media se instalará en aquel remoto planeta para siempre. Algo parecido le sucede a Zhao dentro de un universo, el de los superhéroes, completamente refractario a su mirada. La peor película de Chloé Zhao también es la más triste película de superhéroes. Qué difícil es ser diosa (le ha durado un año). ",NEGATIVE
"Nov 4, 2021"," Boasting a roster introducing the most new superhero characters ever in the same MCU movie, Eternals from director Chloé Zhao (Nomadland) is truly an experiment in testing the patience of Marvel Studios’ well-earned and passionate fanbase. While sometimes when Marvel gets out of its comfort zone, audiences enjoy gems like Guardians of the Galaxy, this time the results are far less successful and quite frankly disappointing due to the talent and potential involved in the project. Since the beginning of time, Earth has been protected by a super-team from the stars, all imbued with incredible skills and power by a Celestial god. After the threat to our planet from the horrible creatures called Deviants seems to have passed, the Eternals separated and found new lives here on Earth while watching and helping humanity grow. When the Deviants unexpectedly return in the present, the Eternals must reunite and battle their own personal histories if they are to save the planet. To say Eternals is a lot would be an understatement. The film is packed to the brim with characters that have very little brand recognition while being tasked with not only introducing the audience to each new character and their power sets, but establishing a massive cosmic plotline. The ideas are lofty and interesting, but the film has to move so fast it barely gives any time to digest the massive amounts of exposition that it keeps throwing at the audience for what feels like an eternity of prologue until the actual present-day story begins. While it’s refreshing that this enormous ensemble cast is full of diverse and unexpected choices for superheroes, the talent gets lost in waves of mediocre-to-bad CG action sequences and nonsense. Angelina Jolie is the biggest name of the film, seemingly just appearing to cash a big paycheck and strike cool fight poses as Thena, the warrior that inspired the mythological Athena. Game of Thrones alum Richard Madden also does his best Superman impression as Ikaris, but audiences have already seen a volatile, conflicted Man of Steel and they weren’t very receptive.  Eternals also tries to inject far too much comedy in order to convey the idea to “not take things so seriously,” but then turns around and asks the audience to take things seriously, effectively undermining the tone of the movie. Also, the jokes fall on their face more often than not with corny puns and Dad jokes. Even with very talented comedic actors like Kumail Nanjiani and Bryan Tyree Henry in the main cast, they can’t salvage much of the early attempts at humor. To be fair, the humorous elements improve in the back half of the film, but at that point the film has already lost any comedic credibility. Many fans and critics have fairly compared Eternals to Marvel’s endeavor at making a DC movie, and they’re not wrong. Apparently neither studio has figured out the right formula, since this film fails in the same ways both versions of WB’s Justice League movies were taken to task for including the aforementioned overuse of CG and lack of a compelling villain. The generic sci-fi designed Deviants are not interesting antagonists and even the eventual big bad revelation that comes in the last act are all fairly obvious and one-note. On top of that, the script tries to squeeze poor Kit Harington into a supporting role that is really just a glorified cameo, setting up yet another obscure Marvel B-list hero.  Everything leads up to a convoluted, bizarre finale that is heavy on CG action and light on logic. The scale is so silly and huge that these events absolutely must be referenced in every MCU movie going forward due to the literal Earth-changing ramifications. If they’re not addressed, it will be a huge glaring disservice and a show of a lack of faith in this movie’s role in the MCU. Clearly the best part of Eternals is the ensemble cast, and I will admit to being very excited to see these actors show up elsewhere interacting with MCU characters we already know and love, but hopefully in a better film.

"Nov 4, 2021"," True follies are rare, fantastic and filled with inexplicable joy. Bad movies are far more common. The thought of a total bomb detonating onscreen is a ripe prospect, until a doomed movie demonstrates that it is just bad, as minute by minute, hour by hour, you sit through one like “Eternals,” awaiting the sweet release of the mid-credit and post-credit scenes.”Eternals” could be the MCUinex needed to clear the pipes of the frantic Marvel Cinematic Universe, but who knows? It could well be a colossal smash. Who are Eternals? The press kit is more lucid than the clipped opening crawl: “The Eternals on Earth are a diverse and powerful group—a combination of thinkers and fighters, sharing the same cosmic energy, which manifests itself in different powers within each individual. When they work together these powers complement each other. When they are off-duty, they act like any other dysfunctional family group, supporting one another and squabbling in equal measures.” Or, as Agatha Christie might put it, “Ten Little Bores.” Based on a comic from 1976 under the hand of Jack Kirby, one arid passage had me drifting off, to the story behind the story beyond this story, to an apocryphal phantasm of how the comics could have created in dirty, fervid 1970s New York City, fueled by tattered paperbacks of Erich von Däniken’s “Chariots of the Gods,” butt-ends and cardboard cups of Greek diner coffee (not a few flask-infused), then how all those drawings and lettering became blobs of color, slightly out of register and printed on the cheapest newsprint. I don’t know what Marvel’s offices looked like in 1976, but why not a nicotine-stained Manhattan walkup like the 1940s-style office the Coen brothers wrote their screenplays in for so many years? The couches would be tattered but stuffed with the dreams of so many naps. During postproduction of “Eternals,” co-writer-director Chloe Zhao made her Oscar-sweeping “Nomadland”; only she can tell whether any aspect of that movie was in reaction to what she had shot for the two hours and thirty-seven minutes of the confounding bombast of this character-spinning millennia-spanning farrago of interlocking pageants. The attractive cast includes Salma Hayek, Brian Tyree Henry, Angelina Jolie, Gemma Chan, Barry Keoghan, Don Lee, Richard Madden, Kumail Nanjiani and Lauren Ridloff. Zhao’s film displays a spectrum of representation as matter-of-fact, but what does that matter when a movie, its characters speaking a parlance of hodgepodge and bullshit as quotidian, is bad, both lackluster and hyperkinetic? It is good to see a range of characters and cultures and accents, even in bad movies. Still, the accents range from succotash to farrago: Angelina Jolie is particularly good as hailing from no part of Britain, but all parts of Britain. There’s a Black gay character who creates technology and passes it along to humanity, which isn’t advanced enough to develop it on its own. Humanity: stupid! Stupid humanity! (Now here’s Angelina Jolie in a white gown that is never soiled or stained across millennia: where’s that technology?) The inventor is given his own genocide: we see the nuclear cloud rise over Hiroshima, and then we cut to him crouching in the wreckage, ruing that he had created the technology. The effect is obscene as well as the most beautifully designed and photographed scene in the entire effort. And of course, “Eternals” just has to be one more entry in the ranks of Marvel neocolonialist bow-to-dominion myths, with overseers who are just like us, except they are immortal overseers, eternally, who oversee us forever, at least until they are killed by other overseers. Behold! A brace of neo-colonialist sky-mommies and sky-daddies who live a meaningless existence except to be reincarnated to destroy unnumbered planets and their population. There’s also the suggestion of life as full-on simulation, as in the lot of latter-day theories recently beloved by NPR. Plus, here’s a dude at NPR who bullet-points reasons, in over 2,500 words, where he insists that “Eternals” is pretty good because it’s different from other Marvel Studios window displays, which could be convincing, that is, if you never see “Eternals.” Ray’s history of Chicago Ghost Signs is planned for publication next year.

"Nov 4, 2021"," It only took 20+ movies and four phases, but “Eternals” put its diverse cast front and centre of one of the most ambitious MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) films to date. “Eternals” follows a group of heroes from beyond the stars who had protected the Earth since the dawn of man. When monstrous creatures called the Deviants, long thought lost to history, mysteriously return, the Eternals are forced to reunite to defend humanity once again. When it comes to the MCU, 2021 has been a year filled with expansion, including our first Asian lead in “Shang-Chi”, the three streaming shows so far - “Hawkeye” is coming later this year – and the animated adventure “What If”.  When it was revealed that Academy award-winning director Chloé Zhao was at the helm of the film, many fans, myself included, wondered how she would tackle an MCU film since her directing style doesn’t necessarily fit in with the MCU template we’ve come to know. “Eternals” spends a lot of time establishing the interpersonal relationships of all the main characters, and Zhao does take her time with the pacing of the film, and it is a nice change from what we've become accustomed to. This film doesn’t follow the usual MCU structure, and I, for one, am happy to have something that feels fresh in a movie franchise that’s been going on for more than 10 years. A lot of the movie’s emotional weight rest on Gemma’s shoulders, and she does a great job at keeping us as the audience invested in what is going on. The movie has been getting a lot of backlash for its diverse cast and lack of relatability from audience members who haven’t even seen it and other reviewers.  And I, for one, as a queer POC (person of colour), am very happy to have a film where, for the first time, I can see myself represented in a franchise that’s taken over the world. Disney and Marvel have been dragging their feet when it comes to queer representation, with Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) being hinted at as being bisexual but never said outright.  We finally took another tiny step forward with the God of Mischief in “Loki” when he very subtly revealed he was bisexual. However, when it came to the movies, they have been ducking and diving the criticism of them having queer characters in theory but not in practice.  And finally, with Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), we have a gay hero who has a husband that we see on-screen sharing a kiss. Do you understand how long some of us have been waiting for this?  Along with getting an openly queer character, we also have our first deaf superhero with Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), and they were able to seamlessly integrate sign language into the movie without it feeling out of place. You really can’t watch this movie if you haven’t been following the MCU since the only exposition we get is about the Eternals themselves, but anything else explained previously in the MCU isn’t going to be spoon-fed to you here. Some people have said it feels as if we’re being thrown into what feels like a sequel instead of the first movie.  I didn’t feel the same way, and since I’ve watched all things MCU-related, I didn’t struggle to keep up. The only thing I would say is that it would have been nice to have more scenes with the Eternals through the 5 000 years they’ve been on earth. The special effects are as top tier as you would expect coming from Kevin Feige and co. Zhao has put her distinctive stamp on this film, and it’s shot beautifully. “Eternals” is not going to be everyone’s cup of tea, but in a universe filled with movies that sometimes feel like it’s been copied and pasted several times over, it’s time that a movie in MCU shakes the table on multiple fronts.",POSITIVE
"Nov 4, 2021"," When Marvel hired Chloe Zhao to direct “Eternals,” the linchpin of the post-Avengers phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, they could not have imagined that her next film, “Nomadland,” would end up winning three Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. The film was originally slated for release around the same time as “Nomadland,” but the entire 2020 Marvel slate was upended by the pandemic, sliding everything into 2021. It turned out to be a nice little coup for Marvel, who suddenly could market the most esoteric film in their catalog as having been created by an Academy Award-winning director. It might be needed, as “Eternals” has a lot of ground to cover. The Eternals are a race of superbeings from the planet Olympia who work for the Celestial Arishem (David Kaye) to protect worlds from a race of quadrupedal monsters called Deviants. We are introduced to the Eternals who have been tasked with protecting Earth, including leader Ajak (Salma Hayek), who has the power to heal wounds; Sersi (Gemma Chan), who can alter matter in certain ways; Ikaris (Richard Madden), a clear Superman analog with the ability to fly and shoot lasers from his eyes; Thena (Angelina Jolie), who can conjure golden weapons to fight with; Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), who can shoot energy bullets from his hands; and Gilgamesh (Don Lee, aka Ma Dong-seok from “Train to Busan), who can punch things really hard. There’s also Sprite (Lia McHugh), a shapeshifter and reality shaper; Druig (Barry Keoghan), a telepath and mind control specialist; Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), a tinkerer and inventor; and Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), a speedster who is also deaf. We watch them protect the world from Deviants across the generations until they defeat them for good during the fall of Babylon. They’ve been living quiet lives since then, but when the Deviants return, they’re forced to team up again to stop the threat once and for all. Catch all that? The film has an almost impossible amount of heavy lifting to do in its 157 minutes, needing to explain and establish the concept of Celestials, Eternals and Deviants, let alone the specific group of Eternals who serve as the protagonists here and the wider cosmic purpose of the giant beings who they serve. That means that even well into the second hour of the film, the momentum has to grind to a halt in order to explain yet another concept required to follow the plot. All of this exposition ends up short-changing the character development, making the majority of the heroes into little more than sketches with a personality trait or two, like the big guy who enjoys punching things, or the small guy who solves all of his problems with mind control, or the medium-sized guy who kind of makes things with his hands. Chan and Madden get the majority of the development, and Nanjiani gets the majority of the comic relief, but this is a movie about bringing the band back together, so not caring about seven of the ten people we’re supposed to care about makes for rough going during such a long movie. There are a few sparks, most of which come from Henry, the most charismatic member of the cast, so he naturally disappears for the majority of the runtime. Similar to DC’s attempt to sprint to the Justice League after barely any movies, “Eternals” just has too much to do in too little time, despite being the second longest film in the Marvel canon. But that’s not the whole story of the failings of “Eternals.” It’s the Deviants who really tank the entire proceeding. Positioned as the sort of long-term cosmic foil to the Eternals, the Deviants are complete duds — a set of uninspired designs that serve to splash CGI all over Zhao’s trademark naturalistic cinematography and distract with the same fight scenes that we’ve seen dozens of times before in all these superhero movies. Attempts to bring them back in the second half of the film as a new threat who can steal the Eternals’ powers as it kills them falls spectacularly flat, especially since the central conflict of the final act treats them as little more than a nuisance or distraction. There’s no question that “Eternals” tries to differentiate itself from the pack in attempting to mount a more cerebral, philosophical and emotional take on the battle to save the world from the most recent giant thing/existential threat. But despite these attempts to shake up the most recognizable formula in all of entertainment, the film remains utterly familiar in everything it does. The Deviants are just an even more boring version of the Chitauri or Thanos’ minions from the Avengers movies; the Eternals just so happen to wear spandex super suits like all the other heroes do; and attempts to raise the stakes to something godlike is just another coat of paint on Dormammu from “Doctor Strange.” You don’t get credit for trying to raise the narrative to something deeper and more philosophical when so much of the result is laughable (“We caused Hiroshima and thus feel bad about it!” is a somewhat reductive take on one howler of a scene, but that’s essentially the gist). It’s entirely possible that a movie like this could work in some alternate universe where Kevin Feige is not so zealous in the control of his IP, but we do not live in that universe. The idea that an eight-second, emotionless sex scene is somehow groundbreaking for this genre is the most damning indictment of the entire Marvel enterprise and proof that “Eternals” never stood a chance. I don’t lay this at the feet of Zhao, despite being the director (and twice credited as a writer, which you don’t see too often). The Russos and the Kenneth Branaghs and the James Gunns of the world can fit right into the setting and the requirements because their authorial voices (or lack thereof) are already designed to gel with the institution. For someone like Zhao, who has made ponderous, intensely personal films filled with first-time actors, it never had a chance. Her sense of visual style is lost on MCU house cinematographer Ben Davis, and what does look good is painted over with wretched CGI. It’s a failure on all levels. This is without a doubt the worst MCU film to date and the sort of rancid theater experience that makes you want to rethink the whole thing and burn it to the ground.

"Nov 4, 2021","It's sprawling and somber, collapsing under the weight of its own misguided ambitions.",NEGATIVE
"Nov 4, 2021"," For Oscar-winning director Chloe Zhao (“Nomadland”) the answer doesn’t come completely because “Eternals,” as intriguing though its premise may be, represents an uncharacteristic mixed bag for a film based on a Marvel Comics property. It opens in theaters only Thursday. While logically venturing into origin story territory, it’s certainly an atypical Marvel film.  It’s contemplative, at times somber and yet compelling. Changes that if handled correctly could add plenty to what’s become formulaic filmmaking. So what’s the problem? The first hour is oddly disengaging as we learn the story of these would-be superheroes who’ve lived across 7,000 years of humanity’s history. In telling their backstory, Zhao, who co-wrote with Patrick Burleigh and Ryan Firpo, loses the narrative at times, muddying a timeline that is confusing to start. Where the film finds its groove, however, comes in its final 90 minutes (yes, it’s officially the longest Marvel movie ever, clocking in at two hours and 37 minutes), where the storytelling and action actually converge to complete the tale of a team of alien heroes. Arriving on Earth under the direction of Arishem, a mysterious being called a celestial, Ajak (Salma Hayek), who serves as team leader, Sersi (Gemma Chan), Ikaris (Richard Madden), Thena (Angelina Jolie), Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), Sprite (Lisa McHugh), Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), Druig (Barry Keoghan) and Gilgamesh (Ma Dong-seok) comprise a team with assorted super powers. No assembly necessary. They have but one mission to ensure the growth of the human species and get out of its way so that it can develop into a peaceful culture. How to do that eludes them and eventually causes fissures in the group. Given the events in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, that’s of little surprise. After millennia on the planet, this group developed an appreciation for the assorted cultures, but sat idly by and watched as forces within and from outside, including Thanos, wreaked havoc. As the mystery unfolds as to their purpose, it becomes clear just why the Eternals, as they are known, were sent to Earth. To say the reason has little to do with altruism is an understatement.They have decided between their mission and the personal ethos they’ve established living and interacting with humans. Those choices set up satisfying conclusion to this particular story, allowing Zhao and her collaborators to ultimately deliver an unexpected twist to complement some well-choreographed action sequences. Give Zhao credit for being able to at least give each actor moments to delve into their respective characters. The most significant surprise in that regard might be that Jolie isn’t leading this troupe. Hayek receives that honor before eventually giving way to Chan’s Sersi, who brings vulnerability and empathy to the part. However, for those looking for that one character who stands out, he comes in the person of Henry as Phastos, the techno geek intellectual, who happens to be gay.  In the best Marvel films, there was always one actor who made the audience sit up and take notice. In “Iron Man,” the role of Tony Stark seemed tailor made for Robert Downey Jr.  After watching Henry as Phastos, the same revelation comes courtesy of a witty, humorous and humane performance. Some will not enjoy the ponderous path “Eternals” clears for Phase Four of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It certainly isn’t what audiences have come to expect from the most significant film franchise of the past 13 years. However, despite its obvious flaws, it’s easy to appreciate the willingness to try something different in “Eternals.”",POSITIVE
"Nov 4, 2021"," A tale of cosmically conflicted beings who watch over the balance of life on Earth, Marvel's Eternals – directed by Oscar winner Chloé Zhao (Nomadland) – arrives with an admirable degree of conceptual ambition, promising a grand meditation on the universe and a superhero cohort far removed from the tired archetypes of the form. As the longwinded opening text reminds us, the Eternals are a race of ageless superhuman beings created by the Celestials, the all-seeing alien architects of life in the universe. First conceived by Marvel artist Jack Kirby in the 70s, the idea was borrowed in part from Erich von Däniken's zeitgeist-capturing bestseller Chariots of the Gods?, which suggested human civilisations were originated by alien travellers. And the film's early sequences have an appropriately pulpy, new age look that conjures the spiritualism of the era: shapeshifting astral bodies, galactic beams of light, a colourful hint of camp to the costumes. Arriving to Earth in 5000 BC via pan-dimensional spacecraft, the Eternals themselves cut a striking figure. Maternal leader Ajak (Salma Hayek) is all flamboyant headdresses and capes; flaxen-haired Thena (Angelina Jolie) pirouettes with translucent, elvish weapons; and an androgynous, Bowie-esque teenager, Sprite (Lia McHugh), can bend reality into illusion. There's also tech whiz inventor Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry); mischievous mind-manipulator Druig (Barry Keoghan); strongman Gilgamesh (Don Lee); super-fast Makkari (Lauren Ridloff); and Kingo (Kumali Nanjiani), who can project energy beams and sitcom jokes in equal measure. Zhao reserves most of the dramatic focus, however, for the transmutational Sersi (Gemma Chan), whose relationship with fellow Eternal Ikaris (Richard Madden) and subsequent love for a human (Kit Harington) has given her a deep sense of connection with the Earth. (The way it's pronounced here, ""Sersi"" frequently sounds like ""seriously"", resulting in an inadvertent, Flying High!-style running gag.) That's understandable, given they've been waiting around Earth in limbo for thousands of years, during which time the Avengers – a far less cerebral, much more crowd-friendly bunch – have come along and stolen their thunder in the battle between good and evil. It's hard to be a god. But with Thanos vanquished and the world apparently back in order, the Eternals' old foes – the beastly, Pokémon-on-steroids Deviants – have been roused to villainy, and the astral humanoids are once again called upon to set the world right. The premise feels like a real diversion, at least at first, from the familiar action-plus-wisecracks formula that drives so much of the MCU – a chance to refresh this overextended franchise and introduce a more contemplative, emotionally nuanced perspective. It's also a plus to see one of Marvel's most varied international casts up on screen, and the inclusion, however belated, of an unambiguously queer superhero in Phastos, and a deaf superhero, Makkari (played by deaf actor Ridloff). With the world once again (sigh) under threat, Marvel's standard business of getting the team together kicks back in, and the film reverts to yet another extended set-up for future installments. (Details of a post-credits scene featuring a certain pop idol have already, notoriously, been leaked online.) Sersi, Ikaris and Sprite go globetrotting to reunite the gang, a trip that takes them through the Amazon, Iraq, outback Australia and India – where, in one of the movie's genuinely funny bits, they discover that Kingo is now a swarthy Bollywood superstar trailed by his camcorder-toting manager (Harish Patel, stealing many of the movie's comedy scenes). Soon enough, they learn that their role on Earth is not what it seems: rather than protecting humanity, they're preparing the planet for the birth of a new Celestial, a cosmic colossus that will regenerate life in the universe but wipe out humankind in the process. This is a pretty neat pickle for the movie to slice, blurring the distinction between good and evil and introducing some big-ticket philosophical ideas about the nature of life and how it evolves in the universe. But the typically overstuffed and under-baked screenplay, credited to Zhao, Patrick Burleigh, and Ryan and Kaz Firpo, struggles to integrate these concepts into a narrative with any real momentum. Zhao's storytelling is similarly choppy. There's little dramatic rhythm, and the characters barely resonate. As usual, the acclaimed filmmaker hasn't met a magic hour she couldn't film a scene against – including a tacky visit to the still-smouldering ruins of Hiroshima – but without the space for her natural docu-fiction tendencies she seems adrift, wrong-footed by Marvel's routine, action-heavy narrative. The film wants its audience to regard the Celestials as cold, emotionless architects to be challenged, but their overarching plans seem closer to the natural ebb and flow of the universe than the Eternals' – and humanity's – self-absorbed instinct for survival. In one particularly laughable scene, Sersi – seriously – gives a would-be moving speech about how she admires the humans' ability to live, laugh, love, despite the fact that there's nary a heaving mass of humanity to be seen in the film's airless void. Plenty of Marvel movies have induced tedium in non-believers, but this might be the first with a plot to literally send one of its antagonists into deep slumber. And if the Eternals can put an all-powerful intergalactic being to sleep, what chance does an audience of mortals – armed only with popcorn and watered-down soda – even have? Still, there's something about a Marvel movie with this kind of ambition that's unusual, however messy and compromised the result. It's hard to dismiss Zhao's film entirely. At the very least, it's an interesting failure.

"Nov 4, 2021"," You might have heard that “Eternals” is overstuffed. Overlong. Overcomplicated. Overly invested in a complicated cosmology involving space gods and the even bigger space gods that created them.  The Marvel Cinematic Universe, which started with a movie where Robert Downey Jr. played a second-tier superhero in a tin can, is now straight-up hiring Oscar winners to tell creation myths for almost three hours. “Eternals,” helmed by “Nomadland” director Chloé Zhao, is out in theaters this weekend.  The first line of the movie: “In the beginning.” I’m not throwing out Bible comparisons willy-nilly, gang. Got too much respect for Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.  For its 26th film (the third released this year), Marvel goes deep with “Eternals,” based on somewhat obscure characters created by Jack Kirby, the intelligent designer behind most of your favorite comic books. Fictional millennia ago, omnipotent space deities named Celestials sent a superpowered race called the Eternals to Earth, in order to guide humanity’s development and protect it from a ferocious, monstrous race called the Deviants.  But when a resurfaced Deviant attacks modern-day London, Sersi and Ikaris travel the globe to reunite the family. Along the way, they discover that the millennia-old truths they’d believed weren’t so true after all.  Now, just a couple of weeks ago, I criticized Denis Villeneuve’s new film adaptation of “Dune” for trying to cram in too much dour, joyless world-building at the expense of giving newbies a story. “Eternals” has the opposite effect: Zhao, who also co-wrote the movie, crams 7,000 years of colorful, wide-eyed, sci-fi humanism (including 14 years of Marvel continuity) into the same almost-three-hour runtime. And you can find the flaws in “Eternals,” but a lack of story threads sure ain’t one.  “Avengers” characters like Thanos and Thor get namechecks, but Zhao’s film isn’t ever bogged down by its shared universe. Even the concept — “Oh, you liked the stuff with Iron Man and friends? OK, well, the whole time, there were these galactic gladiators roaming around Earth doing entirely different things, and boy, it’s nuts” — engages imagination audaciously. There are even more wild, punch-the-air concepts that we won’t spoil.  It’s never a knock on the cast, who all find a different angle to approach the pantheon from, especially Kumail Nanjiani as vainglorious energy blaster Kingo and Don Lee as nurturing punch expert Gilgamesh. (Yeah, that one.) But with 10 principal roles, a human love interest (Kit Harrington as Dane, Ikaris’ rival for Sersi’s undying affections), some giant cosmic deities, a few CGI beasties and general flashback whiplash, there were bound to be a few odd gods out. ",POSITIVE
"Nov 4, 2021","With beautiful visuals, some of the most innovative action scenes from the studio, and a deep sense of love to the characters and their clash of ideologies, Eternals is so flawed yet so emotionally rich.",POSITIVE
"Nov 4, 2021","While Eternals has considerable strengths, it is somewhat lacking in ... fun [and] adventurousness.",POSITIVE
"Nov 4, 2021"," In April, Zhao made history by winning best director for “Nomadland” (which also won best picture). Now Zhao is following up that award-winning film by helming the latest film in one of the most popular film franchises today – the latest chapter in the Marvel Comics Universe “Eternals.” And while the woman behind “Nomadland” and “The Rider” might seem an odd choice to helm a Marvel movie, “Eternals” actually proves to be the perfect fit for Zhao’s storytelling style. The result is a Marvel Film that feels more like a Chloé Zhao film than the other way around. “Eternals” is a sprawling epic that spans thousands of years, following a group of ancient aliens sent to Earth to protect the planet from beings known as Deviants. This group includes the leader Ajak (Salma Hayek), Sersi (Gemma Chan), Ikaris (Richard Madden), Druig (Barry Keoghan), Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), Thena (Angelina Jolie), Sprite (Lia McHugh), Makkari (Lauren Ridloff) and Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani). And this is where Zhao’s intimate storytelling kicks in. “Eternals” takes time to allow the audience to get to know these aliens and how they have blended into the modern-day world. Sersi is an archaeologist in a relationship with an English teacher named Dane (Kit Harington). Because the Eternals never age, Sprite lives with the pain of always being stuck as a teenage girl. Zhao, who co-wrote the screenplay, takes her time to allow the audience to get to know these characters in a fashion we have rarely seen in Marvel movies. This is a dysfunctional family that we see in their most mundane moments (at least mundane by comic book standards). “Eternals” builds off the previous Marvel film “Shang-Chi” which was a bit of a departure for the franchise by not being afraid to be quiet and reflective. That intimacy is on full display here – and provides the film with its strength. But this is a Marvel movie so there has to be some sort of conflict beyond everyday things. The film’s central conflict emerges as Deviants return, just as it appears that a series of cataclysmic events threaten the Earth’s existence. The Eternals must reunite and stop this event in time to spare the lives of everyone on the planet. This central conflict leads to a final act that will likely satisfy action fans (There is also a mid-credit scene that really pushes the Marvel world forward), but ultimately this is a chapter in the franchise where we get to know the characters in ways that have never been explored before. It makes for a more personal experience, a Marvel film that slows everything down and allows the audience to breathe a bit before this phase of the MCU really ramps up. “Eternals” may not be your typical comic book film, but it’s a refreshing new vision thanks to Zhao’s confident filmmaking.",POSITIVE
"Nov 4, 2021"," Entre 2008 y 2012 Marvel demoró cuatro años en lanzar cinco películas para reunir seis superhéroes en un clímax satisfactorio. Unos más interesantes que otros, pero cada quien con una relación aunque sea tenue con la realidad. Iron Man traficaba armas en Medio Oriente. El Capitán América era una reliquia propagandística propia de su época. Incluso Thor, dios del trueno, parecía relativamente plausible por la mundanidad que lo rodeaba y la fascinación con la que era recibido.  Eternals (2021), la película número veintiséis, empieza en cambio con diez superhéroes inhumanos y la sensación de estar mirando algo por la mitad. La relación con la realidad se ha perdido y nos encontramos en pleno territorio Power Ranger. Las pretensiones dramáticas de estas películas nunca habían chocado tanto con el nivel infantil de su historia. A esta altura el universo cinematográfico de Marvel ya no tiene verosímil que lo valide. Ha sido estirado en tantas direcciones por tantos géneros que en la trama vale todo pero no importa nada. Abundan las explicaciones largas, torpes y repetitivas. Algunas tan densas que cobran forma de hologramas de colores con la esterilidad clínica de un show de luces y sonido en Epcot Center, como para no aburrir en el fondo. Asimismo arrancamos con algunos párrafos introduciendo a tres razas extraterrestres y el primero de varios soliloquios en explicar qué es lo que estamos viendo. Son 156 minutos llevados a pésimo ritmo, con una historia que alterna constantemente entre pasado y presente sin ganar nada en el intercambio. Todos vienen del espacio: guerreros (Eternos) enviados al planeta por dioses (Celestiales) para pelear contra monstruos (Desviantes). Los Eternos no sólo protegen la Tierra desde que arribaron en Mesopotamia en el año 5000 a.C. sino que también dirigen el progreso de la humanidad según un guión predeterminado (quitándole a la vez todo mérito a la raza humana). Dentro de este triángulo bélico la humanidad es incidental, y la Tierra es un mero escenario para una disputa intergaláctica como tantas otras. Los Eternos son una mezcla entre Power Rangers y Planetarios, cada uno trajeado con su color y distinguido por un poder en particular, aunque entre los diez no hay uno solo que tenga uno original. Los Desviantes son a su vez indistinguibles de los varios monstruos descartables que han atacado la Tierra en estas películas. ¿Van cuántas invasiones extraterrestres? ¿Cuántas sociedades secretas y cuántas ligas de superhéroes? Cuando los Desviantes reaparecen luego de cientos de años en la actualidad, los Eternos tienen que recorrer el mundo para juntar a la banda de nuevo. La acción es lo de menos en Eternals, sin la gracia o la espontaneidad de algo como Shang Chi (2021). Más diversión trae la introducción paulatina de su decena de superhéroes a medida que se van reuniendo en el tiempo presente y sumando conflictos interpersonales a la trama, que carece de tensión y necesita urgente algún elemento humano. Se destacan Sersi (Gemma Chan) e Ikaris (Richard Madden), despechados por la memoria de su romance; Thena (Angelina Jolie), cuya propia memoria de miles de años vividos amenaza con volverla loca y Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), el relevo cómico y hedonista del grupo que compone su propia dinastía de playboys. La oscarizada Chloé Zhao dirige la obra más banal, ampulosa y pretenciosa en rellenar el expansivo catálogo de Marvel, cada vez más parecido al fondo de un barril. ¿Pero qué es dirigir una película que se arma mayormente en la cadena de montaje y mucho antes de fichar un director? La directora de Nomadland (2020) se hace cargo de uno de los proyectos menos convencionales del estudio con resultados decepcionantemente convencionales.",NEUTRAL
"Nov 4, 2021",Pretty images can only go so far and Eternals can't quite rise to its own formidable goals.,NEGATIVE
"Nov 4, 2021"," Throughout “Eternals,” the latest — though certainly not the last! — from Marvel Studios, you can see the director Chloé Zhao fighting to cut this industrial-strength spectacle down to human size. Her efforts are mostly evident in the sincerity of the performances, and in the heartfelt moments that punctuate the movie, creating pinpricks of warming light. But it’s a titanic struggle. And as Zhao keeps lubricating the machinery with feeling and tears, her efforts seem to mirror the battle that her likable superheroes are waging against a force seeking to thoroughly control their destinies. Created by the comic-book seer Jack Kirby, the Eternals first swooped onto the page in 1976 (“When Gods Walk the Earth!”) and have been resurrected a few times since. With Marvel bringing the Avengers movie cycle to a close (for now), it was a given that it would dust off another group of potential super-franchisers. To that end, Marvel brought in Zhao (“Nomadland”) to start the engine with a cast culled from across the entertainment world. Angelina Jolie is here, with sad hair and glamour-puss makeup, and so are Gemma Chan, Salma Hayek, Don Lee, Kumail Nanjiani, an indispensable Brian Tyree Henry and two dewy heartthrobs from HBO’s “Game of Thrones.” Among Kirby’s lesser-known creations, the Eternals are godlike humanoids primarily borrowed from Greek mythology but with oddball spellings: Thena, Ikaris, Sersi and so on. They have an elaborate history and a charge to safeguard humanity. (To judge from the wretched shape we and the planet are in, they haven’t done a very good job.) As a character explains in the movie, they interfere in human conflicts when need be, a role that evokes that of the United Nations Peacekeepers. But since humanity keeps getting attacked by snarling enemies called Deviants, the Eternals keep stepping into the fray, an interventionist habit that more strongly suggests that of the United States. Written by Zhao with several others, “Eternals” follows the Marvel house style visually and narratively. It’s busy, borderline clotted, and by turns works as a war movie, a romance, a family comedy and a family drama. It’s best categorized, though, as a getting-the-band-back-together flick: A group of former playmates reunite — warily, eagerly — to make music again or, in this case, kick cosmic butt. Unfortunately, the movie spends an inordinate amount of its two-and-a-half hours revisiting the group’s greatest hits, all while the Eternals explain a lot of stuff. The flashbacks interrupt whatever momentum Zhao builds, while the yammer only further muddies an already convoluted story. As the potential first installment in a new series, the movie serves as an extended meet-and-greet, so it’s heavy on introductions (who are they, what do they do?) that delineate the powers, sensibilities, histories and relationships of the 10 Eternals. It’s a crowded marquee but, as in the Hollywood star system, some lights shine brighter than others. The headliner is Sersi (Chan), a caring, somewhat reluctant champion who’s living in London and dating Jon Snow, a.k.a. Kit Harington’s Dane Whitman, when Deviant trouble roars into that dirty old town. The enemy incursion instigates the reunion and the amusing entrance of Jon Snow’s bro, Robb Stark, a.k.a. Richard Madden, who plays Ikaris. He and Sersi have history; it’s not complicated. The actors are the movie’s great superpower and give it warmth, even a bit of heat, and a pulse of life that’s never fully quelled by the numerous clamorous action sequences. Henry, Lee and Barry Keoghan (the terrifying kid in “The Killing of a Sacred Deer”) are particularly crucial to keeping your sympathies engaged. Henry’s character, Phastos, is the most vivid, partly because his superhero has an identifiably real side, but primarily because of the actor’s unforced sense of empathy and delicate expressivity. Lee offers some much needed comedy and makes a surprisingly effective foil for Jolie (inspiring visions of a Mr. and Mrs. Eternal spinoff), while Keoghan adds some prickly menace.

"Nov 4, 2021"," Make no mistake: it is always a good thing when a franchise departs from formula to try new things. As much as we have all grown fond (if, indeed, we have) of the special sauce that Marvel Studios has added to its product for the past 13 years (starting with the 2008 Iron Man), the same old same old nevertheless becomes overly familiar after a while. So kudos to those behind the new Eternals for flipping the script to start fresh. Unfortunately, change for change’s sake never guarantees quality, and the “flipped script” here is a mess, a mishmash of competing ideas that never gel into a coherent or meaningful whole. It’s also dreadfully long, drawing out the ennui far past its due date. Still, there are some fine sequences, and a strong, wonderfully diverse cast, but those elements are not enough to overcome the pitfalls of a poorly constructed narrative. Director and co-writer Chloe Zhao has previously shone with films like her 2017 The Rider and Oscar-winning 2020 Nomadland. Here, however, she is unable to breathe much life or energy into this soggy tale of Earth-bound immortals trapped in a mission which even they fail to understand. The glacial pace of the piece makes sense, in a way, given how time must appear to those for whom it never ends. Despite the heavy use of exposition, whether via on-screen text or exposition, however, nothing else proves as logical. Here’s a brief sketch of what happens. In 5000 BCE (written as “BC”), a group of superheroes—the “Eternals”—was dispatched to our planet to protect humans from lizard-like creatures known as “Deviants.” Receiving orders from an omnipotent “Celestial” named Arishem, they then proceed to remain on Earth in case the Deviants return. Barred from providing excessive aid to the developing civilizations, they nevertheless assist in a more nuanced manner, gently pushing forward the spread of new technologies. At various points in the story, we flash back to later and later moments in the past, seeing how their interpersonal relationships evolved and, eventually, deteriorated. They are a varied bunch, some looking younger, some older, no one changing from how they were upon arrival. They speak with an assortment of accents (the why of which is never discussed) and each have different powers. They can be wounded, and potentially die, but thanks to the magical healing talents of their leader, Ajak (Salma Hayek, The Hitman’s Wife’s Bodyguard), are always quickly repaired. Ikaris (Richard Madden, Netflix’s Bodyguard series) is the only who can fly, but the rest have some nifty tricks, as well: Sersi (Gemma Chan, Let Them All Talk) manipulates matter; Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani, The Lovebirds) shoots lasers from his fists; Makkari (Lauren Ridloff, Sound of Metal) is a speedster; Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry, Godzilla vs. Kong) is the technopath of the group; and so on and so forth. Years ago, Sersi and Ikaris fell in love, but then, for reasons later (sort of) explained, he took off. As the film begins, she is in a new relationship with a mere mortal, Dane Whitman (Kit Harington, Jon Snow on HBO’s Game of Thrones series), who, based on one of the movie’s many final scenes, is probably more than he appears. Dane notwithstanding, Sersi and Ikaris are still very much on each other’s minds (and in each other’s hearts), whether they admit it or not. Sadly for them, they begin to find themselves at odds as the true conflict of the movie emerges. Sadly for us, that conflict is a muddled one, filled with gargantuan stakes that barely resonate. Please, Marvel, stop making films about the end of the world or the universe; it benumbs the mind. Remember those Deviants? They play a part, but though Eternals hints at an interesting development in their reappearance, that proves a red herring in the ensuing climax. This is regrettable, for even though that subplot bore some resemblance to that of Avengers: Age of Ultron, it was the only one for which I felt a lasting glimmer of engagement. Otherwise, as the Eternals battled forces both within and without their collective, and the movie dragged on in a never-ending chaos of CGI and dramatic disarray, I could muster but a yawn. Chan is wonderful in what becomes the lead, though, as are most of her supporting ensemble. If they’re lucky, Eternals will be only a transient blip on their résumés before they get back to more substantive material.

"Nov 4, 2021"," ""In
the beginning"" begins Eternals,
and if there's an opening statement that imbues more grandness on a story than
that, this movie would have started with it instead. The so-called Marvel
Cinematic Universe has expanded in ways that likely were unthinkable when it
first began only 13 years and, somehow, 25 movies (not to mention the recent
boom of TV shows within this universe) ago. Here, perhaps, is the most
significant expansion of the history and mythology of these superhero tales, as
an alien squad of super-powered beings arrive on Earth with the emergence of
early humans and guide the species' continued development for millennia. These
are no mere superheroes, in other wordsor at least they aren't in terms of
how ordinary people see them. They are gods and heroes of ancient myth within
human storytelling. When people speak of the man who flew too close to the sun,
they are actually talking about Ikaris (Richard Madden), one of those Eternals
who arrived on the planet in 10,000 BC with others of his kind, such as the epic
hero Gilgamesh (Don Lee), the warrior goddess Thena (Angelina Jolie), and the
craftsman Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry). From then until now, these entities have
helped and shaped the course of humanity for better and, obviously, for worse. The
setup of director Chloé Zhao, Patrick Burleigh, Ryan Firpo, and Kaz Firpo's
screenplay certainly suggests something different and far more significant than
the stuff we've come to expect from this ongoingand seemingly never-ending
(although now we have a starting point, at least)franchise. The movie's
opening scenes, which feature the Eternals within their stone monolith of a
spaceship floating by the flaming sun and engaging in fierce battle with
monsters hunting early humans, are strange and mysterious. The
images and action are preceded, of course, by a lot of text, explaining their
origin from another race of celestial entities, appropriately called Celestials,
in the battle against those monsters, called Deviants, in some cosmic
back-and-forth between good and evil. There's a lot less strangeness and mystery
in such blunt and bland exposition. That's
the real battle of this movie, which is a theoretically ambitious but
practically routine superhero tale. At its thematic core is the story of
immortal beings, whose existence in human history was vital and celebrated, even
as they're now filled with regret for their actions and inaction, longing for
some purpose or sense of fulfillment, and uncertainty for what's to come. The
central idea of these characters is fascinating and woeful, especially as
flashbacks show how their leader Ajak (Salma Hayek) made a clear line of when
the Eternals could and could not interfere or help humans throughout history. If
the Deviants were killing humans, as they start to again in the present day
after a long absence, the Eternals were obliged to become involved. If humans
were slaughtering each other, these powerful beings were only allowed to watch.
As Phastos sees how his spark of rudimentary invention millennia ago led to
unthinkable destruction in the 20th century, the Eternals saw a lot. All of
this material, as the Eternals' history on Earth is revealed, feels like its
own, isolated, and far more engaging tale. In practice, though, all of that is
merely back story and exposition for the real plot. That sees Sersi (Gemma Chan)
bringing the Eternalsthe aforementioned ones, as well as Sprite (Lia McHugh),
Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), and Druig (Barry Keoghan)back
together to fight the emerging Deviants across the globe. How
does one make characters with this much cosmic, existential, and philosophical
potential into vessels for a series of scenes of exposition, interrupted by
generic sequences of computer-generated action? Somehow, superhero movies will
find a way, apparently. The
answer in this case, at least, is to make them the next step in a series that
has perfected a formula to the point of undermining even characters as powerful
and enigmatic as these. The movie jumps back and forth in time, not as a way to
illuminate characters or theme, but as a way to keep the plot going and to offer
additional action (Zhao makes good use of the budget to give us gorgeous,
globe-trotting backdropsand then cram a bunch of computer-generated noise
into the frame). There
are so many superheroes here, being introduced for the first time, that the
screenplay has little time for them as characters. They are mostly
interchangeably bland, aside from their glowing-gold powers and the melodrama of
Sersi's love interests (She goes from a five-millennia slog of lazy sex with
Ikaris to a less-developed relationship with Kit Harington's Dane Whitman, whose
purpose is apparently being saved for some later adventure). The exceptions are
Nanjiani, whose Kingo has become an egocentric Bollywood star (publicly,
multiple generations of stars in the same family), and Henry, who brings a
thoughtful sense of tragedy to Phastos' guilt over what devastation his
inventive spark has wrought. Something
as huge in scale and scope on the surface shouldn't seem this dull and
perfunctory. Eternals and its superficial treatment of characters who deserve
more, though, ensure that's the case.",NEUTRAL
"Nov 4, 2021"," After thirteen years and twenty-five films, it only makes sense that the standard formula for what makes a Marvel movie earns something of a deviation from the expected.  The tightly choreographed fight sequences, the amusing quips, the CGI-heavy climactic battle…all ingredients that, to the testament of such an institution, have been recycled in a variety of entertaining and intricate manners.  And whilst Eternals, the latest cab off the MCU rank, indulges in these ingredients too, it opts for an emotional, biblical edge that is likely to test the genre puritans who prefer brawl to brains. Whilst the Eternals themselves, with their specifically coloured garbs and respective super-powers, have an air of “The Avengers” about them, Chloe Zhao‘s ambitious actioner aims for more, presenting the titular crew as ancient-old cosmic beings that have existed since before the dawn of civilisation.  Their singular goal was to protect the Earth from a species of deadly creatures known as Deviants, implored by their leader to never interfere in any other destructive source, believing that humanity needs certain chaos in order to thrive and evolve; this being a reason as to why they weren’t on hand to protect mankind in previous films. The Eternals themselves are born from mythological figures known throughout history, with the likes of Gilgamesh (Don Lee), a Sumerian blessed with super strength, the flying wonder Ikaris (Richard Madden), the closest thing the MCU has to rivalling Superman, and Thena (Angelina Jolie), the Goddess of War, just a slew of the saviours that Zhao’s script unravels over the course of a mammoth 156 minutes. Though introducing such a large array of characters in one sitting means certain developments feel unrealised, Eternals still manages to forge believable relationships between its ensemble, with their lived-in mentality and romantic inclinations proving one of the film’s strongest assets.  It’s all very well and good that The Avengers succeeded at jovial banter, but a lot of their coming together was out of necessity, these Eternals, though initially together as a cosmic requirement, maintain a connection beyond their duty when their wise and spiritual leader Ajak (Salma Hayek) informs them after so many thousands of years that they are free to live their own lives, on their own terms. It’s when the film gives us a glimpse into their existence of intended normality that it really sets itself apart from the other entrants that came before.  Sersi (Gemma Chan), an empath who hones a deep connection to humanity, serves as something of a mother figure to the forever pre-teen Sprite (Lia McHugh), who yearns for the ability to age so she can love and raise a family like all those around her, whilst Druig (Barry Keoghan), a manipulator of minds, and Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), the MCU’s first deaf superhero, transcend their limited screen-time with a scorching chemistry that burns even when they’re relegated to the background.  The action on hand may not differ from anything that has come before, but in terms of progression and emotionality (we finally get an openly gay, non clickbait, hero in Brian Tyree Henry‘s weapon and technology innovator Phastos), Zhao’s film accomplishes more in a singular feature than the previous titles combined. For everything Eternals gets right – which also includes its visually appealing, more muted colour pallet, a stark contrast to the more candy-coated shadings of your Thor’s and your Guardians‘ – it isn’t immune to buckling under its own ambition.  The seeming need to please its standard audience is felt in its overly CGI-rendered final battle sequence, with a villain no less that doesn’t feel entirely organic to the plight.  Perhaps it ultimately comes down to the fact that, in these early stages of Marvel’s Phase 4, these Eternals don’t feel entirely necessary.  We are informed they will return in the obligatory post-credit sequence (and, if it hasn’t already been spoiled for you, there’s one helluva character appearance that looks ripe to set an interesting dynamic going forward) and, indeed, the film’s ending leaves us for wanting more, but they’re existing in their own niche clique for the time being, and their lack of interacting with any recognisable stock could very well work against them for the audiences unwilling to embrace mass change.

"Nov 4, 2021"," I’ve gone on previously — most recently when discussing Halloween Kills — about the Marvel Cinematic Universe serving as big-budget, high-concept soap operas for modern audiences. There are moments when it feels like Eternals is fucking with me along those lines. Usually these films have some sort of grand McGuffin, some ancient artifact or exogoo that’s driving the narrative engine. Here we have Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry) — an ancient being of limitless power when it comes to innovation, technology and literally drawing component elements from the air and earth around him — who sets devices aside for a cutting quip or well-timed rejoinder. So call that an animating philosophy. The thing about Eternals that confounds and enthralls is its insistence on foregrounding the emotional response to all the wild cosmic shit that’s happening. People have tasteful, PG sex in this film, and it’s just as important to the story as the slavering monsters laying waste to the supporting cast. I have no idea how the general public will respond to it. I’m well aware that some folks read my reviews with a giant “Do the Opposite of What This Guy Says” banner superimposed over it, and I’m OK with that. But this film has me flummoxed in a way that is kind of enthralling. There are world-shaking stakes and CG monster fights (obviously, this is a Marvel movie), but it has this interesting quality where it doesn’t feel like it was made in a warehouse festooned with green-screen material. Some of that comes from extensive location shooting, and some of it is thanks to an elastic tone that encompasses ancient themes and modern execution. But I never felt bored or alienated; even at its clunkiest, the film has the bewildering propulsiveness that makes for low-key addictive storytelling. You want to know where they’re going with all this. Long story short: Giant Alien God makes ageless helperoids to be stewards of the earth, helping humanity along in its development with little nudges here and there. Of course, it gets more complicated than that (superhero cinema does love its twists), but you can start from there and be just fine. There are a couple of instances of trying to shoehorn our squad of Eternals into the larger Marvel universe with references to “The Blip” and some scattered talk of The Avengers, but it’s not important unless that 26-film-strong through-line is your foremost concern. Like Dune, this is a several-hundred-million-dollar hangout film, and it’s got a fairly nurturing vibe. Most Marvel films for me are one-and-done. There are a few exceptions (Captain America: The Winter Soldier because of its overwhelmingly slashy vibes that made the whole MCU course-correct into shaky straight-people foolishness; the amazing Tony Leung wuxia dance fights in Shang-Chi; Iron Man Three when the Christmas season rolls around), but for the most part they propel the viewer forward through the channel prepared for them. Eternals, however, has that bowl-of-chili/bare-legs-under-a-comfy blanket feel — it’s a film you can spend time with without the plot getting in the way of the mood. I delight in Kumail Nanjiani’s Kingo, who’s spent the past century becoming a family dynasty of Bollywood stars, for well-timed comic relief and reliable laser hands. It’s also kind of hysterical that with as much attention and discourse that sprung up around Nanjiani’s training program/low-carb glow-up, The Powers That Be didn’t devote similar resources to extensive dance training. But honestly, Harish Patel (as Kingo’s valet Karun) makes a remarkable impression, taking a role that could have easily been a bundle of stereotypes and finding some remarkably effective moments with it. At its best, the Kingo/Karun pairing has the potential of a Morris Day/Jerome Benton-style spinoff, which would be a license to print money. I’d also like to take a moment to trip out on how Angelina Jolie can take a supporting role and turn it into something more captivating than any of the A plots. Yes, it’s Girl, Interrupted all over again, but here it’s worth noting that, like Brendan Fraser, Jolie made a point of learning the mechanics of how big-ticket effects movies work — the process of it all. Ever since 2004’s Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, she’s had this knack for meshing perfectly with the maelstrom of digital everything that defines so much of the modern blockbuster, and she shines, bending data to her presence before it’s even rendered. Her character Thena is a fierce warrior battling the early stages of dementia, and it’s such an unexpected turn — not that she’s figured out the character with the most viscerally captivating arc, but that she goes hard and finds a real, live beating heart in the midst of a cosmic picaresque. I mentioned Henry’s Phastos earlier, and he’s also very good, giving the Disney/Marvel empire its first queer character who isn’t a marketing decoy or afterthought. (Note: The gay power in this film is so real that Russia has rated it 18-and-up, which is utterly ridiculous, but so is any place that hates gays but is fine with autocrats … and that applies to more of America than I’m comfortable with.) He actually has the most intriguing arc in the whole film, because he goes through it for and with humanity — there’s a scene in the wreckage of Hiroshima that would set off warning klaxons that could be heard for a three-theater radius were it not for the fact that Henry digs in completely and finds the heart of it. You just have to respect that kind of gutsy swing. When the advance word about the Marvel machine choosing Oscar-winning Nomadland director Chloé Zhao for this film broke, I was genuinely intrigued. Directors come into the MCU with several previsualized CG sequences to work around, and we need only think back to the whole Edgar Wright/Ant-Man kerfuffle to remember how easily aesthetes can run into some corporate mandate bulwarks when heaps and heaps of money are on the line. Zhao changes up the program in her own way, much as James Gunn and Taika Waititi and Ryan Coogler have — broadening the scope of these films, finding resonance beyond awe and narrative reversals. It’s not a drastic enough change to freak out the faithful or demolish the formula, but it’s a pleasant enough experience, and its aesthetic instinct skews toward the pretty and expansive.",POSITIVE
"Nov 4, 2021"," I'm beginning to wonder if Marvel Studios' films are starting to become too much.  Are audiences getting tired of the supernatural, action films that have been produced over the last fifteen years?  When are there too many superheroes? Do we need a flow chart to keep track of them all? Well, if you weren't overloaded enough, here come the Eternals. One could say they are the originals and all of the other ""superheroes"" have followed in their footsteps and, while you wouldn't be wrong necessarily, no one knew who they were or where they were.  All that changes this week when Eternals opens in theaters nationwide. With the screenplay written and the movie directed by Academy Award winner, Chloé Zhao (Nomandland), Eternals begins long before the Avengers roamed the earth.  These immortal aliens who were created by the Celestials, came to Earth over 7,000 years ago to protect the people from their evil counterparts, the Deviants.  Once the Deviants were defeated, the Eternals stayed on earth, hidden until it was time for them to leave.  Unfortunately, before that could happen, the Deviants re-emerged to once again threaten the human race.  Separated for centuries, these ten immortals reunite to battle the villains. With an all-star cast, Eternals has a lot going for it.  Salma Hayek (The Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard), portrays Ajak, the group's leader and the bridge between the Eternals and the Celestials.  Angelina Jolie (Maleficent) is Thena, a warrior who can create weapons out of cosmic energy.  Gemma Chan (Crazy, Rich Asians) plays Sersi, an empath who can manipulate objects.  Upon Ajak's departure, Sersi becomes the leader of the group.  Rounding out the cast are Richard Madden (Game of Thrones) as Ikaris, Kumail Nanjiani (The Big Sick) as Kingo, Lia McHugh (Into the Dark) as Sprite, Brian Tyree Henry (If Beale Street Could Talk) as Phastos, Lauren Ridloff (The Walking Dead) as Makkari, Barry Keoghan (American Animals) as Druig and Don Lee (The Outlaws) as Gilgamesh. Unfortunately, an award-winning writer/director and a cast full of talent can't save Eternals.  Hayek is ok but doesn't seem to be playing much of anyone other than herself.  Madden does decent work, but the script can be too cheesy at times to take any of them seriously. Chan is the standout, with a gentle quietness that hides a leader under the surface.  Henry and Nanjiani offer some comic relief along with Kingo's valet/assistant Karun, played by Harish Patel (Run Fatboy Run).  Jolie was a disappointment as she seemed to be playing a snobbish and bitchy, mentally disturbed person (much like her real-life persona).  The rest of the actors are good but nobody other than Chan stands out. While the special effects are well done and the various scenic views are beautiful, Eternals' story is choppy and a little confusing.  At a run time of two hours and thirty-seven minutes, the movie drags at points and doesn't really seem to be going anywhere very fast.  The action sequences are typical of a Marvel movie and well-choreographed, but they can't make up for other areas where the film is lacking. Besides a few references to Thanos or an Avenger here or there, Eternals doesn't blend with the MCU.  It has a different look and feel, even more so than Black Widow did this summer.  Of course, the ending and end credit scenes leave the movie open for a sequel, but one can only hope that quality will prevail over the lure of the almighty dollar. Eternals is a decent film but not the best offering in the MCU (heck not even in my top ten) and sadly, it comes out in November because Marvel could have probably made some extra cash on Halloween costumes.

"Nov 4, 2021"," Marvelâs recent attitude has been to let indie filmmakers work on a bigger stage than their success to date would normally allow them, just working within the bigger framework of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Thatâs how the directors of antihero black comedy Super, schoolroom drama Half Nelson, racial meditation Fruitvale Station, Cannes-favored romance Somersault, and lo-fi adoption drama Short Term 12 have all ended up with blockbusters. And Eternals, directed by Nomadland filmmaker ChloÃ© Zhao, is likely to be another blockbuster, purely off the momentum of the MCU. Bluntly, it doesnât deserve it. It doesn't help that mentioning the Eternals will elicit an overwhelming, âWho?â from most comic readers, never mind the broader Marvel film and TV audience. First seeing print in 1976, they were Marvelâs answer to founding artist Jack Kirbyâs New Gods title for DC: When Kirby returned to Marvel after a six-year sojourn at the Distinguished Competition, he mixed his ongoing obsession with the blurry lines between superheroes and gods, and added in a layer of New Age-y Erich von DÃ¤niken Chariots of the Gods âancient aliensâ narrative. The result was the Eternals, a cadre of unkillable guardians left on Earth by the Celestials as noninterfering guardians. The problem is that no one cares. In 45 years, there have only been 45 issues of The Eternals, in part because they are tough to care about. They are abandoned angels, waiting on the will of implacable divine forces, tending in limited ways to humanity â so, basically, itâs Wings of Desire with more punching. But Eternals never even comes within glancing distance of that kind of insight, and instead is an oddly flat adventure that should feel epic. It definitely has the longest timeline of any Marvel film, zipping back and forth between post-Avengers: Endgame now and the last 5,000 years of the Eternals mucking around with human development to appease the will of their divine masters. Most of what they did was beat up the Deviants, the latest and least interesting of the generic CG monsters that occasionally plague the MCU. Supposedly disposed of centuries ago, now theyâve returned and have disrupted the blossoming relationship between Eternal Sersi (Chan) and human Dane Whitman (Harington), which is being encouraged by perpetual preteen and deceit-dealing exposition depositor Sprite (McHugh). Worse still, Sersiâs old boyfriend, Superman knockoff Ikaris (Madden), is back after a few hundred years. Thatâs awkward as they must scour the world to gather the team together, only to split them back apart again, then reunite them for a big fight. Thereâs been an urge to excuse the director and blame the studio, arguing that Zhao just didnât fit into the strictures of the MCU. Yet that doesnât explain how weak the script she co-wrote is, or why itâs so insufferably long, or why it almost completely fails to tackle its own core conceits of blind loyalty, of the perils of immortality, of rebellion against faith. Thank goodness for Kumail Nanjiani as Kingo, who has gleefully spent the last century pretending to be several generations of a Bollywood family, and Barry Keoghan as the mind-controlling Druig, a dour and sardonic presence who saw through the Celestialsâ supposed benevolence centuries ago (and, to a lesser degree, Henry, who may be the MCUâs first queer hero, but whose superpower makes him a discount Tony Stark). Without them there would be no light or shade. Eternals is as flat as the Western plain across which team leader Ajak (Hayak) rides in one of the National Geographic-esque scenery shots. For years, edgy cineastes have whined that thereâs no sex in Marvel, but the scene Zhao finally delivers has less passion and heart than Steve and Peggy dancing cheek-to-cheek in the finale of Endgame. Character traits are mentioned but irrelevant, while the return of the Deviants is one of a multitude of strained contrivances. Sersiâs excuse for not helping against Thanos may as well be, âWe slept through our alarm,â itâs so weak: Moreover, how the Eternals start seeing off a global-level threat without any other heroes noticing stretches credibility in the increasingly interwoven MCU. Worse, thereâs something uniformly placid about the performances, not helped by the cameo-length appearances by much of the wasted cast, and especially Jolie as warrior Thena (often relying on the same one-note smugness that drowned her version of Lara Croft in the Tomb Raider franchise). The inevitable âEternals will returnâ stinger seems like more of a threat than a promise, especially since the first mid-credits scene introduces a character that is, to say the least, problematic â a scene worsened by some wretched CG that is possibly the worst in the MCUâs history. But itâs the second that emphasizes why Eternals fails. Itâs a reframing, one that pulls back from the cosmic to what defines Marvel: the ordinary versus impossible odds. Stan Lee once said that, if you looked in the basement of a building in one of his comics, youâd see plumbing. Even Asgardians have explicable concerns. By contrast, Eternals is the unengaging concerns of cardboard demigods.

"Nov 4, 2021"," The Marvel Cinematic Universe expands this weekend with the theatrical release of “Eternals,” a star-studded superhero film with thousands of years of backstory and 10 new-to-the-big-screen superheroes. They are 10 immortals lead by matriarch Ajak (Salma Hayek) and Ikaris (Richard Madden). Rounding out the diverse cast (who are often lined up on-screen like they are posing for a 1980s album cover shoot) are matter manipulator Sersi (Gemma Chan), Thena (Angelina Jolie), a warrior with super strength and the ability to fly, strongman Gilgamesh (Don Lee), Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), the fastest woman in the universe, Bollywood star Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani) who can shoot fireballs from his palms, the childlike ancient Sprite (Lia McHugh), master inventor Phastos (Brian Tyree), mind control expert Druig (Barry Keoghan) and Sersi’s human (or is he?) boyfriend Dane Whitman (Kit Harington). 7000 years ago they were sent to Earth by the all-powerful Prime Celestial Arishem (voiced by David Kaye) to keep humans safe from evil killer creatures called Deviants. Over the years they have been present at many defining world events, from ancient battles to Hiroshima. They live by a strict set of rules, including one, a prime directive of a sort, that instructs them to only protect humans from Deviants. That means no man-on-man conflict. If they interfere with earthly concerns, Arishem says, humans will never figure out how to protect themselves. Now, in present day, the Deviants are back and badder than they ever were—this time around they can heal themselves—but can the Eternals battle the deadly invaders while pondering the real reason Arishem put them on earth in the first place? The 25th epic in the Marvel Cinematic Universe spans millennia but tackles many current issues. Themes of unity and the power of connection are woven into the story, topped with messages of self-awareness and being who you are. The ten new superheroes are more introspective than your run-of-the-mill superbeing, expressing their innermost feelings when they aren’t grappling with the existential threat posed by the Deviants. I mean, when was the last time you saw a superhero cry? The ideas expressed regarding sacrifice, interventionism and purpose of mission are endlessly replayed but never truly explored. It is pop psychology disguised as depth. But, nonetheless, they take the time to pontificate. At two hours and thirty-seven minutes, “Eternals’” story doesn’t exactly feel like it takes an eternity to tell, but it does feel long, especially if you stay to the end to see the two post credit scenes. Oscar winning director Chloé Zhao, who also co-wrote the script, brings humanity to these alien creatures, but the blockbuster style action, endless exposition and humanist musings sit uneasily beside one another. It’s ambitious, but tonal shifts abound and by the time the CGI orgy of the finale gets underway, “Eternals” simultaneously feels like too much and too little.

"Nov 4, 2021"," Eternals — out now in cinemas worldwide — has a lot to show. After all, it's the second-longest Marvel Cinematic Universe movie of all time, with a 156-minute runtime (including credits), behind only the epic saga-concluding Avengers: Endgame. The Eternals ensemble is made up of 10 immortal beings, led by the likes of Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Richard Madden, and Kumail Nanjiani. Its tale spans several millennia: from 5,000 BC Mesopotamia to present-day London, and 15th-century Spanish conquest to 400 AD Gupta Empire. There are lore and exposition dumps scattered throughout, but even that's not enough. Eternals begins with a three-paragraph opening crawl — it's like Star Wars but sadder — that tells us how the Eternals came to be, their chief enemy, and their purpose on Earth. It's just too much — and despite being two-and-a-half-hours long, Eternals buckles under the weight of the demands put on it. It's like being thrown into Avengers: Age of Ultron without the knowledge of any of the previous MCU movies. To be fair, Marvel has taken on an ensemble project before: Guardians of the Galaxy. Except James Gunn had a talking tree and a snark machine as two of its five primary characters. Eternals has TEN human-looking characters whom we are all meeting for the first time. It's an uphill battle for any writer-director, even one who has won Oscars for her filmmaking. Earlier this year, Eternals director Chloé Zhao won Best Picture and Best Director for her work on the Frances McDormand-led drama Nomadland. Worryingly, Eternals doesn't ever really feel like a Chloé Zhao movie. Though that may be because we've never seen a Zhao movie on this scale. Up until before Eternals, Zhao was renowned for delivering lyrical explorations of rural America, made with non-actors wherever possible. That made her work feel grounded, realistic, intimate, and akin to a documentary. Eternals is anything but. It's a Marvel superhero movie about immortal beings. They are not relatable, the film features planet-sized giants, and it feels very much like a Marvel Studios production. Sure, Zhao carries over her love for shooting on location in the golden hour, Eternals has epic vistas and is beautiful to look at, and there is a tangible feeling to some of its settings. But all of that is superficial. Zhao fails to bring the heart and soul she's known for on Eternals — instead, she delivers a gigantic and gorgeous movie with nothing to say, something that Marvel gets blamed for all too often. The Eternals opening crawl informs us that the titular beings were created by Arishem, the Prime Celestial. Think of Arishem as a supergod who only deals in planet-level talks — it makes sense given Celestials are the size of planets themselves. Arishem dispatched our Eternals to protect Earth from the Deviants, evil ugly-looking beasts who are essentially apex predators. They were instructed not to interfere in any other human conflict. Eternals arrived on our planet over 7,000 years ago and have since been living in secret, having gone their separate ways centuries ago due to a tragedy, as more expository narration tells us. There's Sersi (Gemma Chan, from Humans) who can transmute any inanimate matter and is living as a Natural History Museum employee in London. We have Ikaris (Richard Madden, from Game of Thrones) who is basically Marvel's Superman given he can fly and shoots beams out of his eyes. Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani, from Silicon Valley), who can fire blasts from his hands, has chosen the peculiar disguise as Bollywood's biggest movie star. Sprite (Lia McHugh, from The Lodge) can cast life-like illusions and has the appearance of a 12-year-old. Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry, from Atlanta) is a tech wizard. Makkari (Lauren Ridloff, from The Walking Dead) is basically Marvel's The Flash since she has super speed. Druig (Barry Keoghan, from Dunkirk) can take over human minds at scale. Gilgamesh (Don Lee, from Train to Busan) is the strongest of the Eternals with his fist capable of stopping nearly anything. Thena (Angelina Jolie), who gives the Goddess of War her name, can summon weapons out of thin air. That leaves Ajak (Salma Hayek) who has healing powers. More importantly, Ajak leads the group as the “Prime Eternal” (she's like a mother for the rest) and can talk to Arishem. Eternals spends its first half or so jumping across time to show us the group's journey on Earth — the big events they were part of, what led to their split, and the team slowly coming back together in present day as the old Deviant threat re-emerges. It might be watchable, but it's not remotely interesting. Frustratingly, Eternals never really takes us inside these immortal yet fallible beings. Naturally, as with any film that has so many characters, some of the Eternals ensemble is more “main” than others. Sersi and Ikaris get the most amount of screen time, fitting Chan and Madden's top billing. But their “millennia-spanning love story” is so perfunctory, it happens in one scene and comes out of the blue. Jolie is wasted in a one-note role that renders her star power useless for all but one scene. And Hayek, who was concerned Marvel would offer her a grandmother role, ends up more or less doing that with her truncated role as a mother to the Eternals. One major character takes a break from the third-act big fight — no one talks about their absence even when they magically return for the conclusion. Kit Harington, Madden's Game of Thrones co-star, has a tiny role that is essentially a backdoor pilot for his future MCU adventures. Even the likes of Phastos and Makkari are essentially relegated to the side-lines. This feels like an additional betrayal given Eternals has been billed as Marvel's most diverse movie to date. (Yes, I know it's a very low bar and that it should've happened sooner.) Phastos and Makkari are respectively the MCU's first gay and deaf superheroes, but their presence is minimal and fleeting. I was genuinely surprised to see that India's censor board didn't cut the gay kiss though, something they have been guilty of in the past. There's even a brief PG-13-friendly sex scene, a first for Marvel. Eternals also suffers from Marvel's villain problem. The Deviants are not at all interesting — the fact they cannot speak for the most part contributes to that. Heck, some of them don't even get names, despite appearing repeatedly. One doesn't appear until three-quarters into the movie. The only refreshing aspect is the comic relief provided by Kingo and his camera-toting valet Karun (Harish Patel, from Gunda). Kingo seems to be the only one with a sense of humour amongst the Eternals — and Nanjiani and Patel infuse life into the film. It's frankly amazing how often Patel ends up stealing scenes in a movie filled with stars. That's likely also because the others, except Kingo, are stuck playing gods with the weight of the universe on them. Thanks to the duo, Eternals also break the fourth wall of sorts as Karun follows Kingo everywhere with a camera, allowing for some chuckles and over-the-top nonsense to cut through the dramatic tension. And it's through Kingo and Karun that Zhao gets closest to any kind of incisive commentary — I can't say if it's intended, but some lines in Eternals cut deeply into Bollywood. It made me wonder who's responsible for such insight in the writing committee. The humour also comes from characters referencing other MCU characters and events — Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) gets a nod — and even jumping into its rival DC Comics, with a couple of jokes comparing Eternals' characters to Superman and Batman's butler Alfred Pennyworth. Eternals' action sequences are nothing special either. If you were hoping that Zhao's love for lingering takes would result in longer stunt shots, prepare to be disappointed. It's cut and edited pretty much like any Marvel movie in fact. Award-winning filmmaker Lucrecia Martel revealed that she turned down Marvel on Black Widow after they offered to “take care” of the action sequences. I might be totally wrong here, but it seems like Zhao isn't responsible for the big set pieces. Yes, there are some flashes of style, using the unique abilities and showcasing the otherworldly nature of their superpowers in a fun way, but it's rare and forgettable. The most promising nugget that Eternals offers is how the team is split internally on values — they don't see eye to eye on a lot of topics, which is what caused them to go their own separate ways. (It also contributes to Eternals' big twist, which I won't get into.) This is expressed most clearly through Druig, who as he says could easily resolve all of mankind's disputes in a blink of an eye. But then humans wouldn't learn and develop, the counter-argument goes. Being asked to stand by when you've god-like powers can weigh heavily on anyone's shoulders. Eternals needed to better expand along these lines — but it doesn't know how to. In lieu, it just gives us dollops of exposition, characters standing around and arguing, and little forward momentum or narrative urgency. With Eternals, the MCU's gods take centre stage. Yes, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) has been around since the beginning, and we had Ego (Kurt Russell) — a Celestial — pop up in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. But Marvel has never gone in for the creation myth until now. The Disney+ series Loki briefly touched upon the lack of free-will in the MCU, and Eternals pushes deeper into that. Though with very mixed results. Eternals posits that the 10 have shaped human history. That's fine. But by saying that the Eternals are responsible for humans' worst impulses and calculations, it's taking away the evil that humans themselves are capable of. Humans are their own worst enemies — we don't need gods playing dice to decide our behaviour and our fate. No matter who was hired for the job, Eternals was always going to be an ambitious movie. Despite the lengthy runtime, cramming nearly a dozen characters and an epoch-spanning saga seems overambitious. Zhao acknowledged this: “It could be longer! You know, it's ten characters, the Celestials, and 7,000 years. There's a lot going on.” Weirdly though, Eternals feels like it's thinly plotted for most of its 156 minutes, before being thrown into the deep end. That tilts the balance and sinks the ship. Zhao unfurls the story of the Eternals on an epic and elaborate stage, though that ends up being a double-edged sword. We get a grandiose mythology about the creation of the (Marvel) universe, alongside backstories for its titular immortal beings. But we are never really given the time to understand them, care for them, or connect with them.",NEGATIVE
"Nov 4, 2021"," To paraphrase Mrs Merton: what first attracted director Chloé Zhao to the idea of directing something in the colossally lucrative Marvel franchise? Or, to paraphrase Nigel Planer’s fictional actor Nicholas Craig: were they offering Zhao a staggering amount of scope to develop the project? At all events, it was an interesting idea to hire the brilliant Oscar-winning film-maker Zhao, known for social-realist docudramas such as Nomadland and The Rider. But the very few authorial touches that she manages to bring to Eternals – some Terrence Malick-ish “golden hour” sunset scenes – only go to show how dominant the formula actually is. Perhaps there is the question of tone; I had the uncomfortable feeling that the all-important brash humour, DayGlo energy and operatic craziness of superheroism were being downplayed in favour of something more serious – the addictive inspiration of fast food being replaced by vegan cordon bleu. There are some nice touches and an attractive new diversity worn lightly, but this is an underpowered and uncertain film. The Eternals of the title are an order of divinities with various silly powers and familiar-sounding god-names who have lived incognito among humans for millennia; they include Thena (Angelina Jolie), Sersi (Gemma Chan), Ikaris (Richard Madden), Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), Sprite (Lia McHugh), Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), Druig (Barry Keoghan), Gilgamesh (Don Lee) and Ajak (Salma Hayek). They are commanded to protect Earthlings from periodic incursions by alien beings called “Deviants” but must otherwise refrain from getting involved in any of humanity’s wars, although Phastos bitterly regrets introducing us to his super-engineering skills, which apparently led to the atomic bomb. There’s a misjudged scene, treated as a mere passing episode, in which an anguish-filled Phastos stands solemnly in the wreckage of Hiroshima. (Could someone at least have pointed out that it affected Nagasaki as well?) A new Deviant attack in London brings the Eternals together for a fightback, but then it becomes horribly clear that the Eternals have been misled and now they must choose between their loyalty to celestial orders laid down from on high, and planet Earth’s humankind, which they have grown to love. This leads to some very protracted set-piece spectaculars, and admittedly amusing scenes for Nanjiani’s character Kingo, who in civilian mode is a Bollywood superstar but is prickly and defensive when it comes to his stalled career as a director (“I have directed some internet content …” he snaps, when pressed for details). But his status as the comic turn only underscores the heavy and unsatisfying seriousness of everything else.",NEUTRAL
"Nov 4, 2021"," 
One has to wonder whether Marvel Studios’ reputation as the
industry’s King Midas might be in jeopardy. The post-Infinity War continuation
has limped along without providing a compelling reason to return to theaters
(although millions have done so). Black Widow was disappointing and
unnecessary. Shang-Chi was entertaining but failed to break much new
ground. And Eternals does little to change the momentum. Directed by
Oscar-winner (and avowed MCU fan) Chloe Zhao, the film falls into a no-man’s
land of trying to be both portentous and exhilarating and not really succeeding
as either. While not a complete failure, Eternals is plagued with
problems. Some are related to forcing it, like a square peg into a round hold,
into the MCU and some are simply because of narrative and structural
sloppiness.
 If there’s one salient question to ask, it’s why, especially
with the resources of Disney+ available, Marvel Studios elected to go the “DC
route” for this film. Back during the run-up to the release of The Avengers,
Marvel carefully developed the team by giving most members of the squad either
entire movies of their own (Iron Man, Hulk, Captain America) or significant
portions of one (Black Widow). Everything built to The Avengers. DC, on
the other hand, rushed things, releasing Justice League with undue haste
while introducing several characters who had never before been seen. The result
spoke for itself. For some reason, however, Marvel has elected to use the DC
template rather than their own for Eternals. The result of trying to
cram ten backstories and character arcs into a single 150-minute film is a predictable
mess.  Had Eternals been released in a pocket universe
divorced from the MCU, it might have worked better. The logistical problems of
fitting this story and its characters into an already-established milieu create
all sorts of difficulties. The screenplay proves unable to explain a basic plot-hole
in a convincing manner. Why did the Eternals remain hidden and uninvolved
during Thanos’ attack? The matter is addressed (how could it not be?) but the
answer proves to be mind-bogglingly hard-to-swallow. (Specifics would require a
greater degree of spoilage than I feel comfortable divulging.) This isn’t a
minor point; it’s a major failing. Had Eternals transpired in a universe
where Thanos never existed, it would have gone away. Then there’s a question about whether the addition of a
group of mega-superheroes like the Eternals continues to crowd the MCU with
gods and demi-gods. Now, it’s no longer Thor and Captain Marvel. In the span of
a single movie, Marvel has added Eternals and Celestials. In the face of such
immense powers (and with the “multiverse” concept about to be pursued), the
“individual superhero” has been marginalized. Faced with the awesome powers of
the Celestials, what’s someone like a Spider-Man, Captain America, or Black
Widow to do? They no longer matter. The story has moved beyond them. Uber-super
villains require uber-superheroes to fight them. Hence, we have Eternals. But
what of so many of the characters we have to come care about during the last
10+ years of Marvel movies?  (This is an
indication that the MCU may be following in the footsteps of the comic book
universe, which might not be the wisest course. Movies are not comic
books nor can they be.) There are ten Eternals (or at least ten who have been sent
to Earth). The leader and mother-figure is Ajak (Salma Hayek), who is the only
one of the group with a direct “line” to their god, Arishem. Her closest ally
in the “family” is Ikaris (Richard Madden), who can fly and shoot energy beams
(like Cyclops) out of his eyes. For most of his time on Earth, he has been in
love with Sersi (Gemma Chan), who can control inanimate matter, but their
relationship has cooled and she is now involved with a human (Kit Harrington).
Other Eternals include Thena (Angelina Jolie), a gifted fighter with sanity
problems; Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), who can throw energy projectiles; Phastos
(Brian Tyree Henry), a futuristic engineer whose blueprints become reality;
Sprite (Lia McHugh), a trickster with mastery over illusion; Makkari (Lauren
Ridloff), whose speed might allow her to beat Flash in race; Druig (Barry
Keoghan), who can control minds; and Gilgamesh (Don Lee), who has the best pure
strength of any Eternal.  The backstory takes a while to unpack. The Eternals were
sent by Arishem (and his race, the Celestials) to Earth 7000 years ago to protect
it from the Deviants, monstrous creatures that roam the cosmos. They were
instructed to not to do anything else except destroy the Deviants and, when
that task was completed, they were forced to assimilate into the human
population, although their immortality set them apart. Now, in the modern-day,
they are scattered across the globe but the return of the Deviants forces them
to re-assemble the team and confront a dark secret hitherto known only by Ajak
about the true nature of their mission on Earth. With an Oscar on her mantle for the somnambulant Nomadland,
one has to wonder whether Zhao was the right choice for the job. Her attempts
at adding issues of existential import might have worked better if they didn’t
echo Thanos’ dilemma in Infinity War too closely (after all, he believed
his actions were cosmically justified). Also, we never get a feel for the scope
of the Eternals’ power. How strong are they in comparison to, say, the X-Men?
Can they be killed by anyone who isn’t a Deviant or a Celestial? I guess it’s
up to a future director to fill in the blanks.  The biggest overall problem is the number of characters,
none of whom were previously introduced. The screenplay has too much heavy-duty
lifting to do: introducing ten new card-carrying members of the MCU, fleshing
out their backstories, getting them back together, and providing them with a
present-day storyline. At the end of 2 ½ hours, I didn’t feel like I knew any
of them, nor did I much care one way or another. That’s a problem that no script,
no matter how cleverly written, could have overcome. It’s a result of not
rolling out the characters over multiple movies or a made-for-Disney+
mini-series.  For the most part, the cast impresses, although the
in-jokiness of the encounter between ex-Game of Thrones siblings Rob
Stark (Madden) and Jon Snow (Harrington) comes a little too close to breaking
the fourth wall. (It’s subtle but obvious to anyone who has watched the HBO
series.) It’s fair to say that no one gets enough screen time to stand out.
Even the big names, like Angelina Jolie and Salma Hayek, blend into the
background. But maybe that’s how it should be for a truly ensemble film.  One surprise is how adept Zhao is at handling the action
scenes. They are well-choreographed and elegantly shot. Cleanly presented and
not reliant on fast-cut editing, they do a good job of generating suspense.
Nevertheless, with the film’s primary problems being related to its narrative
structure and overall placement in the MCU, these things are of secondary
import. Eternals, despite trying to be a departure from the superhero
generic norm, misses wide of the mark and ends up being a major lapse.",NEUTRAL
"Nov 4, 2021"," Oscar winning best director and indie icon Chloé Zhao presides over another big budget, huge-cast “All in the Fractious Family” Marvel monstrosity with “Eternals,” an origin story that dates from when the comic book colossus ran out of things to do with its Avengers, et. al. It’s a derivative, noisy, sometimes-amusing Greek myth-reinventing eye-roller, full of fan-service, inclusion, dry-eyed deaths and “high stakes” that feel like a half-hearted send-up of that idea. When you put the ’60s weeper (“Don’t they know, it’s) The End of the World” on the soundtrack, you know subtlety isn’t what Zhao was going for. Overloaded with characters, geographical and temporal settings and exposition, it’s pretty much the generic bore the trailers promised. This could be Marvel’s “Suicide Squad” level bust.  They’ve been on Earth for 7,000 years, a long opening credit tells us and the characters keep reminding us. They’re “not to interfere” with humanity’s progression, we’re told, time and again. We see them interfere, time and again, from pre-history to the Hanging Gardens of Babylon.  Ajak (Salma Hayek) is their leader, the one in charge of their “mission,” the one who talks to “Arisha,” of the space gods called “Celestials,” giants who manifest themselves in modified “Iron Giant” gear and pull the strings in the universe.  The Eternals’ ostensible mission was to kill off the “Deviants” — dragonlike gargoyles who devoured humans from hunter-gatherer days onward. “Eternals” picks up their story 500 years after they wiped them out.  They’ve scattered, with Sersi (Gemma Chan of “Crazy Rich Asians” and a lot of British TV) and the perma-pixie Sprite (Lia McHugh of “The Lodge”) hanging out in London, where Sersi — having split up with Ikaris (Richard Madden of “Game of Thrones” and “Cinderella”) — has taken up with non-Eternal Dane (Kit Harrington).  Druig (Barry Keoghan) is off in South America, Thena (Angelina Jolie) and Gilgamesh (Ma Dong-seok of “Train to Busan”) and deaf-and-mute “Female Flash” Makkari (Lauren Ridloff) are off doing versions of their own thing. Ajak retired to South Dakota, Ikaris got off to who-knows-where and brainy, tech-oriented Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry of TV’s “Atlanta” and “Godzilla vs. Kong”) has settled down in a same sex couple in the city. And most amusingly, Karun (Kumail Nanjiani of “The Big Sick”) has been passing himself off as generations of Bollywood stars (explaining away his eternal life/youth) — a century of vampy romances and campy musicals, big paydays with a Man Friday/valet (Harish Patel) at his beck and call.  So characters have to get over old grievances, suit up, fly around, shoot bolts or balls of energy out of their hands, conjure up gadgets, wield light swords and shields and get on with the business of killing dragons.  I liked the next-gen effects, and Zhao keeps the action beats visually coherent, not something you can say about every picture of this genre. The cast is not-quite-“Justice League/Avengers” impressive, but good actors to a one, even if they’re only challenged in the most modest hint-of-human-relationships ways. But the dialogue is strictly boilerplate — “Druig, I can see you’re upset!” “Know your place!” The “We are family” ethos is Pixar pablum of the “Fast and Fading” variety.  And as generic as the fights inevitably are, the dead zones between them — with little dollops of Nanjiani/Patel comedy — are excruciating. This picture seems to go on forever.  It’s not like the exposition in this origin story never ends, but it does go on an on, unlike some of the alleged “Eternals.” Whatever “meaning” their deaths convey, Zhao delivers them perfunctorily. The relationships — a sex scene included — are the only hint that there’s an Oscar winner behind the camera. Much of the time, Zhao is just another Marvel traffic cop, trying to keep the endlessly inter-connected stories straight, the fights and laughs at the appropriate intervals and the fans sated, if not exactly delirious at seeing something “new.”",NEGATIVE
"Nov 4, 2021"," Despite being the undisputed juggernaut of the Hollywood landscape, the Marvel Cinematic Universe spent years being criticized for its homogenous, generic superhero movies. That has changed somewhat lately, but not entirely. No matter what the story, or how large its scope, like say Avengers: Endgame, it is constrained by the needs of the genre. And then comes along Eternals, which boasts the talents of Academy Award winning Nomadland director Chloe Zhao, and arguably the most talented ensemble Marvel has ever put together. With a story that spans thousands of years, employs numerous mythological concepts and philosophical ideas in the midst of a cosmic war between celestial beings, this is Marvel doing bold, ambitious filmmaking like they’ve never attempted before. Marvel has done cosmic before, but never quite like this. Eternals begins with the literal creation of the universe by the gigantic Celestials. The Celestial known as Arishem creates the immortal beings known as the Eternals to protect the planet Earth, forbidding them to interfere in anything unless it is directly connected to the monstrous Deviants. That explains why they have been absent while the planet was threatened by, oh some dude named Thanos. The Prime Eternal Ajak (Salma Hayek), Ikaris (Richard Madden), Sersi (Gemma Chan), Thena (Angelina Jolie), Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), Sprite (Lia McHugh), Druig (Barry Keoghan), Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), and Gilgamesh (Don Lee) served in this function for thousands of years, but split up when all of the Deviants were believed defeated. But when Sersi and Sprite, who are living normal human lives in London, are attacked by a Deviant stronger than they’ve ever faced, a reunion is called for. Eternals is essentially one big gathering, like those episodes of GI Joe where the best part was watching the team come together. So it proceeds pretty slowly as a result, and your mileage will vary depending on how much investment you place in the diverse array of characters and the different lives they lead. To Zhao and her co-writing team’s credit, every Eternal is incredibly interesting, so much so that you wish this could have been a series with each one getting some focus. Sersi, who shared a eons-long relationship with the Superman-esque Ikarus, is now dating human Dane Whitman (Kit Harington), which causes some long-held feelings to emerge. Sersi and Dane, who in the comics is known as the Black Knight, have always been my favorite Marvel couple (Gambit and Rogue a very close second) so seeing them on screen brought a smile to my face even if we don’t get nearly enough of it. The Hepaestus-like builder Phastos has built a family with his same-sex partner and is reluctant to join the fight, especially given that his technological gifts have been squandered by man for centuries. Sprite, forever stuck in a child-like form, resents the others for what she can’t have; the mind-controlling Druid has built himself his own personal cult; Kingo has become the world’s biggest Bollywood star, and so forth. Then there’s the goddess of war herself, Thena, who has seen so many planets destroyed it has fractured her mind. These individual tales add color and depth to Eternals but leave you wanting more. Unfortunately, there just isn’t enough time for it, even if the film does a great job of making each character feel like an important part of the whole. Everyone has their role to play. But that limitation is something you can see Zhao struggling with. Questions are raised that are barely explored. What does love mean to someone who can live forever? What about mental illness, like the one that afflicts Thena? How does guilt change someone who has been manipulating events for ages? Does war still have any meaning? Does peace? In one scene, Phastos warns Druid that he’s “not a god”…but isn’t he? He lives forever and is all powerful, just as they all are. Aren’t they all gods? Most of them, both in the comics and in this movie, are based on the legendary deities of Greek myth. The physically powerful Gilgamesh is just another name taken by the mighty Hercules. The needs of a Marvel movie just have to intrude themselves, though. There has to be a big baddie and there has to be a huge final fight. And what a beautiful fight it is! Zhao, who captured amazing natural beauty in Nomadland, brings her cinematic eye to the world of superheroes and it has never looked better. It doesn’t matter whether the Eternals are in the sands of Iraq, in a jungle hut, or firing laser beams and creating magical weapons in battle against the Deviants, Eternals is simply stunning and the best looking Marvel film yet. What Zhao brings is pure poetry for the eyes and I can’t wait to see it all again on the biggest screen I can find. What holds Eternals back is the sheer size and scope of it. The thing that separates Marvel characters from DC is that they are better the closer they are to the ground. We like them because they are human; we can see ourselves in them. That’s impossible when you’re talking about immortal super-beings who regularly chat with the creators of the entire friggin’ universe. Try as the film might to humanize them, and it does, audiences will find them hard to connect with. While it ultimately gives in to the demands of the MCU, Eternals strives to be more than just another superhero movie. It’s the reason why it has won me over, and may be the reason why it won’t work for others.",NEUTRAL
"Nov 4, 2021"," Wondering if Marvel’s Eternals is ok for kids? Eternals is rated PG-13 for language, violence, and some sex. Is Eternals kid friendly? Well, there is a sex scene. In a Marvel movie. Marketed to kids. Aside from that, Eternals is long, boring, and cheesy, so it may not be the best choice for little ones. Eternals does not fit the typical Marvel mold, which is why it has been divisive. Here’s what parents need to know in this Eternals Parents Guide. The Eternals are approximately 7000 years old and were sent to Earth by the Celestials, an ancient group of godlike beings, to defend humans against the Deviants, monsters also created by the Celestials, but they couldn’t be controlled. Their main job is to only focus on Deviants and not to involve themselves in other human affairs, even though they technically could stop some human wars. Meet the Eternals: Ajak, also the Prime Eternal (Salma Hayek), Ikaris (Richard Madden), Sersi (Gemma Chan), Sprite (Lia McHugh), Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), Thena (Angelina Jolie), Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), Gilgamesh (Don Lee), and Druig (Barry Keoghan). They all have their own powers, and spent thousands of years together fighting the Deviants. After they think they have killed them all, they live life in separate places. However, a family reunion is needed after the Deviants have returned.  Eternals is rated PG-13 for fantasy violence and action, some language and brief sexuality, which means it may not be suitable for kids under 13. Parents need to know that Eternals is 2 hours and 37 minutes long, which may too long for younger kids. Eternals also contains a sex scene and is the first Marvel movie to include two gay characters who share an on-screen kiss. Language is pretty mild in Eternals with about 3 uses of sh*t, a couple uses of hell, one use of a**, and words of Deity like “oh g-d.” One character gives the middle finger to another character. Sexual content in Eternals includes kissing between a man and woman and also between two men. One scene includes two characters kissing, then leads to the characters being naked with a woman on top of the man in the sand and some heavy breathing. There is no full nudity in Eternals and most body parts are covered with only seeing the top half naked and maybe a quick glimpse of boobs from an angle. The scene adds nothing to the story and is somewhat awkward.  Eternals does contain a fair share of violence and scary elements for kids. Is Eternals too scary for kids? Yes, the Deviants are scary, but nothing over the top compared to other Marvel films. The Deviants are gross-looking monsters, almost dragon-like, with  Venom-like attributes like large teeth, gnashing around. They do kill humans, and that may be disturbing for young ones to watch. Flashbacks contain scenes of human destruction such as wars and Hiroshima. There are buildings burning as well as soldiers fighting and slicing off a head with a sword. As far as violence is concerned, Eternals is less violent than Black Widow and Black Panther. I’d be most concerned about the age recommendations for Eternals due to length of the film and maturity of understanding what is going on. If you thought Doctor Strange was complicated, then prepare yourself for Eternals. I’d recommend Eternals for kids ages 12 and over, but you can definitely go younger as far as content if you’re comfortable with it.  It’s not a bad film, but don’t go in with the expectation of it being like all the other Marvel films. As a fan, I’m still waiting for the MCU Phase 4 excitement in the films. I loved the Marvel shows like WandaVision and Loki. WandaVision took risks and they paid off. Eternals takes different risks, and I can’t pinpoint why they didn’t work for me.  Perhaps I was already invested somewhat in Wanda and Vision, and Agatha was really easy to like with her sense of humor and energy. Trying to meet 10 new characters in one film is daunting, and I felt overwhelmed. Rather than appreciate Chloé Zhao’s attempt at connecting me to the Eternals, I was bored and uninterested in whether one died or not. The pacing was off and lackluster.  Admittedly, I am super annoyed at Marvel for putting in a sex scene in this film. Is there nudity? No. But did it add anything to the story? No. It wasn’t even vulgar or particularly sexy, it was just awkward. One dad in the theater even broke the silence with a “this is for kids?” If you want a more mature film, then make one. It’s your film, it’s your franchise. But if you’re going to market a movie to children, including adding Eternals toys to Happy Meals, then make it appropriate for kids of that age range. I enjoyed seeing diverse representation from different cultures in the Eternals, humanizing a dysfunctional family and group of loved ones. It almost had an Umbrella Academy feel as they all try to find each other and get the family back together in a united cause. Eternals digs deeper and explores complex feelings and emotion like jealousy and mental health, but many of the speeches and Eternals one-liners felt overly cheesy. And I like cheesy! At one point, I was rolling my eyes at the ‘truth will set you free’ trope. Eternals had a very DC feel to it, bringing in greek mythology and making the Eternals into god-like saviors for the human race. It just doesn’t feel like it fits into the MCU, and perhaps it will as Phase 4 continues. I have to hand it to Zhao for her ambitious take on a Marvel film and going in a different direction from the typical Marvel formula. She has an all-star cast, and none really disappointed, but the writing and character arcs seemed weak.  Was this what Martin Scorsese was talking about when he said Marvel movies aren’t cinema? Is this why we have Eternals? Maybe this is the artistic answer.  Yes, Eternals studies the complexity of people and their contradictory natures. Yes, we get a closer look at how they can hurt one another and love one another, but even with all that, call me basic, I miss the old Marvel. I missed the euphoria and high of a really solid Marvel ride where I can’t wait for the next film. Eternals just didn’t do it for me. If I need an almost 3-hour Marvel film, Avengers: Endgame will be my pick. ",NEUTRAL

"Nov 4, 2021"," ETERNALS * (157 minutes) M
Oh, dear. What a blow. There was Space Jam: Legacy, secure in the knowledge that its icy grip on the glittering Worst $200 million Hollywood Film of the Year award would go unchallenged. Now along comes Eternals, the latest hollow epic from Hollywood as Marvel Studios raids the lower tiers of its roster of superheroes to squeeze out a yet another hollow, utterly forgettable FX-fuelled epic. Sluggishly directed with an astonishing lack of regard for clarity or pace by Chloé Zhao, Eternals is a thunderously dull bland-out stuffed with all the things we’ve seen quite enough of: fights with big-jawed monsters; eyes that shoot energy beams; self-important longueurs; an all-but-incomprehensible story. Seriously: enough.  At 157 minutes – that’s 10 minutes longer than Apocalypse Now – Eternals should also be known as The Film That Would Not End for its cumbersome attempt to deliver unto a weary, superhero-stuffed audience no fewer than 10 new superheroes. Lodged into human affairs in the year 5000BC by a giant, six-eyed, deep-voiced, barely intelligible God-like entity called  Arishem (looking uncannily like The Iron Giant), the Eternals are tasked with defending humanity against The Deviants. The Eternals team consists of (in no particular order): Sprite (Lia McHugh); Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani); Sersi (Gemma Chan); Ajak (Salma Hayek); Ikaris (Richard Madden); Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry); Makkari (Lauren Ridloff); Gilgamesh (Don Lee); Thena (Angelina Jolie); and Druig (Barry Keoghan). Tagging along with them in the modern era is Karun (Harish Patel), a business associate of Kingo, who has blended in to modern society by becoming a Bollywood star.  While the rest of the Eternals are trying to save humanity from a extinction level event – thank you Deep Impact! –  called “The Emergence” it is Karun’s job to tag along and video everything. But are the Deviants all that they seem? Are the Eternals all that they seem? They supposedly wiped the Deviants out long ago and have been patiently waiting thousands of years to be called home. Yet the Deviants have returned to wreak havoc. What gives? While trying to unpack its tangled narrative, the film also tries to impart enough information about each of the new superheroes to engage our emotional interest. No sale. The only one that vaguely comes close is Sprite, the youngest of the Eternals who pines for normal human life. The rest of the film is just a scramble of confusing exposition, not aided by all the time skipping the story, going backwards and forwards through history. Not helping the viewer experience are the film’s expensive boom-crash visuals that spew forth a cascade of rote effects that lack inventiveness and do nothing to build any tension or excitement. Again, there ain’t nothing here you haven’t seen before. And here’s a question: why has Marvel stuffed 10 new characters into one film? The studio has done so well with its TV shows, why on earth didn’t it do Eternals as a 10-part TV series, focusing on one character per episode? Surely Marvel could have covered that for the $200m it’s wasted on this dirge. But never mind all that. All anyone should be preoccupied with is how Eternals fits in to the oh-so-important framework of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, meticulously constructed by all the previous Marvel movies. We know of the devotion hardcore Marvel fans have to the franchise and they will no doubt expend much time and energy seeking out the data drops that places the film into the Marvel myth. To these ardent souls must be extended all goodwill and Godspeed. It is to them Marvel owes a debt that allows it to make terrific big-screen spectacles such as Thor 3 and Endgame as well as crank out films as terrible as Eternals.",NEGATIVE

"Nov 4, 2021"," Marvel Studios has a track record of recruiting auteur directors with a strong style into its fold. And it’s worked out (Taika Waititi, Ryan Coogler) more often than it hasn’t (Edgar Wright). Marvel swooped in on Zhao before she won her two Oscars for Nomadland, after her first two features, Songs My Brother Taught Me and The Rider.  Zhao’s creative vision relies on the majestic backdrops of grand landscapes and the emotional intimacy of small, human stories. There is nothing small about the MCU while its backdrops tend to be computer generated. So, the question is whether Zhao successfully imbued the latest Marvel movie with her aesthetic or if the Marvel machine flattened it. It’s a bit of both.  Zhao’s signature visuals and focus on emotional arcs is all through Eternals but that’s offset by too many over-the-top action sequences involving pyrotechnics and CGI monsters.  Part of the issue is that Eternals has a challenge like no other Marvel movie before it – and there have been 25 of them – in that it has to introduce a new ensemble and a convoluted mythology.  But it’s not just one or two new superheroes and their supporting sidekicks, it’s 10 superheroes, all with their own distinct powers, desires and fears, built up over 7000 years of human history. That is an almost insurmountable task if you think about the fact that by the time the first Avengers movie came out in 2012, there were only six superheroes and the vast majority had already had a solo adventure. But it still feels overstuffed, and even for an engaged audience who have spent 13 years theorising about infinity stones and mystical realms, the idea of immortal beings in the service of a Celestial called Arishem, is still a lot. With a huge cast of established and promising new stars, Eternals centres on a group of superpowered beings who have protected Earth for seven millennia, but only against one specific threat, monsters called Deviants, which look like enormous wire-art sculptures. They’re led by healer Ajak (Salma Hayek), and include Sersi (Gemma Chan), the Superman-like Ikaris (Richard Madden), Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), strongman Gilgamesh (Don Lee), speedster Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), illusionist Sprite (Lia McHugh), mind controller Druig (Barry Keoghan), Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry) and warrior Thena (Angelina Jolie). In the MCU, Eternals is set after the events of Avengers: Endgame and the return of half the world’s population. That energy set off something called “the emergence”, a threat to humanity. Sersi is the heart of the story, a superhero that even after thousands of years still has to find the strength from within to meet the great challenge ahead of them. She’s not torn between doing what’s right and what’s not, she still has to work out what that is. The relationship between her and Ikaris – one of many pairings that help to ground the character arcs – is a millennia-spanning grand romance not seen before in the MCU, which gives way to Marvel’s first proper sex scene. There are lots of firsts in Eternals – the first deaf character, the first named gay character, the first female Asian lead – but its real delights lie in the exquisite character moments set against real-life landscapes.  The production shot on location and built physical sets. There’s a texture to scenes and to the light that you can’t recreate in front of a green screen. Those moments are Eternals’ strongest.  But even as they linger, held for longer than you would expect in a superhero blockbuster, the action far too frequently inevitably shifts back to CGI monsters and laser beams. Both a great sports movie and unconventionally riveting romantic drama, Challengers volleys the audience back and forth to reveal what is riding on a tennis match, writes Leigh Paatsch.",NEUTRAL
"Nov 4, 2021"," It is both trite and true to proclaim that “Eternals” may as well reference the perceived running time of the latest entry in the latest phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, one bolstered thus far more by its Disney+ television series than its silver screen fare. Clocking in at a beefy 157 minutes, “Eternals” is engorged on a hefty cast and storyline that literally spans 7,000 years of actual and fictitious history. It is no small wonder, then, that writer-director Chloé Zhao — whose indie film bona fides include the Oscar-winning “Nomadland” — manages to forge this hefty spectacle about gods and monsters into one of the most human Marvel films to date. Still, the seams of this unwieldy amalgam are showing and stretched. As adroit as Zhao is at the film’s indie elements, she is just as clumsy and/or disinterested at building the necessary foundation of a superhero action movie. Thousands of years ago, the titular immortals, led by matriarch and healer Ajak (Salma Hayek), were sent to Earth by omnipotent celestial Arishem the Judge, tasked with protecting the planet from a species of space creatures called the Deviants. Even after seemingly eradicating the Deviants, the Eternals remain on terra firma, blending in with humans while also splintering from each other. In the most notable of numerous narrative and moral inconsistencies, the Eternals are forbidden from interfering with human events, including the most brutal bloodshed, yet they nudge along human evolution, particularly technological advances honed by tech whiz Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry). So, the petulant Druig (Barry Keoghan), who can control the minds of others, goes off to live in a jungle commune populated by his manipulated minions. Super-fast Makkari (Lauren Ridloff) choses to live by herself in the Eternals’ spaceship, waiting for the day they can leave for home. Super-strong Gilgamesh (Don Lee) goes into exile to babysit warrior goddess Thena (Angelina Jolie), who is going insane under the weight of many millennia of thoughts. The fire-shooting Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani) becomes a Bollywood star. The empathetic Sersi (Gemma Chan), who can transmute inanimate objects, has a centuries-long romance with Ikaris (Richard Madden), this comic’s Superman analog, before splitting and living alongside BFF Sprite (Lia McHugh), who can project illusions but is forever trapped in the body of a 12-year-old child. Skip ahead to the post-Thanos era — speaking of which, the pregnant question of why these all-powerful beings stood by when half the universe disappeared is off-handedly chalked up to a non-interference pact that they otherwise regularly ignore. The Eternals band back together after the Deviants reappear, including their Ultron-esque leader who can absorb the powers of slain Eternals — not nearly enough is made as this snarling beast gradually morphs into a sentient, self-aware foe. But the real dividing lines form between Eternals dedicated to the preservation of humankind and those duty-bound to their true mission, which essentially rests on Earth being a giant egg and earthlings being cultivated to overpopulate until they’re not needed anymore. The argument is that sacrificing billions would give life to many billions more throughout the universe, a very “Watchmen”-like moral quandary for this broken superhero family. That leads to emotional conflict built around genuine stakes, as each Eternal must also face questions about their own origins and purpose. There is also a tantalizing New vs. Old Testament schism between archangels ready to sacrifice themselves to save the human race and those blindly devoted to God’s wrath. But it is all punctuated by plot holes and lackluster action sequences layered atop unconvincing CGI, lumbering along for so long you forget what it was all about. Although on a very different scale, “Eternals” shares a quality with Zhao’s “Nomadland”: it is at once both overly convoluted and oversimplistic.",POSITIVE
"Nov 4, 2021"," Marvel’s Eternals introduces a group of 10 immortal superheroes who’ve been charged by a Celestial with protecting Earth. Over the centuries, these powerful beings have stepped up and saved lives during fires, floods, hurricanes, pandemics, and wars. Wait … no, they haven’t. They kept billions from perishing by stopping Thanos from snapping away half the world’s population. No … actually, they didn’t lift a finger. When it comes down to it, they’re nowhere to be seen when the Earth is in trouble. And, with exception of one or two, they don’t seem all that special. So why do these particular superheroes deserve their own film? Unfortunately, it’s possible to sit through a screening of Marvel’s Eternals and never have that questioned answered. These ageless beings have spent 7,000 years on our planet, remaining on the sidelines except for when their mortal enemies – grotesque creatures known as Deviants – rear their hideous heads. After believing Deviants had been wiped out, the Eternals went their separate ways. Some attempted to blend in, others kept to themselves, and one – Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani) – opted to become a famous Bollywood star because why not? The sudden reappearance of Deviants forces the Eternals to reunite which in turn forces the audience to sit through what feels like never-ending expository flashbacks meant to explain what each Eternal has been up to since the last time they fought together as a Deviant-crushing team. These flashbacks reveal the personal dynamics of the team, the cliques within the larger group, and the romantic relationship between Ikaris (Richard Madden), the guy who thinks he should be the group’s leader, and Sersi (Gemma Chan), the woman who truly deserves to be in charge following the death of their official leader. Once the team’s reunited, secrets are exposed, jealousy rears its ugly head, and the truth behind why the Eternals have been on Earth for thousands of years is finally revealed. And that, of course, all leads to the fate of humanity resting in the hands of a powerful, extremely dysfunctional “family.” For nearly every superpower on display in Eternals, there’s already been a character on screen with a similar power brought to life in a much more impressive manner. We’ve seen speedsters, guys who can fly, heroes who can cast illusions, super strong superheroes, and ones who shoot laser beams out of their eyes. The laser-shooting Eternals can’t hold a candle to The Boys’ Homelander, played by Antony Starr, and even The CW’s The Flash offers better speedster effects than this big-budget debacle. Oscar-winning director Chloé Zhao (Nomadland) did an excellent job of making sure this large ensemble is one of the most ethnically diverse in Marvel’s cinematic history. The film also features the first openly gay character of the MCU, Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), as well as a lead character, Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), who’s deaf. It’s way past time but bravo for this inclusivity finally happening in the MCU. Representation matters and it’s great to see the MCU taking more steps toward ensuring kids can see superheroes they can relate to on the screen. Unfortunately, Zhao did a less impressive job in giving this diverse cast anything meaty to work with. (Zhao is a co-writer along with Ryan Firpo, Kaz Firpo, and Patrick Burleigh.) The plot seems unnecessarily convoluted and there are far too many characters to introduce all at once. The sheer number of main characters means even with time devoted to each of their backstories, only a few emerge as completely fleshed out and with engaging personalities. There are suggestions of infinitely more interesting storylines buried in the flashbacks, and the idea of these beings existing on Earth for 7,000 years and witnessing the evolution of humans is fascinating but barely touched upon. Among an ensemble that includes Richard Madden, Angelina Jolie, Kit Harington (a scene-stealer in his few onscreen appearances), Lia McHugh, Lauren Ridloff, Barry Keoghan, Don Lee, Harish Patel, and Salma Hayek, it’s Gemma Chan’s Sersi who goes through the biggest transformational journey and becomes the heart and soul of the Eternals. Brian Tyree Henry is also a standout, giving multiple layers to Phastos – a tech wizard who regrets introducing technology that’s been abused by humans. And Kumail Nanjiani can be credited with injecting a little fun into Eternals. Without Nanjiani nailing the job of comic relief, Eternals would be completely lifeless. There’s a lack of energy throughout and even the fight scenes between the Eternals and the CGI monsters don’t feel dynamic. The pacing’s off, the constant jumping between past and present doesn’t help the flow of the story, and none of the set pieces leap off the screen. Director Zhao is a formidable filmmaker, but Eternals isn’t one of her finer efforts. Even an impressive cast can’t overcome the film’s major flaws including the lack of a compelling story. Superhero movies have been called a lot of things but boring isn’t usually a label included in descriptions. Until now.",NEGATIVE

"Nov 3, 2021"," Jack Kirby, creador de mitos de la cultura pop y ardiente amante de las mitologías antiguas, creó los Eternals de Marvel en 1976; al hacerlo, se sirvió alegremente del tesoro de dioses y relatos heroicos de diversas culturas, pero también jugó con la teoría de los antiguos alienígenas que circula desde 1968, cuando Erich von Däniken especuló sobre la influencia de los visitantes extraterrestres en las primeras civilizaciones en su Memorias del Futuro. El propio Kirby mostró poco interés en vincular narrativamente a los Eternals con el resto del universo Marvel; de ello se encargaron autores posteriores, entre ellos Neil Gaiman en 2006, que devolvió a los comparativamente impopulares Eternals al radar de los fans de Marvel junto con el dibujante John Romita Jr. Durante milenios, los Eternals Ajak (Salma Hayek), Druig (Barry Keoghan), Gilgamesh (Don Lee), Ikaris (Richard Madden), Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), Sersi (Gemma Chan), Sprite (Lia McHugh) y Thena (Angelina Jolie) han estado vagando por el planeta Olimpia. El objetivo: proteger a los humanos de los Desviantes, poderosos monstruos que quieren destruirlo todo. Pero en algún momento los archienemigos fueron derrotados, la tarea de los héroes y heroínas está cumplida. Y así siguieron sus caminos por separado, todos en busca de un nuevo propósito. Sin embargo, para su gran sorpresa, en algún momento deben enterarse de que los Desviantes han vuelto, más fuertes que nunca. Y sólo juntos podrán detenerlos. Pero eso no es tan fácil, porque mientras tanto los diez no sólo se han separado como grupo, también llevan vidas completamente diferentes. Hay que reconocérselo a Marvel, impresiona recolectando talentos que han podido atraer para su propio universo cinematográfico. Esto no sólo se aplica a las numerosas estrellas que están delante de la cámara y que hacen que sus películas sean importantes, también hay conocidos cineastas detrás de la cámara. Entre ellos se encuentran aquellos que uno no asociaría con las adaptaciones de cómics a primera vista, ya sea el experto en terror Scott Derrickson (Sinister, Doctor Strange) o Ryan Coogler (Fruitvale Station, Black Panther), especializado en dramas sociales. Más inesperado aún fue el fichaje de Chloé Zhao.  Ahora la respuesta está al alcance de la mano. Se llama Eternals y es algo aleccionador, al menos si se mide con las expectativas galácticas. Claro, nadie podía esperar seriamente que la directora de origen chino mantuviera su estilo típico completamente inalterado. Al fin y al cabo, Marvel está al servicio de las masas, no del público de los festivales de arte y ensayo. Y estas masas quieren espectáculos técnicos, gore a gran escala, y alguna que otra ocurrencia desenfadada entre medias. Que el mundo esté a punto de acabarse no significa que tengas que perder el buen humor, sobre todo, porque al final todo acaba bien, como todo el mundo sabe en el cine. Al fin y al cabo, las películas están pensadas para entretener, ante todo. De los aspectos deprimentes del exterior deberían ocuparse otros. No obstante, resulta algo decepcionante la poca frecuencia con la que Zhao tiene la oportunidad de utilizar realmente sus habilidades especiales. Por ejemplo, llaman la atención los constantes saltos temporales y los cambios de ubicación. A veces, el itinerario incluye el Londres actual, luego nos abrimos paso a través de la selva unos siglos antes, de repente nos encontramos de nuevo en un desierto, para luego lamentar una Hiroshima destruida en 1945. Muchas de las escenas sólo duran unos minutos, algunas ni siquiera eso. Por un lado, esto hace que Eternals sea muy variada visualmente y también hace que la película resulte en cierto modo cansina, sobre todo porque la duración de más de dos horas y media es de nuevo muy excesiva. Han intentado meter toda una serie en la película, lo cual es mucho y poco al mismo tiempo. En relación con esto, hay un enfoque inusualmente fuerte en los personajes. El equipo recién reunido está formado por no menos de diez hombres y mujeres, con unos cuantos personajes periféricos a su alrededor, entre ellos Harish Patel como el cómico compañero Karun, el representante de Kingo. Y al menos Zhao tiene mucho que decir sobre los personajes principales. El resultado es como si Eternals fuera una mezcla de Los Vengadores y las películas en solitario, todo en uno, quizás esto es un poco exagerado. Pero, al mismo tiempo, éste es también el aspecto más interesante de la película, porque dentro de la algarabía hay mucha humanidad. Aunque los diez tienen la misma misión y han viajado juntos a la Tierra, su trato con la gente les ha llevado por caminos muy diferentes. Chloé Zhao y sus coautores no utilizan una plantilla de historia específica, sino que amalgaman elementos de diferentes cómics en Eternals. Su historia encaja en la continuidad del MCU, pero muestra menos interés en tantear horizontalmente a las otras películas y series, sino que se deleita en expandir el complejo universo verticalmente, hacia las profundidades de la historia de la humanidad: el prólogo no es la única excursión histórica que ilumina la historia de fondo de los Eternals, por la que va desde la costa mesopotámica en el 5000 a.C. hasta la antigua Babilonia con su Puerta de Ishtar y a la metrópolis azteca de Tenochtitlan, conquistada y arrasada  por los españoles en el siglo XVI y la nube de hongo atómico sobre Hiroshima en 1945. A lo largo de los 157 minutos de película, se respira el aliento épico de los milenios, por lo que los flashbacks no sólo son una oportunidad para mostrar valores cinematográficos interesantes, sino que también sirven para desarrollar la relación de los Eternals con el pueblo y con su propio papel de protectores, porque en algún momento esta relación empieza a ser difícil y controvertida. Por eso, los Eternals en el presente narrativo hace tiempo que dejaron de ser un grupo cohesionado. La tarea de presentar un conjunto heroico de diez personajes (ninguno de los cuales ha tenido una película en solitario antes, a diferencia de Los Vengadores) necesariamente cuadra el círculo: dar a todos los personajes un perfil distintivo es simplemente imposible. Los guionistas reaccionan a esto sin ni siquiera intentarlo, sino estableciendo prioridades: Sersi proporciona el centro emocional; Ikaris, con la que todavía tiene sentimientos incluso después de una ruptura, es su fuente más importante de fricción, y a su alrededor los otros Eternals, enfáticamente diversos -incluyendo una persona  sorda y un personaje homosexual- funcionan como personajes secundarios, Algunos de ellos proporcionan alivio cómico (especialmente Kingo, interpretado por Kumail Nanjiani, que ha aprovechado su retiro de los Eternals para escribir la historia del cine como una dinastía de Bollywood de un solo hombre), otros son los talones de Aquiles internos que garantizan que el equipo desarrolle debilidades, de las que luego se puede extraer la tensión potencial. Thena, por ejemplo, padece la enfermedad de los Eternos Mahd Wy'ry, una especie de delirio causado por demasiados recuerdos acumulados, y Sprite lucha contra su incapacidad para crecer. Por momentos, esto podría resultar doloroso y triste y uno desearía que a Zhao se le hubiera permitido hacer un drama existencial de superhéroes en lugar de presentar este extraño compromiso. El hecho de que la historia sea en parte algo fuera de foco y que los personajes no siempre se comporten de forma verosímil sólo para que la trama pueda avanzar tampoco ayuda a tomarse la película a pecho. Sin embargo, la hostilidad, a veces desagradable, que recibe Eternals no está justificada en la forma que adopta. Porque, aunque el experimento de combinar el cine comercial con la sensibilidad indie no haya funcionado del todo, hay varias escenas que merecen la pena ser vistas. Y al menos, para algunos de los personajes, sería deseable que volvieran a la gran pantalla en el futuro. Rubén Peralta Rigaud nació en Santo Domingo en 1980.

"Nov 3, 2021"," The movie's themes include the conflict between sacrificing the few for the many and understanding that humanity is responsible for unthinkable violence but also great beauty, art, and curiosity. When you love something, you protect it. The story encourages teamwork, empathy, compassion, and unconditional love. The Eternals love and respect one another, even when they disagree. Central characters willingly put themselves in dangerous situations to save humanity/defeat villains. Gilgamesh selflessly cares for Thena, who is brave, fierce, and loyal. Sersi is compassionate and empathetic. Sprite is clever and quick-witted. Ikaris is devoted and faithful to his cause. Druig prioritizes peace. Kingo is entertaining and ambitious. Makkari is courageous and well-read. Dane is loyal to Sersi. A few characters are willing to do something immoral in order to stay faithful to their mission/do what they think is right in the end. The ensemble is racially and ethnically diverse; Asian, Latinx, Black, White, and deaf actors are authentically represented (their characters are aliens). Characters use sign language to communicate. Phastos is the first openly gay hero in the MCU. The Eternals use their superpowers and superweapons to defeat scary, aggressive monsters known as Deviants (one of which eats a parent in front of a child in the movie's opening scene); some goopy gore when they're killed. Characters are injured but usually healed (or can heal themselves). Human bystanders are killed by the fighting between Eternals and Deviants. Gun and knife use. The Eternals witness soldiers committing genocide during the Aztec Empire. The bombing of Hiroshima is shown, along with its afermath. Global earthquake, volcano eruption. Spoiler alert: Main characters die/are killed, and Earth is threatened with total destruction. Adults exchange lingering looks, kisses, and embraces. There's one love scene that shows bare shoulders/backs and passionate kissing; sex is clearly implied. A married couple kisses farewell. Another couple never kisses but flirts and hugs. An Eternal who's perpetually young complains about not being old enough to experience love (and has an overt crush on an older team member). One relationship is loving and affectionate (the two characters have lived together for centuries) but not overtly romantic. Adults drink beer at a party and liquor on a plane. Gilgamesh offers other characters mead, ale, and homemade liquor fermented with spit. A character in a post-credits scene seems drunk. Joke about being drunk. Parents need to know that Eternals is an epic-scale Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) adventure directed by Oscar-winning writer-director Chloé Zhao. It focuses on a team of ancient aliens who emerge after the events of Avengers: Endgame to battle the monstrous Deviants they thought they had defeated long ago. With a cast that includes Gemma Chan, Kumail Nanjiani, Salma Hayek, and more, this is one of the MCU's most diverse outings; it features the franchise's first deaf character and first openly gay hero. It's also arguably the MCU's most mature and character-driven film to date. It has themes of sacrifice, unconditional love, and teamwork, but also far more romance than usual -- including the MCU's first on-screen love scene (naked shoulders and all) -- and very scary creatures, one of whom eats a parent in front of his child in the movie's opening scene. While there are lots of talking scenes, action violence is also frequent and often devastating, both in a large-scale way (genocide, natural disasters, destruction) and an intimate one (betrayal, loss, grief). Weapons are used, and spoiler alert! main characters die/are killed. Language includes occasional but not frequent use of ""s--t"" ""ass,"" ""hell,"" etc., and characters drink socially. To stay in the loop on more movies like this, you can sign up for weekly Family Movie Night emails. In Marvel's ETERNALS, a prologue explains how Earth (and presumably every other planet in the universe) was created by planet-sized life-bringing acient beings called Celestials -- who were soon thwarted by monstrous beings called Deviants. So the all-powerful Celestials fashioned a supernatural, immortal group of guardians called Eternals to battle the Deviants. The Earth-assigned Eternals, led by Ajak (Salma Hayek), spend millennia killing Deviants, but some of the team begins to wonder whether their mission of not getting involved in human affairs and advancement is wise. After the last Deviant is killed, Ajak allows her subordinates -- including Sersi (Gemma Chan), Ikaris (Richard Madden), Thena (Angelina Jolie), Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), Gilgamesh (Ma Dong-seok), Druig (Barry Keogh), Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), and Sprite (Lia McHugh) -- to go their separate ways, although a few live undercover together. Centuries later, in the present day, a Deviant resurfaces, forcing the now-estranged crew to reunite after a tragedy. Together, they must decide whether to stay true to the Celestials' mission or intervene on humanity's behalf. Oscar-winning filmmaker Chloé Zhao is a gifted director, but this crowded, overly expository Marvel entry doesn't quite come together, despite impressive visuals and an excellent, diverse cast. The MCU has never shied away from big ensembles, particularly in the Avengers movies or Guardians of the Galaxy, but it's difficult to feel invested in all 10 of the Eternals' character arcs when the screenplay centers on empathetic Sersi, who was once married to Ikaris but was at some point abandoned and, centuries later, is now with a new beau, human teacher Dane (Kit Harington). She and the inexpicably younger-than-everyone else Sprite (who's forever an adolescent, while the rest of the Eternals are adults) are sisterly, and the movie positions them -- and the Superman-meets-Captain America-like Ikaris -- as the ""main"" Eternals. The movie's plot is fairly straightforward, so the real tension is in the relationship dynamics, since each Eternal has a different level of faith in their original mission. The most fun in this overwhelmingly serious film is when the movie reintroduces Kingo, who has played four generations of Bollywood superstars in India. Nanjani brings welcome comic relief to a surprisingly somber story. Harington's Dane is also entertaining, especially after he discovers the truth about his girlfriend's past (accepting it with a calm that makes sense, considering this is a universe that survived Thanos' Snap). It's difficult to discuss the cast without mentioning something obvious for anyone who watched or is familiar with HBO's hit series Game of Thrones: In Eternals, the one-time Stark brothers (Madden and Harington) reunite on screen and are both in love with the same woman, who is named Sersi (yes, it sounds exactly like Cersei). Watching the men who played the King in the North and Jon Snow say ""I love you, Sersi"" is just trippy enough to take viewers out of the moment. A casting director (or Zhao herself) was either clever or misguided with that coincidence. Audiences might also wind up with unanswered questions about the nature of some of the other characters' relationships. The only Eternal who has a fulfilling traditional life in the present is Phastos, Marvel's first openly gay hero, whose husband and son are another highlight of the occasionally rambling drama. There are definitely rousing action and set-piece battle sequences, but this is a film primarily about relationships that doesn't quite hit the mark, despite all of the attractive, talented actors making heartfelt speeches to one another. Families can talk about the various forms of representation in Eternals. Why do diverse representations (not just racial/ethnic, but also age, sexual orientation, and disability) matter? Which forms of representation seem authentic/organic to the movie's story? Are there any that you think could have been improved? How does the amount of romance in this movie compare to the love stories in other Marvel movies? Was it surprising to see an on-camera love scene in an MCU film?  The movie has a large cast. Did you feel like all of the characters got equal treatment? Which ones do you feel should have been more prominently featured? Did anyone's story get short shrift? How do you feel about the Eternals' mission and their directive to not get involved with humanity's progress other than to protect them from the Deviants?

"Nov 3, 2021"," The first genuinely bad film from Marvel Films, Chloe Zhao’s “Eternals” is a colossal bore, a bloated, meandering super-hero odyssey that’s intended to serve as the foundation for the studio’s next extended epic.  It will serve as a rocky underpinning what with indistinctive characters, a purpose that lacks direction and a tenuous connection to the rest of the company’s extended universe.  To be sure, the plans Marvel has previously put into motion have proved to be a masterstroke of narrative interconnectivity that’s set a standard other studios have failed to duplicate, so it’s too early to cast judgement on their next epic. But there’s no question, phase four is off to a rocky start. Based on the Jack Kirby comic book, the title characters are 10 godlike creatures charged with protecting the cosmos from The Deviants, sinewy, dragon-like creatures that look like they escaped from a rudimentary programmer’s laptop. (Perhaps the biggest surprise is how cheap these creatures look from a studio that prides itself on slickly produced special effects).  This duty takes them to Earth, a place they fall in love with and vow to protect, despite the objections of their creators, The Celestials. Hiding in plain sight, these demigods watch over the planet and its inhabitants from 5,000 BC to the present day, protecting but not interfering with major historical events that shape the race.  Having finally vanquished the Deviants during the Middle Ages, the members of the group have gone their separate ways but when their ancient foes reappear in modern London and other spots, they must reunite to combat them. And who are the members of the team? Well, that’s part of the problem as the 10 characters are, because of their sheer number and the fact they’re all introduced at once, hard to keep track of, some making an impression, most of them not. Ajax (Salma Hayek), is their leader, Sirse (stand-out Gemma Chan) and Ikaris (Richard Madden) have been in an on-again-off-again thousand years romance, Kingo (Kumail Nanjinai) is the comic relief, Gilgamesh (Ma Dong-seok) provides the muscle, Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry) is a master inventor, Makkari (Lauren Ridloff) is mute but very fast, Druig (Barry Keoghan) controls minds, Thena (a sleepwalking Angelina Jolie) is a fierce warrior and Sprite (Lia McHugh) is a bitter, eternal child.  Laser beams shot from eyes, shapeshifting, flight and teleportation are among the variety of powers the group employs to vanquish evil. Far too long at nearly two hours and forty minutes, the film ratchets back and forth on a 7,000-year timeline, resulting in a disjointed affair that never finds its footing. It takes 90 minutes to get the band back together and by the time that occurs, you’ll have ceased to care about why they’re reuniting. What’s most frustrating is the plot twist that’s revealed early in the third act is a genuine stunner, one that knocks you and the characters back on their heels, forcing them to reevaluate all they’ve done and their purpose in the universe. However, before it and its ramifications can be fully explored, an over-blown, special effects laden throwdown that’s apparently required in movies of this sort takes place, wasting a prime opportunity to delve deeper into these vague characters. At the end of the film when it’s promised the Eternals will return, I took it more as a threat than something to anticipate. Hopefully during the second go-around more time will be taken to flesh out these characters, in order to generate some empathy.  Without that, all the action scenes in the world mean nothing.",NEUTRAL
"Nov 3, 2021"," ¿Qué queremos de una película de superhéroes? O mejor dicho, ¿Qué esperamos de una película de Marvel Studios a estas alturas? Mucho mencionamos “La Formula Marvel” para describir contenido producido por ellos, y otros, no porque sea malo o buena sino sencillamente porque eso nos dice que esperar. Al menos yo lo hago así. Y funciona. La usan y la seguirán usando mientras siga dando multimillonarios resultados. Especialmente ahora que estrenan su primer filme relativamente alejado lo más posible de “la formula” con mixtos resultados. Hay una buena película de 90 minutos enterrada dentro de las dos horas y media de Eternals. Lo mejor que puedo decir de esta nueva oferta de Marvel Studios, es que servirá para debatir si el género de superhéroes genuinamente es capaz de darnos más allá de lo mismo de siempre. Y si la respuesta es “no” pues, ¿es eso tan malo? Lo mínimo que le pido a cualquier contenido es que no me aburra, y si no cumple con eso, pues al menos que sea por buenas razones. Aquí ni una ni la otra. No puedo decir que Eternals es una mala película, porque no lo es. Es simplemente…blah. Salí de Eternals pensando en la Hulk del 2003, no solamente por ambas ser hechas por directores recién salidos de una aclamada película, sino porque ambas tienen mucho que decir sobre la humanidad, y el heroísmo, pero ninguna logró encontrar el tono apropiado para hacerlo. El primer gran problema de Eternals es precisamente ser parte de un gigantesco universo cinemático que ya ha ido al cosmos, y ahora hasta otros universos. Despues de todo lo que ha pasado, tenemos que aceptar que un grupo de 10 poderosos extraterrestres llevan viviendo en la Tierra desde hace 7,000 años pero nunca habíamos visto nada, porque fueron creados por una raza superior llamada “Celestiales” para combatir otra raza superior de criaturas creadas por computadora llamada “Los Desviados”, y durante todo ese tiempo se mantuvieron escondidos, porque su regla primaria es no interferir en asuntos humanos, a menos que los Desviados fueran parte. Que se chave el chasquido de Thanos, la guerra civil de Tony contra Steve, o una ciudad entera cayendo del cielo, hay que obedecer la regla. Si no hay lagartija gigante en CGI, no nos importa. Seguro, los eternos doblaron esa regla las suficientes veces para dejar evidencia de su estadía largo plaza en nuestro planeta, incluyendo quedar plasmados en distintas mitologías, pero lo importante es que los humanos usamos esos desastres para progresar… ¿cierto? ¿Recuerdan cuando estrenó Justice League y una de las mayores quejas es que hicieron una película de equipo demasiado rápido sin que la gente conociera bien los personajes? Ahora imagínense lo mismo, pero con personajes que realmente nadie conoce. Seguro, hay arquetipos familiares; Ikaris (Richard Madden) es el Superman, Thena (Angelina Jolie) es la Mujer Maravilla, Makkari (Laura Ridloff) es como Flash, y los demás con características a lo Batman o Hulk o parecidos. No todos, pero algunos merecían su propia historia. El tema de la inmortalidad puede ser sumamente interesante cuando se aplican variables; ¿vale la pena vivir para siempre cuando tienes severos problemas mentales? ¿O sin poder amar porque la única persona que quieres no te desea? ¿Merece la humanidad su libertad de voluntad? ¿Tener poderes te da derecho sobre la vida de otros? Nada de eso importa, porque Eternals eventualmente tiene que volver a ser una película de superhéroes, con batallas entre personajes disparando energía de las manos o los ojos contra pajarracos computadorizados. Entre medio hay mucha, mucha (¿ya dije mucha?) conversación sobre cosas del espacio, filosofía monga y discusiones sobre cuanto vale la pena pelear por nosotros miserables mortales. Hay varios momentos decentes en Eternals, y algunos personajes son más agradables que otros para pasar más rato con ellos si pudiera, pero este filme intenta hacer tanto, que eventualmente se queda corto, con todo y su larga duración.

"Nov 3, 2021"," Over time, Eternals may become my favorite entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Not best, mind you — it’s too scrappily chaotic for that to happen. But unlike so many of the other films that make up the bulk of this interconnected comic book series, this one is built on a foundation of big ideas and creative imagination. It is weird yet personal, unwieldy yet emotionally focused, making this ambitious sci-fi fantasy an invigorating time-bending travelogue I couldn’t take my eyes off of. Academy Award-winning Nomadland director Chloé Zhao is a strange choice to take the reins of a Marvel opus, and it seems clear to me that there had to be at least some bickering between the filmmaker and the studio as to what the finished product was going to look like. Zhao’s down-to-earth, quietly humanistic approach is immediately at odds with the typical candy-colored bombast of most MCU ventures. Because of that, not all of the visual and narrative elements comfortably fit together. No matter. Zhao, working with co-writers Patrick Burleigh, Ryan Firpo and Kaz Firpo, has taken comic impresario Jack Kirby’s certifiably peculiar source material and put her own indelible stamp upon it. Much of Ben Davis’ (Captain Marvel) richly minimalistic cinematography is reminiscent of the director’s past endeavors like The Rider. The use of natural light and practical sets — not to mention actual outdoor locations — is notable. This allows the various characters inhabiting the tale to be authentic, even with their intergalactic origins and godly superpowers. More exciting are the themes Zhao explores. Issues pertaining to mortality, divinity, faith, family, friendship, gender and love are all plumbed. The biggest of these is a conundrum of epic proportions that potentially affects entire galaxies, not just the planet Earth or its human population. Questions of life and death lead directly to the birth of new worlds and fresh civilizations, destruction and creation walking apocalyptically hand in hand. There is a lot of plot, and Zhao is unable to make cohesive sense out of all of it. The short version is that, 7,000 years ago, a group of otherworldly beings, the Eternals, was sent to Earth by the powerful Celestial Arishem (voiced by David Kay) to assist the newborn human population in their growth as a species. They are also there to fight against Deviants, powerful creatures that devour all they encounter. After completing this protective task, and once humanity has reached a point at which it can continue to independently evolve as a species, the Eternals are to sit on the sidelines and observe until Arishem calls them back home. They are led by the maternally wise Ajak (Salma Hayek) who has the power to heal. After that, there are warriors Ikaris (Richard Madden), Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), Gilgamesh (Don Lee) and Thena (Angelina Jolie), each with their own unique ability to combat Deviants. There is also the sorceress Sersi (Gemma Chan), who can transmute inanimate matter, the pint-sized illusionist Sprite (Lia McHugh), speedster Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), mind-controlling telepath Druig (Barry Keoghan) and master craftsman Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), whose inventions will inspire humanity to new technological heights over the coming centuries. While jumping back and forth through history, the crux of the plot takes place right after the events of Avengers: Endgame. While Tony Stark’s sacrifice brought back everyone Thanos had originally snapped out of existence, it also inadvertently brought about an apocalyptic event known as “The Emergence.” In seven days the Earth will be destroyed for new planets to be created; the Eternals must decide if they will allow this to happen or if they will instead disobey Arishem’s nonintervention edict and protect this species they have grown to love. Most of this revolves around Sersi, and Chan is up to the challenge of placing this massive epic upon her shoulders. After having done such a splendid job of seductively stealing so much of Crazy Rich Asians, she bursts forth as a major star here. Chan’s emotional convolutions are palpable, and I thoroughly enjoyed watching her physically and internally wrestle with the ramifications of her character’s decisions. As for the rest of the ensemble, Lee, Jolie, Nanjiani and Henry are the chief standouts each putting an indelible stamp on the proceedings. The rest are also quite good in their respective roles; they just don’t always get the opportunity to shine the same way their costars do. Madden might be the only one I slightly question, but that has more to do with the way Ikaris is so frustratingly written than anything else. But the actor does what he can, and it should be noted that his fiery chemistry with Chan burns right through the screen. My core issues are the moments when Zhao has to bow to MCU convention. While the visual effects are as solid as ever, because of the realistic, lived-in shooting style, the sudden bursts of computer-generated augmentation can’t help but stand out. Rich, lifelike colors give way to a digitized video game aesthetic that’s jarring, and I cannot say I found any of it appealing. Then there are the actual superheroics. It does not help that many of this team’s powers resemble those utilized by the X-Men, making comparisons between this group of Eternals and the students at Professor Xavier’s School for Gifted Youngsters almost unavoidable. With rare exception, their battles against the Deviants aren’t very memorable, and save for a climactic clash featuring Thena and a particularly crafty adversary, my excitement level during these moments never ascended all that high. Like almost all entries in the MCU, there’s too much time spent on foreshadowing and not nearly enough on closing out this specific story as its own thing. The last few minutes emit serious Guardians of the Galaxy vibes, and as much as I enjoy both of those two James Gunn–directed adventures, this is still a tonal shift I did not jibe with. But I like these characters. I responded to their existential quandaries. I loved the sometimes ugly and unpleasant ways they were all forced to work out their differences. They felt like a real family, their collective messiness making each one of them all the more genuine. It is through their internal disagreements that hard, unbreakable truth can be found, and that is the core dynamic that kept me wanting to see what was going to happen next no matter what else may have been going on. Eternals shoots for the stars, and if the finished feature isn’t quite out of this world, it’s still close enough to getting there that my interest in seeing where these characters go next is exceedingly high.

"Nov 3, 2021"," Of the many problems with ""Eternals,"" that's the most glaring one. Superhero posse cuts are, of course, the goal of today's comic book franchise machines: there are three ""Avengers"" movies in the Top 10 grossers of all-time, and a fourth one sits at No. 11. But those were culminations of long projects, built up to after numerous individual chapters, not starting points. Had Marvel just gone out and started with ""The Avengers,"" the results most likely would have been different.  And ""Eternals"" is no ""Avengers,"" just as the Eternals are no Avengers. This isn't Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, the Hulk and the rest of the troop, this is (checks notes) Kingo, Ikaris, Sprite, Phastos, Ajak, Thena and Druig. After awhile, they don't even sound like names anymore. This isn't a who's who of superheroes, it's more of just a, ""who?"" And that's just the characters. ""Eternals"" presents a clunky storyline, an inconsistent mood, flat action and confusing world building. You know that feeling when a movie is really humming along, gaining momentum from scene to scene, and everything just sort of falls into place? That never happens in ""Eternals."" It starts off rocky and never finds its footing. The Eternals each have their own superpowers, from superspeed to power of flight, and are led by Salma Hayek's Ajak, who is the sage spiritual leader of the gang. Physically, the most powerful Eternal is Ikaris (Richard Madden, who looks a lot like Sebastian Stan, who is already in the Marvel Cinematic Universe), whose ability to fly and shoot powerful beams from his eyes earns him comparisons to Superman. (Ikaris rebuffs the connection, noting he doesn't wear a cape.) There's Thena (Angelina Jolie), who is able to whip up weapons out of thin air, Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani) can shoot fireball-like beams of energy from his hands, and Gilgamesh (Don Lee) possesses super strength, as well as a close bond with Thena. There's also Druig (Barry Keoghan), who can manipulate people with his mind; Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), who would give the Flash a run for his money in a footrace; Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), a genius tech expert and inventor; Sprite (Lia McHugh), who can project illusions and fool people into believing they're real; and Sersi (Gemma Chan), who can turn inanimate objects into whatever she wants, such as a speeding bus barreling toward her into a pile of harmless flower petals. Got all that? Hope so, because we've barely met the Eternals before there's trouble in their ranks: after a significant member of the group is killed — those dang Deviants are on the attack — the squad begins to splinter, and Ikaris turns heel. It's up to the others to stop him, which isn't easy since, well, cape aside, he's basically Superman.  ""Eternals"" is also about the individual lives of the members outside of their superhero duties, their interpersonal relationships, and their extracurricular activities. Kingo is a vain Bollywood superstar with a manager-type, Karun (Harish Patel) who follows him around, filming footage for a documentary, an attempt at comic relief which mostly comes up short. Makkari is deaf, and communicates with her fellow superheroes using sign language. Sersi is dating Dane (Kit Harington), who doesn't know the ins and outs of her whole, er, immortal superhero thing. And in an MCU first, Phastos is gay, and significant screen time is given to his domestic life at home with his husband, Ben (Haaz Sleiman).  Again, a lot going on, and Oscar-winning director Chloé Zhao (""Nomadland"") strives to make ""Eternals"" the most diverse, representative group of superheroes ever assembled on screen. And she achieves that goal, but it comes at the expense of a story that frequently sputters and never finds a decent rhythm. The narrative regularly time hops, bouncing between the present, ancient times, early civilization and other dates throughout the last 500 years, rarely staying in any place for long enough for it to matter. And because the group of Eternals is so large, there are many scenes where two or three of them are interacting, and the others are just sort of standing around in the background, watching. It seems like the actors' call days could have been cut down significantly.  Madden's Ikaris is given the most to play with, character-wise, while the others lobby for screen time. Keoghan, a natural villain (see his work in ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer,"" or more recently ""The Green Knight""), seems miscast as a hero, and has the least to work with; his character gives off shades of brooding darkness, though he doesn't have an opportunity to burrow in and fully explore his motivations.  That's the thing with ""Eternals"": it crams in a lot but still feels meatless. The plot is so exposition-heavy it often feels like sitting down with the Eternals Wikipedia entry, while the action and execution underwhelms. It's a film that takes itself very seriously, and is mostly free of the wonky wink-winks that tend to characterize superhero enterprises. But there needs to be at least some winking — this is a superhero story, not politics — and ""Eternals"" has a hard time figuring out what it is and what to do with itself. And at nearly two hours and 40 minutes, that's a lot of soul searching, only to mostly come up empty. ""Eternals"" is too much of a not good enough thing.",NEGATIVE

"Nov 3, 2021","  The powers that be in the Marvel Cinematic Universe have been masters at making moviegoers care about characters relatively few people know. Once they got past undeniably popular ones like Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, and Hulk, making lower tier characters like Black Widow, Hawkeye, the Guardians of the Galaxy, Ant-Man, and more equally as popular was the result of strong marketing and solid storytelling.  Now that we’ve entered Phase 4 of the MCU master plan, though, some cracks are developing under the weight of it all. Black Widow was entertaining enough, but felt like it came too little, too late for Scarlett Johansson’s now-deceased character. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings featured some spectacular set-pieces, but an overabundance of CGI. Now comes Eternals, featuring a group of all-powerful beings with a mission to protect Earth.  That group includes … deep breath … Ajak (Salma Hayek), who has healing powers; Sersi (Gemma Chan), who can change matter with her hands; Ikaris (Richard Madden), who can fly and shoot lasers from his eyes (no, he’s not Superman); Thena (Angelina Jolie), who can create any type of weapon out of thin air; Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), who shoots blasts from his fingers; Sprite (Lia McHugh), who can alter the look of reality; Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), who can conjure any type of machinery; Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), who has super speed; Druig (Barry Keoghan), who can take over people’s minds; and Gilgamesh (Ma Dong-seok), who has super-strong fists.  They were sent to Earth over 7,000 years ago by a Celestial named Arishem to protect humans from the invasive Deviants, a group of shape-shifting creatures. The catch is, that’s their entire mission; no matter what other bad things happen to humans (say, Thanos) or humans try to do to each other (like genocide), the Eternals are forbidden from interfering. The struggle between their mission and their collective conscience is what drives the story of the film.  Written and directed by Chloé Zhao (Nomadland), with writing help from Patrick Burleigh, Ryan Firpo, and Kaz Firpo, the film is a sprawling epic with scenes ranging from modern-day to ancient Mesopotamia, with multiple other stops along the way. It attempts to include everything from existential questions about the fate of humanity to individual romances, with varying degrees of success.  When it comes to the personal feelings of the Eternals, the film is stuck between two worlds. Since they are close to immortal, they tend to keep their relations to humans at a distance. But it becomes clear that human feelings are part of who they are, especially the longer they linger on Earth. Zhao and her team do their best to sell the emotions of the group, but it’s sometimes difficult to match up their words with their actions.  Ultimately, it’s just too many characters for an introductory story. Only a few of them truly stand out, and with the film running over two-and-a-half hours, there is too much time for the audience to ponder if certain characters’ powers are all that useful. Combine that with the fact that their individual stories are meted out in drips and drabs, and it’s difficult to empathize or relate to any of them.  Much of the action involves people pointing or conjuring with their hands, things that only look slightly less ridiculous because of the CGI. Few of the fight scenes measure up in any meaningful way to those of previous MCU films. Zhao, who is known for her internal stories, just can’t seem to get across the scope that the big set-pieces deserve.  One nice thing is that the film features a cast that’s diverse in its skin color, gender, and level of fame. Six of the 10 characters are non-white, half are women, and only Hayek and Jolie could be considered stars. Even if we don’t get to know any of the characters that well, due to the overstuffed roster, the diversity allows the filmmakers explore avenues other MCU films haven’t, including a same-sex relationship.  Perhaps Eternals will gain traction the more we get to see what the rest of the MCU’s Phase 4 involves. On its own, though, the story lacks the excitement that audiences have come to expect from Marvel films. 1. Dallas neighbor shines as the 2nd happiest city in the U.S., report finds.

"Nov 3, 2021"," Marvel Studios’ “Eternals” follows a group of heroes from beyond the stars who had protected the Earth since the dawn of man. When monstrous creatures called the Deviants, long thought lost to history, mysteriously return, the Eternals are forced to reunite in order to defend humanity once again.

"Nov 3, 2021"," Eternals? Not even close. Though at two hours and 37 minutes it may start to feel like it. Marvel’s latest offering is chockfull of characters – 10 new superheroes plus various hangers-on, with nary an Avenger or Guardian in sight – plus a lot of world building in a franchise that already refers to itself as a universe. It’s getting crowded in here. The bare-bones backstory: In the beginning … That’s not even me being snarky. The movie opens on those exact, Biblically freighted words … in the beginning there was a race of beings called Celestials, and they sent the Eternals to Earth to rid the planet of nasties called Deviants. This was millennia ago, and so the movie will occasionally touch down in, say, 575 BC Babylon or 1945 Hiroshima for a bit of catching up with its characters. That second location is an odd choice because it raises the question of why these immortal superbeings never thought to interfere in any of our species’ larger conflicts (real or fictional), let alone the extraterrestrial threats of the Marvel canon. The reason given is that they were told not to, a vague rule they’re happy to break whenever the plot demands it. Chief among the Eternals is Gemma Chan as Sersi, who works as a museum curator (shades of Wonder Woman) and is dating her coworker Dane (Kit Harrington), despite any concerns from human resources, like the fact that he’s from the late ’80s and she’s from the late Stone Age. Richard Madden is Ikaris, who seems to have modeled his powers on those of Superman. Eternals might be – and I say this as someone who’s always been more Team Marvel – the most DC-like of this franchise’s outings. The cast also includes Thena (Angelina Jolie), suffering from some kind of Eternals’ dementia; and Gilgamesh (Don Lee), who has set himself up as her caretaker. And on down the list, each with his or her own (sometimes overlapping) powers. Salma Hayek plays Ajak, the group’s leader. Sixteen-year-old Lia McHugh is Sprite, her eternal life compounded with eternal youth. There’s Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), Makkari (Lauren Ridloff) and Druig (Barry Keoghan). And finally Kumail Nanjiani as Kingo, sporting truly distracting abs and incognito (if you can call it that) as a Bollywood star. His producer (Harish Patel) provides comic relief whenever Nanjiani is too busy saving the world to crack wise. So what’s troubling the world this time, exactly? Well, it seems the Deviants are back, and so the Eternals, who have been laying low for centuries, must assemble (though no one says “Eternals … Assemble!”) to counter the threat. Sersi, a big fan of humanity in general and her boyfriend in particular, circles the globe to find her colleagues and convince them to help, though not all are equally interested. When they find out why the monsters have returned, it makes the choice harder still. Eternals was co-written and directed by Chloe Zhao, whose last movie, Nomadland, won Academy Awards for Zhao, star Frances McDormand and as best picture of 2020. Zhao is just the second woman to solo-direct a Marvel movie, after Black Widow’s Cate Shortland. But she’s also the latest in a list of (relatively) low budget filmmakers to be handed the reins of an MCU project. They include Jon Watts (Cop Car, three Spider-Mans), Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck (Half Nelson, Captain Marvel), Ryan Coogler (Fruitvale Station, two Black Panthers) and Kenneth Branagh (just kidding). But the poster boy for the larval-to-Marvel transition has to be Taika Waititi, who not only made a decent movie in Thor: Ragnarok, but managed to infuse the studio product with a little of his own wacky sensibility. No such luck with Zhao. Hard to tell if she pushed back against the Marvel machine, but if she did it was too little and too late. Between all the requisite exposition, character interactions (some of the Eternals don’t play well with others) and a few punchy-punchy battles en route to a we’ll-be-back conclusion and a couple of jaw-dropping end-credit scenes, there’s precious little room to put a personal stamp on this one.

"Nov 3, 2021",The film is very prog. But also very pop.,NEUTRAL
"Nov 3, 2021"," The newest team of superheroes has arrived in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Eternals is a superhero film that takes place after the events of Avengers: Endgame. The movie follows the Eternals, an immortal group of aliens who have lived on Earth for 7,000 years, as they reunite to protect the world from their evil counterparts: the Deviants. Marvel has had an excellent track record of pulling up-and-coming directors and dropping them into a superhero movie, with Jon Watts’s work on the Spider-Man films and Destin Daniel Cretton in Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. This time, Academy Award-winning visionary Chloé Zhao has arrived in the MCU, fresh off her Best Picture and Best Director wins for Nomadland. Zhao has never made anything with the feel of an MCU movie, and she brings her style to the most successful movie franchise of all time to lukewarm results. Nearly everything Marvel makes is watchable. Even in their lesser movies, their movies are consistently action-packed fun with jokes, easter eggs, and visuals that are pretty easy on the eyes. Zhao’s approach has a few of these qualities, but it also has a lot more. There are moments of this film where the storytelling feels quite methodical as if Zhao wanted to take her time with telling a story so vast and epic in scale. Clocking in at over two and a half hours, Zhao makes a movie that is never boring but has qualities that prevent the film from being as engaging as it could be. Eternals marks a step away from the standard Marvel formula, not feeling as formulaic as the other movies. This is a unique risk for Marvel to take by putting an arthouse director’s style on the mainstream big screen, and for the most part, it works. It doesn’t feel like a disposable, forgettable studio product; it feels like a passion project for Zhao as she helms the film with grace and maturity, as she creates a gorgeous movie with a lot of ambition. It’s an origin story with ideas that have never been seen before, but it’s also a movie that features a lot of familiar ideas, almost as if Zhao’s style was met with the constraints of being a studio film. Let it be known that Zhao had no easy task with this movie. Eternals introduces ten brand new superheroes to the series, and she had to give every hero a certain amount of development to get the audience to care. This is a near-impossible assignment to pull off, and Zhao does her best. Surprisingly, much of it works, as each hero does stand out, partially due to the diversity of the cast, featuring different races, genders, sexual orientations, and even introducing Makkari, portrayed by Lauren Ridloff, a real-life deaf actress. This is an accomplishment for diversity in film, but each character also has a unique set of powers, and by the final act, the characters are making choices that say a lot about who they are and how different some of them can be. However, the film has so much world-building and character-building that the screenplay stumbles from time to time. The movie follows two storylines, one that takes place centuries in the past and one that takes place following Endgame. Nonlinear storytelling has been used in superhero films such as Batman Begins.  The problem is that Eternals has so many characters that juggling every new face with a story that’s told out of order prevents certain character moments from having the emotional depth they deserve. Nevertheless, the movie has some outstanding performances from its ensemble cast that make each character stand out. Sersi (Gemma Chan) and Ikaris (Richard Madden) have an investing relationship that serves as the heart and soul of the film. Kumail Nanjiani steals the show as Kingo, and his subplot surrounding a documentary filmmaker is the highlight of the film, allowing for excellently timed humor. The movie mixes your standard “getting the band back together” storyline with vast visuals and high stakes, resulting in a film that generally works but feels as if it is also biting off more than it can chew. Despite the novelty of a movie that tackles such rich themes and doesn’t feel comic-bookish in the slightest, the film’s final act still devolves into a bunch of people in funny costumes battling with CGI and green screens. Marvel’s formula that feels largely absent from the film seeps into Zhao’s vision from time to time to create a movie that feels like a flawed, enormous spectacle. Many had high hopes about an acclaimed director like Chloé Zhao directing a Marvel movie. Unfortunately, this movie is not the beautiful marriage of two beloved icons that we would expect. It has its messy moments and compared to the MCU’s other work this year, this may be the weakest of them all. However, there is so much to appreciate and respect about Zhao’s artistic choices. Every visual, combined with Ramin Djawadi’s chill-inducing musical score, creates a superhero movie for the ages that may be low-tier MCU but remains entertaining, powerful cinema that will polarize audiences. This is an ambitious, exciting movie that doesn’t entirely stick the landing but remains on par with what we’ve seen from a successful franchise film. As ComingSoon’s review policy explains, a score of 7 equates to “Good.” A successful piece of entertainment that is worth checking out, but it may not appeal to everyone. Jonathan Sim is a film critic and filmmaker born and raised in New York City. He has met/interviewed some of the leading figures in Hollywood, including Christopher Nolan, Zendaya, Liam Neeson, and Denis Villeneueve.

"Nov 3, 2021"," There may not be any eventuality in the Multiverse where Eternals works. It feels like deep-cut source material not mined for adaptation out of desire, but a necessity to keep the engine running. Despite her reportedly unique pitch, co-writer and director Chloé Zhao’s involvement seems almost like a lark after coming out the other end, save a handful of interesting points her film offers up. Regardless of on-location shooting or dalliances with something resembling pathos, Eternals is unmistakably Disney above all else. Following the eponymous group of cosmic entities, we see our heroes (?) influence life on Earth, from the fabled gardens of Babylon to the very real devastation of Hiroshima at the behest of an all-powerful (if detached) creator named Arishem. If it seems historically significant, they had a hand in it—for reasons benevolent and otherwise. Much like their mythological counterparts, the Eternals are intrinsically emotional beings falling into love, melancholy, even madness across seemingly interminable lives. An emotionality is clearly the most enticing thing for Zhao, who tries to layer something real onto the cosmic scope of the universe these beings inhabit. It’s an earnest, admirable attempt that collapses under the number of threads and characters a lumbering script takes great pains to realize with any dimension. A measure of this laborious plotting does bear fruit, however: we’re treated to this franchise’s most sweeping attempt at a lush romance containing both stakes and (surprisingly) sensuality––albeit by MCU standards. What surrounds it are broader, not wholly uninteresting platitudes on existence and lesser evils delivered in dulled costumes by commendably diverse faces. Though the diversity in front of and behind camera is more than welcome (and necessary), Disney seems not to wield that initiative as a force for change but as a shield from would-be detractors. Not one to sit back and give sway to true innovation, the company hedges on a specific brand of feigned progressivism; they’re intent on co-opting pure motives to cynically churn out the cinematic equivalent of “I’d Like to Buy the World a Coke.” In that meat-grinding process, Eternals‘ central tragedy isn’t the imminent destruction of life on Earth or humanity’s contradictory capacity for evil and good—it’s that those front-and-center are exceptional talents who deserve better. Zhao can wring something from each member of her cast because they’re all total pros. If both characters and scope (particularly in some of the third act’s final shots) have awesome potential, the tank has run dry as Eternals flirts dangerously close with nearing three hours. This gripe is not solely native to the MCU, and films can be however long they need. That said, I am begging studios to rediscover the beauty of a well-placed intermission. Though not an entirely colossal failure, Eternals has a Sisyphean problem with authenticity: the greater its attempts at specific, deeply felt connection, the more it feels like a broad, insecure, corporate pander. It becomes increasingly tough to appreciate the handiwork of Zhao or her cast when you can imagine Kevin Feige singing “It’s the real thing!” under every ersatz Terrence Malick tableau. Should Zhao’s dealings with Feige and company yield five more Songs My Brothers Taught Me or The Rider, then frankly Eternals is worth it. Even with that level of cautious optimism, the whole enterprise remains a supermassive black hole not even a light like Chloé Zhao can escape.",NEGATIVE
"Nov 3, 2021"," As someone who wants the MCU to explore new territory, it brings me no joy to say that Eternals is dull. Spanning 7,000 years, it’s a fantasy tale about a team of immortal aliens who watch over Earth like intergalactic park wardens. Echoing Wonder Woman‘s Amazon society, they vow not to interfere in human conflicts. But this moral dilemma stretches credulity to breaking point. Not only did the Eternals refuse to help when Thanos killed half the population (a detail that must be tackled with some laborious plothole-darning), their lifespan means they stood by and watched millennia of war, genocide, and slavery. Okey-dokey! Rather than embracing the idea of the Eternals being truly distant and inhuman, the film still wants them to be likeable and moral. Definitely a stretch because their personalities are half-baked, and much of the film’s dialogue is distractingly stilted. At a rough estimate, 70% of the Eternals script is exposition. The first act involves numerous clunky scenes where people explain their names, powers, and backstories as if they’re reciting their own Wiki summaries. “Well, it is tricky to introduce this many characters,” I thought charitably, before remembering that the first X-Men movie managed this with charm and ease—and was a full hour shorter. Directed by Oscar-winner Chloé Zhao (Nomadland), who co-wrote the screenplay with Patrick Burleigh, Ryan Firpo, and Kaz Firpo, Eternals does have a different tone to most MCU products. It’s aiming for epic fantasy, portraying its heroes as godlike figures—somewhat similar to Zack Snyder’s vision for Justice League. Gemma Chan leads the ensemble cast as Sersi, unfortunately, she’s the least interesting Eternal. Her one defining trait is her affection and sympathy for humankind. The secondary lead Ikaris (Richard Madden) suffers from a similar lack of personality. His main schtick is that he’s very powerful and Very Serious. He’s also Sersi’s ex-lover, but despite sharing the MCU’s first sex scene, they have minimal chemistry. Happily, the other Eternals are more engaging. Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani) is the comic relief, an egomaniac who uses his immortal talents to become a Bollywood superstar. He’s fun! Sprite (Lia McHugh) is cursed to look like a child forever, which sucks for her. Makkari (Lauren Ridloff) is a Deaf hero who speaks ASL, and while she doesn’t get a major role, she’s pretty charming. Barry Keoghan (always great!) plays the cynical psychic Druig, with Salma Hayek as the team leader Ajak. Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry) is by far the most relatable and emotionally dynamic, playing the MCU’s long-awaited First Gay Superhero. (Regrettably, he also stars in the film’s most cringeworthy moment, blaming himself for the Hiroshima bomb.) Finally, we have Don Lee and Angelina Jolie as Gilgamesh and Thena, the film’s most compelling relationship. They’re warriors and life partners, with Thena as a troubled veteran and Gilgamesh as her supportive friend. Their story offers a more impactful sense of epic, centuries-old love than Ikaris and Sersi’s unconvincing romance. Jolie’s star power shines through during her somewhat limited screentime, and on a purely shallow level, it’s cool to watch her stab monsters with a magical spear. Eternals is, in fact, something of a monster movie. The heroes’ mission is to protect Earth from a bunch of alien predators, the Deviants. A potentially interesting departure from the MCU formula of prioritizing a singular supervillain. Unfortunately, neither Marvel nor Chloé Zhao is very good at creating effective monsters. The Deviants look ugly, and not in a good way. Their design is overcomplicated and unmemorable, with a sheen of CGI unreality. They lack the physicality of a true monster-movie monster, where Jurassic Park lingers on the dripping gleam of fangs, or Godzilla revels in the destructive heft of its antagonist. It’s impossible to find the Deviants scary or cool, making it hard to care about the fights scenes, where the heroes zap them with laserbeams or bloodlessly chop them to pieces. In fairness, though, many MCU films have forgettable fight scenes. Eternals is more concerned with the moral dilemmas of its main cast. Which also aren’t very interesting. Each Marvel movie arrives on a tide of hype, and this one focused on how Eternals will be “different” – both in terms of Zhao’s artistry, and the fantastical scope of the story. Producer Kevin Feige made a lot of noise about Zhao’s use of natural light and location filming, but I found Zhao’s subdued palette and diffuse lighting to be a bad fit for a fantasy/action blockbuster. Eternals actually repeats a recurring aesthetic problem for the MCU. Shot by the same cinematographer (Ben Davis) as Avengers: Age of Ultron and Captain Marvel, the film is frequently murky and flat during scenes that combine CGI with live-action. The most visually interesting moments come when the concept designers take over for primarily-CGI sequences, especially the scenes involving the Celestial god Arishem. For much of their 7,000-year stay on Earth, the Eternals are motivated by loyalty to Arishem. This offers an intriguing religious angle to the story, but the team’s philosophical differences remain frustratingly shallow. Bafflingly, the film also fails to draw comparisons between the heroes’ relationship to Arishem, and the way the Eternals themselves are viewed as gods for much of human history. Somehow there’s less conflict between Sersi and her bland human boyfriend (Kit Harington) than between Peter Parker and MJ in Spider-Man. Another symptom of there being far too many characters. In some ways, I admire what Eternals is going for. It’s a weirder and more ambitious concept than most MCU movies, and it offers a truly diverse cast. However, it falls flat on several fronts, beginning with its attempt to introduce ten superheroes at once. The best I can say is that it’s bad in a more interesting way than something like Doctor Strange, which felt like the paint-by-numbers version of a Marvel origin story. You get the sense that Zhao wanted to make something intimate and philosophical yet epic in scope, but got tripped up by the creative restrictions of working on a Disney blockbuster.",NEUTRAL
"Nov 3, 2021"," Eternals, which is, incredibly, the 26th movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise - and in superhero tradition an origin story – introduces us to 10 superheroes at once.  Eternals, is a group of 10 beings with superpowers, sent to earth 7,000 years ago to save it from fire breathing lizard-like creatures from space called deviants.  Their mission accomplished, the heroes were assigned to stay on earth, and keep an eye on civilization, just in case, without interfering. Although as we see, they have not been entirely successful with that particular directive. The 10 are Sersi (Gemma Chan), Ikaris (Richard Madden) , Thena (Angelina Jolie), Gilgamesh (Don Lee), Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), Sprite (Lia McHugh),  Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), Druig (Barry Keoghan) and their leader—Ajak (Salma Hayek), who gets her directions from a Celestial, a universal being who looks like a giant robot of sorts, somewhere out in cosmos.  As the film begins we see the dilemma of being an Eternal with super powers living amongst mortal beings.  Sersi teaches at a museum in London, and long-time boyfriend Dane Whitman, (Kit Harington) is ready to take the relationship to the next step and move in together and, is puzzled by Sersi’s reluctance.  It’s his birthday, but the celebration is cut short when they are attacked by a deviant—-and then more. Luckily, Sprite is with Sersi as the fight begins, and they are suddenly joined by Ikaris.  This just in: they must defeat the deviants, who, by the way, have been upgraded from snarling fire breathing monsters to something much more self-aware.  The rest all have their stories and baggage, which eats up screen time. But, save the world they must. What’s ahead challenges not only their ability to fight as a team, but brings a series of shocking twists for the group. It’s a lot. And on paper, anyway, there are many intriguing and fun ideas implicitly and explicitly here. For instance: Ikaris, Thena, Gilgamesh, the hint that some of the Eternals were mistaken for gods and demi-gods  in human history, is a clever idea.  And Phastos’s desire to move humanity along for the better results in him inventing things that are both amazing and horrible.  But the weight of all of this makes for a long, and sometimes overly detailed journey. The film has more locations than a Bond film. But then again, Bond is Earthbournd, and the action plays out in a single time-line, whereas Eternals jumps around, from ancient cultures like Mesopotamia, to present time (-ish) out in space. After a while, all of this slows the film down and becomes tedious. It’s an incredibly diverse cast, ethnically and culturally, which is one of the most appealing things about the film.  It’s also thoughtful in its casting. Lauren Ridloff, is a deaf actor who plays the speedster Makkari, who is herself deaf and uses sign language.  I’m a big fan of hers.  To switch suddenly to a film that’s all Sturm and Drang and special effects has to be like creative whiplash. For a director normally rooted in reality, she does surprisingly well here handling the big action elements. But it’s only part of what’s needed here. The film loses momentum early on and starts to feel listless.  But the film doesn’t need it all. It’s added freight that slows the film down. In the end, all of those good intentions, don’t make for enough of a fun and exciting movie.  Eternals. Directed by Chloé Zhao. Starring Gemma Chan, Richard Madden, Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Kit Harrington, Kumail Nanjiani and Bryan Tyree Hendry. Eternals opens in theatres, November 5, 2021.",NEGATIVE
"Nov 3, 2021"," “Eternals” introduces a slew of Marvel Cinematic Universe firsts. First same-sex kiss. First tender love scene between two hetero superheroes — discreet, brief but enough to remind you how much of the comic book genre is about looking good, alone, instead of quality time in pairs. Unfortunately, another first: “Eternals” is co-writer and director Chloé Zhao’s first dull movie. After “Songs My Brother Taught Me” (2015), the sublime neo-Western “The Rider” (2017) and her Oscar-winning “Nomadland” (2020), nearly as good as “The Rider,” this movie is more risk-prone than the majority of Marvel titles. Yet it frustrates, even beyond a screenplay full of self-competing interests. And as far as MCU fatigue goes — well, at this point, it goes pretty far. On the other hand: There’s a series waiting to be built around Lauren Ridloff’s super-speedy  cyclone-generator Makkari. Like Ridloff, the Tony Award nominee for “Children of a Lesser God” and a “Walking Dead” alum, this female iteration of the male character introduced in the 1976-78 “Eternals” comic books is deaf. In a packed ensemble, in which even Angelina Jolie and Salma Hayek struggle for some real estate, Ridloff emerges as the poetic lifeline. Director Zhao clearly responds to both the performer and the character, taking the extra beats to establish Makkari’s presence in this two-hour, 37-minute paradox: a leisurely scrum. Life for the Eternals is frustration incarnate. For ages, these specially gifted immortals, created by the Celestials, have borne witness to humankind’s struggle. The rules require them not to interfere with any epoch-defining historical outcomes. The first third or so of “Eternals” plays like a dreamy update of the old ’60s TV show “The Time Tunnel,” toggling from 5000 B.C. Mesopotamia to modern-day London and a few other locales. The gang of 10 Eternals includes, among others, Ikaris (Richard Madden), Sersi (Gemma Chan, the nominal female lead, and a pretty good one), Thena (Angelina Jolie) and the tech-support wizard Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry). For some droll throwaway jokes, there’s Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani),  living a very public sort of incognito life as a Bollywood superstar. The Deviants threaten Earth with the usual extinction, and these four-eyed bear/dog/wolf/extension cord hybrids periodically turn “Eternals” into a monster movie. There’s a great deal more to the plot, and considerable soul-searching about the Eternals’ limitations. From Sprite (Lia McHugh) to Gilgamesh (Don Lee), they all share the feeling they’ve been here before, wherever “here” is. They watch over repeated human endeavors and devastation, without experiencing full participation. (They’re watching a middling Marvel movie, in other words.) Zhao strives for a franchise universe rangy and oddball enough to encompass Bollywood song and dance and everyday relationship difficulties among various couples. The villain/hero lines blur frequently, as do the crisscrossing subplots. The welter of flashbacks early on eventually gives way to a seriously halfhearted action climax. “Long time on that damn beach” is what I wrote in my notebook. That won’t spoil anything except hopes for a conventional big finish Zhao has no interest in delivering. She cowrote this script, with several other writers sharing credit as well. I honestly think the Zhao + Marvel equation was worth a shot. But there’s only so much room in the MCU for sidewinding introspection and meditative sunsets; no matter the director, there’s always the moment, followed by hundreds more, when the digital rivers of blue or orange light has to fly out somebody’s eyes, or fingers, and those are the money shots that feel like loose change in late 2021. Eight years and many Marvels ago, when “Thor: The Dark World” came out, I wrote: “We don’t go to any of these films, really, for something new. We go because we saw the other ones.” Turning down a Marvel movie, I’m sure, would not be easy, nor necessarily the right decision for one’s career. But I believe this also to be true: Zhao has too much to say as a filmmaker to spend years of her life straining to personalize essentially impersonal heroics.

"Nov 3, 2021"," Halloween may be over, but there’s an artfully ghoulish quality to Spencer, Chilean auteur Pablo Larraín’s audacious new film about about Princess Diana’s final Christmas as part of the royal family. Starring Kristen Stewart in the lead, the film isn’t ghoulish in its treatment of its protagonist, but Larraín (who made the similarly inventive Jackie) and British screenwriter Steven Knight (Eastern Promises, Locke), do take a gleefully macabre approach to the monarchy. Riffing on the The Shining with ominous aerial shots of Sandringham, the film’s setting is presented as a gilded-cage version of the Overlook Hotel, one replete with a sinister Timothy Spall as an all-seeing equerry intent on correcting Diana, and Diana’s own fracturing psyche bringing forth the ghost of Anne Boleyn in a place where “the past and the present are the same thing"" and the “future doesn’t exist.” Opening with a military-style operation to get Sandringham ready for the holidays, the film subtly sets up the notion that Christmas with the in-laws is going to be a battleground for Diana, with her subsequent late arrival signifying the extent to which she’s already in a kind of monarchical no-man’s land, caught between her desire to desert and her determination to fight for her children. As such, what follows shouldn’t be viewed as a dramatically realistic portrait of the inner workings of the royal family, but an expressionistic horror film in which Diana’s overly scrutinised reality starts distorting around her, like the warped landscapes of an Edvard Munch painting. Her own torment reaches a fever-pitch of despair in a remarkable dinner scene that sees her making croutons out of a pearl necklace then vomiting up her soup in a bulimic bout of defiance. The Crown this ain’t. Through it all, Stewart is fearless as Diana. Complimented by the eerie madness of Jonny Greenwood’s disorientating score, her performance eschews reverential mimicry in favour of a more empathetic and interpretive exploration of Diana’s internal chaos. There’s a point late on in Chloé Zhao’s Oscar-winning Nomadland in which Frances McDormand’s van-dwelling Fern is trying to figure out whether or not to plough on with her itinerant lifestyle or reconnect with society at large. Walking along a deserted street late at night, she approaches a cinema showing The Avengers, pauses briefly to check out the poster, then moves on. Modern pop culture, it seems, has nothing to offer her. It’s a beautiful, subtle moment, typical of Zhao’s work. Ironically, it’s also now a depressing portent of how little the Marvel behemoth has to offer an Academy Award-winning director such a Zhao, whose new film Eternals has been conceived as one of the launchpads for the next phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but is more notable for how completely it subsumes Zhao’s hitherto distinctive filmmaking style. Based on a gibberish Jack Kirby comic about a race of interstellar superbeings who’ve been hiding out on Earth for the last 7,000 years protecting its citizens from a race of lupine supervillains known as Deviants, the film jumps back and forth across centuries to lay out a deeply uninteresting origins story involving a celestial god and another civilisation-threatening plan for global annihilation. Among the extensive cast, Angelina Jolie, Richard Madden, Gemma Chan and Salma Hayek come across as charisma vacuums, with only Kumail Nanjiani and Barry Keoghan bringing any sense of fun to an overly earnest universe that’s short on zippy banter and big on shoddily rendered CGI set-pieces. Of course, there’s nothing wrong with Zhao wanting to have a crack at something on this scale, but as Nomadland made clear, you don’t have to be partake in mainstream culture to count. Following on from the biblical fury of 2017’s First Reformed, The Card Counter sees Paul Schrader enjoying a remarkable late-period renaissance with another hard-hitting exploration of purgatorial suffering. Oscar Isaac takes the lead as William Tell, an ex-con gambler who makes his living touring casinos and using his titular prison-honed skills to make a modest living quietly beating the house at its own game. When a not-quite-random encounter with Cirk (Tye Sheridan) – a college drop-out connected to his own bad apple past – provides him with a shot at redemption, he decides to enter the high-stakes world of big money poker tournaments to help Cirk out. It’s a move that risks upending William’s carefully controlled life, but it also brings him into the sphere of Tiffany Haddish’s La Linda, a poker agent with whom he gradually falls in love. Here Schrader cleverly uses gambling as a bluff to lead us into a far wilder story, one that begins with an astonishing shot clueing us into the guilt-fuelled nightmare from which William is trying to escape, and continues with a subversive riff on the troubling avenging angel trope Schrader first explored in his script for Taxi Driver. There’s a freakier take on the concept of the avenging angel in Bull, the intense new film from London to Brighton director Paul Andrew Williams. Starring Kill List’s Neil Maskell as a violent criminal out for vengeance against his equally nasty in-laws (led by a menacing David Haymen), the film starts out as a forcefully directed revenge thriller, but Williams takes it in a more original and disturbing direction with a bold final act wig-out.

"Nov 3, 2021"," Chloé Zhao, fresh off winning two historic Oscars for “Nomadland,” gracefully handles a thankless job with “Eternals,” a Marvel Cinematic Universe origin story that suffers from all the baggy, convoluted drawbacks of the form. Based on characters created by Jack Kirby that first appeared in a 1976 comic, the latest installment of never-ending MCU hegemony introduces a new, post-Avengers cast of franchise players: the titular band of immortals who were sent to Earth from the planet Olympia thousands of years ago to banish a marauding monster species called the Deviants. With those baddies apparently vanquished, the Eternals have taken on human form, absorbing into normal, everyday life, like so many intergalactic sleeper cells. When we meet Sersi (Gemma Chan), she’s working at the Natural History Museum in London, keeping her dishy boyfriend Dane Whitman (Kit Harington) at wary arm’s length because of a millennia-old off-and-on thing with Ikaris (Richard Madden). She’s also a surrogate mother to Sprite, a mop-topped tomboy played by Lia McHugh as a disturbing cross between Tinkerbell and a creepy kid vampire from an Anne Rice novel. When a Deviant unexpectedly fetches up at Camden Lock one evening, it’s clear that Sersi, Ikaris and Sprite have more work to do: Led by Ajak (Salma Hayek), they get the band back together, traveling the world to round up erstwhile allies that, when asked by civilians, are invariably explained away as “friends from college.” The whirlwind tour of locations as far-flung as South Dakota, Amazonia and, eventually, Alaska, mainly serves to give viewers a panoply of backdrops for what invariably turn out to be long, expository speeches questioning why the Deviants have suddenly assumed the ability to heal themselves, and whether humanity is even worth saving. Zhao, whose previous films “Nomadland,” “The Rider” and “Songs My Brother Taught Me” all took place amid the simple majesty of the American West, does her best to imbue “Eternals” with those same sweeping production values: Eschewing computer generated effects as much as possible, she also films in actual locations (England and the Canary Islands), which lends an air of authenticity to a film genre too often hermetically sealed in its own plasticized artifice. What’s more, she keeps an eye out for small, humanistic moments of intimacy: “Eternals” has been recognized for introducing the first deaf MCU character (Makkari, played by Lauren Ridloff), as well as a gay character and a pluralistic ensemble of actors, but it’s also notable for being the first Marvel movie to feature a sex scene — PG-13 approved, but a breakthrough nonetheless. Even with these glimpses of grounded reality, though, Zhao can’t overcome the structural realities of the behemoth she’s been tasked with piloting. “Eternals” is a choppy, whipsawing affair, especially in its first half, when the narrative pingpongs erratically between present-day scenes and those taking place in ancient Mesopotamia, the Gupta Empire and Aztec-era Mexico. Zhao’s script, co-written with Patrick Burleigh, Ryan Firpo and Kaz Firpo, alternates between generic lines like “Run!” and “Watch out!” and leaden, self-serious perorations. There are moments when the visuals of “Eternals” recalls Ray Harryhausen in their adamantly analog effects, and when the heroes work their magic, it often takes on the delicacy of finely-spun scrollwork. But by the time yet another Deviant throw-down arrives with metronomic timing — and by the time the movie begins to sag under its 2½ -hour running time — an inevitable feeling of dull, drearily repetitive predictability sets in. There are bright spots in “Eternals”: Kumail Nanjiani has a blast as Kingo, who has become a heartthrob of Bollywood cinema and has most of the movie’s best punchlines (one of them is a wink at Thor, one of a few self-referential nods toward what’s happening over in the other ’verse). Brian Tyree Henry is similarly wry as Phastos, who at the beginning of the story has happily given up on superheroics to raise a family with his husband Ben (Haaz Sleiman). As the brooding hothead Druig, Barry Keoghan seethes with Kurtz-like intensity, hiding out in Brazil out of disgust with his inability to save people from themselves; Angelina Jolie plays Thena, a warrior princess now suffering a form of cosmic dementia, with touching naivete. Thena’s protector is the enormous Gilgamesh (Don Lee), continuing the “Eternals” theme of everyone having an opposite number with whom they can play and riff; unfortunately the most obvious place the gambit doesn’t work is in the film’s central relationship between Sersi and Ikaris, whose exceeding physical attractiveness can’t overcome a fatally inert setup. As in most launchpads of this type, “Eternals” has so much work to do that chemistry can’t help but get squashed: introducing a seemingly endless cast of characters; putting them into ever-multiplying snares, traps and ambushes; hinting at myriad movies to come and constantly explaining what happened once, what’s happening now and what’s going to happen next.  Zhao might have her eye on the nuances, but ultimately even a filmmaker with her sensitivity and vision can’t bend the Great Marvel Imperative to her will.",NEUTRAL
"Nov 3, 2021",[Chloé Zhao] is somehow out of her element here as she struggles to juggle multiple character arcs throughout the ponderous 157-minute length.,NEUTRAL
"Nov 3, 2021"," One of the biggest criticisms lobbed at the Marvel Cinematic Universe is its persistence with sticking to the tried and true “Marvel formula.” In most Marvel Studios films (particularly first outings of new superheroes), we meet our down on their luck protagonist who soon discovers their hidden superpower which attracts the attention of some ungodly antagonist who forces our new hero to overcome insurmountable odds and ultimately save the day. Now that you’ve read it, you can see how many Marvel films it applies to, right? To be fair, this generic plot arc could be applied to literally hundreds of action films, but it’s worked incredibly well for Marvel for over ten years and they’ve rarely stepped off this well-worn track. When Marvel Studios tapped Academy Award-winning director Chloé Zhao to helm Eternals, it looked like this may finally be the film to shatter the formula. In many ways, Eternals is unlike any MCU film thus far. However, that’s not necessarily a good thing. While the diverse ensemble cast brings impressive (and overdue) representation to this franchise and its ambition and scope are both hugely admirable, the end result is muddled by an exposition-heavy plot that takes itself far too seriously and pacing problems that cause the film to drag for considerable periods of time. There are moments of visual and narrative brilliance, but it’s ultimately a film that bites off more than it can chew. The film centres on the titular group of ten super-powered alien creatures who were sent to Earth 7,000 years ago by Arishem (voiced by David Kaye), their Celestial master who instructed the Eternals to watch over the planet and protect it from an evil race of murderous beasts known as Deviants. Strictly forbidden from intervening in events involving human conflict (hence why they were nowhere to be seen during Thanos’ reign of terror), the Eternals instead guide humanity’s development and encourage our natural evolution. After spending centuries fulfilling their mission to rid the globe of every last Deviant, the team went their separate ways. Cut to present day and we find manipulator of inanimate matter Sersi (Gemma Chan) living a simple life in London with her human boyfriend, Dane (Kit Harrington) and fellow Eternal Sprite (Lia McHugh), an illusion master stuck in the form of a 12-year-old child. When a powerful (and presumed extinct) Deviant attacks the trio, they’re saved by the reemergence of Sersi’s former love Ikaris (Richard Madden), the most powerful Eternal who can fly and project cosmic energy beams from his eyes. With no choice but to get the band back together, the gang set off around the globe to reunite the Eternals and stop the potential Deviant uprising. On their checklist we find the group’s former leader Ajak (Salma Hayek), who is blessed with the ability to self-heal and acts as the line of communication between the Eternals and Arishem; Thena (Angelina Jole), an elite warrior who can form weapons from cosmic energy; Gilgamesh (Don Lee), who is endowed with superhuman strength; Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), a deaf hero who possesses super-speed; Kingo (a typically scene-stealing Kumail Nanjiani), a cocky show-off who can project cosmic energy projectiles from his hands and currently lives the life of a hugely famous Bollywood star; Druig (Barry Keoghan), who can manipulate the minds of humans; and Phaistos (Bryan Tyree Henry), the group’s uber-intelligent inventor who now lives quietly in the suburbs with his husband, Ben (Haaz Sleiman) and their young son, Jack (Esai Daniel Cross). For all its flaws, Eternals is still a landmark moment for diversity in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and that has to be cause for celebration. From race and gender to sexual orientation and special needs, this film shatters preconceived notions of what normally constitutes a superhero protagonist. Just the fact two of its leads are both “women of a certain age” would be groundbreaking enough for this genre of cinema. It’s a group of characters who represent humanity in such varied ways and that kind of representation can only be seen as a good thing. While lacking in blockbuster filmmaking experience, Zhao is the perfect choice to challenge the status quo of the Marvel universe, particularly after her historic wins at this year’s Oscars. She’s a director with a penchant for human drama, and that’s inherently what we find hidden amongst a whole lot of fantastical sci-fi gobbledygook. Zhao knows she has to deliver action set pieces, but she’s mixed them amongst an ambitious narrative that focuses on conflict, guilt, power, and love. But it’s this kind of ambition that is ultimately this film’s undoing. Even with a running time of almost two-and-a-half hours, it’s simply trying to do too much at once. We’ve never met any of these ten characters previously, which causes Zhao to spend much of the film drowning in backstories and scenes of heavy dialogue to establish who they are, what they can do, why they’re on Earth, what they’ve been up to for the last few centuries, what they’re up to now, and the complicated relationships in the group where the power dynamic seems to shift at every turn. If that’s exhausting to read, it’s can be just as tiresome to watch. It’s almost like viewing an entire Phase of the MCU condensed into one film. By using one film to introduce so many new characters, Zhao is saddled with attempting too much character development in a short space of time. Several characters are introduced and then given very little to do for the next 90 minutes before returning for the final battle. One character even decides to just tap out of taking any part in the climactic finale only to re-appear when it’s all over. It’s confounding moments like this that make you realise this film is juggling too many balls at the same time and most of them are seemingly stuck in mid-air. Zhao takes a non-linear approach to her storytelling, which is a curious and occasionally interesting decision. But it also causes the film to repeatedly jump to exposition-heavy flashbacks that often cause the pacing to grind to a halt. Just when you think the narrative is finally progressing somewhere, we have to pause and head back to the past to understand what’s coming next. It’s akin to reading a novel by starting with chapter one, then jumping to chapter 17, then back to three, and so on. That’s a problem when the chapters aren’t equally interesting, leading the film to suffer from long periods of genuine dullness. With such a crowded ensemble cast, it’s essentially 156 minutes of every actor attempting to make the most of the time they’re given. Both Nanjiani and Henry inject some desperately needed levity into the serious narrative, particularly the former whose blustering Bollywood persona is a breath of fresh air. Nanjiani struggles to handle his character’s more dramatic beats, but Zhao takes full advantage of his natural gift for dry humour. Hayek and Jolie bring some gravitas to proceedings, but they both feel terribly wasted, particularly Jolie who barely utters more than ten lines of dialogue. Harrington is saddled with the thankless (and, for now, pointless) boyfriend role. But, if you know your Marvel lore, you’re aware his character will have more to do in the future. Keoghan plays Druig as aloof to the point of disinterest, but he is blessed with a meatier backstory involving his frustration and guilt over being forced to watch humans constantly destroy each other while knowing he could solve all their problems with his powers. The film tries achingly hard to create an epic love story between Sersi and Ikaris, but even the usually charismatic Chan and Madden can’t save such disappointingly bland characters. On the insistence of Zhao, much of the production was filmed on location and shunned the use of green screen where possible. The end result is genuinely beautiful and blesses the visuals with a natural authenticity we rarely see in the Marvel universe. While it’s dizzying watching the characters zoom around the globe on their quest to locate each team member, it does allow Zhao to film in numerous stunning locations that allow Ben Davis‘ immersive cinematography to soar. Zhao’s muted colour palette won’t be everyone’s cup of tea, but it does create stellar juxtapositions when the usual bright comic book colours burst through. Zhao has sought to bring something different to this saga and her visual style is completely unique. She delivers the bombastic action required but admirably attempts to shake up the formula with a deeper focus on character. If only her ambitions matched the final product. Eternals seeks to be the next Avengers without the momentum and groundwork of previous chapters. That in itself is an impossible task. There’s enough here to keep you engaged and there are several setups for future adventures that will be better served without the need for expository introductions. Eternals is far from the worst of the MCU but it’s nowhere near the greatness it might have been.",NEUTRAL

"Nov 2, 2021"," Seven thousand years. Ten thousand years. Fiction is able to cover massive timescales in a matter of pages. Isaac Asimov’s Foundation, Frank Herbert’s Dune, and Jack Kirby’s The Eternals debuted in print within the same fifteen years, and now they have debuted on screens (some larger or smaller than others) within a month of each other. Those original works came in the midst of the Cold War, when the United States found itself economically prosperous, scientific advancements had sent us toward landing on the Moon, and the cultural and societal status quos were being challenged. Now, those stories are adapted while an entire generation feels as though they are on the precipice of colossal upheaval, not looking up toward the stars, but toward rising temperatures, sea levels, and prosperity that has eroded from all but the wealthy. These stories are resonating with audiences in new media because we are confronting a crisis created by our civilization that will fundamentally change it.  While Asimov and Herbert looked into the far future of human civilization, Kirby was drawn to the past, but the time scales at play are more or less the same. Where we come from and where we are going are nothing if not the same question asked in different ways. Like the Roman god Janus, we must face both simultaneously. The present exists as a membrane between the past and future, and we can’t know our destiny if we don’t understand our origin. It is not known if Jack Kirby ever read Erich von Däniken’s 1968 book Chariots of the Gods?, but Marvel’s marketing for The Eternals comic played up that fact, as the cover to issue 2 loudly proclaims itself “More Fantastic than Chariots of the Gods!” in crimson font, playing off both the fad book and Kirby’s previous co-creations, the Fantastic Four. Von Däniken’s book is racist junk masquerading as scientific inquiry, arguing that “mysteries” of the ancient world (most of which are not mysteries) are best explained by extraterrestrial astronauts. Von Däniken himself drew ideas from H.P. Lovecraft, science fiction’s most famous racist uncle, and his book undermined the idea of intelligent ancient cultures in Egypt, Easter Island, and elsewhere in the public consciousness. Kirby’s approach is not at all focused on explaining ancient landmarks, but inserting modern day characters into an eons-spanning soap opera between super powered beings and their cosmic makers.  The most interesting aspect of Eternals is the involvement of Chloé Zhao. Her breakout indie works The Rider and Nomadland epitomize naturalism, and explore humans’ relationship with the natural world. The tension between this sensibility and the polished Disney machine would be present no matter which Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) movie she became involved with, but stepping into a story of beings who live for thousands of years and their space god masters seems like an odd fit at first glance. However, it is this tension which makes Eternals stand apart from those other films. Zhao’s take on these characters revels in the fact that they are obscure even to most Marvel die-hards. Each of them are allowed to be flawed, and not just in the “they’re the perfect hero, but their greatest strength is also their greatest weakness” kind of way. As Eternals unfolds, each of the core cast is revealed to have made bad, or at least questionable, choices. When your lifespan is thousands of years, you’re bound to make a few mistakes. Introducing the entire cast is not a small feat, as there are nine Eternals introduced, all of whom arrive together in Earth’s prehistory with Ajak (Salma Hayek) as their leader. This is the main thing that weighs the story down, especially since we see all the characters together in multiple flashbacks, but the movie is also structured like a “getting the band together” movie, so it feels like we are introduced and reintroduced to some of the characters multiple times in case we forget their situation. Gemma Chan’s Sersei functions as the lead, though she fades into the ensemble for some of the middle act. The casting here mostly works, though Kumail Nanjiani’s Kingo sometimes feels like he’s in a different movie, since he and his valet (Harish Patel) carry a lot of the comic relief.  The scale of Eternals is matched by its large cast of characters. Spanning the course of several millennia, the Eternals take their marching orders from a Celestial, Arishem the Judge (David Kaye). Like another Jack Kirby creation, Ego the Living Planet (called a Celestial in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2), Arishem wishes to propagate the stars, albeit with a different strategy. The Eternals are charged with protecting humans from a race called the Deviants, taking the appearance of colorful chimeras in this movie. While in the comics the Deviants are revealed to be intelligent, with their own society and hierarchy, this film only hints at that potential. The main contrast between the Eternals and Deviants is that the former never change, even over long spans of time while Deviants evolve constantly. The Eternals are obsessed with the idea of having all of their memories intact, learning through observation, while the Deviants react and change with their environment.  This idea of change and adaptability are woven into the look of everything in the movie. When the Eternals wield their cosmic powers, it is often represented as gold. Not only does gold signify wealth and power, but gold itself is also a delicate material, representing the light touch the Eternals have had on human history, only intervening when instructed. In addition, much of Eternals is shot during “magic hour” bathing the actors and environment with golden light. The sun seems to be rising or setting for much of the film, evoking the feeling of an oncoming change that is cosmic in nature, immutable and unstoppable.  Chloé Zhao’s choices evoke both the epoch-spanning timeline of the film as well as the planetary change happening to the Earth right now. The challenge the Eternals face in the film’s final act is an obvious stand-in for the global impact of climate change, except in real life, those with the power to fight it–governments and transnational corporations–have abdicated responsibility, cherishing the status quo and profits rather than confront a waking giant. This theme–that human civilization has culminated in climate change, led by nothing but the forces of capitalism–is actively embraced by Herbert’s Dune (Villeneuve has missed that or not gotten there yet) and rebuked by Asimov’s Foundation and Eternals. The latter posits that even if there is no God, there are unseen forces steering destiny, albeit on a planetary scale. In times of extreme uncertainty, it would be comforting to know that there is a cosmic watchmaker who may eventually balance the scales. Until then, it feels like any gods that may be out there are merely standing by as the forces of colonialism, war, and capitalism shape our world and determine the few winners among many losers. Eternals attempts to explain why, and ultimately lands on the side of those with great power taking an interventionist track, but maybe it’s too little too late for Earth. Good luck to the next planet. ",POSITIVE

"Nov 2, 2021"," Director Chloé Zhao applies her distinctive aesthetic imprint to “Eternals,” but she can only do so much to bend the Marvel Cinematic Universe to her will. The result is a blockbuster of unusual gentle beauty that also strains to fulfill the gargantuan requirements of a massive action spectacle. It is, in short, a bit of a mess. It is also—and I cannot stress this enough—2 hours and 37 minutes long. And yet because the talented, eclectic cast is so enormous and so much world-building must occur, “Eternals” ultimately feels rushed and unsatisfying. The mythology here is both dense and frequently silly, with the movie grinding to a halt around the one-hour mark for an extensive information dump. By the end, you may still be unclear as to what’s going on, but you also may not care. Zhao, the newly minted Academy Award winner for Best Picture and Director for the spare and intimate “Nomadland,” does offer a great deal of her signature style, though. For those of you who found the choice of Zhao a fascinating one and wondered what her version of the MCU might look like, you’ll be happy to learn she manages to find magic hour wherever she goes, from a breezy sunset on the shores of ancient Babylon to ominous storm clouds gathering on the plains of present-day South Dakota. Working with cinematographer Ben Davis, who also shot “Guardians of the Galaxy,” “Doctor Strange,” and “Captain Marvel,” she consistently provides opportunities to let us slow down, take a breath, and enjoy a moment of naturalism and stillness. You can feel the sunbaked heat of the windy Australian outback. An action scene set in a torch-lit forest at night is especially stunning. Zhao and her fellow screenwriters Patrick Burleigh and Ryan Firpo & Kaz Firpo lurch around in time in an ungainly fashion to tell the story of a group of immortal beings living secretly on Earth. Each has his or her own specific abilities but, collectively, they share the quippy humor that’s become so typical in Marvel movies. The casting and characteristics on display here are revolutionary and, at first, cause for inspiration that we might be in for something totally different. There’s a natural diversity at work in ways we haven’t seen from the Avengers, for example. From the leadership of Salma Hayek’s Ajak and Gemma Chan’s Sersi to Brian Tyree Henry and Haaz Sleiman as a gay couple with a young son to Lauren Ridloff’s Makkari, whose hearing impairment is her superpower—the inclusive nature of “Eternals” feels both exciting and effortless. Angelina Jolie’s Thena is a ferocious warrior who also suffers from mental illness, which the film handles sensitively. Conversely, Lia McHugh livens things up as the androgynous, forever-young Sprite. There is also a plot, however, which will escape your mind as quickly as it entered. Briefly, the Eternals have scattered across the globe in the centuries since they arrived on Earth in a spaceship that resembles a behemoth, black marble Dorito. All along, they’ve been stealthily guiding humanity and fighting ravenous, sinewy monsters known as Deviants. But a potentially cataclysmic event forces them to leave the comfortable lives they’ve forged for themselves, reassemble (if you’ll forgive the word choice) and use their combined superpowers to stop what is essentially the apocalypse. Again! You don’t need to be deeply steeped in Marvel lore in general or Jack Kirby’s trippy comic series specifically to follow “Eternals”; aside from a brief reference to Thanos, and why these heroes didn’t step in to stop the events of “Avengers: Infinity War,” this feels more like a standalone film than most in the MCU. Having said that, of course you’ll get more out of the movie if you’re a fan, and the obligatory end-credit sequences will mean more to you, too. Chan’s Sersi, with her transmutational abilities, and Richard Madden’s Ikaris, a versatile, Superman-type figure prominently as centuries-old, on-and-off-again lovers. Charismatic as Madden is, though, Chan enjoys greater sparks with Kit Harington as her mortal, London-based boyfriend, Dane Whitman, who shares Sersi’s interest in archaeology. Whatever emotional stakes may exist between any of these characters eventually take a back seat to flying around and zapping monsters with eye lasers. You can feel the struggle in trying to juggle it all. And the climactic action extravaganza is so glossy and cacophonous, it could have been plucked out of any number of soulless, sci-fi spectacles over the past decade, smothering all the smaller charms we’d enjoyed along the way. A newly buff Kumail Nanjiani offers some laughs as a pompous Bollywood star, Don Lee provides a kind presence despite his hulking power, and Barry Keoghan merely has to show up to make us feel his unnerving vibe. All of these actors prove they’re up for the challenge of trying to establish complicated characters within the frenzy of the MCU machinery. Frustratingly, they—and Zhao—can only serve as cogs. Christy Lemire is a longtime film critic who has written for RogerEbert.com since 2013.

"Nov 2, 2021"," With one or two really, really well-known exceptions, it’s become the kiss of death for a fantasy sci-fi epic to open with a scroll of exposition. Not because it presages the filmmaker’s concerns that audiences won’t understand enough of the nuances of the backstory to engage with the prime narrative properly. But because the opening in scroll is not their answer to those concerns, merely the opening salvo in a war of constantly escalating explanation and description. It is a war not only for comprehension but for the fleeting minutes any given film has, leaving character and emotion to fight with the plot and backstory for space. Seldom does the character, the spice that brings stories to life, succeed, and unfortunately, Chloé Zhao’s Eternals is the latest casualty in that unnecessary war. To be fair, anything dealing with the machinations of space gods and the immortal super-soldiers they send throughout the galaxy to fight their wars for them is going to need some explanation. The short version is that Earth (and inhabited planets like it) are frequently threatened by writhing, tentacled beasts called Deviants who exist only to devour whatever is before them.  Fortunately for said planets, intergalactic space gods called Celestials have gathered a team of super warriors from the planet Olympia and sent them to find and defeat the Deviants wherever they may appear. When one of those ‘where’s’ turns out to be ancient Mesopotamia, the Eternals dutifully arrive to defeat the villains and then set up shop on Earth, subtly setting forth the direction for Mediterranean society (and later the rest of the world as well) as they wait for their space lords to send the call to send them home. When their leader and only means of communication with the Celestials, Ajak (Salma Hayek), turns up dead at the hands of the long-thought vanquished Deviants, the remaining Eternals are faced with a greater threat than they had supposed, and, for the first time real doubt about the future. There is most definitely an excellent film to make about the ennui of immortal space warriors as they search for meaning in lives that must ultimately repeat the same actions over and over, and the only stable relationships are with themselves. It is fertile ground for interesting psychological and emotional exploration of intense abstract concepts of the sort sci-fantasy is best at.  Based on the poetic and mournfully contemplative films Chloé Zhao has made to date, it’s easy to see her producing something exactly like that. This makes it doubly disappointing when the film she has made turns out to be so clunky and meandering, with its most interesting stuff hidden under mounds of exposition, bad dialogue, and an overlong run time.  By the time it starts to make a legitimate case for being worthy of all the time spent on it, it’s also time for everything to wrap up. It’s all grandly depressing. Not for want of trying, though. It is, potentially, the best looking of the Marvel Studios films to date (only Black Panther and Captain America: The Winter Soldier come close), making use of naturalistic lighting and color to create a warm, earthy, real feel the rest of the film struggles to emulate. Ben Davis, working on his fifth Marvel film, breaks free of a lot of the four-color house style the studio has perfected to mesh surprisingly well with the magic hour-driven naturalism and location-focused photography of Zhao’s films.  And it really is magic, producing something visually light and airy whether visiting a South Dakota ranch or following flying supermen eye-blasting monsters. It’s the only part of the film that really manages that, or what one might consider a Zhao action film would be like; that’s why it’s so depressing when the rest comes crashing down to earth. Most of the problems, in fact almost all the problems, come from the script by Ryan Firpo and heavily rewritten by Zhao herself (along with Patrick Burleigh). It’s not that it is heavily plot-laden — though it most certainly is to the point where anything non-plot related in the dialogue is frequently smothered and left to die — so much as what non-plot dialogue there is does no one any favors.  It’s not a conceptual problem; a film digging into the melancholia of immortals and what drives them to continue life should be an excellent change of pace for Marvel; it’s entirely on execution. There’s not enough apparent experience with anything approaching human emotions to make an exploration of these beings’ complicated feelings possible, much less interesting. Most of what they have to say and do revolves around constantly explaining exactly what is happening and why, including multiple sequences of characters being directly told the story to date. But even the in-between moments, when everyone can stop focusing on the world ending long enough to discuss Gilgamesh’s (Don Lee) unique beer recipe or Kingo’s (Kumail Nanjiani) documentary about Eternals and their lives, Eternals is flat and lifeless. The patter is mostly insipid, and the jokes are only occasionally funny, leaving a talented cast little to nothing to hold onto. Very seldom does any actor sound like they believe what they are saying, leaving the dialogue to very obviously sound like words being recited and not the real thoughts of flesh and blood (sort of) people. Barry Keoghan is blessed with one of the few characters complex enough in his misanthropy to grab onto; everyone else is surprisingly one note to the point that the dialogue from one character in one scene can be lifted and inserted into another, and it wouldn’t be out of place. Kingo is really into himself, Phaestos never gets to make everything he wants, Dane Whitman (Kit Harington) wonders which historical people the Eternals really were, etc. Zhao the director is never able to overcome the problems delivered by Zhao the screenwriter. She tries hard and when Eternals does occasionally stop to luxuriate in what it has done or to dive headlong into a fight against the Deviants it does perk up. But it just as quickly winds down even as the plot and the backstory become ever more complex. There’s still every reason to think Zhao can deliver that moody, contemplative action spectacle her initial hiring seemed to promise, but this Eternals isn’t it. Joshua Starnes has been writing about film and the entertainment industry since 2004 and served as the President of the Houston Film Critics Society from 2012 to 2019. In 2015, he became a co-owner/publisher of Red 5 Comics and, in 2018, wrote the series “Kulipari: Dreamwalker” for Netflix.

"Nov 2, 2021"," Start with an Ocar-winning director, Chloe Zhao, hot off critical darling Nomadland. Add in a ridiculously exciting cast including Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek,  Gemma Chan, Kit Harington and Richard Madden (yup, Jon Snow and Robb Stark). Mix in the most broadly diverse blockbuster cast and themes ever, including deaf actress Lauren Midloff, Marvel’s actual first sex scene and a proper gay relationship and gay kiss. Layer it all over an epic story spanning thousands of years that taps into many of our world’s oldest myths. Shake it all together and what do you get? A big fat snooze, that’s what. Much has been said about people complaining they wanted Marvel to try something different, and then complaining when they do. Let's be clear, that is not the problem here. What’s worse is that there are so many flickers of fabulous texture and life struggling valiantly to get out, that it makes the general inertia and frustrating flatness even more painful.  I just couldn’t escape the sneaking sensation that Zhao is faintly embarrassed by all this superhero stuff.  The perfunctory action scenes fast become repetitive and the classic superhero moments like posturing line-ups or descending like gods from the sky are often handled with long shots rather than spine-tingling close-ups and a knowing wink.  These monsters are a decidedly dull 'big bad', who generally seem indistinguishable and have little discernable motivation beyond stomping and snacking on passing humans. A clumsy third act introduction of sentience and (well-deserved) bid for sympathy is creakily too little, too late and then too easily dismissed. The Eternals themselves each have extraordinary powers. Jolie’s Thena is a mighty warrior, Midloff’s Makkari has super-speed, Kumail Nanjiani’s Kingo shoots energy bombs from his fingertips (when he’s not hilariously moonlighting as a Bollywood star) and Madden’s Ikaris is basically Superman with superstrength, flight and laser-beam eyes. And so on. There are some great revelations, devastating (in theory but just not on screen) betrayals and losses, and a potentially globally catastrophic climax. Yet none of it manages to thrill or dazzle. Or remotely move, despite the excellent cast’s best efforts. Zhao’s characters visibly come alive in civvies, gathered around meal tables, bickering and bantering with glimpses of fascinatingly textured dynamics built up over millennia. But put them back in spandex and it all goes stiffer than Angelina’s forehead. They all have supposedly complex psychological layers but it is all handled so heavy-handledly that it jars and judders, when more 'traditional' Marvel movies have made us think and feel far more deeply with breezy ease. None of this is helped by a fatally underwhelming score by the usually excellent Rami Djawadi which apparently wilfully fails to stir in the big tentpole moments and is rather toe-curlingly twee in the emotional punches. There are also far too many scenes with no music at all, which is all very well for indie auteur kitchen sink dramas but exposes how inept and prosaic too much of the dialogue is. Hayek, in particular, as maternal Eternals leader Ajak is lumbered with some corkers, halfway between clunky exposition and Hallmark card kitch. However, the two most energising and exciting moments come in the end credits scenes which I can’t spoil here but both promise a massive injection of energy and, dare I say it, fun, for the sequel. A certain former boyband superstar looks set to cement himself as a bonafide Hollywood star. Despite all the flaws, there is so much intriguing raw material here that I definitely want to see more, just with a different approach and, I’m sorry to say, a different director.",NEUTRAL
"Nov 2, 2021","The single most unique and visually stunning Marvel movie ever... a return to the Grand Hollywood Epic on the biggest scale possible. While it, understandably, may not work for some, this behemoth of a picture is a hugely welcome and refreshing entry",POSITIVE
"Nov 2, 2021"," The Marvel Cinematic Universe has been knocking around for some thirteen years now, and this week sees the release of its 26th theatrical film. It is an enormous element in pop culture, not just in the USA where the films are made but genuinely on a global level. It is an impressive achievement, but it is clearly going to be harder and harder in the future to maintain audience interest in the films and for those films to keep the general level of quality that has made them so widely popular. There are three key problems that I can perceive. The first is the long-term risk of audiences tiring of the superhero blend of science fiction and fantasy. There was a time when westerns were all the rage, but they fell out of fashion. There was another time when you couldn’t toss a coin into a cinema without hitting a slasher flick. Both these genres remain today, but neither is as popular as they were. It is unlikely they will ever be. Sooner or later, the superhero market is simply going to move on. The second risk is that constructing a shared universe requires an unfortunate amount of homogenisation. Those original Marvel Studios features – Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Captain America: The First Avenger, and Thor – all presented varied styles of tone and genre. Once all four were collected into a single movie (2012’s The Avengers) those same tones had to be crudely hammered into a single format and the same visual and narrative cadence. Since then Marvel’s films have increasingly adopted similar plot structures, aesthetics, and senses of humour. It helps to unify the overall franchise, and it results in bona-fide knockouts like Avengers: Infinity War, but it does risk wearing the audience out sooner or later. Finally there is always the risk that sooner or later Marvel Studios will green-light a new film that simply doesn’t capture a mass audience’s attention. To an extent the overall Marvel brand has deflected this issue for some years. Guardians of the Galaxy and Captain Marvel were hardly household names, yet both were the kind of global hit that other studios are increasingly only dreaming about. Marvel still have some high-power IP sitting in the queue, essentially all of the X-Men and Namor the Sub-Mariner, but getting an audience on-side purely on corporate brand and not specific character interest is always going to be much harder. I thought about all three problems while watching Eternals, the latest Marvel Studios feature. It is, as noted above, the 26th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is not a bad film, but it is an unsatisfying one. It feels less like a narrative feature and more like commercial content: a means for Marvel’s owner Disney to continue dominating global box office for a few weeks until their next product rolls in. Not that I am against commercial product. I have always been an enthused fan of Disney, but their Achilles’ heel is their sheer corporate nature. When one of their blockbusters allows room for a directorial vision and a modicum of originality, they regularly make some of the best mainstream entertainment in the business. When they reign that creativity in, the sheer quantity of money and committee-based thinking becomes crystal clear. Eternals comes from director Chloé Zhao, who previous film was the Academy Award-winning Nomadland. You would be hard-pressed to recognise her style here, any more than you could recognise Cate Shortland’s behind Black Widow or Jon Watts behind the recent Spider-Man movies. It is that homogenisation effect in play: while Marvel Studios continue to exercise such a strong authorial hand over their films, they are essentially wasting opportunities in hiring some outstanding talent. The film has an insurmountable problem shoehorning its premise and characters into the MCU. The Eternals are not a popular set of characters among comic book fans. They have never been adapted to other media before, so the general audience has likely never heard of them. To present their obscurity on an understandable scale: there have been 53 issues of Eternals published by Marvel Comics. This compares to about 625 issues of Iron Man, 735 issues of Captain America, and even 110 issues of Guardians of the Galaxy. Marvel Studios have never previously released a film based on a property so untested with audiences, and so obscure with them too. This problem is compounded by there being a team of 10 new characters to introduce, each with their own separate personality, super power set, and names. On top of that, they have an origin and set-up so comparatively complex that it takes several paragraphs of scrolling pre-credits text and a running time of 157 minutes to fully explain it. The story, in broad terms: all-powerful aliens known as the Celestials manipulated the development of countless planets, including the Earth. When a plan to speed up evolution using their own engineering species the Deviants failed, the Celestials created the Eternals to travel to each planet and wipe the Deviants out. On Earth, 10 Eternals have lived among humanity for 7,000 years – but after completing their mission 500 years ago they are faced with combating the Deviants once again. Eternals is slow. Much of its running time is devoted to the team – who largely have not seen each other in centuries – getting back together. This is interspersed with a series of flashbacks that illuminate the characters and explore why they separated in the 1500s. Eternals is also a weirdly lonely picture. The characters spend a lot of time talking about humanity and the human race, but very little time around them. By-and-large they don’t fight any characters, simply monsters. The scale of the story is huge, and involves nothing less than saving the entire planet, but it is a very empty vista that is being saved. Apart from a few uncomfortably inserted references to the broader MCU, this is probably the most self-contained MCU film since Iron Man. The most awkward link comes when the film tries to explain why, if the Eternals have lived on Earth for 7,000 years, they failed to intervene in Avengers: Infinity War. There is an answer, but it is necessarily a woolly and unconvincing one. Of course there are some thing we can almost take for granted with Marvel movies. Eternals is never less than absolutely beautiful to look at, with strong cinematography by Ben Davis and stunning design work in both costuming and visual effects. The flashbacks offer wonderful set-ups of everything from Aztec-era Mexico to the hanging gardens of Babylon. The cast is also top-notch. Salma Hayek and Angelina Jolie offer the star power, but the heavy-hitters here include Gemma Chan as Sersi, Kumail Nanjiani as Kingo, and Lauren Ridoff as Makkari. It is fantastic to see Marvel Studios cast Ridoff, a deaf actor, as the MCU’s first deaf superhero. It feels progressive, but also natural. The film also boasts the MCU’s first openly gay superhero too, Brian Tyree Henry’s Phastos, although as with Disney’s Jungle Cruise it is hard not to notice that the character is always one or two judicious edits away from being straightened (one has to keep those homophobic markets happy). This is not the worst film in the Marvel Studios stable, although I am sure debate will rage on about what precisely is the worst. It is, however, the least interesting. There are good ideas here, and they have visibly been put together by very talented people. The film’s problem is that it is always too much or little, and never quite the right amount. Too many characters, too little plot, too many flashbacks, not enough action, and too much conversation. It looks and sounds so much like Marvel generally, but then is too separate from that ongoing narrative to make such a choice worthwhile. It will probably still be a commercial success, since Marvel Studios seem to be such a runaway freight train in theatres, but my gut feeling is a lot of viewers will have forgotten most of it by the time the next Marvel adventure comes along. (Which is in about six weeks, by the way. Marvel Studios really are out of control.) Two brief notes for the hardcore Marvel enthusiasts. Yes there is the debut of another fairly obscure Marvel hero, although they will slip by most viewers. Yes there is at least a mid-credits bonus scene. It meant very little to me, but apparently if you’re 20 years younger than me it will make you scream enthusiastically. I know that it’s difficult to tell from box office takings thanks to COVID, but I’m curious how much of the world at large felt that Endgame was the ideal time to hop off the MCU train, versus how many are still keen to continue the ride.",NEUTRAL

minutes, “Eternals” also feels like centuries in the viewing. In any event, the
Eternals, whose names indicate the fact that they inspired the ancient gods and
heroes, have waged battles against Deviant irruptions throughout history. As
the movie opens, in contemporary days, they’ve not been faced with Deviant
activity since the Spanish conquest of the Americas in the sixteenth century,
when their victory seemed to be decisive. 
But suddenly the Deviants have shown up again, and they must reassemble. Their leader is Ajak (Salma Hayek), a spiritual sort with healing powers who communicates with Arishem (voiced by David Kaye), their Celestial “handler” who appears as a huge helmeted figure in the sky.  She comes out of her quiet life in the rural American Midwest when a Deviant emerges from a London canal, confronting Sersi (Gemma Chan), a matter-controller who has been living as a museum researcher while also acting as big sister to Sprite (Lia McHugh), who remains eternally twelve years old and can bring illusions to life.  Sersi is carrying on a romantic relationship with a human, Dane Whitman (Kit Harington), although she carries a torch for Ikaris (Richard Madden), a handsome Superman-like fellow who can fly and shoot destructive energy beams from his eyes.  He’s long been gone somewhere, but shows up to help Sersi and Sprite against the Deviant. That’s just the beginning.  Also called back to action are Gilgamesh (Don Lee), a strongman type; Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), a super-speedster; and Thena (Angelina Jolie), the great warrior and weapons-mistress, but with anger issues.  They return to service voluntarily, but three others must be coaxed: Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), who can project bursts of energy from his hands but is reluctant to abandon his career as a Bollywood superstar; Druig (Barry Keoghan), who can control human minds and has withdrawn into the Amazon rainforest in disgust that the Celestials have forbidden him to use his power to end human violence; and Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), the master inventor appalled by the fact that his technology has been perverted into instruments of destruction and has settled into domesticity with his husband (Haaz Sleiman) and their young son Jack (Esai Daniel Cross). Certainly they’re a diverse group—the makers have bent over backwards in that respect, in terms of both gender and ethnicity; and, of course, it’s notable that Pharos is gay and Makkari deaf.  But nothing much is done with these differences; once they’re checked off, as if on some sort of honor role, that’s it.  And of course the actors can’t do much but play the single note assigned them. Soulful Henry and comic-relief Nanjiani come off best, and Madden worst: stiff, impassive Ikaris, despite having the most formidable powers in the group, is easily one of the most boring superheroes ever concocted, and the actor’s stony depiction of him is just as drab. In only a few instances do we get to spend much time with individual human beings—Pharos’ husband and son, or Whitman (who may, in fact, be something more than human anyway, as another post-credits scene suggests).  In fact, the real earthling we see most of is Harish Patel as Karun, Kingo’s manager, who follows him (and his fellow Eternals) around with a camera to document his master’s adventures.  And he’s portrayed as a likable schlub, a comic foil totally dependent—like all others of his sort—on the kindness (or lack thereof) bestowed on him by extraterrestrials.  Human beings are really peripheral creatures here, mere pawns in a vast cosmic game. That might remind you of the underlying theme of Stanley Kubrick’s “2001,” and the shape of the Eternal’s ship bears a striking resemblance to the black monolith from that classic.  But a comparison of that film’s cerebral thoughtfulness to this one’s vacuity is devastating.  Whether you feel he succeeded or not, Kubrick was attempting to get his viewers to think; in this case Zhao is merely trying to give hers the usual Marvel thrill.  And even in this she fails: “Eternals” is one of the least engaging of all the Marvel movies—big and splashy but lumbering and strangely dull.",NEGATIVE
"Nov 2, 2021"," Many fans of director Chloé Zhao’s intimate, personal films — such as the powerful “The Rider” and last year’s best-picture Oscar winner “Nomadland” — were perplexed it was announced that she would be directing the $200 million “Eternals” for Marvel. And they’ll still be baffled after watching the movie, a disappointing, wearying mash-up of superhero tropes. The Eternals are an ancient race of superhumans created eons ago by the Celestials to protect Earth against the monsters known as The Deviants. And, yes, they live in the same Marvel Cinematic Universe as the Avengers as the latter are referenced (and, yes, stick through the end credits for the usual Marvel teasers). That the Eternals span generations allows Zhao, who wrote the script with Patrick Burleagh and Ryan Firpo, to recreate ancient worlds and “Eternals,” opening Nov. 5 throughout Houston, positively shimmers. Zhao’s films always are shot beautifully and “Eternals” is no exception. The problem is with the people. There are so many Eternals — Ikaris (Richard Madden), Sersi (Gemma Chan), Ajak (Salma Hayek), Thena (Angelina Jolie), Phastos (Bryan Tyree Henry), Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), Druig (Barry Keoghan), Gilgamesh (Don Lee), Makkari (Lauren Ridloff)and Sprite (Lia McHugh) — that most are little more than cardboard character sketches battling CGI-created monsters for 2.5 hours. Even much of the humor and interpersonal camaraderie among the Eternals, at which the best of these movies pull off, fall flat. The movie hints at something deeper when a couple of them are conflicted by real-world issues — Phastos having to leave behind his husband Ben (Haaz Sleiman) and son to rejoin the Eternals; Thena’s crumbling mental health due to her especially advanced age — but all of that has to be put on the back seat for not particularly inspired action. “Eternals” makes history as the most diverse superhero movie in terms of race, gender, orientation, age and abilities (Ridloff is deaf) and that’s remarkable in terms of representation. But that doesn’t change the fact that they’re stuck in a story that’s dull and predictable.

"Nov 1, 2021"," Maybe it’s the result of naiveté, or just a surfeit of misplaced optimism, but it has been sad to witness the incessant pile-on that Chloé Zhao’s Eternals has received pretty much from the second it was made public that she would be directing this studio behemoth. Based on the morsels of pre-release marketing and the oblique soundbites that interviewers could extract from the Oscar-winning filmmaker while on the Nomadland press tour, the film has been the subject of an all-guns-blazing online dunking campaign from minute one. As someone who is, in the main, not a fan of the CG-powered pyramid scheme that is the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it may seem a little strange to have suddenly crossed the floor to stand on the side of the defence. Yet it seems so puzzling that this film in particular would get so much shit sight unseen, as even if Zhao was only able to bring, at most, 50 per cent of her ethereal “touch” to what would otherwise be an over-oiled corporate product, then that is most assuredly a reason to be cheerful, is it not? When an early rash of tastemakers, fans and insiders (whatever that means) were shown a sneak-peek of Eternals, their reactions suggested that they had no real idea what to make of it. The typical I-saw-it-first hyperbole was wreathed in doubt, maybe suggesting that they wanted to circle a bit to see what the next wave of viewers would make of it before they pinned their colours to the MCU mast. Some saw this muted response as affirmation of the anti-hype, but perhaps Zhao had done something to, if not break the template, then re-shape it in her own image. What she has delivered is a version of the MCU that throws caution into the wind, that embraces and articulates grand philosophical notions in a way that is neither glib nor infantilised, and brings together an ensemble who have chemistry beyond being able to trade over-written quips with one-another. There are rough edges, and scenes that are terribly misjudged – maybe close your eyes and block your ears when Brian Tyree Henry crops up in the smouldering nuclear fallout radius of the Hiroshima bombing. But the good far outweighs the bad. Nudging aside some of these trifling missteps, Zhao has made a film which turns the boilerplate End Of The World story arc into something that’s lugubrious and melancholy. There’s a satisfying lack of triumphalism in this stately epic, displaced by a feeling of resignation and a sense that, when we do finally bring about our collective demise, it’ll be sudden and painless, like a light being switched off – we’ll never know what happened. The Eternals themselves are a colour-coded clique of ageless, god-like superbeings who are sent to earth to protect the human race from a band of marauding and highly symbolic dinosaur-like beasties called the Deviants. Their orders have been passed down by an almighty galactic being called Arishem, a Celestial, who has stated that they should only destroy Deviants and not intervene in any of the other violent struggles that people may bring about by themselves. It’s a simple request that, we discover, proves difficult to follow. They are, in essence, humanity’s caretakers. From the intimations of the opening drag, which supplies the broad context of the Eternals’ apparent raison d’etre with a few portentous additions, it’s clear that we are in the company of tragic figures. It’s refreshing for one of these films to state, prior to any images appearing on the screen, that the superheroes we’re about to spend time with are maybe not super, nor are they heroes, and that there’s something much bigger than them lurking in the background. A sense of inevitable futility lingers across the film’s entire runtime. Though theirs is a fairly egalitarian crew, there are dominant characters in the mix. The first is Salma Hayek’s Ajak whose main power is communicating with the Celestials and is more like a beloved sage than a fighting force. The second is Richard Madden’s Ikaris, who shares similar special abilities to the X-Men’s Cyclops, in that he fires lasers from his eyes and can fly – placing him in the vaunted position of the most physically powerful. Finally there’s Gemma Chan’s Sersi, who is nudged forward as the film’s central character, or at least its moral nucleus. She’s someone who is clearly committed to the Eternals’ cause, but hasn’t quite worked out what her strange abilities are good for (she can transform the state of solid objects). Chan delivers one of the most remarkable and credibly earnest performances in the MCU thus far. The restraint of her line-readings and the air of irritable confusion she brings to the high-stakes situations in which she finds herself result in a superhero who is caught between emotions, at once depressed and at peace with her ultimate lack of function. She is a kindred spirit to Nomadland’s Fern, a passive, cloistered observer who is, via the breathless spectacle of the landscape, given renewed fervour to extend her existence and see what else is out there. She is unpretentious, and beyond an innate goodness, she doesn’t know what drives her. What’s interesting about Eternals is how genuinely down to earth most of it is, rejecting the time-honoured duality of the flashy superhero who also has to contend with the banality of domestic life. This is more like reality, in that it is about coming to terms with smallness and impotence in the face of so much cosmic sprawl. Even the much touted diversity of the Eternals themselves – who count among them the MCU’s first deaf character and first Black gay character – is employed to represent the realities of the human race through history rather than as a route to point-scoring progressiveness. Elsewhere Zhao has been vocal about her love of the cinema of Terrence Malick, and it’s great to see how much of his imagery and philosophy is baked into this story, rather than just idly namechecked. There is a breathtaking sequence near the centre of the film which is like a miniature remix of Malick’s own 2016 pseudo documentary, Voyage of Time, where the balletic, alchemical and unfathomable formulation of the universe is juxtaposed with the tactile intimacy of human life. This isn’t snuck in at the margins, but front and centre of the whole damn enterprise. So there’s angular, depressive characters and a rumination on the destructive nature of time, but one of the film’s main accomplishments is that, in its expansive plot, anonymous antagonists and sceptical conception of the heroic saviour, it comes across as a quietly savage deconstruction of the superhero genre itself. Where films such as Iron Man 3, Thor: Ragnarok and Guardians of the Galaxy gave us self-satisfied riffs on the MCU’s own superhero lore, here it feels like Zhao is giving us an X-ray of a superhero movie – we can actually see the bones underneath the skin, and it’s not conventionally pretty. This may read like an attempt to flip faults into virtues, to reframe the things that make it “bad” as the things that actually make it interesting and worthwhile, but this is a film that is valuable as much for what it doesn’t do as what it does. Its laconic sweep is peppered with action sequences to keep things ticking in the peanut gallery, but more important is that Zhao does have something to say, and she is not being hamstrung by all the contrived multiverse tie-ins required of the MCU’s central pillar of films. Indeed, it’s bracing to watch one of these films without having to worry that you’ve missed a billion references to other IP brand extensions (even the post-credit stings, which are essentially pre-trailer trailers, are jokily pointless). Maybe the Tomatometer has levelled its judgement, and Zhao will end up being the last time that Kevin Feige risks bringing a serious auteur into the MCU coven. But conversely, there’s always hope that this admirable if slightly misshapen existential missive that’s disguised as a superhero movie will find its own fanbase in the years to come.

"Nov 1, 2021"," Chloe Zhao’s Eternals is Marvel’s latest foray into cosmic expansion, which started with the first Thor and continued into the Guardians of the Galaxy films, ultimately leading to the introduction of Thanos. These attempts to grow the Marvel universe can be applauded for their ambition, but too often the incorporation of new mythology clashes with the mainstream blockbuster instincts to simplify for all audiences. Soon, whatever visual or mythological novelty these films contain gets bogged down in extended scenes of exposition, creating a sluggishly-paced film that too often feels like a very expensive Wikipedia entry. Zhao does what she can to elevate the tone and narrative stakes of Eternals, but her film isn’t immune to these same pitfalls and the result is a great-looking, well-acted film that never seems to invite its audience into the elaborate world it is working so hard to create.  With such narrative complexity, it can be difficult to describe the story without giving away too much, as there are big reveals every thirty minutes or so. The long and short of it is that thousands of years ago, cosmic beings known as Celestials sent out a group of super-powered beings known as Eternals to defend mankind against a race of murderous animals known as Deviants. Having successfully accomplished their mission thousands of years ago, the Eternals go their separate ways, remaining on Earth until they are commanded back to their home planet. As our story begins, Eternals Sersi (Gemma Chan) and Ikaris (Richard Madden) reunite when a new Deviant reveals itself, forcing them to get the rest of the Eternals back together to figure out the mystery of its existence. Of course, we know that at the core of that mystery is a series of lies and betrayals that force the Eternals to question their purpose and the perceived benevolence of the Celestials themselves. This is hardly a spoiler, as it all fits into the larger Marvel narrative, in which the systems in place meant to protect the status quo – from S.H.I.E.L.D. to Stark Industries to the Presidency itself – are shown to be corrupt, ultimately used as instruments of oppression and death. Marvel’s continued attempt to undercut its own mainstream status by embracing a cheap anti-establishment stance could have worked in small doses, but when it’s as consistent as this, it actually works to undermine the story elements, as the audience will inevitably find itself waiting for the big moment when it turns out “nothing is as it seems”, knowing from the outset that it’ll come sooner or later. In the case of Eternals, however, these reveals work with the rest of the material – which sees our heroes lamenting the specific sins of Western Civilization while never quite finding the time to witness any Eastern transgressions – to suggest a uniquely counter-cultural agenda that can be off-putting in what battles it chooses to pick. This would-be punk rock stance is better left to the atrocious superhero series The Boys instead of a film as lofty as this. The cast does what it can, which is saying a lot. The film features a strong ensemble of reliable actors whose earnestness and humanity help to bring these otherwise-flat characters to life. Faring the best is Kumail Nanjiani as Kingo, the cocky Eternal who reinvents himself as a Bollywood star. Nanjiani has always been able to bring a nice mix of arrogance and insecurity to his roles, and his ability to stand outside the portentous tone of the film while still being invested in the story is refreshing. The always-interesting Barry Keoghan and Brian Tyree Henry turn in solid supporting roles and every moment spent with them is a joy.  As dependable as the cast is, there’s only so much they can do with a script that is so laden with exposition. While the mythology of the film is fascinating, it is so dense that the only way to clearly convey it to the audience is to bring the action to a halt so that the film can all but pull out a whiteboard and explain it directly to the audience. Even the best actors struggle when burdened with this much pure information to communicate, and the film suffers for its refusal to allow these cosmic concepts to speak for themselves and let the audience try to catch up. Certainly, nobody goes to a Marvel film expecting 2001: A Space Odyssey, but one can’t help but wonder how invigorating it would be if these films – which have embraced formula to such an extent as to become rote – took some narrative and stylistic risks and let some concepts remain nebulous.  To be sure, the visual aesthetic of the film could more than stand up to any ethereal qualities that the director might have embraced. While not quite matching the gorgeous look of Chloe Zhao’s previous film Nomadland, the beauty with which she and cinematographer Ben Davis capture the Earth’s landscapes – as seen through the eyes of immortals – cannot be overstated. Where the script is too often reductive of the grand concepts being contemplated, the camera and visual effects genuinely convey a sense of cosmic scale, both intimate and epic. In the end, Eternals is a fine movie – and sometimes significantly more than that – that is too mired in exposition and predictable, franchise-informed plotting. It takes a few narrative risks but quickly sabotages them by overexplaining them. As always, it will be interesting to see where the Eternals fit into the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe, but that may be the primary point of interest here. And when the audience is more enticed about what will happen next than they are engaged with what is happening right now, that’s an indicator of a lack of immediate investment on the part of the storytellers, who are possibly too weighed down by the details of this particular mythology to find creative and exciting ways to explore it. ",NEGATIVE
"Nov 1, 2021"," The Marvel Cinematic Universe is thirteen years and twenty-six movies old, reaching its record-breaking level of success by delivering exactly what its audience expects, every time. Going to see a Marvel movie means buff, shirtless superheroes, fun fight choreography, comic book quips, and a big, smashy CGI battle to wrap it all up before dropping hints for the next go-round — coming soon to theaters near you. This is not a criticism of Marvel's formula. It's a creative accomplishment to hit upon what works one time. So, finding a way to do it repeatedly — to the tune of twenty-plus billion dollars — is nothing short of miraculous. Yet this formula means that any deviation, like Marvel's Eternals, is going to freak people out.  Eternals was always going to be a bit of a weird one. This super-team of cosmic beings has allegedly existed since before the dawn of human civilization, protecting the MCU's earth from gooey dinosaur-looking evils called Deviants. These heroes are the MCU's explanation for epic figures in mythology, like the super strength of Sumerian legend Gilgamesh (Don Lee), the goddess of war being named Thena (Angelina Jolie), the flying wonder Ikaris (Richard Madden), the Odyssey's matter-transforming witch Sersi (Gemma Chan), and more.  They are more powerful than — but do not hang out with — the Avengers. They did not help with Thanos for the same reason they let slavery happen, which is because a planet-sized Celestial creation god, who tells them what to do, said no. The Eternals are complicated, messy, and their very existence rocks what we know about the MCU's origins. Yet this is only one way that Eternals immediately stands out from all of the preceding movies.  This movie looks different from the rest of the MCU, with a bluish color correction that stands in stark contrast with the candy-colored worlds of Spider-Man or the Guardians of the Galaxy. The Eternals themselves look different as well, as the relatively homogenous Marvel heroes of the past give way to a super-team more diverse and inclusive than literally all of the past MCU films combined. Helmed by Academy Award-winning director Chloé Zhao, the movie feels different, with a tone somewhere between biblical epic, family drama, and, you know, a movie where hot people shoot lasers out of their eyes.  These differences and others are intentional, but they do not make Eternals a bad movie, or even a bad entry into the MCU franchise. Eternals simply changes what a Marvel movie can be, for better and for worse.  On the side of better, Eternals exposes some of the MCU's key flaws by succeeding at what most films in the franchise have failed to accomplish in past entries. The MCU is not good at romance and sometimes struggles to build believable relationships between its heroes. Eternals knocks both of those challenges out of the park. These Eternals have lived-in relationships. Their devotion to each other is deep and sometimes romantically hefty, far beyond what the MCU has even attempted in any other movie. There's even a sex scene — a franchise first!  These relationships come alive with a cast that brings their A-game to creating ten new epic heroes. Angelina Jolie is a standout as Thena, a living embodiment of war, who is as smooth and sarcastic as she is deadly. Playing Druig and Makkari, Barry Keoghan and Lauren Ridloff don't waste a second of their screen time, generating their characters' chemistry even when they're in the background of a scene. And as Phastos, Brian Tyree Henry is an emotional cornerstone of the film. His character defies the cold, mechanical stereotype of a tinkering quartermaster and is the MCU's first openly gay hero. While the Eternals themselves and their relationships are a high point of their introductory film, Eternals trips up in a few other categories. The ""natural"" look of its on-location shooting makes for some breathtaking shots. But the movie is too long and has far too much to do to linger endlessly on sprawling grey vistas.  The closest thing this film has to a villain is inscrutable. They could cut an entire lesser antagonist from the plot and change nothing about the movie. Eternals also expects people to handwave the implications of its characters' backgrounds as the plot moves along. But it's difficult to focus on the next fight scene when the audience just learned that one of their heroes engineered an exodus of Mesoamerican refugees during the Spanish conquests. Eternals is different, yes, but it's not bad on its own. Whether or not fans will accept Earth's Far Mightier Heroes hedges on what the plan is for the Eternals. Right now, it feels singular in its triumphs and outright weird when it goes wrong. This is a result of this movie carving a new niche in the MCU that changes the origins of its universe while declining to interact with anything recognizable. It will likely sit alone in that niche until somebody explains why we need the Eternals in the MCU at all.  Alexis Nedd is a senior entertainment reporter at Mashable.

"Nov 1, 2021"," When it comes to their respective cinematic universes, the primary difference between DC and Marvel has been this: DC paints in broad strokes of mythic legends and stories in a contemporary setting. Marvel keeps things mostly focusing on character. Of course, both switch it up from time to time, but that’s been the general dynamic, even during Infinity War/Endgame for Marvel and Shazam!/Birds of Prey for DC. Eternals is Marvel doing the DC thing, where the saga eschews the intimacy of character and goes Big Picture — so much so that much of it was shot with IMAX cameras — and it’s the first time that Marvel seems to be chasing “prestige,” going so far as to bring in Academy Award-winning director Chloé Zhao to helm. Zhao, hired before her Nomadland win, brings her formidable talents and vision to the MCU, telling a several thousand-year story and covering an awful lot of ground. Eternals in the Marvel Cinematic Universe were inevitable; this is a mythology, after all, and mythologies need a religion. Stan Lee and Jack Kirby may not have had that in mind when they first put ink to paper, but eventually, a deeper exploration of this world they created needed to happen, and Jack Kirby was especially up to the task of creating a universe full of Celestials, Eternals, and Deviants, forming a solid backbone to their body of work. Stan Lee knew what made their characters tick, but Jack Kirby knew the universe they lived in, and filled it with all kinds of imaginative flights of fancy, only limited by the margins of the paper he created it on. It is a long way from an industrialist building a suit of armor, or a high school student bitten by a radioactive spider, but they all reside in that universe. Eternals spans thousands of years as immortal beings, created by the godlike Celestials, steward Earth and humanity. The Eternals are there to shield humanity from the Deviants, monstrous otherworldly creatures that serve as inspiration for our myths and legends. So do the Eternals: Sersi (Gemma Chan), who can change the physical aspects of anything; Ikaris (Richard Madden), our Superman equivalent, who can fly, and has super strength and energy vision; Thena (Angelina Jolie), the goddess of War and a relentless warrior; and Ajak (Salma Hayek), who has unprecedented healing abilities but more importantly, leads them and is the communication conduit to the Celestials. There’s also Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), who shoots energy orbs and in his spare time is the world’s best-known celebrity; Sprite (Lia McHugh), forever trapped in a 12-year-old’s body and has the power of illusion; Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), who can invent anything, for any task; Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), who has ultrafast speed and reflexes; Druig (Barry Keoghan), who can manipulate the mind of any human on the planet; and Gilgamesh (Don Lee), a warrior with fists that can demolish anything and anyone in his path, and a longtime companion to Thena. Despite their vows of non-interference, the Eternals have still managed to guide and nurture humanity in their different ways, entering our histories and becoming part of the fabric of our religions and myths. However, their time here has taken its toll on all of them despite their immortality; Thena suffers from visions of past wars, and only Gilgamesh can still her violent heart. Druig has seen humanity destroy each other and has decided to take an active role. Phastos has given humanity the tools to succeed, only to see them use those tools to destroy themselves. Their choices have shaped our reality. It has been many years since any Deviants threatened humanity, and the Eternals live quiet lives on Earth, not interfering, not even during the Blip when Thanos erased half of all life in the universe. But the events of Endgame have changed things. The Deviants have returned, stronger than ever. Ajak is suddenly attacked and killed, leaving Sersi in charge. The Celestials have taken a new interest in Earth, and the Eternals’ time may be ending. They must now choose to be a part of the world they have stewarded over the millennia or abandon the world that they have all grown to love. Eternals works best when we are dealing with these characters’ struggles and conflicts, and all the performances are up to the task. Everyone will have their favorites – mine is the work of Angelina Jolie and Don Lee, as Jolie’s Thena suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, and Lee’s Gilgamesh is her steady rock over many years. They are each other’s anchor and have a nice chemistry together, and Jolie makes her struggles feel real – Thena may be an immortal being, but a forever war has taken its toll upon her, and she carries it like a weight. Kumail Nanjiani is the source of much of Eternals’ humor, while Brian Tyree Henry and Barry Keoghan give us much of the film’s heart. Henry’s Phastos is weary but cannot help but love these humans even as they struggle, while Druig’s anger dominates his behavior, and Keoghan fills him with righteous fury. Gemma Chan and Richard Madden are the center for much of Eternals’ narrative thrust, but they each have their own passions and wants. It is the scope of Eternals’ story, however, that gives us the film’s main structural issue – this story would have been better served as a limited Disney+ series along the lines of WandaVision and Loki. While Eternals is a gorgeous-looking movie, filling the IMAX screen with beautiful imagery that looks remarkable in a theater, this is an intricate story with a lot of moving parts, and it needs time to tell itself properly. Even at an almost three-hour running time, Eternals is telling a story that spans millennia, and it took many writers over 60 years of comics mythology to attempt to tackle it. You feel those almost three hours, too. Much of Eternals is spent in conversations with characters laying out the rules of the world and their motivations within it, and this is something that modern television excels at, but which blockbuster cinema still struggles. The last act gives us these characters in conflict, and while we’ve seen this down well by Marvel before, this time, after this deep examination of the underpinnings of this Marvel Cinematic Universe, it feels routine and anticlimactic. Telling that story requires a different sort of attention than we have seen so far, someone with vision and a unique sensibility that can challenge the audience’s perception of the larger story. A fiercely independent filmmaker like Chloé Zhao seems perfectly fitted for the task. Indeed, the best stuff in Eternals happens when Zhao breaks us free of the template these movies have shared for more than ten years now when we get a look at the machinery behind all the legends and myths and can see the larger universe with perspective. Eternals also falls trap to the same rhythms we have seen before, with many characters punching other characters and waving their arms about making CGI magic. Those story beats are the blood and bones of these movies, and I understand the difficulty in breaking the pattern. When Zhao does, we get compelling storytelling, impressive visuals, and a deeper vision than we have seen before. But Eternals struggles more than it doesn’t. The main conflict of the film is not in these characters – it is between Zhao’s independent streak and the corporate needs of Marvel Studios. I am certain that Eternals will be very important in the Marvel films to come. So many of the films we have gotten since Endgame have been Marvel setting stakes for future films and television installments. At some point, Marvel has to deliver on everything it has set up so far. Until then, I expect we will get much more worldbuilding, but at some point, you have to let that world spin. Eternals is not a bad movie. It is ambitious and tries hard to be different from the rest. However, it is ultimately unsatisfying in that most of the film is full of promises for other stories to come. Let us hope those promises are not empty ones.

"Nov 1, 2021"," It seems as if Chloé Zhao, Oscar-winning director of “Nomadland” and other intimate, personal films, would be an odd fit to direct a Marvel movie. Zhao’s “Eternals” is as different from “Nomadland” and “The Rider,” which used non-actors alongside professionals to powerful effect, as a movie can be. It’s big, long, its massive budget right there on the screen at all times, and while it’s definitely different, it’s still very much a Marvel Cinematic Universe production. Which is to say it is not just big, it’s unwieldy. The cast is so sprawling it’s spread thin; no one emerges as the central hero (though Gemma Chan, in a winning performance, comes closest). Similarly the villain, or villains, are just kind of meh. It’s clear who we’re to root for. It’s less clear why, other than the universe has heroes and villains and evidently always has, so let’s cheer for the good guys (and gods). Zhao is such a gifted filmmaker, bringing an intimacy to the look and feel of the film that is so different from other MCU installments that it’s at the least intriguing, and at times engrossing. It’s also by far the most diverse entry in the MCU, as most of the 10 Eternals are people of color. There is a gay superhero (and a same-sex kiss), a deaf superhero — there is even a superhero sex scene, of the PG-13 variety. Eternals are sent to planets to protect them from Deviants, vaguely dog-like monsters that shred and eat whoever they find. This bunch of Eternals, this 10, was sent to Earth thousands of years ago. There is Sersi (Chan), Ikaris (Richard Madden), Thena (Angelina Jolie), Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), the forever-teenager Sprite (Lia McHugh), Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), Druig (Barry Keoghan) and Gilgamesh (Don Lee). The leader is Ajak (Salma Hayek). All have different powers. If that sounds like a lot of characters to keep up with, it is. That’s one of the film’s biggest problems — even though it’s a whopping 2 hours and 37 minutes long, there’s not enough time to get to know more than a handful in any kind of meaningful way. Which is too bad, because Zhao’s touch is evident with the ones we get to know best, particularly Sersi, who has fallen in love with a mortal and has adjusted to human life best — as has Phastos, who actually has a husband and child. We meet all of them, darting in and out of their lives — Druig seems like a fascinating character, able to control minds (and Keoghan brings an inscrutability to him) — but there just isn’t enough time to really know them. The Eternals have been around for a lot, having arrived in 5,000 B.C. But they are under orders not to intervene in human conflict, only things involving Deviants. So they’ve had to stand down while knowing they could have prevented or altered wars, for instance, and other atrocities. Druig is particularly upset by having to stand idly by as humanity seems increasingly intent on destroying itself. They’re trapped in a kind of existential limbo, which some deal with more effectively than others. The group has spread out over the centuries, and things have been quiet on the Deviant front. But they start popping up again, and they’re different — they appear to be evolving beyond mindless killing machines. That means getting the band back together, as it were, to stop them. Rounding everyone up takes a bit. One of the best bits in the movie is when they arrive to collect Kingo, who has made himself into Bollywood’s biggest star — he’s playing Ikaris in a film when Ikaris comes to get him, and it’s great, dopey, hilarious. Here Zhao’s direction is particularly good. It’s a human moment, even if humans aren’t the main characters involved. The Eternals will ask themselves a lot of questions on their quest, and some of the answers they find change the course and nature of their mission. As with any MCU entry, the road to salvation lies through a huge CGI battle, along the way to the promise of a sequel. Good for Marvel for giving Zhao the chance. Good for her for taking it. Some of the camera movements, the framing, hint at what might have been. And who knows, what might be in the next one.",NEUTRAL
"Nov 1, 2021"," Meet the Eternals, featured in Marvel’s interminable newest installment bearing their name. A band of ageless superheroes brought to Earth eons ago to protect humanity (a thing they absolutely do not seem to have done, ever). Each with a different boring ability — super-speed, mind-control, one is “the Goddess of War,” and a couple of them can shoot laser beams or something — they appear to have spent their centuries either moping about or meddling in human affairs, like giving us the gift of technology, 2001-style, which comes in the form of a copper knife for some reason. Why would you give humanity weapons? Ask again later. They also fight these dumb aliens called Deviants sometimes. There’s a lot to take in across this 160-minute mammoth, which in addition to introducing a whole new branch of the MCU, has also been charged with diversifying Marvel’s representational bona fides. The cast includes multiple performers of color, including sort-of main character Sersi (Gemma Chan), whose power is turning stuff into other stuff, and Kumail Nanjiani as Kingo (one of the laser beam guys). Bryan Tyree Henry is also here as Phastos (he’s their tech guy), who is also Marvel’s first openly gay character. Makkari (Lauren Ridloff) is also deaf. These may be baby steps as far as progress goes, but that doesn’t make them less laudable. The problem, however, is the characters are barely sketched beyond these identity markers, making, say, more prominent characters like Richard Madden’s Ikaris, who is just a white dude (who also shoots lasers), seem even more dull by comparison. The story they’re populating could also hardly be more generic. There’s an attempt to generate drama by building the plot around a reunion of sorts: the team fractured years ago as their mission seemed to peter out, but the death of their former leader Ajak (Salma Hayek, wasted) brings them back together to confront an old alien threat. A great deal of the story is expository flashback meant to fill in the gaps of their various histories, but it also leads to ludicrous tangents like the reveal that Phastos taught humans how to make the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima (much to his chagrin), or that they’re all actually sort of robots (something that would appear to undercut the stabs at diversity, but let’s not start nitpicking). It all comes under the supervision of newly-Oscar-winning director Chloé Zhao, who in Eternals’ publicity has been named as the one to change the reputation of these films as being visually indistinct. She mostly fails. That’s not because Eternals looks just like all the other MCU films, but because the visual dynamic she’s brought to this one is both drab and ill-used; the on-location vistas she shoots are indeed lovely, but they’ve also been smeared with a bunch of digital doubles and crummy CGI monsters (the Deviants themselves wouldn’t be out of place, design-wise, in some mid-’90s junk or a network sci-fi TV show). That pretty, real sunset still has a bunch of fake people flying around it, throwing computer-generated rocks and stuff. So in the end, it turns out all these half-assed attempts to be more diverse and dynamic have actually left a movie behind that’s as frictionless as possible. Zhao is obviously a capable filmmaker, but her talents are put to no discernible use here. The representationally progressive cast is given nothing to do. The script is still a jumble of clunky dialogue and exposition dumps with no stakes until the typical VFX-packed climactic fights. Eternals is one of the most flavorless films in the Marvel Universe, maybe even ever.",NEGATIVE
"Nov 1, 2021"," The Marvel Cinematic Universe can often be accused of giving off a repetitious feel. Those who don’t dig on the MCU claim that the films do the same things over and over again. Even someone like yours truly, who almost exclusively enjoys the movies, sees some of their argument. Marvel has a formula, one they don’t really waver from. Now, with Eternals, they’ve given Oscar-winning filmmaker Chloé Zhao the most free rein of anyone so far playing in their sandbox. For a while now, speculation ran while that Zhao had used that cache to make a flick unlike anything else we’ve seen from the entertainment giant before. Well, that’s true, but not necessarily in the manner we were hoping for. Over a week after having seen Eternals, I still can’t quite figure out if I liked it or not. Eternals frustrates because parts of it are outstanding. The visuals are unparalleled for a comic book film. Moreover, these superheroes are allowed to be meditative in unique way. Plus, the concept of these heroes and their dogma/powers as seen with a religious lens is quite new. On the other hand, however, the actual action is lacking, the villain is bad even for Marvel standards, and long stretches don’t have much of anything interesting happen. This is the rare case where you can see the independent sensibilities of the storyteller compared to the instincts of the studio, but side with the latter. This is the saga of the Eternals, a group of ancient immortal beings. The race of alien gods, for lack of a better term, are a creation of the Celestials, meant to guard the universe. A group of ten Eternals were sent to Earth over 7,000 years ago as a means of protection against the evil Deviants. Led by Ajak (Salma Hayek), the group spent centuries beating back their villainous counterparts, before being left to their own devices on the planet once the threat was extinguished. Some have retreated away from humanity after the breakup, like Ikaris (Richard Madden), while others, like Sersi (Gemma Chan) and Sprite (Lia McHugh), live among them. In fact, Sersi has a long term relationship with a human in Dane Whitman (Kit Harrington). When a Deviant of a new sort appears, they know they need to get the band back together. Reunited with Ikaris, her ex, Sersi and Sprite go seeking their leader Ajak, knowing it will be time to bring the Eternals together again. They find Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani) hiding in plain sight as a Bollywood star,  while Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry) has found a husband and is happy with their young son in suburbia. Others, like Druig (Barry Keoghan), Gilgamesh (Don Lee), Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), and Thena (Angelina Jolie) are in hiding. As we learn more about the circumstances of their parting, the group faces a bigger and more epic challenge than expected. Truly, the fate of humanity may be in their hands. This is one of the MCU’s most stacked casts for a non-Avengers film. Sadly, not everyone is given the attention they deserve, even in a film with a long running time and space to breathe. Best in show honors go to Kumail Nanjiani, who not just has the most fun Eternals character, but does the most with his time on screen. Don Lee also is very amusing in another somewhat more comedic role, while Brian Tyree Henry is solid in a role we haven’t seen out of Marvel yet. At the same time, Salma Hayek and Angelina Jolie are largely wasted, as is Kit Harrington, while Gemma Chan and Richard Madden are just bland. That’s a shame too, since they’re the heroes Zhao is most interested in. The rest of the Eternals,  Barry Keoghan, Lia McHugh, and Lauren Ridloff, don’t make much of a mark. Rounding out the cast is Harish Patel, among others. Chloé Zhao presents some of the biggest strengths of Eternals with her direction, but also some of its biggest weaknesses with her writing. Zhao oddly gets the harder things right, while struggling with what the easiest aspects of a Marvel movie should be. Zhao’s script, co-written with Patrick Burleigh, Kaz Firpo, and Ryan Firpo, fits with her unhurried pacing, but not with the requirements of the genre. In trying to bend the MCU to a more indie will, the result is beautiful to look at and takes its time to build character, but shortchanges action and overall interest. You’re never in doubt of what Zhao and company were going for, but it’s hard not to think that the powers that be at Marvel wish she’d come a bit more over to their side. They do come up with a hell of an ending, but it’s almost also a reminder of what could have been previously. The MCU is clearly open to a lot of different possibilities going forward, so it’s almost hard to judge Eternals as a one-off. If some of the opportunities suggested here pay off, it will do a lot to help this one’s reputation in the years to come. If that’s not the case, it may age fairly poorly. Enough here is still open-ended, while both of the post credits sequences (which I obviously won’t be spoiling here) strike your interest, that it’s hard not to at least be intrigued about what’s next. Eternals is occasionally stunning, clearly representing the best looking MCU flick to date, but it’s also sometimes its most boring. For every step or two forward, there’s one backwards too. Don’t get me wrong, this is a solid superhero movie, but the potential for something more also holds it back. Overall, the film is worth seeing, whether as a curiosity or out of genuine excitement, but despite Zhao’s talents, just keep your expectations in check. ",POSITIVE
"Nov 1, 2021"," The new film is the first in the Marvel Cinematic Universe to feature a sex scene … which is about six seconds long and as neutered as Groot the talking tree’s genitalia. But the film is the also first MCU flick to include openly queer characters … though their sexual identity is limited to a quick kiss as chaste as that aforementioned sex scene. Oh, and the film is the first Marvel blockbuster to be directed by a filmmaker coming directly off an Academy Award win for Best Picture … a regrettable fact that earns Chloé Zhao (Nomadland) instant ignominy for helming the most embarrassing best-pic follow-up since John G. Avildsen went from the heights of Rocky to the forgotten depths of Slow Dancing in the Big City. I can’t completely fault Zhao for taking on this particular MCU assignment. If you squint hard and hold your nose – maybe plug your ears, too – there are elements in Eternals’ margins that speak to the filmmaker’s long-held interests: heroes’ resilience against impossible odds, the mutable definition of family, the visual poetry of our natural world. It is only that, as Eternals crawls through its 157 minutes of exposition-laden nonsense, all of Zhao’s previous experience helming beautiful, heartbreaking, majestic films – from the hauntingly spare Songs My Brothers Taught Me to the precise drama of The Rider to the generous humanity of Nomadland – is drowned out by the clang of franchise obligations. You know things are going to be dicey when the film opens by dumping a few paragraphs of text onscreen, Star Wars-style, detailing the convoluted history of the Eternals. The short-as-I-can-make-it version: our heroes are ultrasexy, sorta-immortal beings from the planet Olympia, sent to Earth by the godlike Celestial named Arishem to protect humans from alien predators called Deviants. Although I couldn’t stop thinking of these villains as Variants, thanks to both the more enjoyable Disney+ series Loki and the decidedly less-fun coronavirus. Anyway: the Eternals have been hanging out on Earth for thousands of years now – some of them, like the flyboy Ikaris (Richard Madden) inspiring myths along the way – just waiting for word from Arishem as to when they can go home. Hopscotching across continents and centuries, the film’s screenplay – which boasts a confusing credit allocation that lists Zhao twice; once for her own draft, and another alongside Patrick Burleigh, Ryan Firpo and Kaz Firpo – tries desperately to give each of the near-dozen Eternals distinguishable character traits and engaging personalities. But the closest that you’ll ever get to knowing the film’s heroes is by classifying them by their superpowers: the aforementioned Ikaris soars into the sky and shoots laser beams out of his eyes, Makkari (Lauren Ridloff) runs super-fast, Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani) tosses fireballs, Druig (Barry Keoghan) manipulates minds, Thena (Angelina Jolie) creates fantastical weapons out of cosmic energy, and ostensible main hero Sersi (Gemma Chan) turns objects into, um, sand. Or maybe it’s dust. There are a few more Eternals running around – including a badly miscast Salma Hayek as team leader Ajak –- and a handful of normie humans, too (hey there, Kit Harington, nice to see you have a brief Game of Thrones reunion with your Stark bro Madden). But honestly: you’ll either lose track or stop caring or both. As written and illustrated by Marvel Comics legend Jack Kirby, the Eternals and their Celestial overseers were immensely psychedelic cosmic creations, designed to push the limits of the comic-book form. Think H.P. Lovecraft meets the space age meets a fistful of LSD. Translating such a universe to the screen – even in a cinematic franchise that’s already comfortably featured a giant purple alien titan who sits on a floating space throne and a multi-dimensional demon the size of a skyscraper – requires a filmmaker equipped with a surreal sensibility and a passing familiarity with intricate CGI. Regrettably, Zhao is a baffling choice: a filmmaker who is ill-equipped and out of her element, with her discomfort visible across nearly every frame of the film. Certainly, Eternals features the most natural-looking moments of any MCU film: there are briefly gorgeous scenes of magic-hour sunsets and rolling ocean swells, Zhao neatly setting her heroes up as one of two opposing forces of nature. And the filmmaker is afforded one delightful burst of colourful action when she introduces the modern-day version of Kingo, who has become the face of a Bollywood dynasty. (For all of the jokes lobbed Nanjiani’s way when he was photographed bulking up for his Eternals gig, the comedic actor best known for his nerdy roles on Silicon Valley and Portlandia is far and away the most entertaining performer here, wry and charismatic where everyone else is robotically self-serious and gloomy.) Zhao even finds a way to slip in a snippet from Pink Floyd’s Time just as the Marvel Studios logo pops up, implicitly promising a cooler, trippier MCU journey than we’ve come to expect. But ultimately this is a muddy CGI-heavy mess with no genuine thematic or emotional hook. The Deviants look like budget-conscious riffs on Transformers’ Dinobots. The action scenes are alternately boring or baffling. And as much as we’re meant to care about the Eternals’ various personal crises – from the millennia-old romance between Sersi and Ikaris to the helplessness felt by Druig as he watches humanity succumb to war to, um, the regret that Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry) shoulders for sorta-inspiring the bombing of Hiroshima – there are not nearly enough relatable or even coherent moments to sustain interest. For a film so ostensibly concerned with the indelible power of life itself – humanity, we’re told again and again here, is a special force in the universe that’s capable of changing the course of existence – Eternals is shockingly, depressingly lifeless.

"Nov 1, 2021"," Even now, after living through more than a decade of unending success, it's difficult to quantify just how big the Marvel Cinematic Universe is. What started out fairly modestly with the 2008 adventure Iron Man has now turned into such an influential hybrid subgenre of science-fiction, action and fantasy that you can't avoid superhero films no matter how hard you try. The MCU is permeating the entirety of Western cinema, and its true auteur, producer Kevin Feige, is no doubt interested in moving beyond the typical superhero film.  It is to his credit that the umpteenth MCU film, Eternals, does not feel like the standard fare with capes and superpowers. Here is a film co-written and directed by a distinctive auteur in and of herself, the Oscar-winning director Chloé Zhao, whose most recent effort, Nomadland, won last year's Oscar for Best Picture. Here is a film with a proudly diverse cast, in terms of gender, race and sexuality.  But here is a film whose surface-level attributes seem intended to mask the emptiness underneath. Yes, Eternals breaks a few notable barriers for the MCU, barriers that should have already been broken. There is indeed a sex scene in this movie and there is a gay superhero, too — no tiptoeing around the potential, because you even see said hero kiss his husband. These details are all true and they are all worth pointing out because in these ways and others, the MCU is trying new things. It's good to try new things. But what Eternals should have also tried was creating a story and characters worth a damn beyond the laudable efforts to make a superhero film look like the audience paying to see it. In the beginning, as the opening text notes, there were deities known as Celestials, who oversaw the universe with the aid of superpowered aliens called Eternals, from the planet Olympia. The Eternals watch over the planets and denizens of the universe, staving off the attacks of bloodthirsty creatures called Deviants. Most pressing, the Eternals, who are led by Ajak (Salma Hayek), are tasked with keeping an eye on the humans of Earth, from as far back as 5,000 BCE, and ensuring their safety in the face of the Deviants. Over the course of 7,000 years, the ageless Eternals grow closer to humans, both emotionally and spiritually, before eventually having their existences upended. To say more would be to reveal some of this opaque film's secrets, but it's also true that to say more would be akin to one of this film's many lengthy info-dumps. The most positive way to look at it is that Eternals is trying to do a whole lot in the span of 157 minutes. (That includes, of course, 10 minutes of end credits as well as mid- and post-credits scenes guaranteed to make sense to comic-book die-hards and very few other people.) Aside from watching the Eternals, who also include Ikaris (Richard Madden), Sersi (Gemma Chan), Kingo (Nanjiani) and Phastos (Henry), on their latest adventure against a series of Deviants who have awoken from a lengthy slumber and are now hunting our heroes specifically, there's also the business of introducing the audience to these characters as well as establishing their world. It does not help matters that Zhao seems understandably less interested in mounting action sequences in which the Eternals show off their powers and more so in placing the characters in verdant landscapes, everywhere from Babylon to South Dakota to a fiery volcano. The plot machinations of an MCU movie being what they are, it soon becomes clear that the Eternals — who have been separated from each other for centuries for reasons that become clear in flashbacks interspersed throughout the present-day action — must reunite to stave off a threat that could endanger the whole of humanity. Those storytelling gears grind quite heavily this time around, though. Zhao and cinematographer Ben Davis are much more comfortable in highlighting the surprising lack of CGI in a Marvel movie; by itself, a movie that doesn't have too much CG isn't worth praising simply for existing, but that's how low the bar is set now for Marvel. Conversely, the third-act climax leans heavily on pyrotechnics and computer wizardry, though the latter seems lacking especially in a few fight scenes that seem more like video-game animation from the mid-2000s. Yet even Zhao's predilection for outdoor photography, put to such remarkable use in Nomadland, eventually sours. Some shots in Eternals end up looking like this year's most buzzed-about Super Bowl commercial, which may indeed be different from a Marvel movie without being satisfying. It doesn't help matters that the one aspect that typically marks every Marvel movie — a forceful amount of humor that pushes to the point of glibness — is largely absent from Eternals. Much has been made about the fact that comedian and actor Kumail Nanjiani bulked up to play Kingo, who's equally at home as a modern Bollywood star as he is as one of the Eternals. And while Nanjiani is easily one of the best parts of this film, it badly needs him to be more present. The same is true of Brian Tyree Henry, whose technology-focused character Phastos is a fascinating creation who is mostly absent for the first 90 minutes.  Instead, Eternals focuses much of its energy on the centuries-spanning romance of Ikaris and Sersi (and yes, the former character's name is pronounced like the mythical Icarus of flying-too-close-to-the-sun fame). Madden and Chan are very pretty people, so pretty that they get to be the focus of the much-discussed sex scene, which takes up three shots of film and takes less time than it will take for you to read this sentence. But their performances — or just the writing of their characters — are not up to the task of leading this film. At one point in Eternals, a few of the eponymous superpowered individuals muse about who may lead the Avengers now that both Captain America and Iron Man are gone. Nine years ago, the MCU pulled off what felt like a magic trick. After introducing most of the Avengers in their own films, they were brought together in an epic adventure that balanced action, comedy, science-fiction, romance and drama very effectively, helped in large part by charismatic lead actors, a fearsome but entertaining villain and believable world-ending stakes. Eternals has one thing the 2012 Avengers did not have, and that is a more notable visual style. (No one should argue that Joss Whedon is a particularly memorable visualist as a director.) But Eternals is missing all of the ingredients that made that first Avengers work.  Now that we're in Phase Four of the MCU, it's hard not to see conversations like the one in this film, where the Eternals wonder who might be the next leader of the Avengers, and imagine that this film is essentially an audition tape. If that is the case, we can only hope that someone else will crack the characters creatively. Right now, none of them are Avenger-worthy.

"Nov 1, 2021"," I’ve tried to make the best out of the proliferation of comic book movies in the last couple of decades; having felt that I grew out of them at 10, I never expected that so many of today’s blockbusters would revolve around such ancient IP. I’ve rattled off the names of the best ones (Spiderman, Iron Man 3, The Dark Knight, Thor: Ragnarok), and even found plenty to enjoy in recent entries (Aquaman, Birds of Prey, The Suicide Squad, Black Widow) but Chloe Zhao’s The Eternals reminded me of that other list, the list of indigestible duds. Remember dull pantomimes like Daredevil, Electra, Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor: The Dark World and more? When the Marvel Cinematic Universe produces a real turkey, it’s a hard watch; all this preamble is required because Eternals is their worst film to date. Eternals starts with an impenetrable opening scrawl about Eternals and their battle with aliens amusingly called Deviants, but nothing lands before the text fades. A throwaway bit of dialogue explains that the Eternals politely sat out the Avengers battle with Thanos because it wasn’t in their remit, which seems odd after the ‘everything but the kitchen sink’ last-gasp hurrahs of the last two Avengers films. What we see is a bunch of name actors (Gemma Chan, Kumail Nanjiani, Angelina Jolie, Selma Hayek, Richard Madden) mooching around on various locations, flirting with and betraying each other, delivering multi-pack helpings of impenetrable exposition about uni-brains and blasting each other with fireballs. This is boring after just ten minutes, but 157 minutes will leave you gasping for air. Zhao better keep hold of the paperwork for her best director Oscar for Nomadland, the Academy may well be wanting it back after seeing this impersonal, bland and incoherent mess. Little thought seems to have been given to making Jack Kirby’s property make sense; instead there’s woke-window dressing in the form of gay kisses, sex scenes, Bollywood sing-a-longs, a deaf character and other virtue-signalling that doesn’t really add any value to the film. All this wokeness might feel like more of a positive if it occurred during a good story well told; it’s likely to arouse audience hostility when applied to a venture that resolutely remains stuck in first gear. On the plus side, there’s at least one funny line of dialogue, and it’s delivered late-on by the MVP here, Barry Keoghan, who at least brings some snarky attitude to his role. By then we’re on a beach fighting a giant something or other with a face like a traffic light, and this critic wasn’t about to sit through a moving carpet of end-credits on the promise of fool’s gold in the form of a Harry Styles cameo. Eternals is a rotten movie, and won’t sell many toys, subscriptions or tickets for Disney. If nothing else, it’ll remind audiences what it feels like to be bored to distraction in the cinema; Marvel’s latest is an unfunny farce of epic proportions. Maybe fans will exhume something from this, but the po-faced posturing will likely be a turn-off for casual audiences. Wow!! I have just read a review that said this is like Prometheus, but works. I was going to go and see it the cinema because I heard it was more sci-fi than superhero. I will take your word for it and not bother now. I would genuinely be interested to see a review which made a good case for this film; I genuinely couldn’t make head nor tale of it. Particularly coming after Dune, which made something comprehensible out of a difficult sci-fi story, this is quite a frustrating film to watch. I quite enjoyed Prometheus, for all its faults, but this stopped me in my tracks; while Marvel have many fans, I can’t imagine many warming to this. I think Marvel might have backed themselves in a corner with the superhero trope. Earth is nothing more than a playground for the gifted now. I actually think DC could do a lot better going forward. I’m keen not to read too much into one movie; it’s quite remarkable how consistent Marvel have been up until now, the misfires I mention are hardly the norm. Much derided as they have been, DC will be keen to take advantage of this kind of failure to connect; yes, it pre-sells lots of tickets, but I’d be amazed if the general public stagger out of this one delighted. It’s hard going. Actually, I think I skipped all of those. Or maybe I did see Iron Man 2 but can’t remember. I think there’s no chance I’ll be seeing this. Well maybe slight more chance than me seeing Spirited Away, but still approaching zero. Nor I, and even posting that picture in, they look like a cheap knock-off of the Avengers. Whatever complaints I had about the Avengers movies, they were big, actioned -filled spectacles with welcome dashes of humour. Even if you didn’t dig them, you could just about see why people adored them. It’s like when your favourite band announce their ‘new jazz direction’; the sooner they go back to this greatest hits, the better. Saw this trailer when we went to see venom 2 this weekend and i told my wife im not big screening this one, i can wait for it to be available on the disney subscription. Thank you for saving and proving my decision right. Great review as always. Thanks! Having seen it, your call sounds correct. I’m not some curmudgeon that wants movies to be bad, but when they are bad, I have a duty to warn people. If everyone finds this as boring as I did, you wife will be pleased to give this one a miss, it’s turgid IMHO! I’ll chase Venom 2 up; at least the Venom films seem to give people what they want, Eternals feels like lengthy notes from a do-gooder committee…. Oh blimey O’Reilly I was hoping this would be good and was looking forward to it- though the amount of trailers for it did give me pause- trying too hard I think. Well I’ll do it when it comes to Disney or wherever it ends up and see for myself but consider myself braced for the worse. Where is Kit Harrington in all this? I thought he was one too but he’s not in the picture you’ve posted. Right, and maybe you’ll get more out of this with reduced expectations; it sure isn’t cut from the familiar Marvel cloth. I hadn’t seen the trailers, but the film’s dollops of hard-to-follow exposition made it a chore to sit through, with no notable action highlights to compensate. Kit Harrington is the boyfriend of one of the Eternals and appears in the opening and closing scenes in London; he’s not one of the crew. Maybe people more versed in the lore will dig it more, but adopt the brace position, because it’s one bumpy ride! Lots of younger directors now seem to jump at the chance to make an MCU film rather than stay within the independent sector. I was surprised Chloe Zhao followed this route. I wonder if she would have made the same decision if she had known she would win an Oscar? Good to hear from you! I remember you mentioning that this was Zhao’s next project and thinking you were joking! Aside from some use of real landscapes, I can’t honestly say what she brings to this that’s new, but it also doesn’t feel part of the Marvel house style. I do note that some of the worst Marvel films, Iron Man 2, Thor 2, led directly to much improved sequels when highly idiosyncratic talents were brought it to add character. Hopefully the money will enable Zhao to bounce back with something better, but stamping her talents on this one seems to have been beyond her. Very good point but MCU and the others do seem to attract good directors, possibly following the James Bond template which saw the likes of Sam Mendes etc taking it on. Disclaimer: I am a big comic book fan and have lived through the times of zero comic book movies, outside of B-movies. I remember the days before Tim Burton’s Batman came out, and how I would accept almost anything TV or movie related if it was based on my beloved comic book characters. Trying my best not to be too vicious but that poster of the “team” is laughably unappealing. Even with Salma Hayek, Gemma Chan and Richard Madden in it. That shouldn’t be possible! Is it a real promotional piece, or a “fan edit”? From what I’ve seen from the trailers, this film just looks dull and drab. Where are the OTT Kirby colours like in Thor: Ragnarok? Why do the characters look like cheap, knock-off Power Rangers? They appear to have gone for “serious” or “highbrow”, when comics are supposed to be fun; silly, sensational and exciting. Alarm bells have been ringing for a while regarding this film, but when some critics were raving that you have to watch this “just for the end-credit scenes,” I think they accidentally revealed just how enjoyable the film really is. He could be an Alex Good impersonator. There’s a lot of money to be made from that kind of malarkey. That bodybuilding stuff is clearly a different Alex Good right? Sigh. I have this down for my Monday cinema outing. I’ve carefully steered clear of the actual review but could not help noting the one-star. Amazingly, this film has made $401 million at the box office. With a $200 million budget, that doesn’t necessarily mean it made money — we have no clue how much they spent on advertising. But it is close, and I think it just speaks to how strong a brand Marvel is, even in the pandemic. Even “Black Widow” surpasses $400 million when you factor in the Disney Plus Premiere Access money it made, and I shouldn’t need to say anything about “Spider-Man.” This demo site is only for demonstration purposes.

"Nov 1, 2021"," Copyright Marvel Studios 2021I’m sorry to tell you The Eternals is a mess. I’m sorry because I like Marvel movies and I like the writer/director Chloé Zhao and I wanted to love it.  I did almost love parts of it, but other parts are truly disappointing which is why it is a mess. At least that is better than being bad. I’m not sure anyone could have made it work. It is like calling up the Low-A baseball team to play in a World Series game, leaving us all sitting there in an enormous Major League Baseball stadium watching a team that is just not up to that kind of attention. It might have been nice to see these second-tier Marvel characters in a lower-key, lower-budget setting instead of the massive, time and place-hopping heavily CGI’d epic that keeps threatening to overshadow the characters as we try to remember which one has which powers and how they all relate to each other. It does not help that we have spent 26 films over 14 years to get to know the most powerful superheroes on the planet (in the MCU’s version) and we are now told that there’s another bunch of superheroes we have not seen before who are even more powerful. The reason we have not seen them before is they’re in theory not allowed to interfere with human matters. They have been on earth since its earlier beginning with just one job, to fight some monsters called, not very imaginatively, deviants. They look like they’ve been made out of flexible steel pipes. They were sent by a God-like Celestial called Arishem. We see them at different points in human history, fighting deviants, learning to use their powers, bickering, and occasionally interfering in human affairs by helping out with some advanced technology. In the present day, the group has split up, so, like “Avengers: Endgame” there is a long getting-the-band-back-together section, but in this case we don’t have a 20+ movie investment in the characters so it is more about providing an opportunity to introduce the Eternals and provide some comic relief. That welcome respite comes from newly-buff Kumail Nanjiani, who has become a Bollywood movie star (his dance number is a treat).  There are so many characters and so many powers and so many run-ins and conflicts and shifts that there simply is not room to go into them, so I’m going to summarize some of the film’s strengths and weaknesses instead of trying to recap even the basics of the characters and storyline.  Strength: the cast is excellent and it is a delight to see this group of first-rate performers, one of the most diverse in any film in any category, doing their best and having fun. Oscar-winner Angelina Jolie is Thena, an Eternal who sometimes has a breakdown and starts attacking the others instead of the divergents. Gilgamesh (Don Lee) has a powerful punch, but he spends centuries caring for Thena and their scenes together are touching. Gemma Chan of “Crazy Rich Asians” plays a sometime leader of the group with grace.  Weakness: The specifics and distinctions of the various powers are not as clear as they should be, and the same goes for the creatures they are fighting.  We need a clearer idea of the stakes to understand the fight scenes.  Parents should know that this movie has extended fantasy/superhero peril and violence with many characters injured and killed and references to real-life events like the bombing of Hiroshima. There is some strong language and an explicit sexual situation. Family discussion: Which of the Eternals do you like the best? Which powers would you like to have? What should you know before following someone’s instructions?",NEGATIVE
"Nov 1, 2021","One of the most humanist MCU movies ever made. It's an exhilarating, suspenseful and visually dazzling spectacle with a surprisingly warm, beating heart. By treating the characters as human beings, Zhao treats the audience as human beings, too.",POSITIVE

"Oct 31, 2021"," Eternals is going to be a divisive movie because it doesn't really work at the end of the day. There is too much exposition, the pacing and structure are a mess, and the story of love in all its forms gets lost. There is a problem when you are trying something ultimately new after 20+ movies of doing the same thing, there are going to be bumps in the road, and there is going to be backlash from people not getting what they expected to get. Despite what you might think about Eternals, whether you like or don't or think it doesn't work on any level, Marvel did not play it safe with this one. They could have, and they didn't, and for that, some credit must be given. Everything about Eternals feels so different from the previous Marvel movies. It moves between different timelines, has a large cast of characters with insane-looking powers, and confronts the very idea of what it means to be alive. It's a balance that would be hard for anyone to do, and the fact that it doesn't work really isn't that surprising at the end of the day. This is a story that is fundamentally about love in all of its forms. Whether it is romantic love like Sersi (Gemma Chan) and Ikaris (Richard Madden), familial love as Ajak (Salma Hayek) looks after and loves every member of her team, parental love that Phastos (Bryan Tyree Henry) has for his son, fraternal love that all of the Eternals feel for each other, and finally the love that they all develop for the planet and the people they are trying to save. Love is the thing that dictates nearly every action of the main cast and why they decide to make the decisions that they do. When people say that a movie is about love, they usually think of romantic love, and there is plenty of that in this movie, but the fact that it goes out of its way to prove that every form of love is just as important as the other is truly lovely to see. The movie is also beautifully shot. Director Chloé Zhao truly captures beautiful time periods and makes them all feel as real and as lived in as the scenes that take place in the present day. This might be one of the best-looking Marvel movies so far. The various powers that the Eternals have are imagined through golden geometric shapes. Despite the fact that all of their powers do different things, these shapes feel both consistent and entirely different depending on the character. The best other comic book adaptation that the powers look like would be the Green Lantern rings, only more specialized. Every scene in this power could be framed on a wall which is something we haven't seen since Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. Those visuals combined with the absolutely fantastic score by Ramin Djawadi make for some great visuals, if nothing else. However, all of that good gets utterly lost in the story and exposition. Much like Dune earlier this month, Eternals spends a lot of time explaining itself and everything that is going on around it. We need to learn about these characters, what they are doing, who is telling them what to do, what the Deviants are, and there is so much going on that it can be hard to take it all in. We have to know what is going on to understand the stakes of the Emergence and what it actually means. To get there is a long journey, and because the movie isn't a straight line, it can be hard to get there. The decision to bounce back and forth from the present day to the various different times throughout history as we watch the Eternals learn to love humans, protect them from the Deviants, and eventually fall apart as a family unit. However, it means that the pacing and the structure of the movie are kind of a mess and make the already very long runtime feel even longer. By the time the final act comes around, you're overwhelmed with too much new information and a confounding narrative throughline. This is the moment where everything should be coming to a head, but by then, you're just too tired to really get into it. It's almost impressive how spectacularly it all falls apart. Eternals is going to be a movie that many people aren't going to like, and that is wholly justified. The bad does outweigh the good. Perhaps this is one of those movies where you need to just let it wash over you and worry about getting explanations for what is going on later, a movie that needs to be enjoyed by vibes alone. For what it's worth, this critic is looking forward to seeing it again, and it's going to be fascinating to see how the general public reacts to this movie. Marvel took a chance with Eternals, and ultimately the general public will be the ones to truly determine the future of this franchise. Or if there is one at all.",POSITIVE
"Oct 31, 2021"," ETERNALS marks an odd coming together of the Marvel Cinematic Universe behemoth – $23 billion in box office across all the films and counting – with recent Oscar winner Chloe Zhao, whose NOMADLAND (whilst wonderful and handsomely profitable for its budget) didn’t quite crack $40 million. The resulting film is an odd blend, featuring segments of unusual natural beauty and humanity for a comic book blockbuster. Still, this tonal change is stymied by the need to stick mostly by the formula of its franchise brethren, and the film feels very inhibited as a result of its lack of boldness. The ensemble cast plays the Eternals, a group of seemingly immortal humanoids sent to Earth 7000 years ago by the Celestials (planet-sized god-like beings). Their job was to protect humanity from Deviants, presented here primarily as destructive creatures with an initial design similar to a more colourful version of the Mimics from EDGE OF TOMORROW. Although the group eradicated Deviants from Earth centuries ago, a re-emergence prompts the group to come together once again and reunite from their now-disparate global locations. The film jumps back and forth between the present-day crisis and various eras in human history where the Eternals were attendant. Throughout the historical segments, there is ample opportunity for Zhao to place her characters in scenes of natural beauty. However, these sit at odds with the slightly more generic feel in exposition scenes or CGI/green-screen heavy segments. ETERNALS frequently manages to show images of tangible, sunlit vistas when the Marvel films have usually featured impressive but synthetic concoctions; the sort of thing which feels more at home as a Twitch streamer’s desktop background. Ikaris and Sersi, for example, will be presented in a golden hour Mesopotamian desert mere moments after a colour-saturated CGI monstrosity intended to be Babylon. It’s notable that Zhao is not working with her regular cinematographer and instead with Ben Davis, who has shot previous Marvel entries CAPTAIN MARVEL, DOCTOR STRANGE and AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON. Visually, the film feels a little caught between two stools: it is notably different from previous entries in this series, which have had neither the inclination nor opportunity to harmonise the characters’ humanity with the environments they inhabit (or, indeed, the opposite). However, the film can’t entirely take the leap and stray more meaningfully from the standard template. The editing also maintains a familiar rhythm (Zhao having edited two of her previous three features herself), with few scenes or exchanges left to linger for more than is necessary to progress the plot. This reluctance is unfortunate given the potential of the storyline. There is a hint of PROMETHEUS in the premise: an alien race providing guidance and a spark of inspiration to humans, with an undercurrent of what humanity, if any, there is in how these near-deities regard their charges. Many of the Eternals are designed to piggyback on legendary figures of Greek mythology: the homonym Ikaris (Richard Madden) is the clearest example, but it also runs to Brian Tyree Henry’s engineer Phastos (Hephaestus), Angelina Jolie’s Thena (Athena) and others. However, any potential to examine humanity from this immortal viewpoint is dealt with in very short bursts (including one Hiroshima-based diversion that plays very oddly) in favour of the Comic Book Ticking Clock Crisis™ plot. Although that is to be expected, it is unfortunate given its crumbs in the script and visuals. “The performances also reflect this split identity of the film, with emotionally earnest scenes and humorous interludes oddly juxtaposed with the Marvel signature action sequences in a way that doesn’t quite blend.” The performances also reflect this split identity of the film, with emotionally earnest scenes and humorous interludes oddly juxtaposed with the Marvel signature action sequences in a way that doesn’t quite blend. Richard Madden probably inhabits this odd duality the most effectively individually as Ikaris, and although there is a decent balance across the ensemble as a whole, it’s hard to escape the jarring clash between, say, Kumail Nanjiani’s essentially comic performance with the more existential concerns described via Angelina Jolie’s. Gemma Chan’s Sersi is a performance that feels more calibrated for the gentler, contemplative aspects of the film, leaving her role – the closest the film has to a ‘lead’ – crowded out by the more bombastic ones around her. ETERNALS undoubtedly opens up new avenues within the Marvel realm and achieves the goal of expanding the universe of possible stories to be told as the series looks to move into a new era. However, the conflicting approaches that can be felt here reveal that this range of films isn’t ready or willing to expand how it tells those stories.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 30, 2021","Eternals is Marvel's first attempt at making raw drama. The characters have depth, the score & visuals are unmatched, but I wished they'd committed to the genre change more",POSITIVE
"Oct 30, 2021"," You perhaps read the above and rolled your eyes. Maybe you muttered something unkind under your breath as well. If you didn't, you assuredly know someone who did. That's just simple statistics: Superhero films have become our cultural furniture; they're the steady, unceasing hiss of universal background radiation none of us can escape.  And today, with the debut of every new film and television show, more and more prospective audience members find themselves aching to escape, to rid themselves forever of these children's characters and their microweave pajamas and their hypertrophic musculature and their too-tidy, infantilizing morality tales.  It's not a backlash, really, because backlash suggests a reflexive reaction driven by a sudden, overwhelming need to reject, to force out, to detoxify. What some critics and audiences are manifesting now, as they find themselves wading clavicle-deep through whatever particular numbered MCU Phase we find ourselves in, is something softer and sadder — a weariness bred by familiarity.  So it's strangely fitting that Eternals, the latest MCU film, should take as its organizing principle that selfsame feeling of fatigue — the sort engendered by long years of observation, and the creeping sense that you're seeing the same stories play themselves out, over and over. The only difference, of course, is that in the film, it's not we, the moviegoing audience, who are weighted down by that weariness, but instead a fractious, ten-member family of immortal and impossibly hot aliens who zap sinewy space-lizards with their eye-beams and finger-lasers and magic swords made out of gold filigree. Even the weariest anti-Marvel zombie among us can stipulate that the studio's hiring of Chloe Zhao to direct and co-write their latest film was surprising. Zhao's previous movies (Songs My Brothers Taught Me, The Rider, Nomadland) are intimate meditations about laconic outsiders and the insular communities they find as they try to secure for themselves a lasting emotional purchase, set against the vast expanses of the American West. They're imagistic, elliptical and character-driven (don't say tone-poems don't say tone-poems don't say tone-poems) odes to both human frailty and the immutability of the natural world. As a director, she'd rather frame a flinty face in golden-hour light and let her audience impute the thoughts and feelings roiling beneath its surface than fill her scripts with dialogue that lays it all bare. And given all of that, Marvel still said, ""Great, got it, good, let's hand her a plot choked in 7,000 years of backstory and a CGI budget Michael Bay would chew his own leg off for. Greenlit!"" You'd be forgiven for assuming that Zhao's directorial presence would get buried, caught up in the gears of the MCU machine and ground into the same uniformly fine powder that gets baked into every Marvel movie.  Eternals doesn't follow the usual formula — or at least, the narrative formula it does follow is one of those weird, abstract, unsolvable equations. The film utterly lacks the familiar superhero-movie feeling of plot threads neatly tying themselves up, of Chekhov's gun finally discharging, of moments foreshadowed in the opening minutes landing at the climax with the satisfying whump of a car door closing.  Zhao's penchant for abstraction and nuance manifests in a host of ways: The lines the film draws between its heroes and villains shift in ways that are, in the MCU at least, novel and intriguing. The plot, such as it is, doesn't churn ahead like an engine that has been tooled, lubricated and filed down for four-quadrant success. No, it sputters, stalls and jerks forward. Yes, there are big fight scenes — many, in fact — but they're dealt with like the lima beans you have to finish to get to the dessert Zhao truly cares about: Talking, feeling, and — especially — talking about feelings.  The Eternals are a group of ten immortals who were sent to Earth 7,000 years ago by an immense, all-powerful being — a Celestial, in Marvel parlance — called Arishem. They are tasked with protecting Earth — but only from one very specific enemy, a race of giant dogs/small dragons called Deviants, whose flesh is composed of greyish ropes that give them the look of cornhusk dolls from Hell. (They ... do look kind of goofy, it has to be said.) Thousands of years ago, when the Deviants were finally destroyed, the Eternals expected to be summoned home. They weren't. So for much of human history, they've attempted to go underground, and contented themselves to watch as we puny humans descend into war and greed and hatred and not curbing our dogs or re-racking our dumbbells, etc. Some Eternals became disgusted by humanity's endless, cyclical penchant for destruction, others admired our resourcefulness. All of them, however, grew weary of their mission, and of us, and of each other; most have retreated from any interaction for centuries at a time. And all the while, they've held to their oath not to intervene in human history, lest we, their charges, grow dependent on them, and stop evolving.  That's the setup. Note how completely divorced that whole ennui-of-immortality theme is from issues like where the glowing MacGuffin-du-jour might be found, or how a dimensional portal filled with space-eels might open up, or whatever the hell the Quantumverse might be. Familiar heroes get name checked, yes, as do events like the Snapture (which MCU characters continue to refer to as the Blip, because they are unimaginative and super basic). But mostly, the movie cordons off its characters and leaves them to deal with their interfamilial squabbles.  Eternals' cinematography is where's Zhao's directorial voice is most strongly and clearly felt. She bathes scene after scene in the last rays of sunsets, and places her characters small in the frame so they get dwarfed by the vast landscapes of a desert oasis, a volcanic island, or the American prairie.  She insisted on shooting in real-world locations, and it turns out you can tell the difference between a windswept beach in the Canary Islands, say, and some vast Atlanta soundstage covered in green screen. It's easily the most gorgeous MCU film to date, and the stark, lonely beauty of the places she captures can't help but color the mood of the film, gently underscoring the loneliness of immortal life, and the desire to retreat from the noise of humanity. There's a climactic big battle, of course, but it mostly plays out in the bright light of day, on a beautiful white-sand shoreline, so while what actually happens during the big fight may get pretty silly, and may involve characters exclaiming dippy nonsense like ""Uni-Mind!,"" you'll at least be able to follow it all without squinting. We, uh, also get an adolescent who romantically longs for an adult, and even if we're quick to slap an asterisk on it, (they're both immortal), it's still pretty disquieting. *Okay, somebody does. You can probably find a nerd out there eager to lecture you on the difference in power-sets between Sersi and Ajak, but none of these characters have made their way off of the comics page and into the cultural ether in any meaningful way. We're in Guardians of the Galaxy territory, here. You're dealing with a blank slate, effectively, and everyone else is going in as blind as you are, which means the film has to set up ten different heroes, their powers, their personalities, and their respective interpersonal relationships, from scratch. It's a tall order, and the film makes a yeomanlike effort. Team leader Ajak (Salma Hayek) offers motherly concern, handsome Ikaris (Richard Madden) flexes his jaw muscles, vain Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani) provides desperately-needed jokes, Gilgamesh (Don Lee) is soulful and protective of Thena (Angelina Jolie), who keep going full ham on her own family, and Sersi (Gemma Chan), Eternals' central protagonist, radiates compassion and, later on, worry. Zhao has never directed a cast this large, or one as studded with celebrities, and if the various acting styles on display fail to cohere, they do manage to complement each other. (Barry Keoghan's marble-mouthed Druig, for example, clashes frequently with his super-siblings, but then: He would.) She's also dealing with a phenomenon unique to the MCU: Whenever an established, charismatic screen presence like Jolie plays in the Marvel sandbox, it can seem awkward, like when you're a kid playing with action figures in your bedroom and out of nowhere one of your parents sits down and starts playing too.* *This is known as the Secretary Pierce Phenomenon, named for that time in Captain America: The Winter Soldier when Robert Freaking Redford said ""Hail, Hydra."" Just, like, out loud. As if ""Hail, Hydra"" was an actual line that Robert Redford might say. You might have noticed that many of the Eternals' names — Gilgamesh, Thena, Ikaris, and also Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry) — resemble names from ancient myths. That's fully intentional, and one of Eternals' coolest ideas: That these ten characters inspired our myths and legends. The film plays with this notion just enough, without letting it bog down the present-day action. No, yeah, that's true here, as well. It couldn't help to be, really, given that we're introducing ten new characters with thousands of years of history, and a whole new set of conflicts previous films haven't even hinted at.  For the first time in MCU history, we get an opening scroll that tosses off lots of proper nouns — weird names and capitalized terms and historical events. The film stops dead, from time to time, for beautiful people to debate the fate of the planet and their respective roles in it.  But even here, Zhao's hand can be detected. She's careful to tie those discussions to each character's current emotional state, because the Eternals are a family, and they each see their mission slightly differently. Those differences breed both alliances and conflicts. Thus, the choices these characters eventually make are driven by their personal beliefs, not simply the demands of the (really pretty silly) plot which, yes, does happen to involve a ticking clock, why do you ask? But Eternals' squabbling-family dynamic means that the film foregrounds the kind of emotional stakes that will be familiar to anyone whose ever sat through a Thanksgiving dinner. These characters hold grudges and nurse simmering resentments over centuries, they argue and entreat with each other, they goad and snipe and reconcile.  Which means the film's story — which features significantly more reveals and reversals than is typical of the MCU, and a twist you might not see coming — feels more intimate, more personal, and admits more shades of gray into the proceedings than you're likely expecting in a film featuring characters shouting things like ""Uni-Mind!"" Most of the Eternals are earnest and open-hearted; they say exactly what's on their minds, all the time. And as mentioned, this is one talky film, and most of the time, the talk in question centers on how someone's feeling, or recently felt, or is about to feel. Which makes the two shining exceptions to this rule — Nanjiani's Kingo and Henry's Phastos, both of whom come outfitted with the standard MCU Sardonic Quip PackageTM we've come to expect —  seem like snarky water in a vast, parched, achingly sincere desert.  This is where the decision to futz with the formula by introducing so many new characters works in the film's favor. Not every Eternal will make it through to the credits, and their various allegiances to each other will undergo a series of changes.  News flash: No, the Earth doesn't end, but the life the Eternals have known for 7,000 years (and that we have known for 2 hours and 37 minutes, which can seem like 7,000 years if you haven't managed your fluid intake) does come to an end.  Chloe Zhao makes the kind of movies you're talking about. She won two Academy Awards for her last one. She will make serious bank on this Marvel movie, which she has managed to infuse with her sensibility, despite a massive corporate infrastructure engineered to maintain a uniformity of output that keeps directors like her from doing exactly that.  She will take the money and the clout she made from this film and go on to make movies to your liking, having added to her skillset the successful negotiation of impossibly massive global logistics involved in MCU filmmaking, That won't make her a better director, of course, but it will make her a uniquely experienced one — and, not for nothing, a director able to choose her next project. ",POSITIVE
"Oct 30, 2021"," There’s one common theme to all the “positive” reviews, and if you read between the lines what they’re really saying is, “Wow… Chloe Zhao really laid a stinker, but I would feel totally lame being the first critic to dump on her for her big, first post-Oscar tentpole so I’m going to say things like, ’This is a really different Marvel film! It has so many characters and she really did something, er, different… yeah! That’s it! It’s a different kind of Marvel film! With, uh… longer shots… and more characters… and more character development!” Oh, and they all have different powers? Why the hell not give them all the same powers? Why assign the same group to the whole earth for thousands of years? Why not have a different set of Eternals for every culture or every period of time?  I could go on forever like this. It’s just stupid. Especially after seeing Dune, this feels old, stale, amateurish, narratively sloppy and just… stupid. I hate it. And the silly, “Where were you when Thanos was destroying half the universe?” question is answered with some moronic Eternals version of the Prime Directive? “Oh, that wasn’t part of our job description so we decided to sit the ultimate cataclysm out because our job is to fight oversized wildcats that look like dinosaurs.” What the hell was (producer Kevin) Feige thinking? This thing is a turkey. Worst Marvel film since Iron Man 2, and maybe even worse than that. RAY GREENE: In a critical sense, I can’t be a part of a Tomato Slam for a movie I didn’t see. It wouldn’t be fair to the movie, which I might like eventually — assuming that we also accept the proposition that pigs may eventually fly, while singing “The Star-Spangled Banner” as monkeys fly out of their butts. You know, a typical Ron DeSantis press conference.  I’ve always thought the source material was problematic here, which is why I sarcastically predicted in advance that The Eternals would possess the power to jump sharks. The original comics run laid an egg in the marketplace, and it has never been popular except with a certain strata of the comic book creative community, which is (justifiably) populated by Jack Kirby fanatics, who mostly admire these books for their visuals and splash pages. I read the books when they were new, and found them impossible to engage with — to me they felt like a retread of Kirby’s New Gods run at DC, which also flopped except with comics creatives, and which was similarly derived from the then popular idiocies being spouted by Erich Von Daniken in “nonfiction” works like CHARIOTS OF THE GODS and IN SEARCH OF ANCIENT ASTRONAUTS, about how god and goddess myths descended from sci-fi concepts rooted in reality. The original Kirby books are beautifully laid out and boringly written IMHO — they’re self serious, and they lack the humor, grace and democratic scaling of Stan Lee’s scripts for all the most well known Kirby “Silver Age” collaborations.  Not one of those original Eternals characters ever got anywhere near popular with the average fan — there is no Wolverine among them. Thanos, who is technically an Eternal/Deviant, didn’t even make his first appearance in an Eternals comic. His foe was Iron Man, and the Kirby mythos for the Eternals was borrowed so they wouldn’t have to make something up.  The X-Men are victims of their powers, and that makes them human-ish. The Eternals are gods fighting Gods and that makes them pioneers of the worst tendencies of current Marvel Cinematic Universe storylines, which is to dramatize top down stories where human beings are puny worriers on the sidelines and in the bleachers, who run and scream and die while “superior beings” create history. That’s not just boring to this puny human. It’s fascistic. MARK KEIZER: Ray, please start a comic book blog, stat! I learned more about Kirby just now than from reading his actual work. Otherwise, I’m generally with Wade on this one. Marvel has taken a director of rare sensitivity and forced her into the superhero grinder, where only flecks of her emotionally textured, magic-hour romanticism remain. While I’m firmly on the side of Disney shareholders in not expecting Zhao to give us Justice League by way of Terrence Malick, Eternals represents a rather epic failure of nerve. There are moments where one can sense Zhao connecting with the emotional journeys of the film’s characters, mostly involving the on-again, off-again epoch-spanning romance between Sirse (Gemma Chan) and chisel-jawed Ikaris (Richard Madden) who looks and acts so much like Superman that one character calls him Superman. Sirse and Ikaris even share Marvel’s very first “they’re at least topless and probably having penetrative sex” sex scene, chaste as it is. Each shot of intertwined hands and meaningful gazes hopefully provided Zhao a sense of authorship otherwise denied her by the wham-bam-pow demands of the genre.  One of the surprising attributes of any Marvel team-based film is its ability to give every character his or her due, spreading around the memorable quips, heroic saves and emotion-packed moments so no superhero is left behind. That’s put to the test in Eternals, which features ten characters all starting from zero in terms of cultural recognition. Zhao does the best she can and, unsurprisingly, the film is at its best when these characters are in conflict with each other, whether its Phatos (Brian Tyree Henry) debating whether saving the universe is worth leaving his husband for or Druig (Barry Keoghan) whose mind control-powers would make Earth a peaceful paradise were he allowed to use them. But there are simply too many heroes to track and care about and too much convoluted backstory (when an opening crawl read “In the beginning…” my heart sank). Wade, of all the characters, did you care about any of them, even in the context of “sure, I’ll care about them for 2 hours and 37 minutes but that’s it”? And, Wade, what was the deal with Angelina Jolie? The biggest star here, she’s fairly wasted playing a character I vaguely understood and who would suddenly flip out and attack the group for reasons that seemed like a screenwriter’s conceit. WADE MAJOR: I cared about none of them. And I share Ray’s reservations (on concept, as he hasn’t seen the film) about their “role” in human affairs. That’s basically doing 2001 in the most maudlin way possible. Where Kubrick and Clarke took very seriously the idea that human evolution may be “prompted” by alien intercession, Eternals makes the whole thing part of some gargantuan, intergalactic eugenics experiment wrapped in pop-philosophy and popcorn-authoritarianism. There are a lot of tropes here, none of which can be taken seriously given the silliness of the overall effort (the forced diversity and ham-handed melodramatic relationships across the eons etc.). For instance, all of this moping and moaning about the “burden” of being a superhero is getting tedious. We’ve been force fed that angst for decades now. WE GET IT. It’s tough being a hero! Okay, so step aside and let somebody else do it, then. By now there are more than enough of you. Once the X-Men are back in the fray, just step aside and take a vacation, whiners. Nobody needs a diva.  But there’s something else happening, which is kind of an organic thing, and that’s what I suggested earlier about Dune. The MCU is two decades in, now. And all good things come to an end. Especially when you’re hurling two and three of these films at us every year. You have to give audiences time to breathe. If there had been a Star Wars movie every year since 1977… nobody would want any more Star Wars. You start to gag on it. There’s a reason why, after nonstop westerns throughout the 50s and 60s, that by the 1970s Westerns are OVER. And we’ve never really gone back. My sense is that we’re just about up to our gills with Marvel movies and getting pretty close to cinematic lactose (or gluten) intolerance. Our movie metabolism is going to start to reject what we once loved just based on sensory overload alone. That process is especially expedited by “the next big thing” when it arrives because “the next big thing” suddenly hits our palette with that freshness that makes us realize there’s another universe of food out there. And we move on. Is Dune that palette cleanser? Maybe. Maybe not. We’ll see. What’s certain is that it’s making people ask the question — and it’s technically and narratively so much more sophisticated than something like Eternals that it’s almost like trying to watch an old Buck Rogers serial in the wake of Star Wars. You just can’t go back. And I don’t see ANOTHER Doctor Strange and ANOTHER Thor and A NEW Black Panther and ANOTHER Spider-Man as doing anything but dig that hole even deeper.  RAY GREENE: It’s interesting to note that superheroes were originally devised as a reaction against the idea of the Nazi ubermensch. In 1938, you had Hitler and Co. spouting their racist and anti-semitic hogspittle, and then you had Joe Shuster and Jerry Siegel saying, “Oh yeah?” They even called the first comic book superhero Superman (Ubermensch) as a great big kiss off to the toxic mythos of aryan supremacy. In addition to being a flying middle finger aimed at Adolph and co., I guess that makes Superman a golem too. In the 1940s, Jack Kirby (who was born Jacob Kurtzberg) understood this secret history (or “code” as we’d call it today) very well. His first comic book smash was the co-creation of Captain America with Joe Simon — an all-American superman who was first seen punching Hitler in the face on the cover of Captain America #1 in March, 1941, nine months before Pearl Harbor, okay? And Kirby drew that image. But thirty years later, Jack writes and draws The Eternals, and he’s disappeared into the comics paradigm so far that he’s all about supreme beings, in a way Stan Lee never was. It’s always seemed kind of sad to me. WADE MAJOR: That’s a great observation. It’s also why the most compelling heroes are the average Joes and Jans who are unexpectedly called to be heroes and heroines — the whole Joseph Campbell “Luke Skywalker” hero’s journey — are kind of in the Joan of Arc mold, self-sacrificial for principle, not personal gain. The Eternals and all like them have that annoying Hercules complex. Which always bugged me in mythology. And it bugs me here. Oddly enough… the one Marvel hero who fits that mold but doesn’t bug me… is Thor. Not sure why. Maybe I just dig the hammer.  TIM COGSHELL: My contribution (also not having seen the film) is to ask the question — in the canon, who are the Eternals? What is and has always been their nature and purpose?  And is there any reason why, in this movie, they are different from whom they’ve always been or engaged in something different than they were conceived to do? None of those movies or Eternals or any of the films in the new MCU are for “us”.  They are for our kids and in some cases our grandkids. Yeppers.  RAY GREENE: I’m an American. I reserve my twin rights to think I rule the world and to never grow up. All at the same time. MARK KEIZER: Tim, I’m going to give these kids today some credit and predict they will tolerate this movie, but not embrace it or its characters. The Eternals are mostly defined by their powers which are marginally different from one another but don’t seem particularly appropriate for their primary goal: to protect Earth from the Deviants, which are standard-issue 4-legged monsters that never seem so threatening to humanity that the all-powerful Celestials would need to create a group of ageless superheroes for the sole purpose of fighting them. If these Celestials were really so powerful, they’d just destroy all the Deviants themselves and spare us this movie. The only Eternal who breaks through in any 1.5-dimensional way is Kingo (Kamail Nanjiani) who shoots bolts out of his fingers and has spent centuries since the supposed defeat of the Deviants as a Bollywood star. When the Eternals reunite to take on the resurgent Deviants he brings along rotund videographer, Karum (Harish Patel, the funniest thing in the movie) to record his exploits for a documentary.  But circling back to Tim’s original question, it’s true that Feige might be positioning this and subsequent phases of the MCU to better reflect what younger audiences want to see: superheroes who are Black or blind or gay or of non-White descent. And that’s a wonderful thing as long as it doesn’t come off as box-checking. And actually I’d argue it’s a wonderful thing even if it does come off as box-checking because, well, you’ve gotta start somewhere and here the Otherness of the Eternals takes a backseat to their superpowers and whoever gets the most heroic camera angle as they take down a Deviant.  This question is for the group: if Feige really wanted to lock in audiences wary of investing in another 10 years of MCU epics, wouldn’t he have been better off adapting another team-based comic like Fantastic Four or X-Men?  Feige’s been pushing this idea that the Eternals are critical to the MCU because the entire universe starts with these characters. That sounds like a weak selling point. Audiences want characters they know and love on the big screen and characters they can emotionally invest in. Eternals provides neither. If Eternals were Fantastic Four, wouldn’t that have been way more exciting?  WADE MAJOR: I’m the first person to give Feige props for what he’s pulled off — with very few hitches. The guy went from producer’s assistant to studio head to “most successful producer” in motion picture history inside of a decade and a half. That’s unprecedented.  But… Eternals feels like he handed them his dream wishlist of bullet points to trigger all the storylines and tentpoles for this new phase — and it was too much. No way to make it all work. But nobody went back and said, “Mr. Feige… this is unwieldy and unworkable. How about we just blow off the whole Eternals thing and do it this way…” because nobody in Hollywood wants to speak truth to power. That’s always been a problem, but it’s now also a problem for Marvel. Eternals can’t be undone, and I believe it’s dug them a really terrible hole. ",NEUTRAL
"Oct 30, 2021"," There are films of which the story makes you care about the characters, and then there are movies where the characters makes you care about the story. Marvel’s Eternals, out November 5 in theaters, is the latter, and Chloé Zhao is a MASTER at presenting humanity in the forefront, and allowing plot to weave through the million emotions of somebody trying to find their purpose beyond the meanings and plans attributed to them. It is for this reason that Eternals stands out as a Marvel film; it is deeply emotional and alters the formula we know, which some will love and some will hate. As we meet Sersi (Gemma Chan), she is swooping through insta filters and contemplating whether she should move in with Dane, and Makkari (Lauren Midloff) is zipping through the world and away from such drama.  Meanwhile, Sprite (Lia McHugh) wishes she could grow up so she can do the “fun things” that adults do like club and drink. Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani) is trying to expand his Bollywood superstardom, while Ikaris left the family after finding out what “glues” them together is pretty toxic. Druig (Barry Keoghan) has isolated himself because he is sick and tired of this violent world, and Gilgamesh is taking care of Thena (Angelina Jolie) as she struggles with her memory. All while, Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry) has retired from being an inventor to have a family, and Ajak (Salma Hayek), the mother of the group, has watched her children spread across the earth trying to find their “way” through it. Just on that premise alone, it can feel like I am discussing an episode of a 90s sitcom or dramedy airing on HBO Max. I kind of divide the reception of Eternals between those who go back to Youtube  and re-watch the action sequences versus those who re-watch the scenes where Loki and Thor hold a family conversation and, hopefully, hug. Watching Eternals, I could not help but think of Chloé Zhao’s Nomadland and how the movie weaves sentimentality first and the struggles that inspire it second. Despite some of the most stunning visuals you will ever see and fight sequences that give you the typical MCU, otherworld exhilaration, the movie felt rather quiet and slow in pace compared to Avengers: Infinity War, which shared the same 2 hour and 37 minute running time. Why? Because it felt very conversational.  Eternals was like watching a Game of Thrones episode, beyond the fact that Kit Harrington as Dane Whitman and Richard Madden as Ikaris was there. There were several scenes where characters discussed themes of family, destiny, and what it means to be human. In essence, it was a philosophical movie veiled as superhero one, which is why despite costumes, CGI, and comicbook characters that I have read before; it all felt different. Its cosmic scope was grounded unlike any other Marvel film, of which some will find it boring and plain, particularly, because comicbook films have become our after-work adrenaline rush. No matter their length, they absorb in story, quickness, and imagination, but Eternals gives you the option to be consumed by its soul more than its narrative. ",POSITIVE

"Oct 30, 2021"," In the trailers for Eternals, Marvel Studios’ latest offering in their ever-expanding cinematic universe, we saw some familiar faces: Angelina Jolie, Selma Hayak, Kumail Nanjiani, and Game of Thrones brethren Richard Madden and Kit Harrington. But it may come as a surprise to some that the ensemble is led by Gemma Chan (Crazy Rich Asians), whose star is on the rise but is nowhere near as bright as several of her higher-profile castmates. The surprise is a pleasant one. Not only is the film written and directed by Academy Award-winning director Chloé Zhao (Nomadland), but the fact that it’s the second MCU film in a row to feature an Asian actor in the lead role is a testament to Marvel’s commitment to representing Asians on screen and behind the camera. Eternals is significant in this regard. It boasts one of the most diverse casts of any superhero film, ever, and all of the actors do a fine job in their respective roles. But tragically, on a nuts-and-bolts level, it doesn’t serve its actors well. It doesn’t reflect the pure talent of Zhao, whose previous films are intimate, soulful character portraits. Eternals, unfortunately, is bloated and scattered and hobbled by relentless exposition. As for its contributions to the larger MCU saga, the references, ties, and setups are intriguing but almost detract from the singular enjoyment of the film that harbors them. Still, with a cast this good and Zhao directing them, there was no chance that Eternals would be a complete dud. There are many moments throughout the film that are moving, thrilling, and thought-provoking. The best thing the film has going for it is that it doesn’t feel quite like any other film in the MCU. It’s got an epic, mythological milieu and aesthetic that literally spans the breadth of its imagined human history, and while all of the time-hopping weighs down the storytelling, the imagery is compelling in that it appears at once ancient and futuristic. The Eternals are beings who were created by an all-powerful celestial called Arishem to protect the people of earth from bloodthirsty monsters called Deviants. This is their sole mission. They’ve been ordered to never intervene in human events unless they involve Deviants, which explains their absence from the MCU thus far.  Their story takes place over the course of about 7,000 years, and the film flits around the timeline from character to character to reveal just how dysfunctional this group of superpowered beings from the stars is. In the present, they learn that the Deviants, who have been dormant for some time, are back, and that the end of the world may be at hand. In a post-Thanos MCU, it’s difficult to show audiences any kind of villainous threat that seems, well, threatening. But Zhao and co.’s version of the impending end times is convincing. The story mostly revolves around Sersi (Chan) and Ikaris (Madden), Eternals who were in love for millennia but are estranged in the present day. The tension between them is less than electric, but not because the actors aren’t capable, but because they don’t seem to share a modicum of onscreen chemistry. Nanjiani brings humor and intermittent seriousness as Kingo; Bryan Tyree Henry brings seriousness and intermittent humor as Phastos.  The point is, all of the supporting characters are well-acted and each has well-delineated motivations and superpowers, but they all play such similar roles in the grand scheme of things that it’s difficult for any of them to stand out. And there are so many of them – the team tops out at 11 – that it seems a fool’s errand to wring even a drop of intimate character storytelling out of this thing. So perhaps it’s a testament to Zhao that she actually manages to wring out several drops of character-driven goodness. A good example is found in the relationship between the brute-ish but kindhearted Gilgamesh (Don Lee) and the mentally unstable warrior Thena (Angelina Jolie). She loses herself in a most violent way from time to time, and he dedicates his life to helping her center herself and find inner peace.  Sprite’s (Lia McHugh) plight is poignant as well. She’s lived countless lifetimes but is stuck looking like a teenager forever, which precludes her from many experiences someone her age would want to partake in; finding a partner, going to university, getting pathetically drunk in nightclubs…all the fun stuff. These moments are undercut by the oppressive plot centering around Arishem and the unending war against the Deviants. The superhero action is entertaining enough and looks quite dazzling at times (a literally earth-shattering set piece at the end of the film feels positively massive in scope), but the fight scenes aren’t particularly novel, especially given that many of the Eternals’ powers are reminiscent of other, more popular characters’ abilities.  Some examples: Phastos’ acumen for otherworldly tech is like a cross between Doctor Strange and Iron Man; Druig’s (Barry Keoghan) ability to control people’s minds reeks of Loki; and Sprite’s mind-boggling illusions reek of, well, Loki also. Ikaris can fly, has super strength, and shoots lasers out of his eyes a la Superman, and the film addresses the uncanny similarity with a couple of cleverly-worded lines of foreshadowing: “I’m not what you think I am.” There are some compelling twists throughout the narrative that give the story some propulsion here and there, but they’re too few and far between. Long stretches of the film are rudderless and dour. That’s saying something, as these may be the broodiest Marvel characters yet, with some of their exchanges so cynical and tortured that viewers may crave cheeky MCU one-liners to break up the monotony.  It’s good that Eternals tries to take on a more serious tone than the other films in the franchise, but ultimately, while Guardians of the Galaxy is like an ‘80s-themed rager in outer space, Eternals is an overcrowded, vibe-less party held in the middle of nowhere that everyone wishes they could leave. It’s a shame that the film chugs along the way it does, simply for the fact that its characters represent such a wide range of underrepresented communities. There’s Sersi and Gilgamesh, whose Asian-ness is a refreshing sight. There’s the super-fast Makkari, played by deaf actor Lauren Ridloff, and Phastos, Marvel’s first openly gay superhero. Representation should be the headline-grabber for Eternals, but instead, the conversation around the film will likely focus on how much of a disappointment it is. Giving Zhao the freedom to tell a Marvel story in her way seems like a good idea, but with its sprawling story and the huge cast of protagonists, Eternals isn’t a good fit for Zhao’s vision. Maybe it was the wrong property to saddle her with, or maybe she simply dropped the ball here. Either way, the film doesn’t reflect the brilliance Zhao has demonstrated in her work on prior films Nomadland (2020), The Rider (2017), Songs My Brother Taught Me (2015).",NEGATIVE
"Oct 30, 2021"," It’s all in the eyes, as they say. All those quotes and euphemisms. Windows to the soul, eye for an eye, the hills and their eyes, you know the gist. I’m reminded of Christian Bale’s cold, unhinged performance as the serial-killing banker Patrick Bateman in American Psycho. “We talked about how Martian-like Patrick Bateman was,” director Mary Harron told BlackBook in 2009. “How he was looking at the world like somebody from another planet, watching what people did and trying to work out the right way to behave… He just had this intense friendliness with nothing behind the eyes, and [Bale] was really taken with this energy.” This quote is the first thing that came to mind while watching the 26th movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Eternals. I see it most clearly in eyes I’d never seen so empty: Brian Tyree Henry’s. His eyes have exuded disillusionment in Atlanta or menace in Widows. Here, in his first Marvel-movie appearance, his eyes, in the vast, airless void of his character Phastos, whisper “save me” or turn inward, asking, “How did I get myself into this mess?” The story goes like this: the Eternals are basically the universe’s narc gods. They carry out the will of the Celestials, multiversal forgers who, at the beginning of time, molded the three main consciousnesses of the universe: humans, narc gods, and what are known as Deviants. In order for the population to remain balanced, the Celestial Arishem, the Judge, deploys the Eternals to different planets to keep everything—technology, culture, war—moving along smoothly. Arishem, through his interlocutor and de facto leader of the group Ajak (Salma Hayek) has one basic rule: Do not interfere. So this explains why the matter-shifter Sersi (Gemma Chan), kind brute Gilgamesh (Don Lee), and the flying Superman-like hero, Ikaris (Richard Madden), though they claim to harbor a deep love for humanity, do not infringe on things like, say, genocide, the bombing of Hiroshima, and the most recent human tragedy, courtesy of Thanos’s very large thumb. A warrior-god like Thena (Angelina Jolie), Makkari’s (Lauren Ridloff) light-speed sprints, or the jacked Kingo’s (Kumail Nanjiani) finger guns pew-pewing their way through the Purple Chin’s army maybe could’ve saved millions of lives. But alas, they stayed on Earth cosplaying as humans while Earth was threatened with global catastrophe every few weeks, just sucking up air and eating all the food. Despite their rules, the Eternals begin to question what exactly their purpose is, and it’s that central existential question that is meant to propel the narrative. It’s an interrogation common to Zhao’s work—namely her first two films, Songs My Brothers Taught Me and The Rider—and like those movies boasts an intense admiration for landscapes. If there’s anything that convinces these characters to protect the Earth it’s the diversity of the land. So often do we see characters, in pairs or completely alone, taking in the scenery—Sersi and Ikaris holding hands amid a vast red-orange mountain range; Gilgamesh and Thena delighting in the sounds of loud Amazonian insects; and, over in Mesopotamia, Druig (Barry Keoghan), the mind-controlling rebel, and Makkari, the sign language-speaking speedster, canoodle in a bustling bazaar, their love blooming out of a common need to police its people whilst skirting the rules of non-intervention (thus proving their arbitrary nature). Nothing feels totally natural though. Theirs are eyes filled with a peculiar exhaustion; blank sheets that render these tender moments in awe-inspiring environments moot. While there are striking images on display in Eternals, including the 157-minute film’s climactic battle sequence, its weak script, a mélange of cliches and popcorniness, washes out any visual splendor (phrases like “the truth will set you free” and references to BTS abound), and may be the messiest one the Marvel Cinematic Universe has produced since Age of Ultron. Plus, the plot’s relentless focus on in-fighting, sensually tasteless romances, and an exceptionalist need to “push humanity forward” betrays any sense of sturdiness it could have had. As in most Marvel team-ups, there exists a world-ending threat that challenges its heroes to look deep within themselves and find the strength and pathos to save the world. And these characters supposedly care deeply about the world, as we learn via flashbacks to some of the worst moments in human history, from Spaniards massacring the Aztecs to the aforementioned Hiroshima A-bombing they could have stopped, or that one time their hands touched and they made love. But it’s all so stiff, so robotic, so unintimate you’re never fully convinced. If that weren’t enough, for a group blessed with such wide-ranging powers, it’s hard to shake the feeling that every fight scene feels similar—and the mental-health struggles of Jolie’s Thena are handled with such little care that it only reifies the harmful notion that the mentally ill are inherently flawed and deserving of isolation. There are a multitude of curiosities in Eternals that explore autonomy, such as Ikaris questioning the role of mythological godhood; Sprite (Lia McHugh) interrogating the usefulness of deification; and Druig’s selectivity in granting (or not granting) Indigenous peoples control over their own minds. But these all come secondary to a yawn of a story throwing very pretty people into a multiversal conflict that somehow feels thinner than air. Eternals is, for better and mostly worse, the MCU’s most confounding spectacle: a hodgepodge of friendly faces, cute jokes, cool lasers and hand-dances with absolutely nothing behind the eyes.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 29, 2021","It's the ambiguity, the attention to a person's capacity for contradiction and change, that sets Zhao's MCU debut apart...",POSITIVE
"Oct 29, 2021"," The storyline centers on a group of immortal beings fashioned by the great celestial energy god Arishem to battle deviants — neon, fiber-optic dinosaurs that traverse the planet feeding on humankind. After thousands of years, the Eternals have finally destroyed the last of them, and are free to roam the world finding their own purpose, hanging in bars, making movies, riding the range. This sounds kind of fun. And I wish it were. But with the exception of Kumail Nanjiani who offers, without question, the only real reason to see the movie, the story takes itself far too seriously for fun or, really, even logic. Complicating plot twists surface and disappear and we’re never clear if they were important to begin with. Someone is suddenly revealed to be in love with someone else yet there’s been no foreshadowing to achieve emotional impact. Characters’ motivations, that we are supposed to believe were forged through millennia, shift on a dime, but seem to indicate deep religious faith is bad and will make you kill the people you love. The issue is primarily that Marvel is no longer content to make entertainment. Now, under Kevin Feige’s new direction, it wants to make commentary. It wants to be relevant. Instead, it often ends up ridiculous, taking you out of the world of the movie as you begin thinking about the kind of fawning, celebratory headlines Slate and Vox are going to write about it. The prime example is Arishem’s creative decisions in fashioning this team of minor divinities: A Chinese woman, a Middle-Aged white woman, a Hispanic woman, a deaf woman, an androgynous child, a Korean man, a gay black man, an Indian man, and, finally, a pair of Gaelic white guys. This overt rainbow coalition would have been fine if the film had bothered to offer some utilitarian explanation for it. How hard would it have been to throw in a line about needing to reflect the varieties of humans, or some such superhero boilerplate? Instead, the unaccountable diversity is taken as such a bedrock, unimpeachable good, Zhao and team don’t even think they need to clarify it. During my press screening, this perfect illustration of ethnic, gender, sexual, and ability variety inspired my non-politically-minded brother to lean over and whisper: “So what then — even a cosmic space deity is worried the woke mob will come after him if he doesn’t get the representation right?” With “Eternals,” it seems clear Feige has officially won the struggle for wokeness. The revelation that one member of the team is gay is no quick aside Disney can easily disentangle to pass muster with Chinese censors. He is black and has a husband of a different ethnic minority. They dote in the suburbs over a little boy; they linger long in a kiss. The same impulse to make statements also led Feige to tap Chloe Zhao, an art-house Oscar-winner to helm this project. He and others at Disney have celebrated it as a step forward in politics, not story-telling. It shows. The best Marvel movies have always come from the scruffy guys rising up from the unrespectable genres of horror and comedy. Directors like Taika Waititi, James Gunn, and the Russo Brothers had histories making crowd-pleasers on shoe-string budgets. Zhao has a history of inspiring deep think-pieces in The Atlantic. She’s done wonderful work as a meditative auteur, but she’s a terrible fit for Marvel. In short, this is a movie chock-full of important messages that are ripe for lampooning by the very guys who used to be Marvel’s target audience. What responsibility do independent nations have to the well-being of the rest of the world? (“Black Panther”). What are the best means to combat religious fanaticism when you inhabit a tolerant, pluralistic society? (“Guardians of the Galaxy”). What culpability do powerful actors have when the law of unintended consequences ultimately come home to roost (“Avengers: Age of Ultron”). Are bureaucracy and government oversight a necessary evil or just evil? (“Captain America: Civil War”). Now, the questions are no more interesting or authentic than a yard sign in an expensive, urban neighborhood. Full of virtue and self-importance, signifying nothing. Girl power! (“Captain Marvel”). Racial grievance! (“Falcon and the Winter Soldier”). Patriarchy! (“Black Widow”). Even if your ideology is in line with these preoccupations, where’s the discovery, where’s the thrill in watching a gender or race studies lecture given by guys dressed up in tights? It largely has the effect of reminding you, “Huh, I’m a grown woman watching guys dressed up in tights.” This doesn’t mean, of course, that Marvel still won’t have some hits on its hands with the old guard. Thor, Spider-Man, the Guardians, and a few fan favorites — established before the political themes grew easy, cheap, and flat—will still put backsides in seats, no doubt. But Marvel’s natural lifecycle is drawing to an end. A long slow slide into mediocrity and irrelevance has begun.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 29, 2021"," Director Chloe Zhao’s Eternals takes place within a world that has fully gotten used to the notion that superheroes exist. Occurring after the end of 2019’s Avengers: Endgame, where a massive population returns after ‘the blip,’ the fact that Gods living among us doesn’t seem so far-fetched. Dane Whitman (Kit Harrington) asks his girlfriend Cersei (Gemma Chan) if she’s a wizard “like Doctor Strange” and “to see if she can turn him into a giraffe.” With something as monumental as half of life on Earth turning into dust vanishing into dust, the MCU had to raise the stakes. What if there were God-like entitles that living among us that sought to protect us from a powerful, ancient enemy – even more powerful than an A.I. run amuck or an infinity gauntlet yielding mad man? About 7,000 years ago, The Eternals were sent to Earth to protect humankind from the Deviants – as ordained by a Celestial being, Arishem the Judge. The film jumps around at various points in human history. These beings with powers ranging from matter manipulation, energy beams, super speed, illusions, and choose to live among the humans – but to allow them to forge their evolutionary chart. They do introduce advancements like combustible engines and the plow just as a helper tool. But humans are capable of both love and hate, peace and war – those are things that the Eternals have to struggle with and be hands-off with. Druig (Barry Keoghan), an Eternal who can control minds, brings up this very point. What do you do when you have powers to influence things and can’t use them? But if you do, you would rob humans of developing their own sense of expansion. We’ve seen questions of mortality and sacrifice within characters like Steve Rodgers and Tony Stark, but Eternals does this looking on the outside looking in. When the film shifts to the present day, the writing team of Zhao, Patrick Burleigh and Ryan, and Kaz Firpo try to tie different storylines to find their ways back to an overall theme – love. Cersei was previously in a love affair with fellow Eternal Ikaris (Richard Madden), but her time with humans leads her to Dane when he goes away. Ajak (Salma Hayek), the leader and healer of the group, is withholding a secret from the group – the real reason the Eternals are on Earth. In a process called ‘The Emergence,’ a celestial being is made – for that to happen, all human life must be sacrificed. Here, a lot of the splinters within the group rear their ugly heads, and it lends to the conventional breakup of a superhero team. Some are ok with the mission because they see it as the natural order of things. Others do not because they’ve seen too much good in humans throughout the Marvel saga to give up on them. It’s an excellent problem to dive into, buried in many story beats that we’ve seen before in other films. With a narrative like this, it’s hard to navigate all the characters’ emotional proponents properly. There is a concerted effort to keep the fleeting relationship of Cersei and Ikaris as the Eternals base. In saying that, everybody well uses their screen time. Kumail Nanjiani, who plays Kingo, a movie star who relishes the world knowing who the Eternals are, is the welcomed comic relief of the movie. Together with his manager and trusted documentarian Karun (Harish Patel), they make a very entertaining pair. David Tyree Henry’s Phastos, whose ability is contingent on machinery and technological advancement, has seen the highs and lows of humanity – from something like the atomic bomb and living in suburbia with his husband and young son. He brings a lot of heart and quick, clever lines to the role. Angelina Jolie’s Thena, the ensemble’s best warrior, gets her time to shine within action sequences. She also has a condition called “Mahd Wy’ry,” where too many memories fragment her mind and causes her to lash out at her teammates. Gilgamesh (Don Lee), the Hulk-like character in the Eternals, takes it upon himself to look after her. They have a shared bond you’ll wish had more time to show itself. There are beautiful backdrops aplenty, and Zhao and cinematographer Ben Davis know how to let shots linger in the right places. Either to make it, so the Eternals, Deviants, and Celestials feel out of this world, or when the landscape of sites like the Amazon makes it seem as though the Eternals fit in. The action is extremely fast-paced and is used to accentuate every character’s ability on screen. Eternals finds itself often caught in a spiderweb of the MCU structure that came before it. A tug-o-war between Zhao’s penchant for deep character excavation and superhero team-up tropes. They take from each other so that it feels as though both modes of storytelling don’t do quite enough. Ultimately, the film feels like a pet between two owners, and it’s confused on exactly who to run to. We have a team that has to reconvene together to stop calamity from happening. When they separate, the plot’s main message splinters with different exponential questions. It’s only when the characters are together that everything becomes clear.

"Oct 29, 2021"," There are a lot of mistaken beliefs held by the most passionate of diehard superhero movie fans, and one of the most corrosive is the idea that they’re not only the most important movies at all, but that they’re real movies. If a new director makes a smaller film that's creative and unique—even one that wins Oscars—the natural next step is for that person to step up and make a real movie, one where the characters have superpowers. It's the mindset that suggests that after Bong Joon-ho directed the brilliant, award-winning Parasite, it was time for him to step up and make a franchise movie, with Luke Skywalker or Batman. With Eternals, the latest Marvel Cinematic Universe film, this theory gets a rare real-life test case. The film’s directed by Chloe Zhao, who’s made acclaimed indie films like The Songs My Brothers Taught Me, The Rider, and last year's Nomadland. Eternals is a mess, and probably the worst MCU film since Thor: The Dark World. Zhao hasn’t lost it as a filmmaker—talented directors are allowed the occasional dud—but the structure of a superhero movie doesn't play to her strengths, or allow her to tell the sort of human stories she's good at. It also didn’t help that she's one of four co-writers, while she wrote her earlier films solo. Many things go wrong. The mythology is ridiculous, and just when we're getting our bearings a twist about an hour in scrambles everything. Also, the stakes dwarf those of everything Marvel has done to date, yet the film has to include a line of dialogue to explain why these superheroes never helped out during any of the calamities in the previous 25 movies. The CGI is unimpressive, making the action sequences ugly and hard to follow. Furthermore, there's so much exposition that it takes up a large chunk of the 157-minute running time. Dune had a lot of complex exposition too, but it also looked and sounded amazing. The Eternals are a group of ancient alien superheroes who were sent to Earth centuries earlier to fight a group of evil monsters called the Deviants. The group is led by Ajak (Salma Hayek), who has a direct line to the group's godlike figure. Also included are Sersi (Gemma Chan) and Ikaris (Richard Madden), who are centuries-old lovers, while there's also Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani, whose significant bulking up has drawn the majority of the film's media attention in the last two or three years). The youngest member is Sprite (Lia McHugh), who despite being hundreds of years old has never aged beyond age 12. Angelia Jolie also shows up, as Thena (not Athena), a warrior, while Barry Keoghan, the Irish actor with the unsettling, malevolent demeanor from The Killing of a Sacred Deer, plays a character called Druig. There are a handful of compelling backstories, most related to Sprite's plight, as well as that of Kingo, who due to his immortality has spent multiple generations as a Bollywood star. But there are just too many characters vying for time. The main villains, the monsters known as the Deviants, are boring. And while there are highlights in the overstuffed cast, Richard Madden (Robb Stark from Game of Thrones) isn't up to the large role he's given as a Superman knockoff character. Eternals is based on comic book characters created by Jack Kirby in the 1970s that are considered minor even to comic obsessives. These are the sort of characters who reach down to when it's the 26th film in the series (and one of four this year.) The Guardians of the Galaxy were pretty obscure too, at the time of their first movie, but at least their films were joyful. There's a lot of welcome representation, with probably the most multicultural cast of the MCU to date, in addition to a deaf superhero (Lauren Ridloff.) There's a gay superhero (played by Brian Tyree Henry), and rather than continue the Disney tradition of merely mentioning in passing that he's gay, he gets a family and a husband who he kisses on the mouth. The anti-woke types among the Disney fandom won’t like this, but some of their pro-woke counterparts are currently claiming the mixed early reviews of Eternals are evidence of racism. Eternals also breaks another significant barrier: Two characters have sex on camera, which in the MCU is groundbreaking. It's too bad the sex scene is so nondescript, between two boring characters.",NEUTRAL
"Oct 29, 2021","  Over the past 13 years the MCU has gained a steady stranglehold on Hollywood. The saturation of superheroes has brought an entirely new landscape to the box office. Highly militarized caped heroes saving Earth from weaponized threats, often at the cost of the very people they claim to save. While  there are exceptions to that framework, the MCU has thrived on doing the expected. It has taken Marvel from a near-bankrupt comics company to a worldwide box office smash-making studio that’s now, of course, owned by Disney. But the MCU’s 26th movie offers something entirely different. It’s a story about family, friendship, and love of all kinds. With Eternals, the MCU changes forever but not in the way we expect. Based on Jack Kirby’s esoteric and mythological superhero comic of the same name, Eternals is not a fan-favorite title, which affords the movie freedom. Most comics readers have attempted to break into the Eternals but few are die hard fans. There’s no Eternals run comparable to the success of say The Winter Soldier or The Infinity Saga. In that way, Chloé Zhao can reimagine the heroes and their world without the pressure of fan expectation. But that’s not to say this is a film that ignores the man who created its universe. In fact, Eternals is undoubtedly the most Kirby-influenced MCU movie yet. Not only is this his imagination playing out on screen, but Zhao has an understanding of the  themes, explorations, and notions that made Kirby tick, the same things that make his work so unendingly influential. Introducing eleven new characters is no easy feat but Zhao always makes it an engaging and enjoyable ride. We meet the Eternals on a mission to Earth, led by Ajak (Salma Hayek). The massive beings known only as Celestials send the immortals to our planet to protect it from the monstrous Deviants. Gemma Chan’s Sersi is our in-character as the Eternal most closely connected to humanity. Chan is a sterling lead, charming, brave, complex, and at the center of a fun love triangle. She’s torn between Ikaris (Richard Madden), the Superman-like Eternal who she’s known for centuries, and Dane Whitman (Kit Harrington), the human museum worker who she loves in contemporary London. Sersi and Dane’s world turns upside down when Ikaris reappears during a Deviant attack. From there we head out on a globe-trotting time-hopping adventure and reunite with the rest of the crew: Sersi’s roommate and eternal child, Sprite (Lia McHugh); technopath inventor Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry); speedster Makkari (Lauren Ridolff); Earth’s greatest warrior, Thena (Angelina Jolie); charming and powerful fighter, Gilgamesh (Don Lee); finger guns wielder and Bollywood star, Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani); and mind manipulator Druig (Barry Keoghan). In this sprawling cast, what should be Eternals’ biggest struggle is where Zhao finds its secret power. Each character shares a unique relationship with their fellow Eternals. There’s complexity and nuance built into the dynamics between them. It’s here that the movie truly stands out from its MCU counterparts. Tropes be damned, Zhao carves out unexpectedly human immortals who actually care about each other. They love and hate and fight and forgive and feud and feel together. It’s a refreshingly emotional take. Zhao’s human touch and interest in stories about characters first and action second brings a humanity and emotion that’s often lacking in the realm of superheroes. Sure, these are mythological figures, but they’re also people going on journeys of self discovery, trying to find their place in the universe whatever that means. Even with that at its center, Eternals features some incredible action. The cosmic nature of the Eternals brings a new life to the choreography and styling of the fights. Each character has a defined fighting style that interacts differently with their teammates, and together they’re a formidable team. Their relationships are what really make it work, though. Keoghan is brilliant as the dramatic and troubled Druig. His friendship with Ridolff’s energetic and hopeful Makkari is pure magic. Jolie and Lee shine whenever they’re on screen together in one of the film’s most surprising pairings. Harrington and Chan are at the heart of the adventure even though the latter is barely in the film. When the two are together, sparks fly. It makes us incredibly excited for wherever we see Dane pop up next. McHugh and Chan are also dynamite together as Madden looms over them in omnipotent power and struggle. He’s brilliant as both foil and friend to Sersi, and their centuries long romance is believable and heartbreaking. It’s not just a vibrant new team that Zhao introduces, however. This is a dense, esoteric piece of sci-fi that manages to be accessible and fun while always staying weird. The trailers do not do Zhao or ​​Ben Davis’ stunning cinematography justice as we explore the globe and far reaches of space. The much maligned MCU three act structure is nowhere to be seen. This is an ensemble family drama flung deep into the cosmos. Even the final act belies the classic MCU trope—there are no giant objects falling out of the sky—and offers up an exciting cliffhanger twist when all seems to be calm.  With the magnificent Eternals, Zhao joins Ryan Coogler and Taika Waititi in the realm of MCU directors who have managed to bring something new to the bombastic superhero world. In Zhao’s case, she’s created a truly international roster of heroes, each and every one a joy. But she’s also taken Kirby’s expansive and experimental sci-fi concepts and brought them to the screen in a way we’ve never seen. If the MCU can foster the weirdness and beauty that Zhao has worked so hard to bring, we’ll be lucky. And if those who follow her can keep the heart and soul that makes these characters so special, the MCU will be all the better for it.",POSITIVE

"Oct 29, 2021"," Without a doubt, Eternals is the most mystical, talkative, and far-fetched project the Marvel Cinematic Universe has aimed at to date. That’s rather telling considering the interconnected franchise’s track record of popcorn storytelling sprinkled with all the grains of salt in a comic book shaker. Forging a creation-busting path of human and superhuman history that spans beyond this world, Eternals is asking for a leap, a huge one that even the most fervent fans may not be able to comprehend or embrace.  Stoically opening with a long “In the beginning…” crawl, Eternals immediately begins to stack its bricks to build the eons-long interdependence between the planet-creating Celestials, their enlisted titular defensive force of humanoids, and the helpless people of Earth. First seen and referenced in the two Guardians of the Galaxy movies, the Celestials seeded Earth’s core millions of years ago with a future new one of their own. They also dispatched ten non-aging Eternals to foster the human race’s social and technological evolution and safeguard them from the monstrous Deviant creatures who would spoil the Celestials’ planetary fruit-on-the-vine. Leading the ten is Salma Hayek’s Ajak, a wise healer given the communication authority to converse with the Celestial judge Arishem (voiced by David Kaye), who observes Earth’s progress for what is growing inside. Decisions are made in the past, present, and future that change the entire course of civilization. Ajak wears that authority with reliable credence. She is flanked by a tight-knit brigade of warriors charging forward with different superpowers, sociological disciplines, and, as you can see from scanning their names like Thena and Gilgamesh, future cultural influences.  Some of the Eternals are devout to the chief mission of staying uninvolved while others have developed an affinity for the people they protect. The group disbanded after a division of ideologies during the Fall of Tenochtitlan in 16th century Mexico when the last Deviant was defeated. The group members have since folded themselves with bardic fables among earthlings as cult leaders, movie stars, museum curators, scientists, or vagabonds with a range of weak or strong senses of the value of innocent lives and overall faith in humanity. That dichotomy is seen and explored the most in the failed romantic relationship between the group’s genteel elemental manipulator Sersi (Crazy Rich Asians ensemble member Gemma Chan) and their most powerful champion, the flying Ikaris (Richard Madden of Cinderella) with his cosmic eye beams. Circling back to the present day, she has a new human beau named Dane Whitman (Game of Thrones star Kit Harrington) and new and more indomitable Deviants have reappeared, jarring the post-Blip MCU public. Their resurgence forces the estranged Eternals to re-form their ranks.  The eclectic cast of Eternals, combining elders with fresh faces, is a windfall of demographic milestones. Among them, you have Marvel’s first deaf (Lauren Ridloff of The Walking Dead), Latino (Hayek), Korean (Train to Busan’s Don Lee), Pakistani (Kumail Nanjiani of The Big Sick), Irish (The Killing of a Sacred Deer‘s Barry Koeghan), and gay (the busy Brian Tyree Henry, in his fifth 2021 film) superhero portrayals for the big screen. Some armchair finger-pointers are going to try and call for deliberately planted tokenism, as if Disney is trying to check off audience approval boxes. As Eternals progresses, that crowd will be rendered silent by the actors’ combined and invaluable screen presence. They were chosen for their talent. Gemma Chan steps to the front as the heart and soul among many others channeling the same spirit. Although it is quite difficult to give sizable focus or deep roots to this many new characters, even in a movie stretching beyond two-and-a-half hours, each and every Eternal earns tipping point moments, where the spotlight performer conveys the suitable gravitas for this epic scale. Oscar-winning Nomadland director Chloe Zhao, breaking hardcore cinephile hearts by taking this blockbuster commission, brings her patient and artful touch to what to many of her eminent peers have devalued as silly theme park roller coasters of content. Her invested involvement was a coup for Disney, made for an “incredible experience,” and one that does not deserve to damage her emerging career and prestige cinema cred.  The lurid pageantry of a superhero flick is still here, guided by eye-catching special effects and costumes laced with animated spirograph ribbons of digital filigree. However, cinematographer Ben Davis, working on his fifth Marvel film, slows down to match the endurance of Zhao to soak in the bright kinetic action as well as her signature magic hour backlighting in sumptuous locations like the Canary Islands. The normally bombastic composer Ramin Djawadi, returning the MCU from the first Iron Man, also dials down his danger music to include the soulful aim of his director. The grandiose convergence of mythic themes is all the talk of Eternals written by Zhao, screenwriter Patrick Burleigh (Peter Rabbit 2), and documentary short specialist cousins Ryan and Kaz Firpo (Refuge). It not so softly preaches the specialness of the planet and its people in the larger realm of existence where the exchange of energy at the end of one life begins another. Such heady motivations, coupled with heroism, is a lovely core away from the usual costumed good vs. evil throwdowns, but it’s very, very profuse, complete with all of the intergalactic gibberish in between. Honestly, Eternals swells the Jack Kirby fantasy to a level that is too excessive to absorb. Folks are going to need an atlas and a social studies tutor to get the ancient history and a stenographer to write it all down. Remember when Michael Bay’s Transformers movies upturned and bastardized Arthurian legend, dinosaur extinctions, Apollo moon landings, and teleported massive entities to orbit or collide with the planet for all to see? This movie is guilty of similar offenses. While Bay was deservedly chastised for the ludicrousness, the good graces of Marvel’s popularity will likely spare Eternals a butt-of-all-jokes fate. Still, this may be the movie we look back on where Marvel jumped an ocean of sharks it didn’t need to after having such a good thing going.

"Oct 29, 2021"," Prepare to be wowed. But not in the way you think. “Eternals,” the 25th epic in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, is a plea for diversity and empathy wrapped in an eye-popping blockbuster that keeps springing surprises you don’t see coming. “Eternals,” now in theaters, also takes on the gargantuan task of introducing 10 new superheroes who’ve never been on screen before. Lucky for us, that challenge falls to Chloe Zhao, the Chinese director and co-writer who’s never tackled anything of this size and scope. Zhao, whose “Nomadland” made her only the second woman and first woman of color to win a directing Oscar, makes character-based indie films (“Songs My Brothers Taught Me,” “The Rider’) whose combined budgets could hardly pay for a week’s catering on a Marvel movie. And yet it’s Zhao’s personal touch that makes “Eternals” stand out from the herd. That plus her exemplary work with actors, from the starry likes of Angelina Jolie and Salma Hayek to such stars in the making as Richard Madden and Gemma Chan. There are bumps in the road. Even Zhao can’t hold back the avalanche of exposition that slackens the pace or alien attacks (look out for that giant lobster) with special effects that seem lifted from the standard Marvel playbook. “Eternals” feels long at two hours and 37 minutes, taking its time to achieve liftoff with actors often posed in groups that suggest a static calendar layout instead of adrenalized filmmaking. It’s a lot to set 10 new superheroes spinning. We get it. But this plot needs goosing. Things improve when the action helps define character. What you need to know is that the Eternals are 7000 years old, from the planet of Olympia and sent by the Celestials (don’t ask) to protect humans from a monstrous species called the Deviants. Mission accomplished. Cut to present-day London, where the Deviants are back and all fired up for revenge on the Eternals. That means that Sersi (Gemma Chan) must leave her day job at the Natural History Museum and prepare for war with help from her protege, Sprite (Lia McHugh), an ancient trapped in the body of a teenager. Wait, there’s more. Ikaris (Richard Madden), Sersi’s love from a thousand years back, also returns with his power to fly and shoot destructive lasers out of his eyes and mess up Sersi’s new romance with Dane (Kit Harington), a human hottie who knows more than he first lets on. Did I mention that Sprite loves Ikaris from afar? She does. There’s also a relationship between Thena (a blonde Angelina Jolie), the brain-addled goddess of war, and her protector, Gilgamesh (Don Lee). And Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), the tech-genius among the Eternals, has built a family with his gay husband (a Marvel first). That leaves Ajak (Salma Hayek), the Eternals matriarch, with much to untangle, including a rebellion from Druig (Barry Keoghan), who resents her rules against using mind control to end violence, and the deaf Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), who hates being exiled on Earth. Among the Eternals, no one is having more fun than Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), the firebomber who has spent his downtime becoming a Bollywood star with a human videographer, Karun (Harish Patel), to capture his exploits. Nanjiani’s capacity to steal scenes cannot be questioned. Cheers to Zhao for bringing a distinct touch to characters whose time on Earth involves deaf and queer communities and actors of Black, Latina, and Asian descent. Based on the comics created by Jack Kirby in 1976, the movie shows its hand with the Uni-Mind, which allows the Eternals to quit squabbling and unite as a single force. As the Eternals sweep the globe from Australia to the Amazon—stick around for a post-credits sequence that connects Thanos and the Avengers to the path ahead—what you’ll remember is the quiet at the heart of the storm and the intimate connections that Zhao values above spectacle. Different? You bet. But it’s also what makes “Eternals” unique and unforgettable.",POSITIVE
"Oct 29, 2021"," I’m incredibly conflicted in my thoughts about Chloe Zhao’s Eternals, the newest cosmic comic book installation, into the ever expanding Marvel cinematic universe. On the surface and underneath, it is a movie that’s unlike anything we’ve seen before, and in the world of superhero cinema, it often only takes a few steps in a different direction in order to separate yourself from the pack. That is what Zhao has done, creating a film that is in her style of narrative, with an all-star cast of actors on hand, and still capturing her signature cinematography on site, expanding beyond endless galactic lands. It all amounts to a collection of super-human characters, trying to win the battle against monster beasts, in hopes to provide eternal protection in the world. Along with Loki and Shang-Chi recently, the major goal and mounting powers in the MCU are growing to massive size, sometimes gorgeous to look at, but resulting in more disappointment than Eternal bliss. Eternals is ambitious in scope and hollow in the core. The team is made up of ten characters, Ajak (Salma Hayek) the wise, a healing power leader, Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani) shooting bolts of fire from his hands, Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry) the creator of inventions beyond comprehension, Sprite (Lia McHugh) a child-like women of multiplying wonders, Thena (Angelina Jolie) the powerful fighting warrior, Makkari (Lauren Ridloff) super speed that makes your head spin, Gilgamesh (Ma Dong-seok) the man with powerful fighting fists, and Druig (Barry Keoghan) with the mind capacity to control anyone. The two main characters that the screenplay- written by Zhao, Patrick Burleigh, Ryan and Kaz Firpo- decide to focus on is Sersi (Gemma Chan) and Ikaris (Richard Madden), both connected for centuries with one another, her with ability to change all matter, and him flying and shooting lasers from his eyes. This team has been together for centuries, since the dawn of time, sent by the creator Arishem to defeat celestial beasts known as Deviants. Only their protection has rules to not become involved in the ways of humanity, but when a new batch of Deviants has arrived in the present day, something has awoken, and now the Eternals must band together to do what they do best- protect the planet. When I spell it out a bit more Eternals seems to make more sense, but when sitting in the theater there’s a lot to take in. The massive scale of the story is almost ripe for the director of Nomadland to take on, using her style of taking large landscapes as the background setting, held up against people who feel lost and alone. Unlike the independent film style her earlier work benefited from, the massive scale of Eternals, along with a large cast lacking in any true chemistry, this production never finds a way to gel. There’s never a single performance that finds a groove, with Nanjiani and Tyree Henry used as the comic relief, dropping lines that only evoke “huh’s” and “hee’s”, while Chan and Madden desperately attempt to suck out a romance that can never blossom. Even Hayek and Jolie feel placed in the back seat, where their characters are neutralized, more than set free. When the monsters arrive to fight they’re not fearsome beasts, but more CGI concoctions that have little design to separate them from any other threat in a Marvel movie. In many ways Eternals is not a Chloe Zhao problem as much as it is an MCU problem. After the lights came back on my first thought was that this is where comic book movies have “jumped the shark”. The goal of Kevin Feige and co. continues to be cinema domination, expanding the rolodex of characters that will allow them to criss-cross stories and Disney plus shows, but at what cost? The cost for Disney is a pile of money. For the art of cinema it’s a never ending stream of movies that become increasingly boring and pointless. The stakes in Eternals are set up as the disintegration of the universe as we know it and not for a single minute is there a genuine threat. It’s not that I’m spoiling the ending, where audiences will flood the theaters and see what it’s all about anyway, but our heroes rarely lose. For Eternals it is the peak of that problem. The cinematography is beautiful in moments and the characters all have unique powers- something Marvel-Disney will do all over again with X-Men soon- but what they never are is interesting. Were it not for Zhao trying to inject more reality into the superhuman beings, Eternals would be a big flop. That’s not to say I am entirely down on Eternals, especially because this is still Marvel trying a different narrative style, a different approach to a story that wants to inspect the internal conflicts of beings that have lived forever. That’s not been done enough and Zhao is an auteur that desperately injects her way of filmmaking. It’s all still not enough, where the ending becomes a large-scale battle, complete with CGI fighting, and post-credit sequences that are supposed to mean something greater for the future, negating everything we watched before them. Eternals may be a movie worthy of a second look as time goes on, but for now this is a movie that’s better left in the past.",NEUTRAL
"Oct 29, 2021"," Joan of Arcadia is a forgotten American TV show about a teenage girl who gets assignments from God (yes, of course the title is a play on Joan of Arc). Ostensibly a replacement for the sickeningly sweet Touched by an Angel, the series proved more rebellious than its predecessor, with the angsty Joan refusing to blindly follow God’s bizarre and often annoying tasks. But it’s not until a man with his own assignments from God shows up that the series flirts with a truly complicated turn. He blazes in with the point of view that God isn’t all they’re cracked up to be, and after dispensing with the usual look-at-this-messed-up-world argument, he gets to the good stuff: “I didn’t ask to be born, but now that I’m here, it’s all up to me. I like it that way. My life is a gift? Okay, thanks. You can’t ask for it back.” What he’s getting at here is a question about free will, of why God would create beings with choice and then throw them into such a painfully flawed world where they’re asked to make all the right ones. There’s cruelty in it if you look from a certain angle, one that might make God’s plans not worth following, or more insidiously, might make God themself unworthy of deference. Sadly, the series never got to explore these ideas because it was cancelled right after this character was introduced. Still, a nice little show on American network TV broached them, and it was hardly the first piece of pop culture to take on uncomfortable questions about God while also entertaining us. That’s why I will not be giving Eternals brownie points for posing a similar scenario, even if it does make the film one of the headier entries in the MCU. We all sensed that Phase 4 was going to be a revamp, a freshening of a story that reached a semi-conclusion with Endgame, and pivoting as Eternals does to explore superheroes as agents of a flawed, god-like figure is certainly a revamp, even if it doesn’t prove to be a particularly refreshing one. The odd thing is that the pivot ostensibly makes this a perfect entry point for Chloé Zhao into the MCU. The Oscar-winning director of existential character pieces like Nomadland and The Rider was an unexpected get for the series, and while some decried it as a “selling out” by one of our great low-budget filmmakers, most (including myself), gave her the credit she deserves. Maybe she could take a group of little-known superheroes and infuse their story with the thematic depth that’s missing from much of the MCU. Others have produced similar magic within its confines, from the not wrong bad guy in Black Panther to the melancholic loneliness that underlies Captain America, and don’t even get me started on non-MCU superhero franchises (if you ever want a full-throated endorsement of Logan, I’m your guy). No, the myth that superhero movies have to choose between being bombastic, money-making productions or contemplative allegories is just that, a myth, and Zhao had the potential to bring the false dichotomy crashing down. Unfortunately, the picture she’s made may just reinforce it. What she’s done as a co-writer and director within the MCU is create a movie that lurches between the empty Play-Doh punching of the series and the lurking existentialism she infused into her previous films, the former not being inventive enough to find new thrills and the latter getting too little time to build depth. The pieces for both elements were right in front of her with the eclectic bunch that is the Eternals. A quick intro establishes that they are a group of beings sent to Earth by God-like figures to help humans along by providing inspiring stories, advanced technological blueprints, and protection from evil monsters (but only one kind of monster, which is why they haven’t helped before). Their various powers means all ten (yes, ten) of them are essential to humanity’s development and have their own unique relationship to their wards. Some, including Gemma Chan’s Sersi and Brian Tyree Henry’s Phastos, find beauty in our cultures and choose to live among us. Others, like Salma Hayek’s Ajak and Don Lee’s Gilgamesh, are curious but keep themselves removed while Barry Keoghan’s Druig gets way too emotionally involved. Basically, each near-immortal creature gives Zhao a different way to examine humanity’s faults and strengths, and then those lived experiences get to bash against the cold perspective of a remote God. So much potential! Way more, it turns out, than Zhao could realistically fit into one film, and instead of focusing on the intersections between these complicated perspectives or narrowing it down to one or two deep dives, the emotional core of this movies is…a love story (and not even the gay one). A bland, been-there-done-that, sparkless romance between Chan’s Sersi and Richard Madden’s Ikaris that was intended to serve as the clash (and rooted-for resolution) between the figureheads of an ethical split that forms among the Eternals.  Basically, they’re Captain America and Iron Man in Civil War, and in the same way most of the heroes in that movie took sides based on narrative convenience instead of any semblance of character-based reasoning (seriously, Iron Man wants oversight?), each of the Eternals pick a side without us spending enough time with them to understand why. Instead, it gets distracted by assembling the crew (which becomes a series of Eternal fetch quests as protracted as the Infinity Stone fetch quests in Endgame) and repetitive pounding of the barely explained monsters they’re protecting humans from.  Perhaps this format would’ve worked if what we learned about each Eternal’s life carried over into their actions with the group or if the monsters attacking them played into the existential questions at this movie’s heart. Since they don’t, these structural elements feel like unrelated holdovers from the series this heady movie is clunkily trying to fit into, and frankly, like a boring waste of time. Again, the issue here isn’t that an intelligent theme can’t exist within the familiar structures of the MCU, and the fact that both are present in Eternals tells me that Zhao recognized the potential as well. She just didn’t use each element to build up the other, so each exists in their own half-formed state, with neither being enough to satisfy. Basically, they’re Captain America and Iron Man in Civil War, and in the same way most of the heroes in that movie took sides based on narrative convenience instead of any semblance of character-based reasoning (seriously, Iron Man wants oversight?). Likewise Captain America turns agains the US government – because he discovers that the US government is itself fundamentally corrupt and a perversion of it’s own values.",NEGATIVE

"Oct 29, 2021"," Envy lies at the core in the long, ongoing war between Marvel and The Distinguished Competition: Each wants what the other has. In the modern era, this conflict is displayed in the cinematic sphere, a public arena in which post-Disney acquisition Marvel handily won, at least at the box office and in the popular consciousness. Their films are legitimate cultural events, well-reviewed and gossiped about, and entire lamprey-like industries of bottom feeders have symbiotically leeched on to their underbellies, sucking bits and pieces of rumor and information from fleeting bites beneath the monster’s armored skin. What, possibly, could Marvel want from their lesser, having had it all? Well, respect. One only needs to look at the reception Zack Snyder got from the film/nerd community and the public at large once a greater consciousness emerged about his mistreatment at the hands of Warners and DC brass and resulted in the creation — and good reception– of Zack Snyder’s Justice League. Like his films or not, there is no way one can separate his name from the films that he makes (proof that the “visionary director” branding has some manner of effect), which is a feat that Marvel has only managed to equal once or twice: Perhaps Taika Waititi or Ryan Coogler was as well known as the properties that they were adapting. They wanted all of the trappings of auteurism for a project like Eternals, and hired an indie darling in the form of Chloe Zhao, winner of last year’s Best Picture Oscar for Nomadland, to shepherd a consciousness-altering film that would “hit different” into the eyes of grateful audiences around the world.  It’s genuinely frustrating to say this — and not out of any manner of pride or fanboy defensiveness or anything other than sheer crushing disappointment — but Eternals is the kind of soulless and vacant product that so many Marvel haters have often accused the MCU of being in years past. It abandons every single thing that made the massive franchise run under the hood while doubling down on the worst aspects of this corner of the superhero genre’s style. It’s ugly, charisma-free, dour, overlong, exposition-heavy, patronizing, and, worst of all, it has none of the heart even feinted at by the least successful films within the MCU canon. It is a dispiriting experience, one that makes the viewer dread the idea of ever seeing any of these characters again, and is perhaps what comic book fans assumed would happen with the first Guardians of the Galaxy film back when it was announced: a terrible merger of filmmaker and form and an oft-miscast ensemble that would turn off normies and quickly be shunted into whatever cornfield that Terence Howard disappeared to after the first Iron Man. At the ridiculous 150-minute runtime that the film sits at, I can’t even guess how many folks will either walk out of the theater they’re in midway through or, if they’re streaming, will eventually give up and go back to watch Ant-Man or something again after clicking on it when it arrives on Disney+. You know, one of the fun ones. Or, hell, maybe they’ll just go watch the new cut of Justice League.  You see, Snyder and Zhao are concerned with similar things: They want to illustrate the issues of being a super-powered individual in a world that they’ve grown with, as they’re forced to endure the possible obliteration of a place they’ve come to love, thanks to their obligations to a mysterious “other,” and there’s a heavy emphasis on these characters being like “gods,” at a remove from humanity even as they try to participate in it. But where Snyder emphasizes both grit and Wagnerian theatrics as he fully dedicates every ounce of his energy to crafting eye-popping images even if it’s at the expense of the things comic fans lust over, and as he attempts to imagine an interesting answer to the question of “What if God was one of us?,” Zhao literalizes it. Enter the Eternals, a race of super-powered alien beings from a galaxy, far, far away, who have been sent by the Celestial master to watch over the people of Earth during the planet’s infancy. Their mission: protect nascent human civilization from the Deviants (CGI, occasionally Bill Skarsgard in a mo-cap suit), who are sort of alien “apex predators” (as the film handily informs us). They’re forbidden from intervening in human conflict, but their celestial god-emperor is a little laxer with the rules than, say, the Prime Directive is in Star Trek. As such, the Eternals shape human civilization, guiding the evolution of humanity over the ages, kicking off periods of technological advancement as well as inventing stories of themselves as gods to be filtered down through the ages. A schism occurs in the group in 1521, during the Conquistador pillage of a South American village (outside of two recurring characters, humans are rarely glimpsed here, and when they are seen, they’re usually genociding one another), which causes them to split up. Cut to 500 years later: Sersei (Gemma Chan), the group’s resident manipulator of matter (She can change rocks into water! She can change trees into water!), is living a peaceful life incognito in London, where she works at a museum as a teacher. Her boyfriend (Kit Harrington, one of two humans in the cast) wants her to move in with him, but she’s hesitant to commit, given that she’s an immortal superhuman who will undoubtedly outlive him. She’s in London with the illusion-master Sprite (Lia McHugh), who, like Kirsten Dunst in Interview With the Vampire, is an immortal being in what’s basically a child’s body: we see her crafting an illusion of an older woman in order to flirt with a dickhead at the bar, which is… discomforting, to say the least. On the way home from the pub, they’re attacked by a self-healing Deviant, which is surprising for two reasons: they thought they killed all of them centuries ago, and healing is about a power which they weren’t expecting it to have. The day is saved by Ikaris (Richard Madden), who arrives at the last moment to rescue the threesome, and it’s decided that they need to get the band back together. I’m gonna list them all here in rapid-fire fashion because I’m already getting tired thinking about it: There’s Druig (Barry Keoghan), who can control minds and fucked off into the jungles of South America to raise his own mind-control slave tribe of pacifists; Thena (Angelina Jolie), who is the goddess Athena but has weird superhero dementia, who is watched over by the Tank of the group, Gilgamesh (Don Lee); there’s Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), a deaf speedster who apparently invented sign language; there’s laser-gun fingered Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), a Bollywood actor and vainglorious asshole, complete with a manservant; Phaistos (Bryan Tyree Henry), the super-inventor, who has a bad habit of making things at the exact wrong time for humanity (in which Marvel surpasses their glib referencing of human trafficking in the most hilarious possible fashion) and who has since retired to live with his husband and kid in the suburbs; and, finally, Ajax (Salma Hayek), the group’s leader, who knows about their master’s secret designs for the planet and their real purpose there.  Before we get into the real meat of why I disliked this film so much, let’s touch on the film’s unremarkable look, which is as if an Instagram filter had been applied to a CW superhero show. Zhao’s filmmaking flourishes as we’ve known them — a Malickian naturalism, usually photographed in a sense-stimulating way, coupled with semi-honest performances — aren’t really present for much of the film, with most of Eternals‘ style being the same old Marvel-core imagery. There are, of course, grey battle sequences loaded with CGI (that only gets more noticeable the more one digs into the fights themselves, which can most likely be better experienced — and interacted with — in any of the modern Final Fantasy games), an ugly muddy color-grading that perhaps best serves the digital artists working on detail-lacking renders, and, of course, a semi-colorful acknowledgment of the cosmic weirdness that only a person like Jack Kirby could have invented. If the argument is that a consistent style between films is worthwhile, given the shared universe concept, one can only imagine how much grander it might have looked had filmmakers been let off the leash to follow their heart’s odd desires. If, instead, we’re trying to say this is a work of unbridled auteurism, free of studio influence and interference, well, it suggests that her specific cinematic imagination isn’t well-suited to this kind of epic storytelling. Regardless, the meager amount of golden/magic hour-shot cinematography that Feige and the PR corps have pointed to and will continue to gesture at in public comments is not the kind of bread that one can live on, to say absolutely nothing of the other absent nutrients needed for any kind of storytelling to provide some measure of sustenance or enrichment. It’s embarrassing that this is going to push Dune off of IMAX screens in a little over a week because that’s a film that deserves the presentation. You could watch this on TV, if you wanted to. The experience won’t be changed. But all of that is small potatoes — and endemic to Marvel movies — compared to what lies at the rotten heart of this movie. For years, the studio has had a stable formula, and it’s been one that’s worked well for them: introduce your characters, give viewers something interesting to latch on to — a new setting, or, ideally, fun and compelling personalities to watch banter and grow — and fully form them before introducing them into new settings with other characters, especially if they’re unknown to the public. You can skip that last step if you’re dealing with a figure as well known as Spider-Man, as they did in Captain America: Civil War, because every single person can most likely describe exactly what his deal is, but you can’t do that with a list of esoteric C-listers like the Eternals, especially if your point is how inaccessible and estranged these characters are from everyday life. Few of the characters have any warmth to them and, even if they fuck on screen, it’s not a substitute for some measure of character evolution: there is no arc here that is resonant or unique for the film, with Feige and Zhao having abandoned the sole aspect of the Neil Gaiman take on the characters that made them narratively compelling: There, the characters had forgotten their memories of their massive adventures and assumed they were human, but here, they remember everything (perhaps Captain Marvel made the twist feel redundant, especially with their releases so close together). Again, their non-intervention policy makes no sense, especially when one character aids in one of the 20th century’s most explosive events, seen weeping in the fallout, and their in-universe explanation for not helping the world against Thanos… also doesn’t hold water. I’m not going to spoil much if anything, but there’s also an unsatisfactory revelation about why these characters are so garbage that attempts to provide a reason why, but it makes total sense, and also suggests that, in other hands, these characters would have been villains, especially stripped of their Kirby-ian insanity.  Again, the aspect of the MCU that separated it from all prior comic book cinema was its warmth: it, at its core, was a celebration of the humanity within these mega-powered men and women, with the slight psychological complexity of the Mighty Marvel Way straight from the comic books sprinkled atop it like sugar to help the fable go down. Every character both fulfills a viewer’s fantasy through their power yet is tempered by a downside — not a tangible weakness like kryptonite, but an aspect of their character that must be overcome for them to be wise and just. These are compelling takes on a Hero’s Journey-style tale, and they were embodied well by the name actors who were smartly cast in the right roles. But Eternals doesn’t have a replacement for those well-loved characters lined-up, nor does it take a particularly bright view of humanity. One remembers the scene in the first Avengers where Loki goes off about how people need to be controlled, that they should want to kneel before the powers before them, and it’s as if Zhao and Feige watched that scene and said to themselves “You know, maybe he was right.” The Eternals are cultural Imperialists, robbing humanity of the beauty of its achievements (our fables, our religions, our ceremonies) and likewise stealing from us the uniqueness of our evils and failures (the recipe for gunpowder and other things having been shared with them), and one has to wonder: if they’re speaking in accented English, did they plant those cultural seeds too? Are we descended from them, like a portion of the population is from Genghis Khan? But I’d doubt they’d want to mix genes with us as the film’s perspective is that, without the guiding hand of a well-muscled super-race, humanity would have fallen into darkness and despair centuries before it ever had a chance to thrive. This, again, is at odds with everything Marvel has given us to date, except for the Avengers’ attempts to circumvent international law, given that they know what’s better for us than us, like inventing a super-A.I. to watch over the world.  The more I think about it, the more respect I have for Snyder for just being willing to make nakedly fascist art, echoing the Wagner featured on his soundtracks and the Nietzchian ethos at the heart of the name “Superman.” But he also prominently features human characters, who offer a necessary counterweight to the talk of Gods and Monsters, and even has one — though his power may be his wealth — that co-leads his big team. But this is also what makes the allusions to DC characters scattered all throughout Eternals so strange: the film seems to want you to draw a link between these two forms, for you to compare and contrast the characters and cheer when you see what little subversion it’s doing, but it ultimately suggests the lack. Marvel never even had to acknowledge the existence of other worlds beyond their own (or, well, within the stable of IP that Disney owns), but here, they attempt to stoke fires in the mind, perhaps to take a victory trot after sinking the winning three in the championship-deciding ball game, having left their small-market team to play with the big boys in the big city on some super team. Hell, they’ve already probably got their backs turned. But this shot rims out, and I’m thinking that Feige and the Mighty Marvel Machine won’t know the damage they’ve done to the soul of their brand of storytelling until they begin to hear the laughs and jeers of the crowd. It will sound unfamiliar to them, but perhaps they need to hear it. ",NEGATIVE
"Oct 28, 2021"," by Walter Chaw Chloé Zhao’s follow-up to her Oscar-winning Nomadland is one of those movies that is more interesting to talk about than to watch–which, in the final analysis, may be the poet laureate of South Dakota’s most distinctive auteur hallmark. Despite that it’s the twenty-some-odd instalment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Eternals is defiantly a Chloé Zhao picture, and the amount of subversion required to make it so highlights both MCU overlord Kevin Feige’s desperation to shake the diversity monkey off his back and his fatal lack of understanding of women creators at the most rudimentary level. In theory that doesn’t matter much if all these folks are asked to do is direct the parts that aren’t generic action scenes, committee-generated in the house style and dropped into the middle of whatever flaccid drama is possible under the narrative conditions like dead paratroopers into a live warzone. What you see in Eternals is a result of what feels less like a partnership with its attendant compromises than like a quiet war waged in the spaces between a boss who thinks he knows what’s happening and a hired gun who’s pretty clever about having her way no matter the amount of oversight. By the third or fourth laborious exposition dump by the least comfortable, least seasoned and natural actor in the loaded cast (that would be 14-year-old Lia McHugh), it’s pretty clear that Zhao’s empathy for unaffected performers rambling in lingering magic-hour landscapes has won the day. Good one, Zhao. Less endearing is how Zhao has also imported her studied neutrality–a certain unwillingness to engage entirely during a period in which the concept of neutrality is tacit endorsement of the forces pushing for the apocalypse. Take, for example, the question of climate change as it’s addressed in Eternals: that it’s the fault of humanity, yes, not for the things they could or shouldn’t be doing, but for the fact of their existence. The critical mass described by the film isn’t carbon emissions driven by capitalism and corruption, it’s world population hitting the exact number to hatch a massive, celestial being from Earth’s core. It’s a Douglas Adams-ian twist, this reveal that the Earth itself is a machine with an arcane function, but as it’s triggered here it plays into the worst, most racist and colonial theories about overpopulation in underdeveloped nations especially. In her quest not to get too involved with the crises of our modern age, Zhao kicks over a Vesuvian ant-pile of unintentional offense. On a smaller scale, take what should, for example, be a watershed moment: Marvel’s first gay kiss, possible only because one of our heroes has invented the nuclear bomb that levelled Hiroshima. Yes, one of the foundational texts for Eternals appears to be Alain Resnais’s Hiroshima mon amour, complete with its moony meditation on the nature of history and memory. The notion that good can come from bad and that bad can come from good is the engine that drives Eternals, though what’s good as a thought exercise or zen koan is not good in a big, stupid spectacle film Frankensteined together from an indie darling’s defiance at the grace of a corporate monolith insisting on prefabricated story elements and de rigueur action scenes. Eternals is a mess with a plot that manages the trick of being at once too convoluted and too simplistic. It’s not entirely unlike Akira in that respect, and both share the burden of having hundreds of pages and dozens of volumes of lore to distill into a single film that ideally needs room to be more than mere scene-setting. Akira, however, didn’t dumb everything down so much as to take its audience for granted. The screenplay credits for Eternals aren’t necessarily damning in themselves, but they portend the movie’s disarray and doggedly auteurist bent, with Zhao listed twice–once as a solo writer and once in collaboration with Patrick Burleigh. When you place an auteur in what is essentially series television, you either get a complete smoothing-out of whatever’s jagged about the auteur that you admire (and I doubt a truly Tarantino episode of “ER” would’ve been something anyone was all that jazzed about), or you get tissue rejection on a massive scale resulting in a painful, drawn-out death. Realizing this, some directors walk away in the middle of a production or before one starts. Zhao has decided to stand her ground. I’m not saying I don’t admire her for it, I’m saying it’s hard to watch. More so than usual, even. In short, Eternals is about a bunch of immortal super-beings created to fight a bunch of immortal super-beings by a Celestial god-being who makes planets and loads them with life. When monsters called Deviants appear one day to eat the life on these planets, the Celestial, Arishem (voiced by David Kaye), employs the same plan to protect humanity as the little old lady who swallowed a fly employs to rid her body of said fly. In defiance, the Eternals’ plan to stop the destruction of the world is the same as Voltron’s plan to turn five lions into a robot. The big question the film tries to answer a couple of times is why these super-beings, despite being here for 7,000 years, didn’t do anything to prevent Thanos from disappearing half the universe in one of the other middle instalments of this endless hell, but because Zhao has insisted on much of the first three or four hours of her film showing human populations genociding each other at actual sites of historical atrocity, the better question might be why Eternals stood idly by during chattel slavery, let’s say, or the Rape of Nanking, or the Holocaust. Realizing that this is now the pertinent question on the minds of Eternals‘ stultified audience, Zhao provides the answer of how war causes humans to develop better medical technologies, meaning that humans will proliferate at an accelerated rate. Eternals don’t prevent unimaginable atrocities that are within their power to prevent because the medical experimentation that occurs during these periods is good for growth. Pruning a tree helps it grow; raping and murdering entire cultures helps the human tree grow. That’s one of those things that maybe you ought to try saying out loud before chiselling it in stone, even if it turns out that Arishem, maybe, in a classic God move, doesn’t care about all that suffering in the context of his secret but grand plan. If this is really the plan, though, why aren’t Eternals tasked with creating conflict among men? And if critical mass is what’s required for the Celestial’s plan to work, doesn’t it follow that each human killed once it reaches its target will slow the target, meaning that the Eternal’s non-involvement at the end when human reproduction has begun to slow and even regress (as it has) is in fact counterproductive to its plans? For an omniscient being, Arishem is pretty stupid. The only way to read Eternals charitably, as it happens, is as a repudiation of Christianity and the death cult it has shown itself to be. If it’s that, then it joins the likes of “Midnight Mass” as a real reckoning with how it is that White Evangelicals remain the only group voting in great numbers for monsters, the better to bring about the end of the world. Its bits about blind devotion to an old testament are good–this fidelity to any old iron causing a schism between Eternals who want to save the Earth and Eternals who want to trust that their god knows best. Late in the game, the most powerful of Eternals, Ikaris (Richard Madden), expresses his fanatical, fundamentalist devotion to a creed that clearly spells doom for the humans he’s spent millennia protecting, and it’s chilling, the analogues to our current fascistic theocratic state stark and despairing. Ikaris, for what it’s worth, is essentially another of Marvel’s attempts to have a Superman, and it begs the question: if Eternals are created beings, why aren’t they all this powerful? In this quasi-Superman’s puritanical religiosity, find an echo of DC’s recent decision to change Superman’s motto from “the American Way” to “a Better Tomorrow” in response to America definitively losing its way. This rebrand, and the image used to convey it (people joined together in a Buy the World a Coke tableau of manipulated uplift), rings patently trite. The way to a better tomorrow is by joining hands with people you disagree with fundamentally on the right to exist? You can shove your philosophy of neutrality up your ass. I’m haunted by the opening sequence of Eternals, set in 5000 BC Mesopotamia, where a little kid watches his father get eaten by a sea monster before he’s saved from a similar fate in one of the most un-thrilling action sequences in a franchise that has become known for unimaginative action sequences. When the dust settles, Sersi (Gemma Chan) gives the kid a dagger that is meant, I think, to represent a great leap forward for humanity into the Bronze Age. The equivalent to the monolith in 2001, n’est-ce pas? How, though, does a dagger unlock the secrets of metallurgy to a hunting/gathering society already using spears to fish and hunt? And if it’s not representative of a great leap for human cultural evolution, then what is it? Is it meant to be a trinket to lessen the mourning for a kid who, frankly, doesn’t appear even mildly upset that his dad was just eaten in front of him. I’m troubled by this prologue, because if it’s the one thing, it’s poorly thought through and, in a film that is basically a distended exposition dump, not well-reasoned; and if it’s the other thing, it’s callow and facile. Adding Zhao to the MCU stable was meant to introduce humanity into the proceedings, and early reviews of this film have trumpeted the genuine emotions of this story of a broken family finding one another again to fight a great evil. Yet this moment intended as simultaneous throwaway and portent is magnificently mishandled. Sersi, this ageless being, sees a boy witness an unimaginable atrocity and…gives him a pocket knife? The rest of the film’s chewing over of whether or not to save humanity calls me back to this moment, in which it’s clear that the fate of the planet is a theoretical exercise for Eternals rather than an emotional one. In that pursuit, Zhao centres the four most boring people in the cast to take the lead. Bland Sersi, who meekly agrees to boyfriend Ikaris’s promises to protect her; bland Ikaris, whose great moment of transformation is indicated by a few man-tears (still coded as sensitivity somehow in 2021); bland Dane (Kit Harington), a little-used human boyfriend to Sersi who nonetheless drives Sersi’s key character conflict, though she doesn’t seem overly tortured or interested or engaged; and poor Sprite (McHugh), who is so overmatched by the terrible dialogue she’s asked to emit that it feels like cruelty. But the unpracticed child is who Zhao is most interested in, either because of her commitment to non-professional actors or because she’s the one most likely to irritate Feige, who has assembled for Zhao explosive actors like Angelina Jolie and Salma Hayek, as well as charismatic ones like Kumail Nanjiani and Ma Dong-seok. The dramatic centre of the climax, this Claudia from Interview with the Vampire or Homer from Near Dark is also the alleged comic relief. And she’s the critical angle in the second of the film’s two love triangles. In her almost uncannily unnatural delivery, Sprite is the physical manifestation of a feast sequence in the middle of the picture where these Eternals try their best to act like relatable characters at a dinner party while dropping contractually-obliged MCU Easter eggs like, Who’s gonna lead the Avengers now that Captain Rogers and Tony Stark are gone? YOU, IKARIS? (Awkward laughter.) There’s room for a gross-out gag, too, when the Asian guy reveals he’s made beer using his spit (like how the Peruvians used to make chicha). Zhao isn’t known for comedy, and, true to form, none of this is funny. If Eternals is a philosophical jumble and a narrative mess, it’s also overcrowded with a gallery of characters cleverly named to suggest the gods and heroes of myth–and it fails to establish them beyond the broad parameters of skill-sets that seem unbound by any rules. Sersi changes something into a tree at one point, a talent at odds with her assertion that she’s only able to transmute inanimate objects. Oh yeah, Sersi transmutes inanimate objects. Like a bus into a bunch of rose petals. One Eternal punches hard, one can control every mind on the planet apparently except those of his peers, one is Superman, one is The Flash. Thena (Jolie) is Athena, goddess of war, and she is good at war, and then there’s Ajak (Hayek), the Eternals’ leader, who can heal people. I should mention, too, that Sprite can create convincing holograms and does so in the early going to confuse one of the Deviants, but then she reveals that she can also render herself and others invisible. Remember in E.T. when he makes the bike fly and shit? Why didn’t the little fucker do that in the beginning to get back on his ship? In Eternals, that sort of thing is harder to overlook. Harder still after it’s revealed what the Eternals actually are, as what they are means that they can’t ever truly be killed. I do like the note that Thena is experiencing a malfunction where the weight of all her memories is driving her insane, although I don’t like that a woman in this movie is insane. I’ve barely touched on the Deviants themselves, standard CGI bugbears until one becomes humanoid and turns out exactly like Paul Bettany’s Vision character. It’s hard to keep talking about this garbage. Eternals is awful by most conventional measures of quality and enjoyment, but it carries the distinction of being weird. It’s a film by someone diametrically opposed to this universe’s showrunner who was nonetheless given an outsized amount of power to do whatever the hell she wanted out of respect for the social condemnation that would have accompanied her muzzling. Which doesn’t mean there wasn’t some muzzling. I have a hard time picturing Zhao, left to her own devices, doing a movie about ten superbots battling a god made out of rock over the fate of the world, or framing a scene in the charred aftermath of Hiroshima, where the Hephaestus character cries out in anguish over his role in this war crime, or the scene where Hayek rides a horse at twilight on a lonesome Dakota plain. Wait, that last one I can picture. Eternals is one half a studiedly, disastrously neutral movie about super-beings declining to participate in the quelling of rape and murder on a grand scale, and one half a movie about super-beings actively participating in genocide through not only their disinterest but their actions, too. It’s an incurably silly film that has one Eternal hiding in plain sight as a Bollywood star, while at the same time it’s a deadly serious film that depicts the conquest of Tenochtitlan by Cortés that involved forced famine, genocide, and razing. Eternals is a joke about serious things. I’m just not sure who the joke’s on. Maybe Zhao is funnier than I give her credit for.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 28, 2021"," If you’re not amazed by how bad Chloe Zhao’s Eternals is, you either haven’t seen the movie, just hate all Marvel blindly or you really aren’t paying attention. It is quite a feat, really, as Marvel has done nothing if not maintain a level of consistency over the 25 previous feature films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which is to say, produced by Marvel under the producing leadership of Kevin Feige.  So instead of just doing an abusive review of the film, I thought I would offer up a more generalized idea of what core Marvel values are missing from this particular film. Here is a list of things not to do, if you want to make a Marvel movie that will not be mocked until Tony Stark returns to life.  Bad Villain Who is the villain of Eternals? Who cares? The mighty Arishem, whose spoken name is awful close to one the Jewish names for God, Hashem, makes the pre-Brolin versions of Thanos seem like a big personality. He not only looks like a bad LEGO figure… he looks like he was made of candy LEGOs. He is less intimidating than the cost of a large popcorn. The audience doesn’t get any insight into him… and thus, no passion and no interest.  Bad Monsters Who the hell allowed the temp Deviants to be put into the final film? They look like the elaborate metalic macrame project that caught your eye at the art fair, but when you went to consider buying them, you realized they would end up in the garage after about a week because they are so ugly and uninteresting. So these non-descript, personality-free giant CG animals are running around and in addition to their big dumbness, they have tentacles that suck the everything out of Eternals when they attach for long enough. Zzzzzz. Sometime late in the movie, we find that if you, somehow (never explained), put a few of these things together, they take an almost human shape, like the world’s slimiest Transformers. Truth told, bad monsters has been a problem through a lot of the MCU, mostly pathetically in the first Avengers film, where the flying scooter machines screamed of “we haven’t really figured out how to do this on a budget yet, so take this mediocrity in a movie you really liked until now and get over it… no one else has it down yet either.” But they have mostly solved this problem in recent films. That said, a movie I kinda love, Shang-Chi, is loaded with great monsters… until the third act, when it all gets sketchy and undefined and not as good as the rest of the film. If the MCU needs to focus on any one thing, it’s 3rd act, world-ending monsters. They haven’t cracked the code yet, aside from Thanos, whose physical and character personification of evil raised the 2-part Avengers “snap” movies above the rest. Bad SuperpowersI kinda knew we were in trouble when I read, before seeing the film, someone tweeting out, “If all Kumail Nanjiani was going to do is throw fireballs, why did he have to get so buff?,” we were in trouble. That and the ad where Sersi turns a bus into flowers. WTF? Invincible on Amazon Prime did a better job addressing the superhero team where no one has enough power to win any fight on their own, but then Superman shows up. I have the advantage of watching watched One Punch Man with my kid, so I understand how cool the idea for Gilgamesh’s power can be… but it takes time and space to get the Zen of it. Thena gets a sword and shield. Wow. Never seen that before. Phastos is really, really smart. Sprite combines lemon and lime… oh… wait… she can change her appearance, isn’t blue, can project images beyond herself, and really, really wants to menstruate. Makkari, a character who used to be a guy, is a young deaf woman (for no apparent reason) who can run really fast. Druig has the creepiest power… the kind of power usually used by villains… he can turn humans into mindless zombies. (Insert Marvel joke here.) And Ajak… she has the red phone to Arishem and the power to talk slowly and calmly and still be the hottest 55-year-old imaginable.  I don’t mention Ikaris because he is the “Superman” character and the only interesting thing about him - which is a shame, as Madden can act - is that they use The S Word in a Marvel movie. I don’t want to do a spoiler, but the film pretty much reduces the alleged most powerful being on earth to a mediocrity whose skill set becomes less and less clear and whose moral standing is somewhere in the realm of a  Trump-supporting Senator. Meh. Characters Who Are Too Self-Serious & No One To Bring Them Down One of the key components to Avengers is the balance of Tony Stark and Steve Rogers. (If you need me to tell you which heroes they are, why are you even reading this?) Tony is the from-the-hip asshole and Steve is the self-serious windbag (but soooo handsome!). Thor balances Loki.  Natasha balances some of the other guys, depending on when you dip into which movie. Dr. Banner balances his two halves.  Eternals is a movie in which everyone wants to be quiet and serious… except for Kumail Nanjiani’s Kingo and Brian Tyree Henry’s dryly humorous Phastos (who turns out to be the most emotionally weighed down and maudlin). Kingo is so flip and half-committed, you can almost imagine him becoming the bad guy. Comedy Characters Who Wander In & Out Without Clear PurposeThis is another Kingo riff. I have only seen the movie once, so maybe I missed something. Dear God, I hope and pray I missed something. But Kingo dips out of the movie, with his sidekick, for no clear reason. And as an audience member, all I wanted to see was this jolly joker and manipulator of humans be an important part of the big fight… and to get a higher stake in being in the story. But like the bad ex who never shows up for his kid’s birthday parties on time, he just skips out. And then… it doesn’t matter. At all. Why? Kill the character you like the mostI shouldn’t tell you who dies. I won’t. It doesn’t matter. All I can say is… never do this. Someone must have been watching The Untouchables and felt all those feelings that Mamet wrote into the screenplay and Sean Connery and his history with all movie lovers brought to life and thought, “Hey… that works!” But I have to tell you… you are no David Mamet (nutty right-winger that he has become aside) and Chloe ain’t no Brian DePalma at the top of his game (she is something else and I suspect we aren’t yet close to the top of her game) and this was a terrible, terrible choice.  Oh, you saw Star Wars and Obi-Wan Kenobi dies and comes back more powerful as a spirit? Yeah… no… you didn’t get within a country mile of that either. You could have. You could have given all of these characters enough backstory to make it actually interesting. But a movie - even a 4-hour long one like this - can’t include 10 proper backstories.  Make Your Lead Character A BoreHere’s the thing. Mary Richards was the least interesting character in The Mary Tyler Moore Show. This has become a standard dramatic tool. Central character is the straight person and they are surrounded by funny or dramatic eccentrics. However… Mary was also funny. Mary had clear motivations. Mary had desires and passions. Mary had people who irritated her. And when Chuckles The Clown died, Mary was so uptight that she couldn’t stop laughing hysterically at the funeral.  I am a Gemma Chan fan. I look forward to her character when I see a film she is in. But her Sersi is about as bland and uninteresting a human being as I have ever seen in a Marvel movie.  She has all the nuance of a piece of white toast with half a pat of margarine.  She’s thousands of years old… and she is still the most boring being on earth! Her power is weird and never surprising in a good way. She is never really thrilled or horrified.  And let me repeat… Sersi is boring. Salma gets to be the Fern/Fran of the piece (see: Nomadland)… though she doesn’t get to be that funny (aka show her range) either. Sersi needed something to do… something to make her more than just a cog who happens to be at the center of the wheel.  Is there any purpose for this love triangle? I guess it was a way to lock down Kit Harrington before Netflix tried to make him some obscure comic book action figure from that independent brand they bought and failed with once already. Aside from that, who cares? You get the feeling Sersi dated Ikaris for thousands of years and never lost her virginity to him for fear of turning his penis into overcooked spaghetti. (You know when you are really hot for someone, your brain decides that their genitals are going to taste like dessert? The problem with Sersi is that she could make that happen. And while it might be amusing for an evening, no one wants to have to find new clothes to fit that modification.) And don’t even get me started on Jungle Cruise, where the level-headed scientist woman decides to give up the cure for cancer so she can bang The Rock. Who is writing these movies?!?! Fail to define major character motives each step of the wayThis was uniquely infuriating throughout Eternals. Even the characters, like Kingo,  who had enough something to kind of feel their motives ended up wandering after a while.  The clearest character in the movie is Brian Tyree Henry’s Phastos, who has a husband and child and had chosen to lead as human a life as he can. But the motive for clarifying him is, I think, that he is the first practicing/living-life-out gay character in a Marvel movie. So his motives were repeated over and over, I think trying to make the argument - that should not be needed - that gay people are regular folks with normal relationships and families and love, just like you straighties.  Sprite ends up playing like a combo of Pinocchio and someone trying to come out, while Makkari is just trying to figure out what the hell everyone is talking about so she can take aim and kick ass.  The Same Old Twist I’d feel bad about this as a spoiler if it wasn’t so murky in the movie. But once again - and this is not just a Marvel thing - the “humans are just animals inhabiting Farm Earth and the universe would be better off without them” schtick is played out. The “new” spin on it here is “if we kill this group of meaningless animals now, better ones will blossom.” I can virtually see the moment in the office when, at 3:30a, after too much Din Tai Fung delivery food and wine, someone screamed, ”Eureka!” But it’s lipstick on what has become a pig of an idea.  All that said… worst Marvel movie ever. Most aspirational. Almost no aspirations met. Failure of trying to do too much. 7 of all trades. Jack, Queen, King, or Ace of nothing… except beautiful landscapes.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 28, 2021"," Eternals es quizá la película de Marvel más extraña y arriesgada - tanto en su propuesta como por su directora la ganadora de un Oscar Chloé Zaho- y manera de contar la historia. En sus más de dos horas y media quizás incluye demasiada información y al final resulta un tanto confusa. Y me da un poco de pena porque Los Etermos es quizá el proyecto más personal del dibujante Jack Kirby, el mejor dibujante de la historia de los cómic de superhéroes. Él fue quien creó a los Eternos en torno al año 76 cuando vuelve de DC a Marvel y consigue absoluta libertad creativa. En esta saga que él creo para los cómic mezcla la mitología y la dividindad usando como modelo a Erich von Däniken, el escritor responsable de Recuerdos del Futuro, en la que que relacionaba la divididad con un origen alienígena, y mexclaba cosas que le apasionaban a Kirby como la mitología cósmica, y con los eternos buscaba crear unos nuevos dioses entre lo mesoamericano y lo grecorromano que establecieran una nueva mitología dentro de Marvel Cómics.  Cuenta una divinidad galáctica, los celestiales llegan a la Tierra y en los albores de la humanidad toman a los primates y crean les dotan de inteligencia creando tres tipos de seres: los humanos, los Eternos -que están ahí para defender a los humanos- y los desviantes que son los malos de la historia, unas bestias terribles.  Dirige Cloe Zaho ganadora de dos Oscar por Nomadland. Esta es su cuarta película. Su primera película, de 2015 fue Songs my brothers taugth me , en 2017 hizo The Rider. Y aborda el realismo mágico de forma muy poética porque suele trabajar con lo más mundano del ser humano en situaciones difíciles y tiene una caligrafía estética que busca una puesta en escena muy lírica. Eternals, de hecho está repleta de puestas de sol. La elección de una cineasta como esta es muy arriesgada, pero todo el proyecto en sí es muy arriesgado porque toma a los Eternos y traza la historia completa de la humanidad desde el punto de vista de los Eternos.  La película es un paseo por todo el globo terráqueo pero recorre la humanidad desde el año 5.000 antes de Cristo, en Mesopotamia, hasta el Londres contemporáneo. Y hay mucho que contar, y ese es precisamente el principal choque: que está comprimida la mitología y la historia de la humanidad, para que puedas comprender las motivaciones de cada uno de los personajes, que son tantos, a los que pasan tantas cosas, que no da tiempo a asumirlo. Y todo ello sin renunciar a la espectacularidad de Marvel, y margen para el drama también.   La pelicula me funciona muy bien en los momentos de acción, pero no tan bien cuando se dedica a desentrañar todo el universo de los Etermos. Está claro que cuando eligen a una directora como Chloe Zaho buscan una espectacularidad, y ella indaga en ese realismo mágico, y a las conversaciones y diálogos para conocer a los personajes, sin renunciar a la fantasía propia de Marvel.  El elenco de la película es espectacular y repleto de estrellas: Gemma Chan da vida a Sersi, Richard Madden, que encarna a Ikaris, ambos vivirán una historia de amor. Angelina Jolie, que da vida a Thena; Salma Hayek, que interpreta a Ajak; Kumail Nanjiani, en la piel de Kingo; Lia McHugh, que interpreta a Sprite; Brian Tyree Henry, en el personaje de Phastos; Lauren Ridloff, que es Makkarof;  Barry Keoghan, como Druig y Dong-seok Ma, como Gilgamesh.  La película funciona a dos niveles, la cósmica y fantástica, la de los celestiales, y la humana, la dramática, pero la mezcla de los dos no acaba de cuajar de todo. Es digno de aplauso, lo ambiciosa que es, pero satura porque no acabas de conectar con ella. Y eso me lleva a la expresión, como en el título de magnífica película de Alexei Guerman Qué dificil es ser un dios. Porque les vemos sufrir y enfrentarse a un doble rasero: por un lado dar sentido a su propia existencia, y por etro sufren para salvar la Tierra. Y sin embargo, me deja frío por su exceso de solemnidad y seriedad.",NEUTRAL
"Oct 28, 2021"," Eternals is likely to become one of the most divisive Marvel movies in some time. But perhaps not for the obvious reasons. It’s hard to imagine lots of Eternals comics fans out who are so diehard that they will scream about “forced diversity” in the casting. However, it’s all too easy to imagine someone getting riled up over a fictional cosmology that appears to deny the existence of God as envisioned by most major Earth religions. But even that isn’t likely to cause the most contention. The challenge with Eternals is that it’s very much a Chloe Zhao (Nomadland) movie. Yet probably not enough of one for Chloe Zhao diehards. It’s best compared to a really lengthy character-based episode of The Walking Dead. Those are the ones with only an obligatory fight or two with bloodthirsty monsters. Unless audiences are fully invested in these characters, the film might be considered boring. In Marvel’s comic book universe, the Eternals are a Jack Kirby creation. Regardless, the movie takes more of its inspiration from Neil Gaiman’s 2006 reboot. As such, it’s full of his hallmarks, including long discussions between near-immortal beings about what fools/treasures these mortals be. For viewers with an interest in theology and the repackaging of same as superhero subtext for the masses — this is compelling stuff. But for those who expect the tightly wound Marvel machine that never stops entertaining for even a second, this isn’t that. It’s very slow. And yet possibly not slow enough for Zhao’s existing fans. But it takes its time and stays focused on relationships rather than super-battles. Not to mention the different ways people react to religious dogma. There’s a reason Gaiman has had more adaptation success on cable and streaming. In this case, the dogma comes from Arishem, a kaiju-sized space-giant of the race of Celestials. In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, an opening text crawl informs us, he created the world, and more. We’ve previously seen Celestials in the Guardians of the Galaxy movies: Ego was one, the Collector’s home base of Knowhere was the severed head of another. There was also Celestial who appeared in a flashback that showed the Infinity Stones’ power. Arishem, though, appears to be on a whole extra God-level, fostering the creation of further Celestials. Eternals are nigh-immortal beings sent by Arishem to protect planetary populations from his previous mistake, the Deviants. Looking like 3D printed flayed anatomy crafted from iridescent Japanese Beetle shell fibers, these apex predators evolved beyond their prior parameters to become a danger to all life. But they are all long-since dead, and the Eternals now wait to be called home. Or so they think. For much of its first half, Eternals plays like It: Chapter Two. A fraternity of friends who long ago defeated an ancient evil must reunite to face its resurgence. All while having significant flashbacks to their early days on Earth. And not everyone wants to come back. Some question their original purpose, others would rather die, a couple finally hook up, and only a few really get it right away. All must deal with how the lives they have made on this planet over the centuries might see drastic changes with a return to large-scale heroics. Connections to the rest of the MCU are minor. But the characters also mention Superman and Batman. It appears DC comics do indeed exist in the MCU. Considering that Eternals must introduce at least ten new characters with extremely comic-booky names to a fresh audience, it does a good job. Sersi (Gemma Chan) is everywoman as immortal, enjoying her life with very periodic, subtle power usages. Ikaris (Richard Madden), her brooding ex, is more concerned with grander cosmic plans. Sprite (Lia McHugh) feels unfairly forced into both the sidekick role and an eleven year-old body. Gilgamesh (Don Lee) like to cook and punch things. There’s more, but the basics come across pretty quickly. Kingo, of course, adds the comedy, since he’s played by Kumail Nanjiani. Often cast as the annoying nit-picky nerd, Nanjiani plays the Tony Stark role. Living the life of a movie star, he adds dry, real-world observations to outlandish situations. He’s way more JARVIS than Jar Jar. When characters’ assumptions get tossed aside, it’s easy to imagine there’s a comparison to Zhao’s own disillusionment with Chinese communist dogma once she moved to Europe and learned alternative facts. That Arishem appears a red, monolithic, unemotional world-sized being surely is no coincidence. But there’s also a level of religious critique, analyzing the way that scriptural rules that were once simply meant as desert survival instructions can turn into toxic fundamentalism once overpopulation becomes a thing. The individual ways each Eternal takes in these changes reflect differences in human philosophies too. All of which becomes more important to this movie than slaying purple monsters. The far more humanoid Deviants from the comics could figure into possible sequels, but they haven’t evolved to that level yet onscreen. Speaking of sequels, the credits teases are not as important as some might claim, and one features some retrograde CG so atrocious that Marvel Studios should be ashamed. Slow isn’t the same thing as dense, and nothing in Eternals should be incomprehensible to anyone paying attention. But for those not in the mood to just hang out with all-powerful beings, rather than following them into wisecrack-filled combat constantly, Eternals may tax the patience.

"Oct 28, 2021"," The season of somber action epics marches on, with Marvel’s Eternals (★★★☆☆) joining the ranks of recent brooding blockbusters like Black Widow and No Time to Die. Sagas of weary warriors reckoning with their losses would seem tailor-made to suit the zeitgeist of our weary world. So Eternals, originally set for release in November 2020, fits right in, introducing an entire team of heroes all contemplating their purpose in a world still weathering the trauma and upheaval of a global catastrophe. That disaster, spoken of in hushed tones throughout the MCU, is known as the Blip — half of all life in the universe, wiped out in a snap. Ultimately, the Blip was reversed, and billions of lost lives restored. But now meeting a humanoid race of super-powerful, near-immortal god-like beings called the Eternals begs the question, where were they and what were they doing when the mad Titan Thanos snapped the universe in half? As we learn early in this origin story, directed and co-written by Nomadland Oscar-winner Chloé Zhao, the ten Eternals dwelling on earth at the time were largely estranged, some adrift, with their own reasons for not joining the Avengers’ Infinity War. But first, Zhao and co-writers Patrick Burleigh, and Ryan and Kaz Firpo establish each Eternal’s individual identity and abilities with a swiftly paced sequence of adventures through history, kicking off in Mesopotamia, 5000 B.C. Led by their powerful psychic-spiritual center, Ajak (Salma Hayek), the group protects humanity from Deviants, ravenous beasts from deep space, who also attack in ancient Babylon and 16th-century Tenochtitlan. At every battleground, the marauding Deviants are confronted valiantly by Ajak, matter manipulator Sersi (Gemma Chan), cosmic superman Ikaris (Richard Madden), fierce warrior Thena (Angelina Jolie), super-speedster Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), energy blaster Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), strongman Gilgamesh (Don Lee), mind manipulator Druig (Barry Keoghan), gadgets conjuror Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), and master illusionist Sprite (Lia McHugh). That’s a host of personalities to pinpoint in somewhat limited time, and the film manages admirably, abetted by a solid cast who capture the camaraderie that bonds this group even when they’re separated by continents or centuries. It’s the weariness of all that time spent fighting for humanity, while hiding from humanity, that weighs heavily on the hearts of some Eternals. For others, it’s the lifetime of losses, or just a lost sense of purpose — not unlike the immortal warriors in the explosive 2020 action epic The Old Guard. The Eternals are wistful heroes, with the notable exception of Nanjiani’s impish showboat Kingo, practically the film’s only comic relief, along with Kingo’s loyal human sidekick Karun (Harish Patel). And Phastos, the MCU’s first gay superhero, ekes out a space of happiness in his undercover life with husband Ben (Haaz Sleiman) and son Jack (Esai Daniel Cross). As with that depiction of a gay superhero, Eternals follows its characters into grown-up emotional territory. Sersi, who embarks on a succession story demanding that she assume the mantle of leadership, also works through a millennia-spanning love story with Ikaris that provides the MCU’s first bonafide sex scene. The couple’s romantic drama, played with compelling chemistry by Chan and Madden, resonates more strongly than a lot of the effects-laden superhero action. For that, the movie too often turns to the horde of nameless, interchangeable Deviants, coldly computer-generated creatures not destined for the pantheon of great and memorable movie villains. Zhao and cinematographer Ben Davis (Captain Marvel) appear more inspired visually by the awesome flying and fighting abilities of Ikaris, depicting him surrounded by a Man of Steel-style aura of majestic light. Still, he represents a symbol of masculine might that feels familiar, conventional, compared to the women who lead the team, or the gay dads who happen to be the only ones among the crew raising a child in this precarious, post-Blip world. Telling an enlightened story of perseverance and sacrifice over centuries, Eternals doesn’t necessarily thrill with monumental set-pieces or clever derring-do. (For sheer comic book excitement, best to stick around for the mid-credits and post-credits scenes, which tease more Marvel superheroes soon to join the fray.) Instead, appreciate the film for its thoughtful foray into battling celestial foes, and expanding this sprawling fictional universe with genuine feeling and an engaging sense of wonder about time and creation. José Rolón, who has 150,000 followers on Instagram and over 500,000 followers on TikTok under the user name @nycgaydad, found himself bombarded with threats from right-wing users after conservative commentator Stew Peters tagged him in an Instagram video.  In the video, Peters called Rolón a ""creep"" and a ""pervert homo,"" and called for his public execution. He also accused Rolón of ""criminal sexual conduct,"" tagging the New York Police Department and urging them to investigate the gay widower. ""Some pervert homo has access to at least four kids around the clock all the time,"" Peters said, misstating the number of Rolón's children. ""He can take them to drag conventions and then post the evidence, post pictures and videos of criminal sexual conduct … and somehow not end up in jail, or better yet, the gallows."" Police mounted a search for 33-year-old Marcus Johnson in connection with the murder of 25-year-old Carlos Collins, a registered nurse who hailed from Yazoo City. According to WAPT, members of Collins family said police told them that Collins succumbed to gunshot wounds sustained during the attack, and that an axe was used during the murder. Varadkar resigned as leader of the Fine Gael political party and will resign as prime minister -- or taoiseach -- once a successor is named.  Standing on the steps of the Government Buildings in Dublin, the 45-year-old said he was stepping down for ""personal and political"" reasons, ""but mainly political,"" reported The Guardian. ""I believe this government can be re-elected,"" Varadkar said. ""I believe a new taoiseach will be better placed than me to achieve that -- to renew and strengthen the top team, to refocus our message and policies, and to drive implementation. After seven years in office, I am no longer the best person for that job."" These are challenging times for news organizations.

"Oct 28, 2021"," Nomandland writer-director and Academy Award-winner Chloé Zhao is celebrated as a humanist, naturalistic storyteller. A filmmaker who sinks into the very pores of the characters and communities she crafts her movies around. Telling stories from a deep understanding of what make these people tick and the idiosyncratic customs of their way of life, Zhao champions the use of non-actors and the backdrop of mother nature to achieve a lived-in, grounded aesthetic. With Zhao’s films, you often feel as if you’ve stepped into another universe, one that’s been squirreled away on some part of our planet we just didn’t know existed. Eternals, the twenty-sixth or so entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (it gets confusing when you factor in the various limited series they now have going on over on Disney+), attempts to harness exactly these storytelling skills, unveiling immortal beings called “Eternals” who live amongst humankind but have remained in the shadows for centuries. Zhao is set to be our guide, allowing us to peek at this squirreled away society existing all along on our world. Sadly, her attempt to do so misfires massively, delivering a clunky, flat superhero team-up movie which debates philosophical principals of the greater good with all the nuance of a stoned college freshman. Eternals is not the worst MCU movie to date – Zhao’s raw talent and the film’s admittedly unique aspirations prevent that – but it’s probably the most dull. More surprising than this, despite her naturalistic style, the composition of Zhao’s shots are stodgy; stiffly devised to cram the dozen or so Eternals into the same frame on a remarkable amount of occasions. The impressive cinematography and naturalistic lighting is worth celebrating but the actual blocking of scenes prove uninspired and lifeless. Any distinction between a natural background and a CG-created one falls away when it’s used only as a backdrop for weak action and somber superhero posturing. Designed as if to be more easily cut into a trailer, scenes feels awkward and stagey in a way that Zhao’s films never do. Self-serious but in a portentous way. Eternals is meant to be Shakespearean in tone but is too often blocked like Shakespeare in the Park. Ambitious but flawed, the screenplay from Chloé Zhao, Patrick Burleigh (Peter Rabbit 2: The Runaway), and first-time feature writers (and brothers) Ryan Firpo and Kaz Firpo smushes the entirety of human history into a girthy two hours and thirty-seven minute runtime, diluting the course of Homo sapiens down to a series of sword and sandal skirmishes and slowly developing technologies. The gist of it involves a lot of mumbo-jumbo about Celestials, God-like universe builders, who accidentally unleashed sinewy demon-beasts known as Deviants upon their creation in order to do some basic population control. They miscalculate. Whoops. To fix this, the Celestials, led by the planet-sized Arishem, then create Eternals, obedient cosmic soldiers each with their own golden CGI pew-pew power, sent to fend off the pesky Deviants. On Earth, the Eternals have watched humans throughout the centuries, nudging them along in their evolution every so often like by inventing the plow (and maybe the atomic bomb?) In order to shrug off why these overpowered beings didn’t intervene when Thanos came to town and snapped away half the population, we learn that the Eternals have been instructed by Arishem not to intervene in the matters of humans unless it specifically involves Deviants. Whereas previous “origins” films are typically meant to introduce the individual contributors before slamming them together to team up and save the world, Eternals has the Herculean task of introducing a whole stable of new characters. None of the dozen or so characters are given much breathing room and, unsurprisingly, none make much of an impression. At the center of this story, there’s Sersi (Gemma Chan), the soft-spoken moralist who is chosen to lead the Eternals when former “boss” Ajak (Salma Hayek) is found killed on her South Dakota ranch; and Ikaris (Richard Madden), the most powerful of the Eternals – he’s the Marvel equivalent of Superman – and the Eternals’ de-facto leader. His 5000-year relationship with Sersi ended before they are forced to band together and save the world. Awkward. Also in the mix is Thena (Angelina Jolie), a goddess of war who suffers a form of dementia that leads her to blindingly attack her allies; Sprite (Lia McHugh) an immortal stuck in a child’s body who is able to project illusions; Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), basically The Flash but deaf;  Druig (Barry Keoghan), a master telepath who really wants to stop war; Gilgamesh (Ma Dong-seok), a caring brute with super strength; Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), group comic relief whose superpower is literally finger guns; and Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), the quartermaster of the gang, always inventing new tech. The collection of talent is impressive on paper but they lack chemistry, any dimensionality to their relationships are papered over with a need to churn out exposition. There’s a general stiffness to the character’s interaction with one another, which is only exacerbated by  cringe dialogue and the occasional algorithmically-calculated quip thrown in to assure audiences that Eternals is indeed a Marvel property. None of it fits together properly and the result is oddly earnest, unfunny, and eternally stiff. The MVP here is Harish Patel as Kingo’s enthusiastic valet Karun, ironically the only dude who doesn’t have any superpowers. Since Eternals not only needs to introduce all these new characters but an entirely new corner of cosmic mythology to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, there’s a ledger of meaty exposition to get through, making for one of Marvel’s most convoluted and long-winded offerings to date. When the pending “emergence” of a new Celestial threatens the balance of life on Earth, the Eternals are forced to take sides, triggering a moral quandary about interventionism and the greater good that lacks true depth. The philosophy of the film – a cosmic scale debate on the merits and perils of interventionism – is about as deep as an introductory-level discussion on The Trolley Problem, that infamous ethical dilemma about sacrifice and agency. There isn’t anything here that’s particularly thoughtful or worth dwelling on, regardless of how hard Chan or Madden stare off into an (admittedly beautiful) sunrise. Scrambling from country to country, century to century, Eternals suggests a grand road trip through time that touches upon the many histories of our world but it all plays as rather inert. Making pit stops in 5000 BC Mesopotamia or 1945 Hiroshima works better in theory than in practice and results in choppy editing and a sluggish pace. The special effects are overindulgently used and flat, making for set pieces that fail to move the needle in terms of our engagement. Superheroes shooting gold beams out of their eyes and fingers just isn’t very visually interesting. Especially if you don’t really care about their fates.

"Oct 28, 2021"," If making “Eternals” was the best option Marvel had left, it is scraping the barrel. The original comic book source material was muddled, a collection of flat characters without any driving motive for their actions, and the movie is, if anything, worse. Like “Black Widow,” it’s an attempt to expand the superhero form to include serious emotion, but the only thing that ends up getting expanded here is the running time. Oscar-winning filmmaker Chloé Zhao (“Nomadland”) co-wrote and directed the film, and in scene after scene you can see her trying to give soul to these soulless characters, to invest paper-thin superhero bots with something that might pass for depth. It doesn’t work, and it doesn’t fool anybody. A friendly word to future directors who take on the superhero genre: If you’re going to sell out your artistic integrity, just sell it and hope to buy it back with your next movie. Don’t pretend. It’s just painful. Every faux-sensitive, melancholy conversation in “Eternals” plays like a Blu-ray extra, like a scene deleted from the original release. However, Zhao does good by diversifying the casting and the characters — there’s a gay Eternal (Brian Tyree Henry); a deaf Eternal (played by deaf actress Lauren Ridloff); and three Asian Eternals played by Kumail Nanjiani, Don Lee and Gemma Chan. And the inclusion is welcome, which makes “Eternals” a virtuous production. But that’s not the same as a good movie. The source of the problem is never addressed. We’re told the Eternals are a handful of eternal aliens living among us mortals. Their job is to protect humankind from monsters called the Deviants, who have been extinct for 500 years. But wait, no, the Deviants are back! And they’re stronger than ever, so now the Eternals have to kill more Deviants. Fine. That gives the Eternals something to do. The problem here is that Earth still isn’t their planet, so there isn’t much at stake for them. If the Deviants win, the Eternals can just pack up and go back to Olympia. But it gets worse. About a quarter of the way in, “Eternals” switches gears, when Sersi (Chan) is told the real reason that the Eternals are on Earth. You might reasonably expect that the real reason would provide the drive to action that the movie needs. But no. Not at all. Now they have even less motive to do anything. That’s screenwriting malpractice to fail, not once but twice, to give the Eternals a reason to fight. As it stands, much of “Eternals” involves Sersi visiting her various colleagues, trying to talk them into joining the struggle. Some do, some don’t. Some have to be talked into it. Some really don’t care either way. “Eternals” is like a movie about a horse race that concentrates all its attention on characters that neither own a horse nor like to gamble. It takes a special kind of movie anti-magic to make an entire audience indifferent to the potential destruction of the planet and the elimination of all life on Earth. “Eternals” manages it. Thus, the pleasures in “Eternals” must be incidental. For example, Angelina Jolie plays the ridiculous, hilarious character of Thena, who has periodic fits in which she blacks out and tries to kill her fellow Eternals. The movie treats this as a serious mental disorder, but it plays more like comic relief. (In this film, any relief is welcome.) There are also hints of comedy of a more intentional nature, with Nanjiani playing Kingo, an Eternal who becomes a vain Bollywood star. And then there’s Chan, who brings such internalized emotion that she almost puts over the somber personal moments. It’s not that we ever believe the movie, but we do believe her. As for Zhao, she won her first Academy Award this year for “Nomadland,” and now, with “Eternals,” she has a retirement plan. She can go back to being an artist. K“Eternals”: Superhero action.

"Oct 28, 2021"," However you may feel about the place superhero blockbusters have occupied in the cultural landscape for the past dozen-plus years, there is something ineluctably sad about the way directing one has become the primary marker of success for a gifted emerging filmmaker. Distinguish yourself in your field, as Chloé Zhao did when she won the Best Director and Best Picture Oscars last year for her contemplative indie road movie Nomadland, and you are ceremoniously handed the keys to the Marvel car—a gigantic CGI-enhanced vehicle that can navigate black holes and shoot rays of plasma out of its headlights, but that always moves in the same direction to arrive at the same predetermined spot. That’s not to say that Zhao’s Eternals doesn’t feel different from the average Marvel offering. This is a movie with a prominently featured gay male relationship, a (PG-13–rated) sex scene between two other major characters, the first deaf superhero in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (Lauren Ridloff’s Makkari), and the most diverse cast of superbeings the franchise has yet offered. Eternals is as sociologically inclusive and as pictorially beautiful as any movie in the franchise, with scene after scene bathed in the warm light of Zhao’s favorite time of day, the pre-dusk “golden hour.” But it’s also one of the weakest Marvel movies I’ve seen, meandering and wan. It takes place over a vast timespan in locations all over the globe (and the galaxy), yet it has the curiously claustrophobic feel of a Saturday afternoon serial filmed entirely in a windowless studio. The Eternals, a gang of immortal quasi-divinities created thousands of years ago by even more powerful space beings called the Celestials, have spent the last few millennia scattered around Earth living undercover as regular mortal beings. As the group’s tech wizard Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry)—a sort of divine IT department—points out, that requires changing residences periodically so your neighbors never notice how you don’t seem to age. Flashbacks threaded throughout the film’s first half show us that members of the Eternals have been present at many of the great atrocities of human history: the siege of the ancient city-state of Tenochtitlan by colonizing Spanish forces, the dropping of the nuclear bomb on Hiroshima. But according to an ancient law not unlike the “prime directive” of the Star Trek universe, the Eternals are forbidden to interfere in human affairs. They may save individual lives in a pinch, but they cannot use their superpowers to prevent the global problems that arise from the poor moral choices made by humans. This places the Eternals in an existential, even religious dilemma: What purpose were they created for, if not to engage their Celestial-given skills to help the planet they have come to love? Is it possible that it’s time to stand up to Arishem (voiced by David Kaye), the Celestial space giant—a literal sky daddy—who has dictated their every move for millennia? When Earth is once again menaced by a race of monsters known as the Deviants—packs of vaguely lupine CGI beasts made of what appear to be bundled gray extension cords—the Eternals must reunite. Their leader, Ajak (Salma Hayek), who has been spending her semi-retirement on a picturesque South Dakota ranch, emerges, resplendent in a cowboy hat and shearling vest, to gather the crew from their various hideouts around the globe. One of the most well-adjusted Eternals, and the closest thing this sprawling multicharacter story has to a protagonist, is Sersi (Gemma Chan). Working by day as a teacher at the Natural History Museum in London, she limits her superheroic efforts to her off hours. Sersi’s power is to be able to transform any material into any other material, a skill that comes in handy when a child is about to be crushed by a large falling object, as happens twice in the early scenes of Eternals. Sersi also has a mortal boyfriend, Dane (Kit Harington), who is unaware of her cosmic back story. But a part of her is still enmeshed with fellow Eternal Ikaris (Richard Madden), with whom she was romantically involved for centuries (been there, sister) and who has now reappeared to help fight the Deviants with his extremely silly-looking but apparently undefeated ability to shoot laser beams from his eyes while hovering broodingly in midair. There are more Eternals, so many more. Gilgamesh (Don Lee) is a super-strong sweetheart whose main role is to watch over the volatile Thena (Angelina Jolie). She, in turn, is a white-catsuited glamourpuss with country-music hair whose power involves conjuring an indestructible golden sword out of thin air. Thena is suffering from a kind of immortality-induced mental illness that causes her to periodically lash out at her fellow Eternals as if they were enemies; when this happens, her eyes turn into opalescent marbles, a good look for her. Sprite (Lia McHugh) is the only underage Eternal, a permanent adolescent who pines after the hunky Ikaris and longs, Pinocchio-style, to be turned into a real girl. Druig (Barry Keoghan) is a rebellious type who uses his psychic powers to create an isolated Amazon jungle settlement of peaceful, if brainwashed, human followers. And Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani) is the comic-relief superhero. His hands can generate lethal fireballs at will, but he is more interested in remaining one of Bollywood’s top male stars. In one of the movie’s best jokes, Kingo shows another character a wall of movie posters demonstrating his presence in the Indian film industry over three generations, passing himself off first as his own grandfather and then as his father. After walking out on a (delightful) Bollywood dance sequence to join his mighty ex-co-workers, Kingo brings along his valet (the endearing Harish Patel) to shoot a puff-piece documentary about the Eternals. This setup makes for some welcome humor amid the solemn pageantry to come, though it seems strange that none of the superheroes would object to the idea of being publicly outed after millennia spent living incognito. The film, scripted by Zhao, Patrick Burleigh, and Ryan and Kaz Firpo, weaves plenty of jokes in with long stretches of intergalactic hocus pocus and equally long action set pieces. But the parts only sporadically cohere into anything like a whole. Zhao, a director whose previous three films have all centered on the everyday lives of working-class rural outsiders, seems ill-suited to a movie of this scale and frankly uninterested in the fight scenes. Perhaps this movie’s sluggish pace, what I can only describe as a lack of narrative muscle tone, can be attributed to the lack of a single identifiable villain. Instead of the Avengers saga’s mauve meanie Thanos, whose staunch belief in the rightness of his must-destroy-half-the-universe mission made him an actual character with a comprehensible if horrifying motivation, all we get here are sad ropy CGI dogs with no apparent goals beyond the desire to destroy the Eternals. A scene where Phastos, standing in the ruins of Hiroshima, berates himself for allowing his technological advances to make way for the Atomic Age feels in questionable taste when the movie’s ultimate conflict takes place not in the crucible of the human soul but in a landscape overrun by animated superbeasts. Eternals’ cinematography incorporates a little more natural light and open landscape than your average Marvel joint, but the demands of a $200 million corporate enterprise ultimately prevail over any aspirations to auteurship. That’s OK—a filmmaker of Zhao’s gifts has earned the right to try her hand at what, like it or not, is one of the dominant genres of the 21st century. She has also earned the right to make a bad movie, shrug it off and move on. Whatever world she decides to build next, I hope its heroes are significantly less super.",NEGATIVE

"Oct 28, 2021"," Courtesy Marvel StudiosWith over twenty films currently making up the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Marvel finds itself at a pivotal moment in its development as a franchise. The studio has access to a rich back catalogue of exciting heroes and stories and an audience that is willing to follow them anywhere. ETERNALS emerges as an ambassador for the next generation of Marvel, boldly endeavoring to move the fan base beyond its comfort zone and pull us into new adventures. It’s an experiment that is sure to pay off, as ETERNALS offers a totally unique Marvel experience saturated in emotion and delivered on a grand, stunning scale. ETERNALS brings forth the combined powers of a dynamic dream ensemble with performances from Gemma Chan, Richard Madden, Kumail Nanjiani, Lia McHugh, Brian Tyree Henry, Lauren Ridloff, Barry Keoghan, and Don Lee, with Kit Harington, Salma Hayek, and Angelina Jolie. The star-studded 25th entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is helmed by Academy Award winner Chloé Zhao (Nomadland), who brings every ounce of her talent to the rich screenplay. In ETERNALS, at the birth of humanity, mankind is besieged by monstrous creatures called Deviants. The Eternals are a band of heroic immortals from the stars that are charged with the task of protecting humanity. The Eternals do battle with the Deviants, guide mankind in their development, and serve as righteous observers to human history. The Eternals passively witness millennia of humanity’s conflicts and triumphs, never interfering but always on guard. One day, when the Deviants return, the Eternals must reunite in order to defend Earth and humanity once again. As mentioned at the outset, ETERNALS is poised at the threshold of unfamiliar terrain in the MCU. Up to this point, all of the other Marvel films have been gearing up for the events of Avengers: Endgame. Even the films that followed the franchise climax had a terrible habit of looking over their shoulders and calling back to the “glory days” of the Endgame storyline. ETERNALS instantly distinguishes itself by operating as something fully separate from the previous MCU films. The characters have a totally unique origin, a unique set of motivations and conflicts, and remain blissfully and intentionally distant from anything that Marvel devotees would consider familiar. This gives the film an instantly refreshing feel, breathing invigorating new life into a formulaic franchise (as effective as that formula may be). Add breathtaking visuals into the mix and ETERNALS solidifies itself as a Marvel film unlike anything we’ve seen before. ETERNALS takes the notion of franchise expansion to its most literal and grand meaning. The film pushes the boundaries of the world of the MCU, revealing beautiful and vast universes and mythos. The vastness of the film isn’t just limited to its setting, but to the greater themes and philosophies of the ETERNALS. Befitting its immortal heroes, the film grapples with larger-than-life philosophies on good, evil, and the grey area in between, the flawed nature of humanity, and definitions of “the greater good” that far exceed anything previous MCU heroes have faced. This distinction alone instantly ups the stakes and adds a weight to the challenges and revelations that the Eternals are facing. Where ETERNALS is most likely to garner some criticism is in terms of its scope and how effectively (or not) it handles that scope. The most obvious place to start is with the ensemble cast. It’s a tall order, with ten unique characters vying for attention. By and large, ETERNALS does phenomenal work in establishing each of these heroes as whole and unique individuals – each with their own differing perspectives, belief systems, and personalities. The strength of each hero only amplifies their work as a team. Regrettably, there are some characters that become casualties of plot necessity or limitations on time. This is not a negative that outweighs the positives, but some fans will be disappointed. ETERNALS definitely has a problem with too many baddies… and too many philosophies. The conflict in ETERNALS splinters off into two factions – one battle is more systemic in nature and the other takes the form of a traditional villain. This is where philosophy comes in. ETERNALS is relentlessly ambitious in its mission to dive into topics that are deeper and much more complex than anything previously seen in the MCU. The Eternals godlike heroes with very human flaws, but that doesn’t make them any less influenced by their in-human role in the universe. Each character has their moment where they choose a path and either break with or bond closer to the elements that separate them from the humans. It’s a decision that makes sense, as the characters have the span of one film to establish centuries of challenges and reflection, but the unfortunate result is splintering. At times, the messaging of ETERNALS feels forced. All of that being said, ETERNALS is the perfect film to usher in the next phase of Marvel. Absolutely saturated in beauty, heart, and epic action – this is the first MCU film, post-Endgame that has given this critic that flutter of anticipation. Earth-shattering and awesome, I can’t wait to see what comes next. I’m all in on ETERNALS!",POSITIVE
"Oct 28, 2021"," As the closing credits of Eternals were scrolling by, I couldn't help but feel like critically acclaimed, Academy Award-winning director Chloe Zhao had very nearly pulled off the impossible by turning a Marvel Cinematic Universe motion picture into, first and foremost, a Chloe Zhao motion picture.  The truth is that despite being overly bloated and downright boring for extended moments of time, Eternals seems to mark the birth of something special in the MCU - a return to thoughtful superheroes and superhero flicks where the people actually matter and the action sequences serve the story rather than the story simply serving as a transition to more action sequences.  Eternals is almost a miraculous film, though I'd dare say Zhao simply couldn't overcome the myriad of obstacles she faced in maintaining her artistic integrity while also keeping the big-wigs at Marvel and Disney happy. Truthfully, Eternals is better than I expected precisely because I thought the Marvel Cinematic Universe would swallow up Zhao and her thoughtful, rhythmic, and often poetic style of filmmaking.  That's unfair, I suppose, because Zhao is a filmmaker and having given us two relatively low-budget critical darlings first, The Rider and the Academy Award-winning Nomadland, we'd never experienced Zhao outside the world of introspective, truly indie filmmaking. While Eternals is not quite upper-tier Marvel, Zhao is doing something special here and this effort here should be the final proof that Zhao is a directorial force to be reckoned with for years to come.  Eternals follows the events that unfolded in Avengers: Endgame. The Eternals are ancient superheroes who've been living on Earth for years living relatively normal lives after their work of centuries ago was completed and they're simply waiting on permission to return home. However, when mankind's most ancient, and thought to be abolished, enemy resurfaces, they're called Deviants, the Eternals are called back into action once again to save a mankind that may not be worth saving.  Eternals benefits from Zhao's presence even if it doesn't quite surrender to it. From opening scenes in 5,000 B.C. Mesopotamia to contemporary scenes introducing us to a London-dwelling Sersi (Gemma Chan) who is now dating the very human Dane (Kit Harington) while fellow Eternal Sprite (Lia McHugh) is her roommate, Eternals is an often mesmerizing motion picture that immerses us in culture and character to degrees seldom seen in the MCU. When the trio is unexpectedly attacked by a Deviant, Sersi's former flame and still Eternal Ikaris (Richard Madden) arrives to join the battle and they realize they must once again reunite the remaining Eternals including longtime leader Ajak (Salma Hayek), the film's comedy centerpoint Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), the heavily burdened goddess of war Thena (Angelina Jolie), the protector (and now movie star) Gilgamesh (Don Lee), the rebellious Druig (Barry Keoghan), now family man Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), and Makkari, who is deaf and played by deaf actress Lauren Ridloff.  Eternals wisely carries with it a rather simple and straightforward story, a blessing in many ways given the already daunting task of meaningfully developing ten full-on superheroes. Surprisingly, Eternals is largely successful with this task even if I'd express my own opinion that certain cast members struggle to balance the acting styles of the MCU and Zhao's more introspectful, thoughtful, and nearly meditative artistry.  The relationship between Sersi and Ikaris is central to the emotional core of Eternals, a genuine romance unlike any that has been seen before in the MCU including the Universe's first crystal clear, though certainly discreet, scene of sexuality. It's a nice touch, though not entirely convincing, and here's hoping that Zhao's willingness to dig more deeply into the MCU pays off in future episodes. Each character, actually, is given moments to shine with Lia McHugh's turn as Sprite particularly poignant as the Tinkerbell-like presence struggles with her physical manifestation despite her undeniable super heroics. Unlike a good majority of Marvel flicks where even collective superheroes can shine individually, it's clear in the Eternals that they are all, essentially, one part of the same superhero body. They are all essential for and with one another and it is their collective presence that makes them all superheroes. This is particularly powerful given the diversity of the Eternals including male, female, older, younger, Asian, Black, White, disabled, and LGBTQ superheroes. While they all present with different gifts, they are all superheroes. 

For the most part, Zhao balances the film's action and humor nicely. It's refreshing that a good majority of the action sequences are daytime sequences devoid of the usual incoherent CGI. Kingo and Sprite carry much of the film's humor, though a certain companion that shows up with Gilgamesh also offers more than a little bit of joy.  I fell in love with Brian Tyree Henry's family man of a superhero, while Lauren Ridloff's badassery is a joy to behold. At over 2 1/2 hours, Eternals is undeniably bloated partly because of Zhao's insistence on maintaining lingering shots of action and the world in which the action occurs but also because it's clear that Zhao wants us to see these superheroes on a deeper level. Eternals wrestles with big questions and refuses easy answers - like the moral dilemmas of collateral damage and the decision to act on behalf of a humanity that often appears to not deserve it. There are spiritual themes galore here and genuine moments of melancholy, regret, resignation, and surprising vulnerability. While Angelina Jolie at times left me feeling ""meh,"" Thena's struggle with traumatic memories and how they're manifesting in her daily life now is genuinely powerful and emotionally honest.  I struggled with Richard Madden and Kit Harington, both actors tasked with giving the film an emotional resonance that never completely clicks. Madden seems more up for the film's MCU moments and dazzles in battles, but his chemistry with Sersi never really invests us in their conflicts like it should.  Lensing by Ben Davis manages to be both intimate and panoramic and wonderfully captures how vital the little moments are in our big lives and in this big universe. Ramin Djawadi's original score feels closer to epic Philip Glass than an actual Marvel scoreand I'd dare say there are hints of Malick bubbling underneath the surface of this first dip into the world of big budgets by Chloe Zhao.  Eternals isn't a perfect film. It's overly bloated, occasionally downright boring, has performances that don't quite always gel, and never quite finds that perfect balance between Zhao meets Marvel. However, amidst all is flaws Eternals has a refreshing heartbeat that lingers long after the closing credits have rolled. Eternals is thrilling and epic and intimate and poignant all in one. It both entertains and dazzles, provokes thought and demands introspection amidst it all.  Eternals isn't a perfect superhero film but, alas, we learn that the Eternals are not perfect superheroes. But, in the end, that is precisely what makes them the superheroes they need to be. ",POSITIVE
"Oct 27, 2021"," Watching Chloé Zhao’s The Rider (2017) made me want to learn horseback riding and got me thinking about humans’ connection to horses. Her Academy Award-winning Nomadland (2020) illustrated the reality a lot of houseless Americans face and offered a window into the American West in the midst of an exceptionally sedentary pandemic. Both films seamlessly intertwine fiction and reality. I knew Eternals was going to be different.  Marvel’s decision to hire the indie director to helm film number 26 in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has both puzzled and intrigued me since the news broke in 2018. Eternals opens exclusively in theaters on November 5 and is expected to hit Disney+ no earlier than 45 days after that. The movie packs a lot of exposition. From an opening crawl that establishes who the Eternals are — a group of immortal heroes sent to Earth from Olympia to protect humans from villainous creatures called Deviants — to several conversations among different characters explaining why the superpowered Eternals don’t get involved in anything other than protecting humans from Deviants, hence why they never intervened in wars or when Thanos eliminated half of humanity. And then there are even more bits that explain the nature of Deviants, Eternals and Celestials — don’t ask me about those last ones because even if I was told who they are on several occasions, it escaped my mind. As with a lot of fantasy, I decided to lean into the suspension of disbelief and not overanalyze the logic — or lack of it — behind anything happening in this story. Also, this movie has a big ensemble cast made of characters with strange-sounding names. I had a hard time identifying all of them and learning what made each one of them special and different at first. Gemma Chan (Crazy Rich Asians) stars as Eternal-turned-museum-scientist Sersi. Don’t be fooled by all those Eternals promotional materials prominently featuring Game of Thrones‘ Richard Madden as Eternal Ikaris. Sersi is the real center of this story; Ikaris is just her ex. They have around 5,000 years of history together, so it’s complicated. Game of Thrones‘ Kit Harington plays Dane Whitman, Sersi’s current beau. When a Deviant attacks Sersi and the Eternal Sprite (Lia McHugh) in London, the two of them reunite with Ikaris and decide to reassemble the rest of the gang. Salma Hayek is the Eternals boss, Ajak, and Angelina Jolie is the goddess of war, Thena (without the initial A). Then there’s Brian Tyree Henry as Phastos, Ma Dong-seok as Gilgamesh, Kumail Nanjiani as Kingo, Lauren Ridloff as Makkari and Barry Keoghan as Druig. I appreciated how each actor playing an Eternal was able to use their own native accent. There were Irish-accented notes in Keoghan’s speech, Scottish ones in Madden’s and Mexican ones in Hayek’s. Ridloff, who is deaf, plays Marvel’s first deaf superhero and uses American Sign Language (ASL) throughout the movie.  Zhao has the difficult task of putting together a story of massive proportions that needs to introduce the viewer to an ensemble cast of new characters and follow Marvel’s established formula — the whole movie is interspersed with action sequences that give way to a final CGI-filled battle of the regular epic proportions. There are also a fair amount of puns, mainly dispensed by Kingo (Nanjiani) and his loyal valet, Karun (Harish Patel). But Eternals isn’t funny the way Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) or Thor: Ragnarok (2017) are funny and most of the jokes didn’t land for me.  Where the idiosyncratic Zhao excels is in the little and not-so-little details. The movie not only boasts the inclusion of the first deaf superhero but also that of the first openly gay one. I’m not talking about one of those imperceptible moments Disney movies have a tendency to include for the sake of headlines and appearing to be of-the-times. Phastos is clearly married to another man, Ben (Haaz Sleiman). They have a kid together. Phastos sees the good in humanity in his son and husband. The married couple shares a kiss on screen that you’ll still be able to enjoy even if you blink. Plus, Phastos and Ben have great chemistry. There’s also a lot of chemistry between Akaris and Sersi and the couple shares what would be the closest to a sex scene we’ve ever seen in a Marvel movie. The whole thing is mostly prudish and not much skin is on display, but still. Progress. Although probably my favorite couple in the movie was the one that didn’t necessarily happen. Zhao, a filmmaker who tends to work with non-professional actors and encourages improvisation, took advantage in this occasion of the real sparks between actors Keoghan and Ridloff and implied on screen that something was going on between their characters Druig and Makkari. I don’t quite understand how — if they had known each other for literally thousands of years — they didn’t find the time to resolve the palpable sexual tension between them before. Still, I just wish there were more of them and fewer big action sequences. But more character development and less action tend to always be my main complaint with Marvel movies.  MCU films can be difficult to follow because of how serialized they are and because of the need to have watched the 20+ previous titles to fully grasp everything. Knowing the comics also helps if you want to catch all the hidden references and easter eggs. But Eternals can be particularly challenging just because of the complexity of the story. That got me thinking about if this could have worked better as a Disney+ show, which would have allowed more time to introduce and develop all the characters the way they deserved. And yet again, I’m not so sure Zhao, Jolie, Hayek, or even Madden would have been interested in that. I won’t be one of those critics who decide to spoil juicy details. I’ll tell you that you need to stick around until the end of the credits for this movie. Mid-credits there’s a scene with a cameo from a very recognizable name, who’s playing a character that comic book fans will recognize. Those who’ve only watched the MCU films will still be able to connect the dots. Post-credits there’s another scene that will puzzle the uninitiated but will have bloggers and pop culture journalists writing for weeks. It gives a bit more info about the history of a character introduced in the movie and that we may hope to see more of in a future Eternals movie. I will spoil this: Eternals will return. Even though I didn’t particularly like Eternals, the movie made me want to see how that Eternals return is going to be, especially now that the big exposition bit is done and we know most of the main players. I guess Marvel made the right choice when hiring Zhao after all, even if she doesn’t get to shine and make the movie completely her own. The studio tends to enlist auteur directors — from Kenneth Branagh for Thor (2011) to Taika Waititi for Thor: Ragnarok (2017), Cate Shortland for Black Widow (2021), Ryan Coogler for Black Panther (2018), and Destin Daniel Cretton for Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021) — and not all of them manage to always get it right while putting their signature spin on things. From all the MCU movies released this year, Shang-Chi is the one that gets the best results. But I feel the scale there, at least in terms of characters, was smaller. I didn’t have any deep breakthrough moments watching the movie the way I had with previous Zhao films, other than thinking immortality sucks. It’s hard to imprint a movie with a filmmaker’s brand when they need to follow so many of Marvel’s guidelines and keep the inevitable sequels in mind. But I’m still looking forward to more Sersi and company in Eternals 2.",NEUTRAL
"Oct 27, 2021"," Since its emergence as a powerhouse populist franchise that delivers box office behemoth after behemoth, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has prided itself on a static formula that has been the source of its audience-friendly success, as well as its critical detractors. With every studio release overseen by producer Kevin Feige, this formula, for better and for worse, has become synonymous with his output in a way that has resulted in creative voices like Edgar Wright and Scott Derrickson leaving projects over creative differences. Yet, when the director to Marvel’s latest property was announced as (soon to be Academy Award winner) Chloé Zhao—with reportedly ample creative control—the question has persisted: How would the independent artistic sensibilities of the director of films like Best Picture Oscar winner Nomadland and The Rider fair when tasked with helming a studio-driven project in Marvel’s ever-growing assembly line of comic book properties. Well, Eternals has arrived, and with it, the answer to the question that will help define the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.  The third installment of Marvel’s fourth phase, Eternals follows the titular group of heroes over the course of seven thousand years of human history. With a uniquely expansive nature, it takes an enlightening opening crawl—the first of the franchise—to catch us up with the mythology behind the film. Sent by the godly Celestial Arishem to further human evolution and protect humanity from a group of deadly creatures known only as Deviants, the film opens as the Eternals arrive on Earth for their first task. In a stunning opening sequence, we are introduced to the ten beings, as they glide across the screen with superheroic glory in battle and harmony alongside a plethora of powers that help them achieve their goals.  Flashing forward to a present where all the Deviants have been exterminated and the Eternals are long broken up, we find Sersei (Gemma Chan) well-ingrained in human life, with a human partner and fellow Eternal Sprite (Lia McHugh) in tow. Content with her current state, she lives a life full of peace until the mysterious re-emergence of the Deviants threatens to ruin the balance the Eternals had cultivated. After vanquishing one of the Deviants with Sprite and Ikaris’ (Richard Madden) help, the three Eternals set off on a cross-continental journey to reunite the Eternals in order to face the threat of the Deviants as they reminisce about their past endeavors and their higher purpose in this world. Telling a story of this scope is no simple feat, but Chloé Zhao ambitiously attempts to do so with much to commend. However, built around a nonlinear structure that weaves together past and present, Eternals finds itself to be somewhat flawed in its over-expositional execution.  With a plethora of information to deliver in a short amount of time (the film’s gargantuan 157-minute runtime is still too quick for what it contains), Zhao and her co-writers crafted a narratively dense story that is powered by roughly drawn benchmarks. Seemingly a consequence of Marvel’s tight formula and production schedules, it leads to a few misshapen beats throughout the film. Sersi’s journey to reunite the Eternals requires an overwhelming amount of character introductions to be told that when factored into the overall story, may seem somewhat jarring and rushed in comparison to the film’s more intimate moments. Thankfully, the occasional expositional mishaps and formulaic touch are overcome by the presence of the other aspects that Zhao brings to the table, resulting in a film that is unlike anything that has been seen in the franchise it belongs to.  With Eternals, Zhao plays into her Academy Award-winning directorial talents to make the film truly shine. While a far cry from the rest of her oeuvre, she successfully manages to blend studio demands with her uniquely poetic visual flair. Her push for the use of actual locations as opposed to the green screen-filled environments typical in blockbuster filmmaking pays off, giving even the bombastic action sequences a tangible, naturalistic atmosphere that is lacking from previous installments in the franchise. That is not to say that the film doesn’t have its fair share of clinical shots that lack personality, but alongside veteran Marvel cinematographer Ben Davis (and camera operator Joshua James Richards), Zhao manages to elevate the material enough to infuse the film with beautifully lit shots that linger on the screen to bring about the pensively intimate grandeur that marks her work. Even in the galactic sequences that could see less experienced independent filmmakers crushed under the weight of their scope, Zhao holds her own to maintain a stunning vision in which her oft-mentioned references to classic works can be clearly noted.  Traversing through mature themes that bring about questions of our own lives and humanity’s relationship with violence, destruction, and our ability (or inability) to affect the outcomes of both interpersonal and global conflicts, the thematic throughline of Zhao’s narrative also serves to elevate it from the rest of her predecessors. Through the eyes of gods, we are shown countless impactful events in human history, witnessing the emotional and physical toll they take on these beings.  Tasked with helping aid human advancement yet prohibited to interfere in human conflicts leaves many of their members questioning their purpose and struggling with the guilt of being directly or indirectly responsible for their actions. Zhao tackles the lasting implications of weight expertly, taking a handful of members and showcasing their breaking points alongside their state of mind in the present. Druig (Barry Keoghan), who holds the power to control humans, is shown to struggle with the fact that he cannot stop the Spanish conquest of Tenochtitlán, leaving the group to run a small village where he can oversee the inhabitants in peace and harmony. Meanwhile, Phastos (Bryan Tyree Henry) inhibits his role as a being that aids humanity with his inventions until his scientific advancements result in the atomic bomb that is dropped in Hiroshima, leaving him emotionally broken and unwilling to help humanity any further, becoming a reserved family man who lives quietly and contently with a husband and child (it’s worth noting that while this is far from the “first” LGBTQ+ character in the franchise, it’s the first role that holds actual weight to it and develops the character as a major player). After the Eternals’ reunite, this central conflict is fleshed out with many of the group torn between helping humanity and supporting the advancements of evolution and intergalactic life itself.  While bombastic action sequences are present in the film, Zhao’s focus on this internal conflict results in a character-driven narrative with much emotion and an intimate heart, once again in deep contrast to the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. These efforts are highlighted by a cast of actors who all deliver thoughtfully meditative performances, channeling both the weight of subtly being intergenerational icons in battle as well as inhibiting subdued moments of loss and heartbreak. The diversity at play in this ensemble elevates the film as well, aiding the film’s universal nature by giving audiences true representation in an organic and thoughtful way with many “firsts” that will surely inspire future generations of marginalized backgrounds.  On top of the aforementioned Chan, Madden, Keoghan, and Henry, the young Lia McHugh cements herself as a talent to watch in her portrayal of Sprite as a seven thousand-year-old being limited to the body of a child, unable to truly have a human experience in contrast to her adult counterparts. Another highlight of the cast, Angelina Jolie portrays Thena, a battle-hardened warrior broken down by a form of millennia-spanning PTSD. Kumail Nanjiani, Lauren Ridloff, Don Lee, Salma Hayek, and many more deserve mentions as well, but the extent to which any of the ten core members of the Eternals could be a personal favorite and no one would question you is a testament to the all-around talents of the cast and those that shaped their words.  While Eternals may be Chloé Zhao’s most conventional effort and falls prey to the typical faults of the franchise, she manages to elevate the blockbuster formula to craft one of Marvel’s best films yet. With incredible ambition and a brilliant vision, Zhao’s ambitious storytelling overcomes occasional expositional issues to break convention, subvert expectations, and work wonders, grappling with mature themes and melding an incredible scope with an intimate heart. Simply put, it’s a brilliant, visually stunning epic that is unlike anything you’ve seen in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and stands tall as not only the best superhero film of the year but one of the best blockbusters of the year as well. ",POSITIVE

Luego fue el turno de 'Shang-Chi y la leyenda de los diez anillos', una aventura de presentación que destacaba más por el uso de elementos propios del cine de artes marciales que por cualquier otra cosa. No ha sido hasta 'Eternals' cuando la cosa realmente empezará a despegar a partir del próximo 5 de noviembre, o al menos en cierto sentido. Es verdad que la nueva película de Chloé Zhao también tiene mucho de introducción, ya que no conocíamos de antemano a ninguno de sus protagonistas, pero aquí las ramificaciones son mayores y se opta por un enfoque diferente al habitual en el cine de Marvel. Sí que hay espectáculo visual, pero es una película que apuesta más por lo emocional sin terminar de dar de todo el paso necesario para llegar a brillar. Seguro que recordáis que las primeras opiniones que salieron de 'Eternals' la comparaban con 'La liga de la justicia de Zack Snyder', algo que tiene su sentido, ya que aquí también existe cierta solemnidad asociada a unos personajes a su manera a caballo entre ser superhéroes y dioses. Por ello, el apartado mitológico tiene una presencia más fuerte de lo habitual en Marvel, lo cual se traduce a su vez en una narrativa más ambiciosa. Ojo, no esperéis aquí grandes filigranas, pero sí más de un salto al pasado con el que Zhao busca dar más riqueza a lo que sucede en el presente. A veces lo consigue, otras no deja de ser otra forma de dar al espectador esa carga expositiva necesaria para evitar cualquier posibilidad de que se sienta perdido ante lo que sucede en pantalla. Eso no quita que Zhao mantenga intacta en ese interés suyo hacia lo contemplativo, dejando respirar tanto a la historia como a la evolución de los personajes. Sí es que hasta la sensación de aprovechar más los escenarios para que la película tenga siempre los pies en la Tierra y no se convierta nunca en un aluvión de fuegos artificiales en el que todo lo demás pierde sentido. Aquí ni siquiera en la batalla final se pierde vista la necesidad de mantener todo bien situado y que haya una lógica que guíe las acciones de los personajes. Zhao no está dispuesta a sacrificarlo todo en aras de una supuesta espectacularidad, pues puede que no pueda imprimir su sello por completo, pero sí que se percibe en todo momento quién está detrás de las cámaras, principalmente por esa querencia hacia el naturalismo hasta ahora inédita en Marvel. ¿Estamos entonces ante un triunfo indiscutible, ante la película que Marvel necesitaba lograr ese prestigio que se le resiste? Ahí la respuesta me temo que es no. Hay dos elementos principales que juegan en contra de 'Eternals' para poder conseguirlo. El primero es que la mitología que expone no siempre casa bien con esa tendencia a potenciar lo reflexivo de Zhao, provocando cierto bajón de interés en el segundo acto. Sospecho que es algo de que ella misma era consciente, pues también es entonces cuando el humor aparece más a menudo, ya que la comedia queda reducida a la mínima expresión tanto en el primer como en el tercer acto. Consecuencia directa de la apuesta decidida de Zhao por lo emocional, presentando al grupo protagonista como una especie de familia desestructurada que ya veremos si logra resolver sus diferencias para resolver el problema al que se ven obligados a hacer frente. La otra pega importante es que ninguno de los personajes tiene el gancho suficiente para conquistar al público. Ahí es verdad que no puedo decir que ninguno desentone, ya que todos y cada uno de ellos aportan lo que Zhao quiere de ellos. De hecho, lo hacen tan bien que quizá por eso lo que debería ser una sorpresa acaba siendo algo que al menos a mí se me pasó por la cabeza ya al de poco de arrancar la película. Puede que sea una cuestión de que Zhao parece no tener el menor interés en que los actores llenen a sus personajes a través del carisma, algo habitual en el cine de Marvel, pero al mismo tiempo parece querer igualarlos a todos, quizá con la excepción de Kumail Nanjiani, que en ocasiones asume sin pudor el rol de alivio cómico. Es como si quisiera que los actores transmitieran las emociones de los personajes desde dentro, dejando de lado tics efectistas para resaltar su estado de ánimo. Vamos, echando mano de esa solemnidad que mencionaba antes, algo que puede tener su sentido en aquellos personajes que no han terminado de conectar con la forma de ser de la humanidad, pero la distinción entre unos y otros es demasiado pequeña por ese lado. Al final lo que falta es esa chispa que ayude a que el público conecte con sus protagonistas. Uno los ve, entiende que reaccionen así y es consciente de que 'Eternals' es una estación de paso muy importante de cara al futuro de Marvel, pero también el impacto que busca la película no termina de dar del todo en la diana. Es cierto que nunca llegué a aburrirme, pero da la sensación de quedarse a medias o que simplemente la mezcla propuesta no encaja del todo bien. Me encanta que Marvel haya optado por dar tanto margen a la directora de 'Nomadland' para esta película, pero el resultado final no fluye como debería. Lo que queda es una película aceptable que nunca toca el cielo pero tampoco se hunde nunca en el infierno. Que cada cual decida si eso es suficiente o no, pero para mí ha sido una pequeña decepción.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 27, 2021"," I usually don’t complain about long movie runtimes. I like it when filmmakers demand sustained attention, butts cramping up in seats—it’s refreshingly confident. Moviegoers, especially those of us who frequent the theater, are there to be hypnotized, trapped in a room and made to turn off our phones, and then re-emerge into the world at an entirely different time of day. But in order for that to happen, the movie has to be surprising, stirring, or flat-out-crazy; I haven’t forsaken fresh air and social media just to dutifully follow a plot. Eternals, Oscar-winning director Chloé Zhao’s first major studio film, is two hours and thirty-seven minutes long—some of the longest two hours and thirty-seven minutes I’ve spent in a theater. It’s a Marvel movie with a pretty dour and complicated premise, so to be fair, Zhao had her work cut out for her. The superheroes here are lonely, immortal-adjacent celestial beings in human form who live out their lives in service of some greater power most of them have never met. From the dawn of sentient life on Earth, they’ve been instructed to save humanity from freaky monsters called Deviants—which resemble the freaky monsters from other Marvel movies, like Shang-Chi and the Seven Rings—but they’re also meant to ignore all human-created catastrophe. So they stand idly by as hordes of people are brutally murdered in the nuclear bombings in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and presumably also—though Zhao smartly does not try to portray this—American slavery, the Holocaust, the Rwandan genocide, 9/11, and the Iraq War. What kinds of weirdos are these? Well, there are a lot of them. There’s Crazy, Rich Asians star Gemma Chan, appearing a bit aimless as the deeply earnest Sersi, who can change matter with her hands; Bodyguard’s Richard Madden as her smoldering ex, Ikaris, who flies and shoot lasers from his eyes; Atlanta’s Brian Tyree Henry as Phastos, an inventor who creates new tools for humans via bizarre hand-miming; Dunkirk actor Barry Keoghan as the moody, punk rock mind-controller Druig—who has a startlingly potent chemistry with speedster Makkari, played by Lauren Ridloff, an enormously charismatic actress who came into the profession later in life, and also happens to be deaf. Ma Dong-seok is the golden-fisted protector Gilgamesh; Kumail Nanjiani provides comic relief as the wry and self-centered Kingo; Angelina Jolie, playing Goddess of War Thena, turns out a sort of clinically depressed version of her other Disney character, Maleficent; Lia McHugh is the eternally childlike Sprite, who can turn herself and others invisible, among other handy tricks; and Salma Hayek is their maternal leader Ajak, a healer who has a direct line to their absent creator, Arishem. The movie takes most of its runtime to establish all of these personalities and relationships, bogged down both by the sheer number of Eternals and the breadth of time and space they cover in their many-lifetimes-long mission. But beyond this clumsy and interminable exposition, Eternals is a drag to look at. Dominated by grays and browns, the natural lighting that Zhao insisted on and producer Kevin Feige has since marveled over washes everyone and everything out. Only Jolie, decked in white and with one of the world’s most striking faces, seems to evade its dampening. For the other certainly beautiful yet not literally radiant actors, a key light may have helped. From visuals to music choice, there’s a lack of style here that is only further emphasized by the film’s refusal to focus. We spend plenty of disjointed scenes with Sersi and Ikaris though Chan and Madden have no chemistry to speak of, let alone a love story with a compelling source. Druig and Makkari, however, let sparks fly as actors Keoghan and Ridloff communicate on multiple levels: through sign language, lip-reading, stolen looks, nudges, and sleights of hand. Yet the film only seems to be passingly interested in them. Ridloff finds exciting moments in Makkari’s hyper-attuned relationship to her environment. This comes, in part, from the actress’s lived experience as a deaf woman, as well as from her character’s gift for lightning-fast movement. She generally can’t stay still unless she’s around cult-leader-esque Druig, who can disarm with a stare. In a better and, admittedly, hornier film, their strange, twisty kind of romance might have unified some of the source material’s loftier themes. Plenty of serious moments in Eternals also made me giggle. The film’s group of highly gifted actors struggled with ham-handed dialogue and half-hearted ideas about family, responsibility, and, more obliquely, whether or not genocidal individuals are redeemable. Zhao and co-writers Ryan and Kaz Firpo let a bulked-up Nanjiani off the hook with what seems like partly improvised humor. His comedian’s instinct for ironic remove is the right one here; even his taut muscles add a layer to his character’s buffoonish love of drama and attention. Chan and Hayek, however, are riddled with the bland characterizations of good women, so dutiful, so pure, so goddess-like in their dusty costumes. Zhao, known in art-house crowds as a naturalistic filmmaker who works mainly with non-professional actors, has now become most famous for her weakest films. This irony isn’t anything new, but it is disappointing given the promise her early work shows. Her films The Rider and Songs My Brother Taught Me are visually pared down and meandering, with plenty of natural light in isolated locations—yet the force of the lives they portray come through in the performances Zhao is able to achieve with her actors. With Nomadland, and even the hyper-metaphorical Eternals, I hoped to see Zhao make her ideas come alive with more conviction. Trained actors, especially recognizable ones who are already sympathetic to audiences, can provide a vessel for a director’s most personal visions. But in both films, it’s impossible to identify any original or urgent thought about the grave situations portrayed—from the plight of seasonal workers to the evils of humanity.

"Oct 27, 2021"," 7,000 years ago, a Celestial, Arishem (voiced by David Kaye), sent immortals to protect humans from apex predators called Deviants but not to interfere in their conflicts.  He speaks to them through a gold sphere embedded in Ajak (Salma Hayek), the leader who tells them all to go off and pursue their own purpose 500 years after the last Deviant was slain.  But when one of the creatures appears in London, it now not only appears able to heal itself, it doesn’t attack humans, instead targeting “Eternals.” 7,000 years ago, a Celestial, Arishem (voiced by David Kaye), sent immortals to protect humans from apex predators called Deviants but not to interfere in their conflicts.  He speaks to them through a gold sphere embedded in Ajak (Salma Hayek), the leader who tells them all to go off and pursue their own purpose 500 years after the last Deviant was slain.  But when one of the creatures appears in London, it now not only appears able to heal itself, it doesn’t attack humans, instead targeting “Eternals.” There’s been a lot of speculation about how Oscar winning cowriter (with Patrick Burleigh, Ryan Firpo and Kaz Firpo)/director Chloe Zhao’s (“Nomadland”) naturalistic docudrama style would translate in the MCU and the answer is, unsurprisingly, a bit of a hybrid.  While Eternals are introduced as two new layers of omnipotence over the Avengers and consist of a group with internal spats, ribbing, rivalries and allegiances, their relationships are more inclined to cross over into love.  The landscape here is far more in tune with nature than urban sprawl as the biggest cities we see outside of present day London are ancient wonders like Babylon circa 500 BC, most scenes taking place in deserts, forests and by the sea.  Zhao’s imprint can even be felt in special effects featuring celestial shapes, natural stone and double decker buses turned into a shower of rose petals.  Even Ramin Djawadi’s score seems softer and gentler.
Aside from the group’s beloved Ajak, who now rides horses in South Dakota, the Eternals consist of Ikaris (Richard Madden), the strongest Eternal who crushed his lover Sersi (Gemma Chan), who can change matter, by leaving without a trace; Sprite (Lia McHugh), the punky teen who lives with Sersi and loves Ikaris; Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani) who reinvented himself as a Bollywood star; Sullen Druig (Barry Keoghan), the Eternal who dares to interfere in human fighting via mind control; Makkari (Lauren Ridloff, AMC’s ‘The Walking Dead’), the deaf Eternal of incredible speed; Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), the inventor who jumps the gun steering human technology before retreating with a husband and son; Thena (Angelina Jolie) the warrior suffering from Mahd Wy’ry, the condition brought on by an overload of memories and Gilgamesh (Don Lee), the Eternal who vows to protect her when Ajak recommends an awful cure.
The film kicks off to Pink Floyd’s ‘Time’ in present day London where Sersi works at the Natural History Museum with her lover, Dane Whitman (Kit Harington).  A global earthquake hits as Sersi teaches a class of young kids.  That evening, as she, Dane and Sprite walk home after celebrating Dane’s birthday, a Deviant emerges from the Thames.  Ikaris returns, drawing out more Deviants (and setting up a dual romantic triangle).  As this splinter group recognizes it is time to reunite with the others, we are witness to a foreboding scene as Arishem tells Ajak not to get too attached to the planet Earth.
Zhao then flashes back to various time periods to do some world building, jumping about various civilizations to illustrate how Eternals lived alongside men like a kind of MCU Peace Corps.  When they’re not assisting with irrigation and other human endeavors, they are fighting Deviants, giant winged beasts that look something like dragons made out of rubber coated wire, the least Zhaoian of the film’s effects.  The Eternals themselves wear form fitting colored suits adorned with golden celestial symbols and have the ability to conjure golden weapons or shoot gold beams from their eyes.  If there is a note of been here, done that, it lies with Ikaris, whose blue suit and powerful beam shooting while suspended in air is strongly reminiscent of “Watchmen’s” Doctor Manhattan.
Following the MCU playbook, it is now time to return to the present, as those London based Eternals find their colleagues in their various earthly pursuits.  Kingo leaves an elaborate Bollywood dance number with his human valet Karun (Harish Patel), whom he’s enlisted to make a documentary of their exploits.  Perhaps most amusingly, Gilgamesh is found wearing a ‘kiss the cook’ apron out in the middle of nowhere, preparing feasts for the increasingly erratic Thena.  But they will find they haven’t reunited for the reason they thought, as one betrayal follows another, not all betrayals what they first appear.  Surprisingly, it appears that Thanos’s attempt to wipe out half of living things put a chink in a more malevolent mission.
The ensemble’s diversity, from race to disabilities to sexual orientation, has been commented upon laboriously, but it is also made up of lesser known actors, Jolie and Hayek its most prominent names.  It’s a good mix, Jolie providing melancholy, Nanjiani comic relief, Keoghan attitude, Madden and Chan sex appeal and romance.  And while all of these films feature life or death climaxes on a massive scale, Zhao’s, at least, doesn’t require the destruction of a city, instead evoking “Planet of the Apes” writ large.  Note that there are two post credit sequences, as usual pointing the way towards future installments and unveiling a new character.

Ah, the Marvel Universe. It is a world/galaxy/universe of its own and fans are its unique inhabitants. I am not an inhabitant. That said, MU films have a checklist that every one of them seems to follow. You get a bevy of colorful super heroes wielding their individual powers. As required, they banter and cajole each other no matter how dire the circumstances and dangers. There is an indomitable foe that they have to dominate. And, most important, there is an extended big bang finale that is supposed to wrap things up – but you know they do not – and it goes on too long.
Now, to the story. It goes about the way described in the opening paragraph. The Deviants are pug ugly monsters out to, as far as I can tell, make a snack out of mankind. The Eternals’ mission is to stop and destroy all the Deviants but, the Celestials have a hidden agenda that will put that mission in great jeopardy. It is up to the Eternals to unite and thwart the agenda.
As expected, the money is up there on the screen with its large, talented cast – including, as I like to see, a huge battery of stunt people – and copious CGI effects from start to finish. It is entertaining and mostly fast-paced – until the interminable bombastic finale that goes on for many minutes longer than it should – and will please the MCU fans.
One last note, I am never staying through the credits of a Marvel movie ever again. The credits go on far too long and I could care less about the much touted bumper of things to come.

"Oct 27, 2021"," So, what happens when you hand a massive Marvel Cinematic Universe movie to a brilliant maker of small-scale, meditative independent movies? Something different, it turns out — not always in a good way, but definitely something fresh, and maybe that’s what the MCU needs right now. Chloé Zhao’s “Eternals” has its flaws; in a nutshell, it’s too long (very few movies, superhero or otherwise, can justify breaking the 2.5-hour mark), it’s got some pretty slow spots midfilm and it’s desperately in need of a bit more wit. Maybe it’s hard to have much of a sense of fun when you’ve been around for thousands of years, as this movie’s main characters have. But what it does have is a palpable, artful mood; this is a movie full of superheroes who spend time thinking and feeling, and of special effects that aren’t just zippy but often delicately elegant. If that’s not a phrase you’ve heard applied to a comic-book movie before … well, like I said, this one’s a little different. A more-or-less stand-alone MCU installment (with a few in-jokes for the hard-core fans, who should definitely stick around for two post-credit scenes about which I’ll breathe not a whit), “Eternals” takes place in multiple time periods. It unfolds simultaneously in the present, in which a far-flung band must reunite when alien predators called Deviants begin to attack humanity, and throughout the past, as we revisit numerous key moments in the group’s history. And it’s a very long history: 7,000 years. Essentially, the Eternals are immortal aliens, living among humans — like vampires, but minus the biting and plus a strong social conscience — and charged with protecting the world. There are 10 of them, all new to MCU movies and all with their own special powers. It’s a remarkable group for a superhero movie in that they look like all of us: diverse in gender (this is the first Marvel movie with an equal number of male and female heroes), race, age, sexuality, nationality and ability. (Not that they really look like all of us. Any group fronted by the likes of Gemma Chan, Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek and Richard Madden has an obvious extra superpower: bone structure.) Zhao brings a creative eye to the action sequences: I loved an early London scene in which a red bus suddenly becomes reduced to crimson confetti, floating like leaves in an autumn wind. The Deviants look like enormous lizards whose very skin seems to be dangerously fraying; they’re both fanciful and menacing (pity most of the scenes they’re in are so murky, though). The golden, runelike figures that elaborately encircle the Eternals as they don their warrior garb are poetry in motion. And it’s fun getting to know this crowd and seeing their personalities and back stories slowly emerge: the on-and-off love affair between Chan’s soulful Sersi and Madden’s more mercurial Ikarus; wisecracking Kingo (a delightful Kumail Nanjiani, this movie’s not-so-secret comedy weapon), who’s been living as a Bollywood star; childlike Sprite (Lia McHugh), who appropriately has a Peter Pan-ish haircut; warrior Thena (Jolie), who moves with balletic grace; cerebral Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), whose mind we can see as it sketches visions in the air. For all the nuance that Zhao brings, “Eternals” is still a superhero movie, with all the pleasures and limitations of that genre. The screenplay, credited to four writers, has some flat spots and awkward dialogue, and there’s a lot of superhero-ish standing around, with the Eternals posing in their beautiful warrior outfits like they’re shooting an album cover. It’s a long sit, but a day later I find myself still thinking about Chan’s quiet, mesmerizing presence at the film’s center, and how Zhao had the confidence to let that performance speak so softly. It’s a different kind of superhero movie; not to everyone’s taste, but made for us all. With Gemma Chan, Richard Madden, Kumail Nanjiani, Lia McHugh, Brian Tyree Henry, Lauren Ridloff, Barry Keoghan, Don Lee, Kit Harrington, Salma Hayek, Angelina Jolie. Directed by Chloe Zhao, from a screenplay by Zhao, Patrick Burleigh, Ryan Firpo and Kaz Firpo. 157 minutes. Rated PG-13 for fantasy violence and action, some language and brief sexuality. Opens Nov. 5 at multiple theaters. ",POSITIVE
"Oct 27, 2021"," And your boss sucks. Hierarchy and teamwork are your bag, so you can’t really question why it is that you take orders from a sentient boombox in the sky. Or why you’ve been saddled with refurbished Power Rangers costumes for eternity. Or why you have to follow so many rules regarding the do’s and don’ts of your time on Earth, the most prominent being: Don’t intervene. Colonialism, genocide, global warming, atomic bombs. Shit hits the fan about a thousand times per century and, despite having the power to stop it, you can’t — it’s not your place. Thanos, schmanos: Not your problem. Your sole purpose is to battle the so-called Deviants, those skinless, reptilian beasts with ribboned musculature and a newfound taste for Eternal blood. Deviate from that plan and the galactic boombox, better known as Arishem the Judge, will get you. Finish the assignment a few centuries early, and you’ll nevertheless remain deployed on Earth, beholden to its rules — just in case the job isn’t really finished. 

It’s enough to drive an Eternal mad. And in fact, the Eternals’ minds are at constant risk of cracking under the pressure of all that history and — will no one admit it? — boredom. No amount of emphatic emotionalism, heroic grandstanding, or Instagrammable, earthbound beauty can distract from this fact. But Eternals, which was directed by Chloé Zhao, certainly tries — ad nauseam — to make the case. Zhao’s movie, co-written by the director with Patrick Burleigh, Ryan Firpo, and Kaz Firpo, rightly sees this franchise as the globe-trotting, centuries-spanning epic that it is. It tries to take us everywhere, give us glimpses of everything, from Mesopotamia in 5000 B.C.; to Tenochtitlan in the 1520s, overrun by an invading Spain; to the Hiroshima of 1945, just minutes after the bomb; to present-day Alaska, Mumbai, South Dakota, London, Iraq. Only spy capers and travel guides rival this movie’s global reach. But even they can’t treat you to the sight of Deviants going full-on Jurassic Park on a gang of hapless Neanderthals.  Eternals stars Salma Hayek, Angelina Jolie, Gemma Chan, Richard Madden, Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry, Lauren Ridloff, Barry Keoghan, Don Lee, and Lia McHugh — the youngster of the bunch — as our titular superheroes. All are imbued with distinct powers and attitudes and suggestively familiar names: Thena, Ikaris, Gilgamesh. It would seem that the Eternals are not only Earth’s protectors (Avengers notwithstanding), they’re also the inspirations for some of its most enduring, godly myths. Hence the opportunities afforded by a central cast this large and varied, whose personalities can’t help but pull the movie in as many different directions as there are stars. Jolie, as Thena — a warrior goddess who fights with weapons made of cosmic energy — gets to hero-pose her way through action scenes in ways that only Jolie can make look good. Lee’s Gilgamesh brings the fearsome fists; Henry’s Phastos has a genius mind for engineering. The leader of the group, Ajak (Hayek), gets to call the shots and react to things with significant facial expressions. The leaders of the movie are Ikaris (Madden), who can fly (duh) and shoot destructive beams from his eyes, and Sersi (Chan), who can manipulate matter at will.  Not that this is how they spend their days, nowadays. While Kingo (Nanjiani) is off in Mumbai fashioning himself into a one-man dynasty of Bollywood icons, Druig (Keoghan), a controller of minds, hides out in a jungle with a colony of laborers in his keep, and Makkari (Ridloff) — the MCU’s first deaf superhero and, for my money, the smartest Eternal of the lot — hides out in the supergroup’s spaceship to wait out the centuries until it’s time to go home.  If only it were that simple. You can’t go home again — isn’t that the line? It’s no spoiler to say that “waiting it out” eventually ceases to be an option; humanity must come under threat, a threat worse than even Thanos, otherwise there’d be no movie. As it is, there’s barely a movie to begin with. Somehow, despite all the nods toward emotional complexity and women’s empowerment, all the caring, cross-cultural gestures of goodwill, the movie whittles itself down to the obvious inner and outer battles, a tepid romantic drama that goes nowhere, and group dynamics that peaked circa the first few Fast & Furious movies: “family,” teamwork, faith in humanity despite the actual inclinations of the humans in question. Eternals is a movie full of opportunities, most of which it sidesteps in favor of its least charismatic heroes, its least interesting questions. Some of this is the fault of a redundant emotional structure that takes the audience’s intelligence for granted. At one point, we get a trio of scenes in which, after someone dies, the gang must get back together after years of living normal human lives, and, with each member of the team that gets reintroduced to the story, we get a ritualistic repetition of a deadening dramatic pattern. Someone breaks the news; someone else mourns the news; then everyone rallies, heading off to the next exotic locale to ruin yet another person’s day. It’s like a game of telephone in which the message being passed on is simply the sound of someone’s slobbery weeping. 

I’d been curious to see what Zhao, who up to this point has worked in a domain far afield from the Marvel Universe, would bring to a movie of this scope. Her previous films got attention for their mix of documentary realism — down to the use of nonprofessional actors — and the more movie-ish style of indie drama that earned her a regular spot on the Sundance roster. They were defined by the director’s insistence on immersion. Songs My Brothers Taught Me (2015) and The Rider (2017) were both filmed on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, in South Dakota, with locals often playing versions of themselves. The best picture–winning Nomadland (2020), fronted by Oscar winner Frances McDormand and set among the modern Southwest’s real-life nomads, co-starred some of the same people who’d lent their life stories to Jessica Bruder’s book, Nomadland: Surviving America in the Twenty-First Century, on which Zhao’s film was based. These movies hit and miss, but Zhao’s visual style — her instinctive reimagining of the Western genre’s mythic vistas and natural environments — became a hallmark. 

Much of that style carries over into Eternals — where it gets exposed, more plainly than before, as a kind of cultural tourism. Mesopotamia, Iraq, indigenous empires: They’re all mere backdrops to the Eternals’ ability to engage with these cultures, learn the languages, feast on the riches of ancient history in beautified montages of the cast’s most attractive actors doing Attractive People things. After the U.S. decimates Hiroshima, what we get is — nothing. Zhao’s Hiroshima feels more akin to present-day Chernobyl, a ghost city, all of the suffering in the wake of the bomb completely absent, all of the actual victims of history evaporated, as if Thanos, not an atomic bomb, had wreaked this havoc. Everything has been cleared out of the way but for a pair of weeping Eternals questioning the destructive path human progress has taken. It’s an easier portrait to paint if the actual human toll is neatly cropped out of the picture.  This would matter less in a movie less cumbersome on the humanitarian front — a movie in which saving Earth, weighing the one versus the many, thwarting deep, dark, intergalactic plans of total destruction, wasn’t such a tiresome, single-minded pursuit. Or a movie that didn’t go so far out of its way to beautify the Eternals’ ostensible empathy for humanity with indigenous cultural props hovering around in the background. They’re a part of this planet, after all, these alien saviors of ours. Yet their interactions with it are laughably limited; the idea that any of them care enough about Earth to want to save it is so taken for granted that merely asking the question makes the movie fall apart. Zhao’s camera is often positioned just below the eyeline of her heroes, who fall into picturesque V-formations out of habit, ever-ready for their class photo: a guaranteed promotional meme. It leaves the impression of a humanity looking up to these gods, this veritable goof troop in their god-awful, color-coded suits. So: Where’s humanity? Who’s doing all that looking? I’m not asking for more no-line extras in exotic costumes or more bit parts written for boyfriend characters. I’m asking about actual people. Not that the Eternals — who get jerked through the movie’s banal melodramas, same-old action sequences, and snoozy central romance — are exactly triumphs of characterization. One character stabbing another in the back (literally, not figuratively) proves one of the more surprising turns in the movie. But the psychological seeds of that act are so loudly and nonsensically signaled that there’s nothing satisfying about it. The most interesting things about these heroes are their moral predicaments, both those that they share as a group and those that arise as a consequence of their individual powers. There’s a Celestial (capital C, as this is another class of superbeing) system of checks and balances at play in this story, in which the Eternals prove a crucial cog. This occasionally results in problems worth dwelling on — which the movie has little time to do, what with all the predictable emotional beats it’s too busy hitting, all the hero poses yet left to strike. “You do not turn against your family,” one of our heroes eventually shouts. Spoken like a true alien; real families, or at least the kinds worth watching movies about, embrace their dysfunction. Yet even when the Eternals fight amongst themselves, they’re boring about it. Eternals is so busy showing off what it can do, where it can go, that it bypasses and overlooks what it really has to offer. There are real dilemmas, real battles of interest buried beneath the soft-pedaled, naturally-lit, cozy surfaces of this movie. But like everything of genuine interest here, those strands are the supporting players to a tired lead act — much in the way that the couple with actual chemistry in this movie takes a constant back seat to its Hot, Boring Leads. Eternals is good at telling us where to look, at impressing us with its manufactured sense of grandeur. What it lacks is any credible sense of what’s actually worth seeing.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 27, 2021"," Eternals is a rather different entry in the 
  Marvel Cinematic Universe
 thanks to a very ambitious goal. The movie aims to reveal new events in the MCU that no one knew took place, spanning almost the entire history of humanity across thousands of years. It's a complicated task, involving multiple zigzags through time, a huge cast and plenty of info-dumps. Unfortunately, the whole package doesn't quite work. Directed by Oscar winner Chloé Zhao, Eternals starts streaming Wednesday, Jan. 12, on Disney Plus for no extra fee on top of your regular subscription. The Eternals, we discover, are superheroes who lived on Earth throughout the entire saga of the 
  Marvel
 films, arriving millennia before Captain America was even born. They include Ajak (Salma Hayek), Sersi (Gemma Chan), Ikaris (Richard Madden), Thena (Angelina Jolie), Klingo (Kumail Nanjiani), Sprite (Lia McHugh), Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), Druig (Barry Keoghan) and Gilgamesh (Ma Dong-seok). These heroes discuss their own backstories early and often, from a failed romantic relationship between two characters that lasted 5,000 years, to a medical condition that might require a memory-wiping procedure. There's a whole lot of talk about these details that surprisingly don't go much deeper, despite a hefty 2.5-hour runtime. You end up having to wait through the entire first half to actually see what powers these heroes are capable of. Fortunately, it's worth it: The variety of gorgeous action sequences showcase the Eternals at war with the Deviants, which look like CGI wolves made of wires. They are apparently the only creatures the Eternals can engage their time and powers against, providing a fairly weak excuse for why they choose to sit out most human conflicts. Not to mention that one time Thanos snapped away half of the universe. It's an odd restriction when many of the Eternals describe how much they wish to protect human society. The powers themselves aren't particularly memorable. Thena can make luminous weapons appear out of thin air. Ajak can heal. Sersi can turn stone into other elements. Ikaris can fly and shoot laser beams. The most interesting character to me was Phastos: He can seemingly invent technology whenever he wants. Among the group, no one is a jack-of-all-trades-type like Brie Larson's 
  Captain Marvel
, nor particularly specialized at their skill like Scarlett Johannsson's Black Widow. At one point Ikaris is called Superman, only stamping home the feeling Eternals' lacks a clear identity. The non-linear storytelling can be confusing: We're whisked back and forth in time, across constantly changing international settings. One minute the Eternals are with humans in the Stone age. The next they're back in the present day. Then we flash back to an event 2,000 years in the past, then forward again. It might be a natural journey for the characters, but I felt whiplash. It might have helped if the characters wore outfits that reflected the society they were visiting, instead of sticking to superhero suits in the past and casual jackets and jeans in the present. Still, the time-hopping is what places Eternals in a different space from the recently wrapped Infinity Saga. While I wouldn't recommend this as a first-time Marvel watch for anyone, the only cursory knowledge it requires is that Eternals' present day storyline takes place in the fallout of Avengers: Endgame. You should also take note that there are two end-credit scenes to wait for. Eternals was originally supposed to be the first Marvel movie after Spider-Man: Far From Home set to further dive into the ramifications of post-blip life. Instead, that honor went to Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, which from introduction to post-credits scene told a story with a new voice in the Marvel universe. While I appreciate that Eternals takes a creative risk with its time-jumping events, its convoluted plot ultimately lets it down.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 27, 2021"," Eternals might be the first Marvel Studios movie that doesn’t benefit from being a Marvel Studios movie. After over a decade of interconnected films, the company has carefully crafted audience expectations. To us, a Marvel movie has a certain undeniable energy; a blend of action, humor, and heart that’s aimed to please everyone from ages eight to 80. Eternals has some of that, of course, but in the hands of recent Oscar-winning filmmaker Chloé Zhao, it also aspires to be more, and being beholden to the rules of Marvel holds it back.  Zhao, who won the Best Director Oscar earlier this year for Nomadland, also co-wrote Eternals along with Patrick Burleigh, Ryan Firpo, and Kaz Firpo. The basic story is that at the beginning of time, God-like creatures named Celestials created immortal beings called Eternals whose job was to protect the universe from another set of beings called Deviants. The film picks up when the Eternals first arrived on Earth 7,000 years ago, and follows them through history, culminating in a cataclysmic event happening in present day. That sounds like a lot of story, and it is, especially when you realize the film also has to follow 10 of these Eternals in addition to side characters.  The plot is designed to fit all of that in though, and at least at the beginning, it works. Things start, and for the most part stick, with Sersi, played by Gemma Chan. Chan previously appeared in a small role in Captain Marvel, but here she shows humanity and charisma that prove she’s much better suited for the foreground. When she’s reunited with her long-lost love Ikaris (Game of Thrones’ Richard Madden, not to be confused with Sersi’s present-day love, Dane, played by Game of Thrones’ Kit Harrington), the two realize the Deviants they thought they’d exterminated on Earth centuries ago are back. And so the two, along with Sprite (The Lodge’s Lia McHugh), traverse the globe putting the Eternals back together to battle the returning threat. In its “getting the gang back together” scenes, Eternals feels like the Marvel movie it aspires to be. These 10 immortal beings are a family, after all—they just happen to have known each other for millennia. Over that massive span of time, deep-seated, complex relationships have developed; the film is eager to explore them, but only has a short time to do so. We learn about Sersi and Ikaris’s romance, for one. Ajax (Salma Hayek), the leader of the group, has gone off to a farm in South Dakota. Druig (Dunkirk’s Barry Keoghan) long ago grew apart from the ideals of his fellow Eternals. Thena (Angelina Jolie) has developed an affliction that requires her to be watched over by Gilgamesh (Train to Busan’s Don Lee). Kingo (Silicon Valley’s Kumail Nanjiani) has become a generational Bollywood movie star. Phastos (Atlanta’s Brian Tyree Henry) detached from the group after a tragic realization. Sprite faces unreturned love. And Makkari (The Walking Dead’s Lauren Ridloff) is just ready to leave Earth. Of course, since this is a superhero movie, all of the Eternals have a different superpower—some of which are cooler and more helpful than others—but seeing all of them interact, reunite, and reminisce is when Eternals is at its best. The characters are well-defined  and each actor does a fine job distinguishing themselves, while also having that spark of knowledge that they’re in a Marvel movie. Because a diverse group of actors was cast, it also makes them feel like true, worthy representatives of the world and the script allows each character to have distinct, dense points of view. We hear conversations about family, religion, war, technology, evolution, and more, resulting in a cornucopia of interesting ideas for the audience to chew upon. Watching all that unfold, there’s a strong sense those ideas are what Zhao wanted to explore with this film. What does it mean to have existed on Earth  and witnessed the entirety of history? How would all of these diverse points of view digest that? It’s a fascinating conceit and one that, if Eternals didn’t have to become a Marvel movie, really might have been interesting—but they have to take time to address why they didn’t fight Thanos and they have to mention the Avengers. So as Eternals goes from a generational exploration of time and space to a zip, pow, wham Marvel movie, all of those ideas and possibilities get pushed into the background.  Once we learn why the Deviants are back, the Eternals are forced into action, and though there are a few solid twists and turns in the final act, the movie more or less devolves into superheroes in suits shooting stuff in order to save the world.  That’s all fine and dandy but Eternals was crafted as, and looks more like, a story interested in exploring the flaws of humanity rather than who would win in the big-budget special effects fight. So every time those VFX sequences kick in, they feel somehow less than ones we’ve previously seen in the MCU. The characters have been doing this for so long, and audiences have been watching characters like them do these things for so long, very little in these portions feels new or unique. Heck, even the villains look familiar (though not from Marvel, more like the Wheelers from Return to Oz and even Steppenwolf from Justice League). None of these things are treated as afterthoughts in the plot, they’re just not as rousing or exciting as one would expect them to be because it’s a Marvel movie first, Chloé Zhao movie second. Eternals is most entertaining and exciting when the heroes are in different time periods, interacting with different cultures and environments. Zhao and her cinematographer Ben Davis shoot the hell out of every lush landscape, from expansive deserts to deep jungles to snow-covered mountains. Plus, the editing, which bounces from the present to different points in history, gives Eternals a decent momentum despite its near three-hour run time.  It’s just that by the end of the journey, all of the characters, all of the history, all of the ideas and exposition only make up some of the film. On top of all that, it has to fit into the Marvel Cinematic Universe and be an exciting action movie. Eternals feels like a balloon that tried to hold it all together but was filled to bursting; it’s too much—and not enough. The result is a very ambitious, very well made, kind of flat, and unfortunately forgettable film. And with the level of talent that made it, that’s a big letdown. But hey, at least the ending and end credit scenes are cool.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 27, 2021"," One of the many, many ways in which the Marvel Cinematic Universe has grown to become the dominating presence it is in cinemas is that each entry has clung to a certain formula and pulled liberally from genres. For example, 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' drew from '70s conspiracy thrillers like 'Three Days of the Condor', 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' was like a John Hughes teen comedy, and 'Black Widow' was a spy blockbuster in the vein of Tom Cruise's 'Mission: Impossible' franchise. It's given audiences a measure of familiarity when introducing new characters and arcs, allowing them to tap into surroundings and tropes that they recognise, but with a comic-book twist to it. With 'Eternals', Chloé Zhao and fellow screenwriters Patrick Burleigh and brothers Kaz and Ryan Firpo are reaching for something that's probably just too far of a stretch for the Marvel Cinematic Universe - substance. Much of 'Eternals' is spent zipping through the centuries, dropping into the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, the Gupta Empire of India, the fall of Tenochtitlan, and charting out how the band of heroes have played a role in shaping humanity's mythology - Icarus, for example, was actually Richard Madden's Ikaris, the goddess Athena was really just Angelina Jolie with platinum blonde hair and CGI. It's bold stuff, reshaping myths around the world and placing Marvel superheroes in the middle of them. It doesn't end there, either. They're guided by an all-powerful being who judges which planets live or die, and they - the Eternals, that is - are really just instruments of his design. That's right, folks - the Marvel Cinematic Universe has shot past the cosmic and into the realm of divine providence and the very nature of existence. Of course, in order to try and rope all of these huge ideas onto the screen, a good chunk of 'Eternals' is spent trying to make exposition and world-building seem cool and interesting, not boring and lifeless. In fairness to director Chloé Zhao, that's a tough task for any director to manage, let alone one whose most notable work to date has been a meditative piece on place and family and is largely devoid of plot. Even if you get Gemma Chan's character to literally spell things out to the audience surrogate - Kit Harrington, in this case - the story itself is needlessly convoluted in a way that really leaves you scratching your head about why it spent an hour-plus to get there. Still, Zhao is pushing the boat out for a Marvel movie in ways it hasn't before. There's a love-making scene, albeit very, very tame, but still! Marvel superheroes having sex! Said superheroes themselves actively question their purpose and their abilities when humanity itself seems unworthy of them, and it literally has them confronting the actual creator of the universe about the divine order of creation itself. With that kind of scale to it, 'Eternals' then has to work extra hard to keep balance with a sense of grounded humanity to it by introducing romances, families, unrequited loves. Sadly, none of them ever quite reach a place where it's convincing. It doesn't help either that the cast is so dense that the camera never seems to rest on any of them for too long, or give any of them a chance to actually develop. For example, Barry Keoghan's character Druig has the ability to control minds and we later see him leading... a cult, you could say? How did that happen and why? Before you get a chance to breathe, there's a CGI fight with tentacled alien-animals and more crying, more jaws clenched in dramatic fashion, and more exposition. To their credit, the cast are giving it their best shot. Richard Madden has real screen presence as Ikaris, Angelina Jolie likewise has a real aura of menace to her character, Lia McHugh's Sprite has all the angst and heartbreak of young adulthood, and even Kumail Nanjiani gets to do a Bollywood dance sequence. 'Eternals' isn't the big blockbuster fun of previous Marvel entries, it's trying to make itself more substantial and ponderous. In an ironic twist, 'Eternals' falls victim to the kind of problems that plagued DC movies like 'Man of Steel' and 'Zack Snyder's Justice League'. It flies high, grapples with huge themes and ideas, tries to keep check with humour and heart, but the whole thing feels so overblown and overwrought that you kind of walk out of the screen in a daze. ",NEUTRAL
"Oct 27, 2021"," “Eternals” is achingly earnest in tackling issues of diversity and representation, but fails as engrossing entertainment. I don’t expect to be educated at a Marvel Cinematic Universe outing and the exposition at the very beginning sets out to do just that…you need to know a lot about Eternals (our heroes) and Deviants (the villains) and Celestials (the supreme beings) and their connection to some supreme being, but you won’t be told all. That might feel like cheating, especially when you get halfway through. I was surprised when Chloé Zhao was pegged to tackle this endeavor because beyond the diversity she brings as both a female director and a person of East Asian descent, her past efforts have been small independent films, best known for depicting semi-autobiographical works of marginalized people. The 2017 contemporary Western, “The Rider,” starred Brady Jandreau as a fictionalized version of himself named Brady Blackburn. Zhao became the first woman of color (and second woman) to win an Academy Award for Best Director for her 2021 “Nomadland” which starred Oscar-winner Frances McDormand as a nomadic worker living out of a van. In the film, Zhao had real people living the van-life playing people that the protagonist meets and learns from. “Eternals” has nothing to do with reality or hardship. Zhao, along with Patrick Burleigh, Ryan Firpo and Kaz Firpo, is credited with writing the screenplay which is based on characters by Jack Kirby. The persons with the biggest star power are Angelina Jolie as Thena and Salma Hayek as Ajak, but the main character is played by Chinese hapa Gemma Chan. Kirby drew heavily from Greek mythology so if you need a rundown here’s how the characters come by their names, I have it here for you below. Otherwise, you can skip down to the next section. Sersi (Gemma Chan) is Circe. Chan previously played Minn-Erva (Minerva is the Roman goddess of wisdom and war whose Greek equivalent is Athena.) in the 2019 MCU “Captain Marvel.” Circe is a minor goddess of indeterminate parentage (Helios and Perse or Hecate and Aeetes) who is best known for her role in Homer’s “Odyssey” for changing Odysseus’ crew into pigs as Odysseus travels home from the Trojan War. Odysseus didn’t hold it against her and stayed long enough to father at least two sons (Latinus and Telegonus) with Circe while his wife Penelope waited for him. Sersi has been in love with Ikaris for centuries and her power is the ability to transform inanimate matter into something else–water into wood or a bus into petals. In the human world, she has been posing as a museum curator in London and dating a mortal named Dane Whitman (Kit Harington) after Ikaris dumped her a few centuries ago. Ikaris (Richard Madden) is Icarus. Icarus was not a god, minor or otherwise. He was the son of craftsman Daedalus. Daedalus build the Labyrinth for the Minotaur for Minos, ruler of Crete. The Minotaur was the monster born to the wife of Minos when she had sexual relations with a Cretan bull through a device made by Daedalus (hollowed out cow-like construction). Minos had angered Poseidon who punished Minos by making Minos’ wife (Pasiphaë ) fall in love with the bull. After Daedalus’ provides Minos’ daughter with something to help Athenian hero Theseus in killing the Minotaur, Minos has Daedalus imprisoned in the Labyrinth. To escape Minos, Daedalus constructs wings for himself and his son to fly away from Crete, but Icarus fails to head his father’s warnings and flies too high and close to the sun. The heat of the sun melts the wax used to adhere the feathers to the wings and Icarus falls to his death. Ikaris is the most powerful Eternal and can fly as well as send cosmic energy beams from his eyes. So he’s literally a guy whose very look can kill. Kingo in the original Marvel Comics  is Kingo Sunen and supposed to be a samurai.  I guess Kirby wasn’t interested in Japanese mythology. He was supposed to be a major action star in Japan. In the film, Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani) is an Eternal who can project cosmic energy from his hands. In the human world, Kingo has become an acting dynasty but unfortunately Nanjiani doesn’t have the physicality to convincingly play a Bollywood dancing star. Sprite (Lia McHugh) is often mistaken for a soft drink. Okay, not really, but every time I heard the characters refer to Sprite, I had to remind myself this was a character. In the film “Eternals,” this Eternal can make lifelike illusions and is a storyteller of the group (imagine making movies before movies or augmented reality were possible), but she looks like a 12-year-old with a bad haircut. In “Eternals,” Sprite is in love with Ikaris. Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry) is possibly the Greek god Hephaestus, of the god of fire, the blacksmith of the gods who makes weapons and military equipment (e.g. the winged helmet and sandals of Hermes). Hephaestus’s wife was the goddess of love, Aphrodite. In the film “Eternals,” Phastos is depicted as Black and gay. Instead of using an anvil and hammer, he is an engineer who makes high tech weapons and equipment. It’s suggested that he provides the knowledge for humans to slowly advance technologically (e.g. the plow because the timing wasn’t right for a steam engine and the industrial revolution). Makkari (Lauren Ridloff) is Mercury. Mercury is a Roman god (Greek equivalent is Hermes) who is the god of messages, eloquence and travelers. As the original messengers of Ancient Rome and Greece were runners, he is portrayed as a runner. In “Eternals,” Makkari possess super speed and runs so fast she can run on water. Don’t worry, there are no slo-mo action scenes to show time suspended for everyone else as she zips around like someone super-caffeinated. Makkari as portrayed by Ridloff is both Black and hearing impaired. Makkari communicates via sign language. Druig (Irish actor Barry Keoghan) sounds like this might be taken from Druid, but I don’t see any co-relating mythological character. In “Eternals,” Druig is not a team player and often goes against what the others want. He has the ability to mind-control people. This doesn’t seem particularly helpful when battling the Deviants. Gilgamesh (Don Lee) is Gilgamesh. Gilgamesh is the hero of the epic poem from Mesopotamia (Iraq, and parts of Iran, Turkey, Syria, and Kuwait),  “Epic of Gilgamesh,” and was supposedly the king of Uruk. Uruk was an ancient city of Sumer (and later of Babylonia) situated east of the present bed of the Euphrates River in Western Asia (Iraq). Gilgamesh as the king of Uruk was a serial rapist who claimed the droit du seigneur (lord’s right) to rape women on their wedding night. His people prayed to the gods to help lift his oppression and the gods find Enkidu and arrange for him to be civilized (this involves a temple prostitute named Shamhat).  Enkidu and Gilgamesh become friends and they have great adventures together until Enkidu dies and Gilgamesh mourns him, hoping that they will be re-united. So the solution to a serial royal rapist was a bromance that took the king away from his people so he could rape and pillage elsewhere. In “Eternals,” Gilgamesh becomes the seemingly platonic companion of Thena when she becomes mentally unstable. He is the strongest Eternal. While it is nice to have an East Asian face (Lee was born in Seoul, but has US citizenship), one wonders how people from West Asia feel about being excluded. Also, some people at the press screening initially thought Lee’s Gilgamesh was Wong from Doctor Strange. I’m not sure if that means different East Asian types need to be cast or critics and audience members need to be exposed to more characters with East Asian faces or both. Ajak (Salma Hayek) is likely Ajax and was originally portrayed by Kirby as male. In Greek mythology, Ajax the Greater was the son of the king of Salamis and the great-grandson of Zeus. He’s mentioned in Homer’s “Iliad” as a tall  and big man, second only to Achilles in strength and bravery. Ajax and Odysseus compete to claim the magical armor of Achilles after Achilles’ death. The armor was made on Mount Olympus by the god Hephaestus. The council awards the armor to Odysseus (who was aided by Athena in his arguments). Ajax then commits suicide. In “Eternals,” Ajak has the ability to heal and acts as the leader of the Eternals and their mother figure. It is her death that brings the Eternals back together to fight a common enemy, the Deviants. Thena (Angelina Jolie) is obviously Athena. Athena is the Greek goddess of war and wisdom, peace and weaving. She is depicted as a virgin and the patroness/protector of the city of Athens. She is the daughter of Zeus with no mother. Her Roman equivalent is Minerva. In “Eternals, Thena can form weapons out of cosmic energy and uses spears, staffs and a shield. She contracts “Mahd Wy’ry” (pronounced like “mad weary” or “mad worry”) and wants to attack her fellow Eternals. This is a type of Eternal madness caused by the extreme accumulation of knowledge from centuries of living. The usual cure is to erase the memories, but because this set of Eternals doesn’t want Thena to lose her self, they opt to allow Phastos to care for her as he is able to calm her down to a certain extent. The movie begins with two paragraphs of exposition (“In the beginning…”) that explains that there were Eternals who came from the Planet Olympia under the guidance of the Celestials. The Celestials have charged the Eternals to keep the Deviants from taking over planets.  The Eternals are in contact the Celestials through the Celestial named Arishem the Judge (voiced by David Kaye. Only the leader of the Eternals, Ajak (Salma Hayek), who has a golden sphere that rises from inside of her chest at certain times, is able to make direct contact. She has always had complete faith in Arishem and never doubted their mission until recently. In their big long block of a black spaceship, the Eternals arrived on Earth. One of the first things they introduce is bronze weapons, ushering in the Bronze Age but the Eternals only do so after killing the Deviants who were attacking the primitive tribal peoples. That defensive battle is when Sersi first meets Ikaris and emotional sparks begin to fly. Jumping to Present Day London, Ikaris is nowhere to be found. Sersi (Gemma Chan) is late and her current crush, Dane Whitman (Kit Harington), is trying to distract the students gathered at the museum. Sersi begins to talk about apex predators which are required to balance an ecosystem when the world, including London, is hit by a series of earthquakes. I don’t know where you are, but in California, we had an earthquake (3.9) the day before the screening. Earthquakes are common in California, but uncommon in London. Later, Sersi, and Dane are at a birthday party and Dane wants to move their relationship forward. No, he’s not proposing marriage. Dane wants her to move in, but Sersi hesitates. He wonders, “Are you a wizard like Doctor Strange?” Sersi isn’t a wizard, but she can’t bring herself to tell her man that she’s much older than he thinks, by a couple of thousand years. And when you don’t die, you think you have all the time in the world. That’s true for Eternals, but not for humans. Sersi’s gal pal, Sprite (Lia McHugh) quips, “He won’t live forever.” And then, the Deviants rise out of the River Thames.  Sersi and Sprite are soon joined by Ikaris (Richard Madden) to fight them off. That forces Sersi to explain to Dane (and the audience) that she and the other Eternals came to earth seven thousand years ago. In this post Thanos-snap world, that makes Dane wonder why the Eternals didn’t rise to help out the Avengers. Good question. The Eternals have something in common with the universe of Star Trek. Arishem had given them a prime directive: Don’t interfere unless the Deviants are involved. Now Dane gets some back story about Sersi and her “pilot” love. They, Sersi and Ikaris, were together for five thousand years, but Ikaris left her and she moved on. More on that romance later. In a flashback to 575 BC Babylon, the Eternals are a unified team. Yet Ajak (Salma Hayek) and Sersi feel there is something special about the planet Earth, but they still respect the grand design of their directive. The script suggests that Phastos is somewhat clueless because he’s interested in introducing the steam engine, but Ajak feels it is too advanced. Under Ajak, the Eternals decide to give humanity the plow. Sersi is content helping to tend the fields and even use her celestial powers to water the plants. There she and Ikaris fall in love. In 400 AD during the Gupta dynasty in Northeastern India, they marry. Back in the present, Sersi, Sprite and Ikaris head to South Dakota. On an expansive farm that seems to grow nothing, they find the dead Ajak on the ground outside with her arms at her side as if she fell asleep after fighting the Deviants. There’s not doubt the Deviants killed her, but her home seems strangely untouched. CSI and NCIS fans will want to examine this scene more closely, but we won’t stay in the present for long. Flashing back to 1521, the Eternals reach a breaking point when they witness Hernando Cortéz in Tenochtitlán, conquering the Aztecs after a three-month siege. The Eternals are conflicted because, “This isn’t war; it’s genocide.” Druig is the most vocal opposition to non-intervention. During this battle, Thena shows the first signs of her mental illness. The Eternals separate and somehow integrate into human societies of their choosing. We learn (but don’t see) Sersi and Ikaris were together until Macedonia where he abandons her, perhaps tired of moving every five years to keep their immortality a secret. Back in the present-day, there’s more globe-hopping involved in gathering the Eternals together. Kingo has pretended to be his own son (grandson, great grandson and great great grandson) for generations in order to build a Bollywood acting dynasty and has a valet, Karun (Harish Patel), who at one time thought he was a vampire. Their relationship is humorous and I wish this had been further explored. The Eternals finally converge in Australia where Gilgamesh and Thena have a homestead. Gilgamesh fixes a hearty meal and the Eternals discuss how to take on the Deviants and who should lead them now that Thena is dead. As you can probably guess, Sersi ends up being the leader, but not without opposition from her former love, Ikaris. How Sersi and Ikaris end their conflict and how we get to Harry Styles as Eros/Starfox, are surprises I won’t spoil. There is, as you might expect from an MCU offering,  mid-credit and  post-credit scenes. The time jumping is jarring and prevents us from really seeing how these Eternals handle each major cultural evolution (and the possible setbacks) by just giving us brief glimpses of their final solutions. It’s like forgetting that sometimes the sights along the way are just as important as the final destination in a journey. If only a whole film had been devoted to one or two periods of time. Think of how much build up it took before the Avengers got together. To an extent, the film seems like a diversity diversion tour: we have to hit a geographically balanced history because surely there were other genocides and moments of ingenuity. The actors might be charming enough alone, but there’s no emotional depth between them. There’s a lack of charismatic physicality in so many aspects of this film, from the lack of adjustment time to their new environment and how their powers function within it, to even their fighting styles and turns at dancing.   Sorry Kumail Nanjiani, I loved your interaction with your valet, Harish Patel’s Karun, but the dancing was not convincing, particularly since Kingo has had centuries to perfect his moves.  Lauren Ridloff’s Makkari is the exception and watching her move and act is a joy, particularly since the director Zhao has chosen not to go slo-mo anywhere. My scientist husband tells me some of the physics are off (e.g. what would happen if someone ran fast on water), but I’ll complain about the lighting choices and the often static quiet, non-battle scenes in terms of blocking and frame composition. Can Chan carry a film? It’s hard to say with this film since there are failures on so many levels. On the level of costuming, Jolie’s costume makes it clear why Athena was one of the three goddesses that Paris judge in a fateful beauty contest. Yet her costuming doesn’t present the Eternals as a visually  cohesive team. Lastly, I can’t help thinking that in this #MeToo era, is it really wise to elevate the world’s oldest and best known serial rapist to hero status? “Eternals” premiered in Los Angeles on 18 October 2021. I saw it in IMAX. Its theatrical release will be on 5 November 2021 and the film is part of MCU Phase Four.",NEUTRAL
"Oct 27, 2021"," It’s odd to think how close we came to having two unique filmmakers adapt the biggest signature solo creations of Jack Kirby. Sadly, the promising Fourth World adaptation with Ava Duvernay was not to be, ending my hopes and dreams for a year of pure Kirby dynamism dominating our eyeholes. But still, there stood Eternals, the lesser of the two properties by most measures. Eternals is still a fascinating pulp take on Erich von Däniken’s Chariots of the Gods – a premise that’s fueled movies like Prometheus, Stargate, and even that terrible Indiana Jones sequel nobody wants to talk about. And now, here we are, with a comic Kirby initially had no interest in tying into the larger Marvel Universe, retrofitted into the largest popular venue for Marvel characters that could ever possibly exist. Filtered through the mind of a newly-minted Oscar-winning director, it has a lot of appeal. Chloé Zhao is a brilliant filmmaker. Her 2018 effort The Rider haunted me, and is the closest we’ve come to an effort that could be spoken of in the same conversations as the grand cinematic experiment Close-Up. And of course, my appreciation of Nomadland is already on the record. But it’s hardly the resume of someone bringing to life earth-shattering figures, or producing the sort of Sturm und Drang that Tarsem Singh or Zack Snyder have made their bread and butter. That’s not to say Marvel hasn’t altered the trajectory of a number of indie darlings into the blockbuster space, but Zhao is such a known quantity, and her predilections seem so deeply at odds with the material as presented that it makes for a fascinating mixture. It’s hard not to feel like Eternals is designed to address many of the criticisms leveled at productions from the studio. For example: issues surrounding representation, or the fact that romantic entanglements are de-emphasized in these films, even down to the choice of Zhao in order to battle criticism that Feige and company aren’t interested in singular voices behind the camera. The only big complaint that goes unanswered is the MCU’s growing tendency for bloated runtimes. Which, unfortunately, is a big problem here. There’s simply far too much runway for the story being told. That’s too bad, because what is here is intermittently engaging. Zhao and her co-screenwriters tackle the enormity of the cast by wrapping it up in a Seven Samurai-style “getting the band together” structure, providing some level of hook by building in flashbacks to their past. As Ikaris (Richard Madden), Sersi (Gemma Chan), and Sprite (Lia McHugh), who are living fairly normal lives in the present day, are attacked by the long-thought destroyed Deviants. They realize they need to pull together their broken apart immortal and super-powered family, and as each member is introduced into the present day, we zip to some historical moment in the past that defines their character just enough to have any reason to care at all. It’s a big challenge, as I’ve long thought one of the biggest weaknesses of superhero movies in general is that only a select few of these heroes are multi-dimensional enough to carry their own big screen adventures. The Eternals are an even bigger quandary because they’re basically each defined by a singular trait or two. So, the job here requires a combination of compelling performances, scale, and momentum to get the job done over a nearly three-hour running time. It’s tough business. For a large amount of Eternals’ running time, you’re at least interested to see what happens next, but that doesn’t necessarily make it a successful movie. The Kurosawa structure comparison is apt, because in a way, this film plays a bit like an MCU take on Snyder’s approach for Justice League. There’s even powerset analogues for Superman, Wonder Woman, and The Flash, and a core antagonist that is about as dull. But beyond that, Zhao’s take on this team is that they are gods walking amongst us, much in the same vein as the derided (and then retroactively celebrated) Snyder movies. But unlike those takes on the DC pantheon, Zhao peppers in a lot of scenes of people sitting around tables and spouting off or weeping exposition at one another. I’ve never seen a movie where almost every sentence spoken at them requires being addressed by their name, but I’d bet if you did the math, 75% of the dialogue would have a name included in it. The grounding of these characters is an interesting approach. One would be tempted to call it another attempt at the Inhumans formula, but with far sharper writing and less horrible cgi. Yet what it really brings to mind is a reminder of Stan Lee’s attempt at retooling the Silver Surfer and making him completely and totally alien from Kirby’s original intention for the character. This is a full-fledged shot at making the Eternals “relatable”, and it works up to a point. …but Zhao also has to maintain the Marvel Studios structure, and that includes a lot of badly conceived second unit action. There are the aforementioned boring antagonists (the Deviants basically look like giant dogs with tentacles for some reason). And so many of these action beats are featured in environments so dark, it’s hard to make out what’s happening outside of pretty people making poses with shiny gold energy things. This becomes a detriment that no amount of tried and true borrowing from the masters is really going to fix, especially when the sludge colored finale exhaustingly unfurls itself. It’s that war between Zhao’s storytelling instincts and everything that is a prerequisite for the Marvel way of moviemaking that makes Eternals interesting to look at from a clinical perspective, but also highlights that really, maybe not every auteur needs to make blockbusters – particularly in an environment as creatively stifling as the MCU. Regardless, for sheer ambition alone, Eternals is better than any of Marvel’s Phase 4 offerings to this point. I’ve hated almost everything they’ve done post-Endgame, though, so it’s a very low bar to clear. From the looks of the trailers it seems the people involved in this movie have discarded most of what made Kirby’s book epic and thrilling. Apart from the Celestial it doesn’t even look like a Kirby creation. Kro and the deviants, truly chilling and tragic in the book are here reduced to run of the mill CGI fodder. How much of the source material has this filmmaker actually understood, or even read ? The same criticism, most of it, would apply to Snyder, so trying to ape him in hist misguided attempt at a JL movie is utterly stupid. Unless a comic-inspired project is helmed by Paul Dini/Bruce Timm, I’m out.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 27, 2021"," What seemed like the perfect marriage of filmmaker and studio, Oscar winner Chloé Zhao (“Nomadland”) and Marvel Studios, turns out to be one of, if not, the biggest misfires since the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) began. Zhao, a unique, more than qualified filmmaker can't reign in a narrative that bounces all over the place, spins in several different directions, and runs an eternal runtime of 2 hrs and 37 minutes. It’s a rare blemish for both creative entities, and not even an electric ensemble, decent special effects, and the first openly gay character in the MCU could steer this metal blob of a ship.  Not for lack of ambition, “Eternals” is trying to set itself up as perhaps the next cosmic Avengers now that Iron-Man and Steve Rogers are out of the picture. Zhao was put in the tough position of juggling a dozen characters while interweaving them into the greater fabric of the MCU. Certain performances get their chance to shine (Kumail Nanjiani, Gemma Chan and Brian Tyree Henry), others (Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, and Richard Madden) are left in the dust.  “Eternals” aims to unearth new events that have taken place within the MCU. This involves jumping between timelines throughout history including the Hiroshima bombing and the battle of Babylon in 500, BC in which the Eternals always stood idle, watching these moments manifest. The Eternals, we eventually find out, are immortal superheroes who have lived on earth since the dawn of creation. When asked why the Eternals, who from what the movie tells us are a strong bunch capable of anything, didn’t intervene when Thanos decided to wipe out half of humanity, the answer is less than satisfactory.  You see, the Eternals sole purpose is protecting human civilization from Deviants, which I guess are the only living thing our heroes can unleash their powers upon. Most of the Eternal gang struggle with an inner moral conundrum on whether or not to interfere with historical events considering they’ve seen a-lot of bloodshed and genuinely want to help. Which makes the whole “we couldn’t interfere with Thanos” excuse even more far fetched. As for their powers, few are noteworthy, even by Marvel standards. Ikaris can fly and shoot lasers out his eyeballs (one kid appropriately dubs him Superman though Madden has nothing on Henry Cavill); Ajak can heal, and Phastos creates new technology almost instantaneously. When the time comes for the inevitable Deviant throwdown, all these powers are so generic and lifeless, you don’t care who they belong to.  Zhao brings pedigree into the MCU canon, but the “The Rider” director can’t lock down a clear identity. “Eternals” is lacking a human and emotional component despite having one of the better MCU casts of recent memory. It doesn’t help that the film is constantly shifting and maneuvering between international locations and timelines, always thinking ahead (fans should be aware there are two post-credit scenes) but never taking a breather to establish a sense of camaraderie. Angelina Jolie is practically absent the entire movie, save for a couple punches during the bombastic climax, and Nanjiani, one of the funniest comedians working today, is never given a moment to highlight those chops.  It all comes down to world-building, something Kevin Feige and the brass at Marvel have perfected over the years. Sure enough, your knowledge of “Eternals” will probably help later down the line (which means, regardless of the quality, you almost have to watch to understand references), but for arguably the first time in the MCU canon, there’s an entry that takes audiences for granted. How can you ask viewers to stay invested in characters when their own film doesn’t? Fans will look past those flaws, understanding “Eternals” is but a stepping stone into a newer, brighter future. For Marvel’s sake, I hope they’re right. ",NEGATIVE

"Oct 27, 2021"," With only her third feature film, Chinese-born filmmaker Chloé Zhao made history. Earlier this year, her adaptation of Jessica Bruder’s book Nomadland: Surviving America in the Twenty-First Century saw her become the first female filmmaker of colour to win the Best Director Academy Award. Best known for her independent features, Zhao is tackling her biggest project yet – the latest installment in Marvel’s Cinematic Universe (MCU). Starring an ensemble cast that includes Gemma Chan, Salma Hayek, Angelina Jolie and Richard Madden, Eternals focuses on a group of beings that were created by Celestials to protect Earth. After secretly living on the planet for more than 7,000 years, its members reunite to safeguard humanity from the Deviants. We’re now, then, at phase four of the MCU and this is film 26. It’s weird to say there’s a first time for everything as after 13 years of practically the same formula, but Eternals breaks ground on various levels. Not only does it have Zhao at the helm, but the film features elements such as the MCU’s first on-screen gay kiss, love scene and deaf character (namely super-fast Makkari, played by deaf actor Lauren Ridloff), as well as its first female lead character of colour in Sersi (Chan). Similar to Marvel’s recent films, Black Widow and Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings, Eternals is another endeavour by Marvel to rectify the qualms of the Infinity Saga, which was mostly led and dominated by Caucasian male characters. Needless to say, its goal to further promote diversity in mainstream cinema stands out. However, this is fundamentally a Marvel film so audiences and fans anticipate a certain level of entertainment from an audience-winning blend of witty banter, dazzling visual effects, and empowering fight scenes. While Zhao tries to step up and take on a blockbuster film, there’s an evident clash of styles in Eternals that strays between mainstream and independent filmmaking. Amid the ambitious visual effects is an ever-expanding story that delves into Eternals' theme of humanity. Arriving on Earth in 5,000 BC, their mission – spearheaded by Eternals leader and healer Ajak (Hayek) – is threatened by their growing compassion for mankind, not to mention the fact that despite their powers, they cannot interfere in global disasters. One being the events in Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame. In fact, the group’s battle with human emotions results in some doubting the relevance of their top-secret mission and their practically blind loyalty to Arishem, an entity of a race previously mentioned in the Guardians Of The Galaxy films but strangely one that not many of Eternals have had direct contact with. Their emotions and divided loyalties only cause them to fracture all too easily, making us wonder whether this group of beings who have stood aside one another for thousands of years ever supported each other at all. In addition, the collaborative script comes across as dull and sporadically wooden, which affects both the resonance and appeal of the characters. Therefore, the film offers a melee of uneven performances, a notable lack of light-hearted moments, and an inconsistent and formulaic narrative that doesn’t warrant the Eternals' lengthy runtime of 157 minutes. Nonetheless, Eternals is a step in a new and refreshingly different direction while Zhao doesn’t hide behind its grandiose scale. While she puts her own touch on superhero films with her love of vast landscapes, she conveys the hardships of being a God-like being on Earth. Through weary eyes and compassion, the characters offer more personal depth to show that, like Captain America: Civil War, their fight is no longer just a clear-cut case of good versus bad. With everyone possessing an unspoken loyalty to someone else, this creates a complex story that capitalises on the characters’ growing friction. With the weight of Eternals on her shoulders, Chan anchors the film with grit and compassion, making Sersi an endearing character and a surprisingly considerate leader. It is no wonder that her on/off relationship with Ikarus (Madden) is a notable subplot, as the intense feelings between certain characters are tested in unforeseen circumstances. Although this causes the relevance of certain Eternals to be brushed aside (notably Barry Keoghan’s Druig and Brian Tyree Henry’s Phastos), this enables Thena (Jolie) and strongman Gilgemesh (Don Lee) to stand in the limelight, as the former’s tortured psyche tests her judgement in battle. However, standout performances from Eternal-turned-Bollywood star Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani) and his loyal assistant Karun (Harish Patel) offer occasional yet appreciated light relief, preventing Eternals from straying too far from its superhero roots. After 25 films, it can be hard to consider something new in the MCU and for the most part, Zhao’s efforts disappointingly do not reach the dizzying scales of previous Marvel films. However, what Eternals does offer is a bold yet epic vision that further reinforces a new creative direction in the franchise.

"Oct 27, 2021"," Back in 2019 I attended the D23 Expo and one of the most exciting announcements was Marvel’s upcoming film Eternals. How cool to see Angelina Jolie, Richard Madden, Salma Hayek and more coming out on stage to be in a Marvel movie with a female director! This was going to be awesome! Unfortunately I must admit to being completely underwhelmed and even frustrated by Eternals. It has some positive aspects of course but its main downfall is a confusing script with inconsistently written characters stuck in a timeline that makes it impossible to build momentum or tell a story that makes sense.  We don’t even have the ties to the MCU to help guide the new characters into the world (Wong for instance in Shang-Chi filled this role). Other people seem to have enjoyed it more than me. I don’t know what to to tell you but most of the film I had no idea what was happening. There’s lots of exposition explaining the rules of the emergence and celestials, for example, but when these events are happening the conversation explaining said event had been so long ago I had forgotten what it meant and was left wondering what was happening and why our characters were behaving in this way. It might help to watch this movie on Disney Plus when it is available and have a pen and paper to keep track of all the rules and what happens in each time period and how that matters. But should that be required of every movie? My friend seemed to keep track of details better than I did but my brain (I have some dyslexia and am more of a linear learner) struggles when plots are fragmented like they are in Eternals. It’s especially frustrating when they could have easily made different choices that would have made sense in the theater on the first watch. Another problem I had was with the characters. Because the timeline flips around over centuries we see characters at weak and high points but since this is out of order it’s confusing and makes it hard to invest in the characters. One character is a hero in a timeline, in another he or she betrays and even kills our heroes, and then he or she’s back to being a good hero and then final redemption. I love the Marvel heroes but these will have to be explained better in other movies because I did not get to know them hardly at all. Also their powers seemed completely random and some hardly useful for defending the world against deviants. All the actors in Eternals give good performances. The cinematography and visual effects are impressive. There are also grown-up moments that some may enjoy (Marvel’s first sex scene since Iron Man). I also appreciated the diversity and inclusivity but unfortunately it all sinks under the weight of a poorly written script and makes for a frustrating watch. If you like Eternals I am happy for you. Indeed, I am jealous because I wanted to have that experience. Please keep comments civil. Anything threatening or unkind will be deleted. Its a new story but its not that hard to catch up with they story. They literally explain themselves in the trailers about who they are and what they did and do before. I think we have to give it a try first. I’m getting a little tired of having to figure out ten million different timelines! It’s just not really my thing and like you I have difficulty following it all and keeping track. So I have a feeling this one won’t really be a favorite for me.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 27, 2021"," “In the beginning” read the first three words of onscreen text. You won’t find the next few in the King James. They come instead from a different kind of bible, an official handbook of back-issue backstory and trading-card statistics. After a decade-plus of superheroes with messiah complexes, the world’s biggest ongoing movie franchise has finally, officially found religion, adding literal gods to its ever-expanding roster of wizards, extraterrestrials, and wizardly extraterrestrials with the names (and skill sets) of gods. Eternals, the studio’s latest $200-million, two-and-a-half-hour extravaganza, offers an origin story of cosmic proportions: nothing less than an explanation for all of life in the universe, at least the Marvel Cinematic one. This is vintage Jack Kirby stoner shit. The famed artist, worshiped like a god himself in some circles, introduced the Eternals in the anything-goes 1970s. His idea was: What if the legends of Greek mythology were actually ageless superheroes, stationed on Earth for thousands of years, playing protector to the planet’s superstitious masses? That one of them can, effectively, turn water to wine implies that this cavalry of spacemen and -women may have been immortalized and deified as a few other holy figures in Earth’s storied history of organized belief systems. Not that Disney would explicitly go there. Eternals brings to the screen a whole team of them—a kind of ageless X-Men from the stars. Our entryway into their ranks is Sersi, the aforementioned manipulator of inanimate matter, who’s gained a real affection and respect for her charges over the millennia. (She’s played by Gemma Chan, who’s already appeared as a different character in a different Marvel movie. Are there now so many of these films that they have to start recycling cast members?) Sersi has an on-again, off-again, Sam-and-Diane thing going with the mightiest of her coworkers, Ikaris (Richard Madden), whose powers are so similar to Superman’s that some kid actually calls him Superman. That’s just a fraction of the call sheet. There are quite a few of these Eternals—too many even for a movie of this length. We also get Kingo (a newly ripped Kumail Nanjiani), who can throw bursts of glowing CGI energy and has spent the 20th and 21st centuries posing as a dynasty of Bollywood stars; perennially childlike illusionist Sprite (Lia McHugh); the deaf and Flash-fast Makkari (Lauren Ridloff); embittered mind-controller Druig (Barry Keoghan); blade-generating cipher goddess Thena (Anjelina Jolie); tech/weapon support Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry); resident puncher Gilgamesh (Don Lee); and wise, maternal team leader Ajak (Salma Hayek). Eternals leaps around in time, flashing back from present day to scenes from 7,000 years of history; some half-a-century after 2001: A Space Odyssey, blockbusters are now counting on audiences repeatedly following the eon-spanning shift from thrown femur to spacecraft. Where were these heavy-hitters when the Avengers needed them, a casual viewer might wonder. The film addresses that, awkwardly shoehorning in talk of franchise brethren. Turns out the Eternals have a pretty narrow jurisdiction: Their bosses, towering space gods called Celestials, have deployed them to our blue marble only to deal with a rampaging species of generic, sinewy beasties called Deviants, which seems like a rather inefficient use of superheroic resources. (Deviants are not to be confused with Variants, another recent addition to the MCU canon; Marvel might need to start issuing a glossary with every ticket sold.) The director and co-writer this time is Chloé Zhao, making an astronomical leap in budget and scope from her last movie, the Best Picture-winning drama Nomadland. Prerelease buzz centered on the supposed real-world tactility she was said to have brought to this series of rotating green-screen backdrops. Indeed, Eternals has some nice, pretty vistas. It also has an actual (albeit very brief) sex scene, adding a touch of fleeting carnality to a weirdly sexless movie world of virginal super soldiers and chaste romances, and a tone marginally more solemn than the average MCU multiplex-filler, appropriate for a story that literally spans the annals of human existence. Yet Eternals proves, maybe once and for all, that who’s behind the camera of these quality-controlled blockbusters may not matter so much. What’s the difference in shooting a real landscape and just generating one on a laptop if it’s going to serve as wallpaper for another round of visually undistinguished comic-book combat? As an action movie, Marvel’s latest offers more of the weightless digital same: variably convincing avatars of the actors darting across ashen beachfronts, tossing fireballs and tendrils. Where Nomadland evinced a clear Terrence Malick influence in its fluid, butterfly-in-the-wind camerawork and cutting, Eternals occasionally suggests what The Tree Of Life might look like with Kevin Feige micromanaging the awe and wonder over the filmmaker’s shoulder. However singular Zhao’s sensibilities, they’re no match for the uniformity of Marvel’s previsualization protocol. The bigger problem here may be that the characters seem a little previsualized, too. Despite the depth of the ensemble (and the acting talents assembled to bring it to life), these Eternals really only come in three varieties: brooding, quippy, and both. It’s difficult to imagine any of them spinning off to a solo vehicle. Last summer’s similarly themed The Old Guard could be something of a drag, but there was a logic to its mopiness: Endless life would lose its appeal after a few centuries, wouldn’t it? Eternals flirts with the melancholy and the neurosis that countless lifetimes of service might instill in its eponymous supergroup, only to essentially conclude that thousands of years on the planet just turn you into, well, a second-string Avenger. The plot ends up amounting to a kind of big-budget Big Chill, as the Eternals slowly reassemble after a death in the family. Zhao keeps it moving along, across continents and ages and passages of breathless expository information, without ever transcending the pro forma MCU storytelling template. It’s distinguished this time mostly by tonal gearshifts that might give even thick-necked Thanos whiplash: In between jokey scenes of demigods addicted to cell phones and the usual sitcom interpersonal conflict, these characters wring their hands about genocide and free will. They also pop into the fresh atomic ruins of Hiroshima, in a scene that rivals X-Men: Apocalypse’s field trip to Auschwitz in the arena of questionably tasteful historical revisionism. A decade ago, the idea of a big-screen treatment of these particular superheroes would be inconceivable. While the Eternals may be among the most literally godlike characters in the whole Marvel catalog, their book also qualifies as decidedly obscure source material; no one would call them household names. Yet Eternals never truly taps into its nutty, ’70s-prog-rock potential, from a visual or a narrative perspective. It’s probably good for business that Marvel can cram one of its weirder, more out-there properties into a one-size-fits-all formula for success. But when even the story of ancient, planet-sized gods and their undying servants comes out looking like just another Marvel movie, one might be forced to conclude that the studio is starting to leave the eccentric pleasures of its comic-book universe on the page.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 27, 2021"," Since the start of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) in 2008 with Jon Favreau’s Iron Man, the once indie studio Marvel Studios went on to create possibly the most elaborate series in cinema history as it slowly built up a mythology across 23 films, including its end Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019), which they called the Infinity Saga. When you’ve watched your heroes battle a foe so strong that there are theories wondering if Chris Evans’s Steve Rogers only survived 2018’s Infinity War thanks to the last minute use of the Time Stone by Thanos (Josh Brolin), the question becomes: where do we go from here? The Avengers, as audiences know them, are basically no more: Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is dead, Natasha (Scarlett Johansson) is dead, Steve is too old, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is off-world with the Guardians, and Hawkeye’s (Jeremy Renner) likely retired. The only thing left to do is start over, which is why, more than any other Phase Four film, director Chloé Zhao’s (Nomadland) Eternals feels like a Phase One film, starting from scratch so as to plant the seeds of conflicts to come. Though it lacks the emotional heft of Phase Four starter Black Widow (2021) or the infectious energy of Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021), Eternals presents an opportunity, not just for new adventures, but for a new way of presenting these stories. Hold tight, true believers, this isn’t the film you expect from the MCU, but it may just be what you need. L-R: Kumail Nanjiani as Kingo, Lauren Ridloff as Makkari, Don Lee as Gilgamesh, Angelina Jolie as Thena, Richard Madden as Ikaris, Salma Hayek as Ajak, Gemma Chan as Sersi, Lia McHugh as Sprite, Brian Tyree Henry as Phastos, and Barry Keoghan in Marvel Studios’ ETERNALS.

In 5000 B.C.E., a small team of eternal superhumans led by Ajak (Salma Hayek) arrived on Earth for the sole purpose of protecting the population from a species of predators known as Deviants. Sometimes this means offering the populace tools to protect themselves, sometimes this means intervening, but this 10-individual team is ordered by the Celestial they serve, known as Arishem (voiced by David Kaye), to never interfere in the lives of the people unless a Deviant is involved.

All Rights Reserved. Zhao’s Eternals is unlike any MCU film before it. This isn’t hyperbole, it’s the simplest way to describe it. It’s somber, thoughtful, and more concerned about characters than it is in action or explosions. The conflict is interpersonal and weighted, the fallout uncertain and from whence the potential of Phase Four becomes unimaginable. While I didn’t find the cinematography to be particularly magnificent, returning MCU cinematographer Ben Davis (Captain Marvel; Doctor Strange; Avengers: Age of Ultron) eschews the typically bright colors for something more natural and earthy in tone. This means that even the costumes the Eternals wear, while singular in color to help convey that each member is unique in their own way, aren’t garish in the slightest. This may upset those who hoped for something a little more in the vein of creator Jack Kirby’s artistic style (seen in Doctor Strange (2016) and Thor: Ragnarok (2017)) who crave that vibrant ‘70s style. The choice, though, to lean in to natural colors emphasize the themes of connection and harmony that runs throughout the film. It also supports the way in which Phase Four seems to be shifting toward grounding the stories even further than they’ve ever been. Considering the stories on deck — Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021), Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness (2022), Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023) to name a few — and the ways in which these films are expected to explode the status quo by introducing the multiverse, Phase Four is going to need grounding in order to not lose the thread of what makes these stories so accessible.

Don’t mistake Eternals as shaking off the MCU essentials, there’re plenty of CG-laden sequences and quite a few fisticuffs, but the feel of it is less masculine-driven which imbues the film with an unseen sensitivity. When one considers that, of all the team members, it’s Gemma Chan’s (Captain Marvel) Sersi with her powers of transmogrification who takes the lead as the audience’s proxy, the vision of the film becomes quite clear. This isn’t to suggest that it’s Sersi’s femininity which instills the film’s general vulnerability, but her ability compared to other’s on the team. Unlike, say, Angelina Jolie’s Thena (warrior ability), Ma Dong-seok’s (credited as Don Lee) Gilgamesh (increased strength ability), Kumail Nanjiani’s Kingo (blaster ability), Sersi’s is distinctly defensive with the capability of gentle offense. This requires solutions to come not from the usual third act claptrap, but something more creative. Thus, we’re offered a final confrontation that’s far more personal and intimate even though the stakes are global. Thus far, only the Ant-Man films have managed to contain their conflicts and, while the future of Earth may be in the balance, the conflict itself is approached in a more intimate-manner. This results in a fight that possesses more than all of humanity in the balance, but something that matters for the Eternals themselves. The aforementioned Doctor Strange and Ragnarok are the closest comparable two to Eternals in that the confrontation isn’t about fixing or resetting to zero, but offering a solution at a cost. It’s both a bold move for a studio which is deservedly accused of “cookie cutter” character arcs and story acts and it’s also what makes this film feel so very Phase One: the possibilities of what’s to come are inconceivable at this time. This alone adds an extra bit of invigoration audiences haven’t had in the MCU since the end of Infinity War.

Given that this one features 10 central characters, it doesn’t so much pad its runtime as it requires a certain amount of patience in the storytelling in order to fit them all in and give them agency. This aspect is successful, but it’s hard not to notice just how long you’ve been sitting there. The trick is, I wouldn’t know where to cut. Eternals only works because of the character work, so we need to spend time with them, yet there’s so much pensive pondering and infighting that require setup and resolution that the actual fisticuffs start to feel like a nice break from the conversation. (It’s a weird feeling to have.) Luckily, the fights are well choreographed so that each altercation possesses the weight of uncertainty regarding who may or may not be injured. Unlike prior MCU films, Eternals doesn’t posture as to the invulnerability of its leads, which makes the choices the characters make feel far more weighted and dangerous in the execution. Add in the fact that the few times we see Arishem, the scale of him turns any Eternal into that of an ant. Previously, audiences have either seen Celestials via Eson the Searcher in Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 1 (2014), which suggested a height akin to Godzilla or taller or Ego in Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2 (2017), the consciousness that formed a planet around itself, so Arishem is something else entirely, which the script effectively uses to instill both awe and terror at once. Of all the things in Eternals which will appear more effective in a theater versus at home (setup depending, of course), it’s any scene involving Arishem. Phase One stories had the benefit of telling individual stories that slowly built the universe as we know it. Oddly, this film, of all the Phase four films we’ve seen, uses characters that are the least known (this will obviously change given the talented cast who brings them to life) to not only create the cinematic foundation moving forward but to change almost everything we thought we knew in the process. Doing so requires patience and that’s not something the MCU typically allows when it’s got some bam-pow! to get to. This is laudable, but not likely to feel like a homerun from audiences at first. Zhao’s Eternals may very well be the first way-homer of the MCU, garnering appreciation with both time and contemplation.

With the intent of keeping my review spoiler-free there’s a great deal that I haven’t discussed and hope to do so in a future home release review. This is a film that, while imperfect, feels like a step forward into maturity for the MCU. I enjoy the spectacle that most of the MCU films are and their quippy one-liners, but, if that’s all they ever are, if that’s all the studio allows moving forward, then we, as an audience, will never rise above the end of the Infinity Saga in terms of emotional connection. There’s been talk of a rising sense of MCU fatigue between the high-number of television shows and films, the synergy exciting comic book fans yet creating a decreasing sense of scarcity that made them wondrous in the first place. Zhao’s Eternals may just set a precedent that could revitalize the MCU moving forward by leaning on its adult themes and new opportunities. This won’t be for everyone, that’s for sure. But it’s exciting nonetheless.",POSITIVE
"Oct 27, 2021","  The Marvel Cinematic Universe wades chin deep into a soap opera river of melodramatic tears. Eternals has a ""family"" of superheroes torn between love, loyalty, and duty in the latest save the world scenario. Oscar winning director Chloé Zhao treads sappy with a convoluted and drawn out exploration of relationships. She does deliver a few eye-popping action scenes, but they largely hinge on the strength of the film's best performance. Richard Madden is an absolute beast. Channeling his Superman-esque powers between bouts of sobbing.   Celestials are an ancient race of near omnipotent beings that foster the growth of life in the universe. They created the immortal Eternals. Then imbued them with supernatural abilities to hunt Deviants, ferocious creatures that feed off life's energy. The Eternals were sent to Earth at the dawn of civilization in Mesopotamia to stop the Deviants from devouring humanity.   Their leader, Ajak (Salma Hayek), can heal any wound and serves as the conduit to their Celestial guide, Arishem. Sersi (Gemma Chan) transforms elemental matter by touch. Gilgamesh (Don Lee) has the greatest physical strength. Druig (Barry Keoghan) has the power of mind control. Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), a deaf Eternal, runs at incredible speed. Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani) launches energy projectiles. Sprite (Lia McHugh), trapped in the body of a child, is a master of illusions. Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry) has a brilliant inventor's mind. Thena (Angelina Jolie) is a tenacious warrior that can craft energy weapons. And finally, there is the heavy hitter, Ikarus (Richard Madden), the most powerful Eternal by far, can fly, has super strength, and shoots devastating energy beams from his eyes.   The story begins in present day London with Sersi working as a teacher. The Eternals separated centuries ago after thousands of years together. Sprite pretends to be her young ward. She curses her youthful appearance, but they have both grown accustomed to living among humans. Their serenity is shattered by a Deviant attack. How were they targeted? They killed every Deviant on Earth. Sersi suspects that the ""Blip"", or the instant return of everyone Thanos vanished, may have resurrected their deadly adversary. Sersi and Sprite must unite the Eternals to again protect a cherished planet. But the bitter feelings and dark truths that divided them may be impossible to overcome.   Think of Eternals as the Fleetwood Mac of superheroes. A mixed gender group of once inseparable friends and lovers splinter apart. Then are forced back together on a final tour that reveals even more drama. Just like Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham, Sersi and Ikarus' love affair causes a lot of tension and jealousy. The film continually flashes back to various historical events when feelings went sour. There's nothing wrong with having a strong emotional undercurrent to the story. The problem is that it's overblown and marginalizes the supporting cast. Gilgamesh, Makkari, Thena, and Druig, who are all pretty cool in their own way, are bit players. They take second fiddle to an exhausting love affair that deflates the narrative.   Eternals represents a wide swath of cultures and lifestyles. Kumail Nanjiani's Kingo is a singing and dancing Bollywood star. Brian Tyree Henry's ""Phastos"" is openly gay with a husband and child. Lauren Ridloff's ""Makkari"" is hearing impaired. Chloé Zhao (The Rider, Nomadland), who also co-wrote the script, makes an effort to focus on inclusion and globalism. The film wants to show the different ways that the Eternals contributed to humanity's evolution. That's commendable, but becomes more filler material that dilutes. There's way too much going on in the two and a half hour runtime. Eternals drags tremendously. Zhao's vision overreaches except in the fleeting parts that are thrilling.   An MCU film rarely disappoints. Eternals is a step back. A dull second act crushes the pacing. Richard Madden's formidable screen presence is the lone highlight for me. Gemma Chan is unfortunately miscast as Sersi. Stick around during and after the credits. Eternals is a production of Marvel Studios. It will be released exclusively in theaters on November 5th by Walt Disney Studios.  Julian Roman has been with Movieweb for twenty years. An avid film buff, he watches nearly 200 films a year across every genre. He feels lucky to have interviewed and written extensively about Hollywood's greatest talents. In his spare time he plays guitar, treasures good company, and always seeks new adventures. It seems that for Netflix strong reviews and an Oscar winner in the cast is not enough to ensure a series making it beyond one season. ",NEUTRAL
"Oct 26, 2021","This film is massive on every level, both with its story and scale. At times, the narrative can come across as a bit messy, but its heart always shines through. Zhao has crafted something so different from the rest of the MCU.",POSITIVE
"Oct 26, 2021"," Chloé Zhao’s admirable effort to tell an intriguing morality play about the burden of godhood is hampered by all the CG business required of its cinematic universe. It’s funny to think about the mission creep that’s escalated within the Marvel Cinematic Universe since its debut in 2008 with the first Iron Man. Watching Eternals, you can’t help but wonder that all of this started, as Jeff Bridges once quipped, in a cave with a box of scraps. Now, with Thanos and the events of Eternals, the MCU truly delves into the cosmic — the vast span of space and time, and the very fabric of the universe at stake. And yet, the bigger and longer the MCU grows (heh), the more weightless it all feels; there’s heaps of ambition at play in Marvel’s latest, at least within the meager confines of Kevin Feige’s franchise stewardship, but its reach exceeds its grasp. Playing like a curious mix of Watchmen, The Big Chill and The Old Guard, Eternals takes a stab at the somber, following a group of immortal, godlike superheroes tasked with protecting the Earth from sinewy CG beasties called Deviants. “In the beginning,” as the film’s opening lines portend, they’re sent to the planet in ancient Mesopotamia, gradually insinuating themselves among early man to aid in their development. They’re happy to build myths around themselves (many of them are the implicit basis for everything from Greek gods to Superman to maybe even Jesus Christ) and encourage man to follow its potential — they’re only asked not to interfere in their conflicts.  But the centuries wear on them (and long after they’ve destroyed the Deviants, or so they think), they grow disillusioned with their charges’ selfishness and bloodshed, things they know they could change with the snap of a finger if not for their own rules. So they split up and spend a few hundred years living their own lives, falling out of touch. It’s only in 2021, when a series of massive earthquakes herald the return of the Deviants, and their matriarch Ajak (Salma Hayek) is found dead, that the Eternals begin finding each other again to figure out who did it, take down this new crop of Deviants, and find out the true nature of their mission on Earth. But for as much as cinematographer Ben Davies (filling in for Zhao’s partner and house DP Joshua James Richards, who merely gets camera operator credit here) shoots for the texture and warmth of real outside locations and the muted colors Zhao is known for, it can’t help but surrender to the Marvel sludge after a certain point. Dialogue scenes and individual moments sparkle with Zhao’s glint of contemplative wonder, but when the film has to stop in its tracks to let its cavalcade of heroes punch CG monsters (or each other) for 15 minutes, all hope of that individualism goes right out the door. It doesn’t help, of course, that the Eternals’ roster is more overstuffed than a Korean boy band, which makes it hard for any one player to stand out. Our window into the story is Sersi (Gemma Chan, dipping back into the MCU after Captain Marvel), the empathetic heart of the team who can transmute non-sentient materials. She’s trying to move on with her life after her on-again, off-again Eternal boyfriend Ikaris (Richard Madden), even shacking up with another Stark, normie English poetry teacher Dale Whitman (Kit Harington, waiting patiently in the margins for his own superhero movie to start) until Ikaris comes back to save her and rekindle their centuries-old flame. Their immortal love story hardly lights up the screen, even as Marvel sees fit to give Zhao the first sex scene in the MCU — even in their sensuous lovemaking in the tender light of the desert dawn, it feels oddly chaste and virginal, maybe because the two leads come off as more than a little robotic.  The rest of the ensemble fares a bit better, though the get-the-band-back-together structure (punctuated by flashbacks to their 7,000 years of history in everywhere from Babylon to South Dakota) means our characters have to battle for not just survival against the Deviants, but for screentime. There’s energy-blaster turned Bollywood star Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), about whom much ballyhoo has been made of his public transformation but who at least keeps the frenzied energy we’ve come to love about him; he’s easily the film’s highlight. It’s also relatively diverting to see Barry Keoghan, he of the Resting Villain Face, shake things up and play a good guy, the wearied mind-controller Druig.  Brian Tyree Henry’s openly-gay inventor Phastos does what he can to spice up some quintessentially creaky MCU jokes with his innate charisma, and almost pulls it off. Train to Busan‘s Don Lee is also endearingly winsome as the burly brawler Gilgamesh. Lia McHugh’s eternally-preteen Sprite has a Tinkerbell complex that offers some of the clearest exploration of the Eternals’ frustrations, and Angelina Jolie brings her effortless grace to Thena, a warrior queen teetering on the edge of madness.  It’s telling that there are very few characters apart from the Eternals themselves to drive much of the action: so much of the story revolves around their own anxieties or ambivalences around their mission on Earth, or the strain that centuries of existence can have on people who’ve run out of things to do. But as they begin to see the broader nature of their mission — one revolving around the Celestial beings who created them, and the ultimate fate of the Earth at the end of their watch — factions form about whether to let it happen, and what it might mean for their own lives. These are interesting questions, but Eternals can’t break from the Marvel shackles enough to truly ask them. (Its biggest reach comes with Phastos sitting among the ruins of Hiroshima, rending his garments about his culpability in the creation of the atom bomb, a questionable setting for your cosmic morality play to say the least.) In the end, the solution to their dilemma still boils down to another CG punch-em-up on an abandoned beach, actors straining to move in skin-tight lycra suits while the previz soup swims around them.  For a film about millennia-old space gods with X-Men powers created by one of the most psychedelic minds in 1970s comicdom (Jack Kirby), Eternals feels decidedly pedestrian, its flashes of naturalism still drowned in the usual Feige trappings. Zhao is one of my very favorite filmmakers, and I sincerely hope that the profile and money from this gives her the latitude to make a dozen more smaller, independent projects that give her the chance to, well, direct the whole thing.  Until then, Eternals evinces the same identity crisis the MCU has had since Endgame; how do you keep this truck a-movin’ after such a definitive final chapter to the story? Turns out, you just tell the same story again and again, but put a different shine on it and call it ‘cinematic’. Cord-cutting once carried the promise of reducing live TV costs, but with most services nearing a $100 per month, that statement checks less every day. That said, there is a handful of cord-cutting services with reasonable monthly prices. Below we list them. Maybe you’ve just seen Oppenheimer and have the strongest urge to marathon—or more fun yet, rank!—all of Christopher Nolan’s films. Or maybe you’re one of the few who haven’t seen Interstellar yet. If you are, then you should change that immediately; the dystopian epic is one of Nolan’s best, and with that incredible twist in ...  Which Netflix Country has Interstellar? For whatever reason, The Hunger Games series isn’t available in the same countries around the world. You’ll find the first and second (aka the best) installments in Hong Kong, for instance, but not the third and fourth. It’s a frustrating dilemma, especially if you don’t even have a single entry in your region, which is ...  Which Netflix Country Has Each Movie of The Hunger Games?",NEGATIVE
"Oct 26, 2021"," About the time my region went to sheltering in place to flatten the 2020 Covid-19 curve, I decided to try to revisit as many MCU films as I could in order of release to reassess where I was at with the engine that is driving the movie train these days.It turns out that Marvel films go down easy for me, but none of them — none of them — wear well on repeated viewing. There is a disposable nothingness to them that is hardly morally objectionable but nevertheless manages to make me crabby whenever a new one comes out. My hopes get up, I am entertained enough in the moment, but it never builds towards anything. Increasingly with films like Shang Chi and Black Widow, I find myself resisting any investment in the characters or story because I know that by the end of the movie nothing much will have changed except that I will be set up for the next movie.  Some might say — indeed I have said — that such is the nature of comic books or serials. There is some truth in this reply. What I find most wearisome about Marvel movies is the need that they be positioned as part of the “MCU.” Individual movies can be interesting, intriguing, different. But entries into such a franchise, like pop songs, must be superficially different yet essentially familiar. And that processed, manufactured sameness is a big part of what makes Marvel movies feel like consumer entertainment rather than works of are.  All that is to say that Eternals is the most I have liked a Marvel film in a long time, and I suspect if I return to it in two weeks’ or two months’ time I’ll find it as flat and tiresome as all the rest. It’s not that it has nothing to offer. It’s just that it gives up everything it has on a superficial first viewing. It helped that I don’t know these characters, so the movie offers up at least some discovery. But when we get to the inevitable post-credits tease for the next movie, introducing new characters, I got the sinking feeling that I knew everything there was to know about these established characters.  This movie also succeeds because it convinces me more than do most Marvel movies that the characters have meaningful choices to make. The ever-escalating threat of destruction (city/world/universe/all of time) that characterizes the Marvel evolution leaves no room for ambiguity. This is the first time in a while where the reasons the characters fought mattered at all, even a little bit. On the more annoying side, it is bloated as all Marvel movies are. The single most irritating thing to me about a Marvel movie is not just that these characters allegedly exist in the same universe as each other but that it is supposed to be the same universe we live in. Yet the implications of past events are never more than gestured at or alluded to, never more than retcon fixes. I wonder what a movie about the average human who lived in a universe that has had such things happen would even look like. The family of Hawkeye or Ant-Man or the Eternal living in Chicago with his boyfriend are the stakes they fight for, but the notion that a return to normalcy is even possible after such cataclysmic events is as colossal a failure of imagination or world-building as anything Left Behind has ever been skewered for. The world is just a stage, a backdrop, nothing more. It is supposed to be everything that the heroes are protecting and loving, but in reality, it is just their staging room, a place for them to eat shwarma between rounds of real living.  I don’t mind religious or cosmological analogies, but it’s not really possible to set the MCU in our world and yet portray our world as no different theologically (why are the calendars still BC/AD. I assume the existence of BC dates means that Christ existed in the MCU, though whether he was just an Eternal (changing water into wine or celestials into stone) or the only ancient myth that doesn’t have a historical basis must never be asked.  Which sort of raises the question, why make gnostic or even satanic (immortal creatures rebelling against the God/god that created them) analogies if your bottom line position is none of its real, anyway? What’s the point of extracting truth from myth if there if myths are always only distortions of historical events? Still, for an MCU movie, it’s better than average. I like Zhao’s direction, too. A lot of MCU movies come across to me as an average or above-average driver suddenly thrust behind the wheel of a muscle car, not really in control. I’m sure there are people who will be disappointed that this isn’t more….auteuristic….but confidence and competence go a long way in this genre. Was I entertained? Maybe a little, to the extent that I was diverted for 145 minutes from having to think about global warming or the extinction of the species or any existential threat that can’t be turned back by simply deciding to use our superpowers. Will I see the next one? Sure, probably. Will I think about this movie ever again except to stream it as background noise while I am playing Candy Crush on the Ipad? I think you and I already knew the answer to that one….",NEUTRAL
"Oct 26, 2021",Thank the cine-gods that Chloé Zhao was able to take all those innocuous prerequisites and create a film that is gorgeously photographed and focuses on the intimate moments between the characters allowing them to breathe.,POSITIVE
"Oct 26, 2021"," If, as some fans argue, superhero comics represent a modern, secular mythology, few properties better support this claim than Marvel’s The Eternals. The result of a decade-long attempt by legendary comic book artist Jack Kirby to tell a sprawling epic about warring gods, the series offers up a psychedelic creation story involving an alien species. In Kirby’s story, the universe was forged by giant, ageless beings called Celestials, who create humans along with superpowered demigods called Eternals and, in a mishap of genetic engineering, aggressive and highly efficient creatures called Deviants. Chloé Zhao’s Eternals does its best to simplify and rework the bedrock of the comic series into something that can reasonably fit into a standalone film. But it’s arguably impossible to introduce a team of superheroes who are unfamiliar even to casual comic book fans and establish the nuances of their long-standing relationship to human civilization and their overarching and underlining conflicts without resorting to one of the most exhausting exposition dumps in the Marvel Cinematic Universe to date. The film aspires to paint complex, emotionally nuanced relationships between its characters, often via flashback, but every time it does so, there are momentum-shattering effects on the narrative. To the credit of Zhao and her three co-writers, Eternals tries to differentiate its cast of characters in ways that go against the grain of the typical MCU style of flattening every hero into a sardonic, reluctantly responsible figure weighed down by daddy issues. These heroes even have an overriding streak of earnestness that runs counter to the glibness of most other Marvel movies: The empathetic Sersi (Gemma Chan) exhibits only tenderness toward humanity, and the Superman-esque Ikaris (Richard Madden) smolders with an intensity that feels far removed from the snark that the average MCU A-lister tends toward. Even the characters that are closest to the franchise’s usual mold of wisecracking, pop-culture-referencing cut-ups are complicated by underlying neuroses. Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), for one, uses his quips to mask his cowardice, while Sprite’s (Lia McHugh) own sardonic one-liners act as pressure releases for her agony at being trapped in a body of perpetual adolescence, cursed with eternal youth that withholds the pleasures of adult life. Still, Eternals suffers from spending much of its 157-minute runtime introducing us to characters that have little in the way of mainstream recognition. And for a film in which the heroes have only a few days to avert the destruction of Earth, a shocking amount of scenes consist of them sitting around tables talking out their less-pressing personal disputes. Kirby’s Eternals marked the culmination of his avant-garde artistic style, a bombastic showcase of electric colors, dizzying scale, and minutely detailed panels. Zhao’s film, by contrast, is defined by earthen tones, subtle grades of light and shadow, and a reliance on natural vistas over epic-scaled CGI spectacle. Its delicate compositions were shot by Ben Davis, who lensed Avengers: Age of Ultron and Captain Marvel, two of the most visually flat MCU films, but Eternals marks the first time that one such film has taken any interest in soaking up the beauty of a planet that its characters are always trying to preserve. That care extends to the action, which leans into pans and arcing camera motions over kinetic editing to capture the ebb and flow of battle between the Eternals and the Deviants. It’s a style remarkably similar to Zack Snyder’s approach to staging combat across his DC films. There’s a real weight to these superhumans’ movements, especially the speedster hit-and-run combat style of Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), that also feels indebted to Snyder’s conception of how such beings would defy mere mortals’ ability to fully process their speed and power. But the clean, lucid layout of the action scenes is such that it may make you wish that more of the film were given over to them and not the more sedentary conversations that propel the narrative. Zhao is genuinely trying to bring something new to the increasingly moribund Marvel formula, tackling philosophical and political ideas that have been sprinkled across the larger franchise but rarely approached with serious interest. This isn’t the first Marvel movie to throw in a narrative twist that challenges the idea that the heroes are unambiguously working for the good of the universe, but Zhao takes more time than others to study how such a revelation might shock characters who’ve never questioned their impact on the world. Marvel’s well-publicized cooperation with the United States military has worked to undercut the studio’s critiques of state power in such films as Captain America: Winter Soldier and Black Panther. Which makes it all the more remarkable to follow the arc of the Eternals’ engineer, Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), whose centuries-long quest to aid humans in their technological development ends with him standing in the ashes of Hiroshima, utterly disgusted with the atrocity that mankind could so callously unleash with his gifts. And yet, at every turn the formula that Eternals seeks to challenge only reasserts itself, as the film is constantly given over to exposition and, with a few notable exceptions, ultimately absolving its characters of the fraught revelations of their culpability in the evil that threatens the world. At once bloated and rushed, Eternals suffers from frequent lurches in tempo that dispel its occasional moments of tranquil thoughtfulness by rehashing plot information ad nauseam until the simplest of details start to feel convoluted. Where Synder’s Justice League displayed a far greater grasp of the grandeur of Kirby’s work, Zhao ultimately robs the artist’s comic of its sweep by constantly turning a space opera into a repetitive character drama, one where demigods with the fate of the world in the palm of their hands spend far too much time sitting around a table attempting to work out their own personal issues.

"Oct 26, 2021"," Chloé Zhao’s introduction to the Marvel Cinematic Universe was an exciting announcement for both fans of Marvel and the director. After a Best Director Oscar win for Nomadland, the potential of a filmmaker of her caliber headlining a Marvel film was an ambitious change from the norm. Long-known as a producer-driven franchise, with Kevin Feige leading at the helm of the juggernaut, Zhao’s directing style served a breath of fresh air. With Eternals, Zhao’s directing sensibilities are indeed the highlight of the film. The characters of Eternals are just as different from the MCU norm as the directing style. With a cast featuring names like Gemma Chan, Richard Madden, Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, each character is written with a serious undertone. Where many Marvel superheroes feel like variations of Tony Stark, full of sarcasm and wit, the Eternals are somber, subdued, and tragic. Of the cast, Gemma Chan stands out as Sersi. Ironically her second role in the franchise, Chan makes the most of her role as the lead and centers herself as one of the few three-dimensional characters in the cast.  Playing on screen as a type of Justice League-lite, with characters like Ikaris, Thena, and Makkari coming off as a bootleg Superman, Wonder Woman, and the Flash at times, Eternals doesn’t properly establish each of them as truly unique outside of their powers. Still, the cast work well with each other, and the chemistry is strong enough to keep viewers engaged.  Overall, Eternals is arguably one of Marvel’s most beautiful film from a visual perspective. Chloé Zhao’s directing is the highlight, with a technical filmmaking style stronger than other directors in the franchise. Still, inconsistent writing and a shaky thematic core prevent it from truly reaching its own potential. ",NEUTRAL
"Oct 26, 2021","  When did Marvel become a mood ring? Early on, their movie multiverse was mostly helmed by amiable experts-for-hire (Jon Favreau, Kenneth Branagh) in a sort of soylent superhero style more notable for its general competence than flair. Then came the auteurs and their looser, bolder takes: Taika Waititi's gleefully loopy Thor: Ragnarok; Ryan Coogler's culture-smashing Black Panther; Destin Daniel Cretton's breezy, balletic Shang-Chi and The Legend of the Ten Rings. But Eternals is the first to be overseen by a recent Oscar winner still fresh off her own watershed: Chloé Zhao, who became the only woman of color (and second female overall) to ever take home the Best Director prize, for last year's sparse, elegiac Best Picture winner Nomadland.
  It's a long way from Frances McDormand in a van to the center of the MCU, and no mere mortal is stronger than a $20 billion franchise; Eternals (in theaters Nov. 5) still molds itself faithfully to Marvel form — the winky banter and convoluted origin myths, exotic scene-setting (London! Hiroshima! Ancient Babylon!) and clanging third-act showdowns. But Zhao's imprint is also hard to miss in the movie's steady thrum of melancholy and its deeper, odder character arcs. Her sprawling cast's superhuman powers tend to belie their extremely human traits: They fight, fall in love, and fall prey to their own egos; some have serious day jobs and even non-Eternal husbands (or at least Brian Tyree Henry's Phastos does).
  Being stuck on Earth for a few thousand years, maybe, will do that; how could anyone embed that long with the natives and not have some of it rub off? For the first time too, the heroes actually look — improbably gorgeous symmetry aside — a lot like the world they're meant to protect: a panoply of skin tones, sexualities, and physical abilities. Many have already noted that the movie marks the series' inaugural inclusion of a Deaf superhero (The Walking Dead's Lauren Ridloff) and same-sex screen kiss (between Henry and Haaz Sleiman, the actor who plays his handsome architect spouse). It also happens that the group's leader, Ajak (Salma Hayek), is portrayed by a Latin woman in her 50s (give or take several millennia), and that the heart of the movie is Gemma Chan's Sersi, a gentle, self-effacing empath who only seems to use her powers because she has to.
  Bodyguard's Richard Madden plays her erstwhile lover, Ikaris, a soulful troubled type idolized by the elfin shapeshifter Sprite (Lia McHugh). A Valkyrie-blond Angelina Jolie swings her movie-star weight as the rampaging warrior-goddess Thena, and Kumail Nanjiani famously bulked up to play Kingo, a sunny bachelor who makes elaborate Bollywood musicals in his spare time and shoots cosmic projectiles from his hands like an electrified Spider-Man. Dunkirk's Barry Keoghan lurks as the mutinous mind controller Druig, while Don Lee floats in and out as Gilgamesh, an affable elder and keeper of the volatile Thena. Granted time off for good behavior and general peace times, they've been scattered across the globe for centuries when the call comes in to reunite; the threat, naturally, is no less than the annihilation of mankind, and the enemy are Deviants — ornery beasts that look like skinned dinosaurs and cut a swath of city-burning, people-eating chaos wherever they go.
  Zhao, who co-penned the script with several credited screenwriters, moves through her assorted story lines in a way that seems almost deliberately unrushed, stopping often and leisurely for extended character moments: Kingo's thriving side hustle as a self-made movie mogul, Sersi's ongoing romance with a remarkably understanding civilian (Game of Thrones' Kit Harington), Sprite's longing to be set free from the prison of her perpetual adolescence. The looping flashback structure and relaxed, intimate pacing has the odd effect of making the fate of the free world feel a lot less urgent than it probably should; the movie frequently comes off less like a standard MCU tentpole than a metaphysical family drama whose black sheep just happens to be Thanos.

"Oct 26, 2021"," Cosmic Marvel is where things get creative. It’s the space in the Marvel cinematic universe where formulas get altered, the stakes get raised, and things get weird. It’s separate from the mainline stories of Captain America and Iron Man to swing for the fences and do its own thing. And to that point, Eternals smashes the Marvel formula to bits and never looks back. Eternals is the latest film in the MCU by Academy Award-winner Chloé Zhao. Directed and co-written by Zhao, the film is co-written by Patrick Burleigh, Ryan Firpo, and Kaz Firpo. But to top all of it off, Eternals has the most star-studded cast of an MCU film to date with Gemma Chan, Richard Madden, Salma Hayek, Angelina Jolie, Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry, Ma Dong-seok, Lauren Ridloff, Barry Keoghan, and Lia McHugh. Eternals has a lot of heavy lifting to do. Not only is the film introducing a plethora of new characters into the MCU, but entirely new lore that extends so far that its existence is the foundation for life itself. In the film, a group of aliens known as the Eternals has been living on Earth in secret for thousands of years, beginning in Mesopotamia and onto the present day. Tasked with protecting humanity from the Deviants, the Eternals complete their job and wait for a call to return home. But when a global event begins, a Deviant appears, and a personal tragedy emerges, the group must reunite to save the world. Taking place after Avengers: Endgame, the first hurdle Eternals comes against is where were they? They’re as powerful as gods and are supposed to protect humanity, so everything feels like a plot-hole at first glance. That is until the film directly confronts that through exposition in multiple scenes that outline when the group can intervene and when they can’t. Placing limits on such powerful characters can be tricky, but this film clears it. On the note of exposition, Eternals somehow avoids feeling weighed down with too much talking. Instead, Zhao and company chose to show the audience what happened in the past to inform the present. Additionally, every moment of exposition has a real-world implication and feels like a narrative element versus an add-on. And with so much to explain and introduce, it’s stunning that Eternals manages to pull this off. With such a strong ensemble cast, it would be easy for the film to feel weighed down, with each star showcasing a charisma that overpowers each other. But that doesn’t happen here, no. In Eternals, each character carries a weight to them, a purpose, and each and every actor in the main cast compliment one another. While some choices are frustrating because I wanted more of certain characters, I can’t say that anyone was wasted, and that is no small feat with a cast this packed with talent. This success is as much a testament to the actors on screen as the film’s script. Yes, the dialogue is essential, with intimate and tender moments between characters weaving an empathic element into the lives of literal gods. But it has to be noted that some of the film’s most powerful exchanges have no words, only a connection that the actors could bring to life. There is romantic intimacy between the characters that comes from small touches, glances, foreheads against each other, and holding hands. However, romance isn’t the only connector between these characters. There are intimate moments of friendship and family that hit. In fact, there is an emotion and connection I haven’t seen in the MCU since Phase 1. None of the relationships, even their issues, feel toned down for a young audience. There is sex, there is love, there is anger, there is sadness, and every relationship in between. Truly, Eternals is the most adult MCU film in years, and it’s not because of sex. It’s because it trusts its audience to see a relationship fostered over thousands of years, warts and all. Eternals trusts its audience to see a relationship unrefined to the simplest emotions. Instead, it accepts that there are things we won’t know that happened between characters, lives lived that we haven’t seen, and as a film, it lets us live in them. This film trusts its audience with something more than formulaic companionship. We see this between Thena (Angelina Jolie) and Gilgamesh (Ma Dong-seok), Sersi (Gemma Chan) and Ikaris (Richard Madden), Makkari (Lauren Ridloff) and Druig (Barry Keoghan), and literally, every single one of them as they come together as a family. Additionally, connecting gods to humans with deep connections isn’t an easy feat, but the film does it expertly through Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry) and Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani). The emotion is also what makes the film’s action sequences grow beyond just the spectacle they bring. Each encounter builds on the last, and in the third act, we see a millennium of emotion released in cathartic and rewarding fight sequences. Not to mention, each power was expertly showcased with both its strength and its weakness, allowing each moment of action to feel dynamic. But where it excels with its main cast of heroes, Eternals’ biggest flaw is pushing too many antagonists and twists in one film. As a result, while the film’s narrative is filled with emotion and purpose, the villain elements overpower each other and clash. One would have been enough especially given the strong connections one particular baddie has with our heroes. Additionally, while I won’t call the film’s uniqueness a fault, Eternals doesn’t feel like an MCU movie in any way, which makes the name drops of existing characters almost feel out of place, breaking immersion ever so slightly. To get a little personal, I wasn’t sure how much of the MCU would feel like it would hook me. Sure, series like Wandavision and Loki have broken expectations and embraced strange sci-fi and adult elements with open arms. But the films have delivered much of the same, executing a formula that works but being formulaic nonetheless. But now, with Eternals, I have the next series within the MCU to hold on to. A visually stunning film, Eternals blows the doors off of Cosmic Marvel, creates its own path in the cinematic universe it’s situated in, and presents a world rich and vibrant with lore and emotion that I want to keep coming back to. The film may be long, but I wanted it to be longer and not in a negative way. I want to be in the world that Eternals created longer. I want more of the Celestials, of the characters, of the lore. I just want more Eternals, please.

"Oct 26, 2021"," Chloé Zhao was named the director of Marvel’s Eternals well before she would go on to win two Oscars at last year’s ceremony for Nomadland. Of course, there were some lovers of art house cinema baffled by the indie darling’s choice to make a movie for Kevin Feige’s Marvel machine. But Zhao taking on Eternals left one big question that wouldn’t be answered until the film started screening – Would Zhao be able to break through the Marvel mold and create something that stands out from the rest of the MCU? The answer is kind of. Eternals isn’t a complete disaster nor is it a home run. The style of Marvel and the style of Zhao don’t always meld in the rather busy, overstuffed Eternals. At times Zhao’s superhero epic is able to breakaway from the Marvel mold, but in the end the movie is still beholden to the broader MCU. In the universe there are beings known as Celestials, and they harness energy to create life and worlds across all of existence. The Celestial known as Arishem created the world as we know it, but creation was plagued by violent creatures known as Deviants. To protect life, Arishem send a race of beings known as the Eternals from the planet Olympia to Earth. Led by Ajak (Salma Hayek), the Eternals are tasked with protecting humanity from the Deviants. Among the Eternals are Sersi (Gemma Chan), who can change matter with a simple touch; Ikaris (Richard Madden), a powerful force capable of flight and shooting powerful beams from his eyes; Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), who also shoots some kind of projectiles; Thena (Angelina Jolie), the goddess of war; Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), an intergalactic engineer capable of creating incredible inventions; Sprite (Lia McHugh), a mystic capable of projecting various images; Gilgamesh (Ma Dong-seok, credited as Don Lee), a man of incredible brute force; Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), a mute with blistering fast speed; and Druig (Barry Keoghan), who can control the minds of mortal men. For millennia, the Eternals fight the Deviants and guide humanity from the shadows until the destruction of the Deviant threat causes these eternal beings to go their separate ways on the planet Earth. It’s easy to see the potential problems that could arise from Eternals by trying to summarize the basics of the plot. You have a robust cast of new characters with their own centuries of backstory and unique powers. Zhao takes the action between the past and present for much of the film’s first half, establishing what these characters were like then and where they are now. They’re called into action when the Deviants return to Earth and once again threaten humanity. So the Eternals are then reunited and it leads to a fair amount of the film’s bloated running time as these characters are now given multiple introductions throughout the first half. With so many characters, so much backstory, and no clear villain, it can be hard to see just where Eternals is going in its first half. The first half of Eternals is also very dry. The latest Marvel film lacks the constant humor that have become a trademark of the MCU. While it’s understandable that some people think the MCU films are a bit too jokey, the humor helps these films maintain a consistent tone of pop entertainment, and joking about the absurdity of the scenarios makes the absurd more digestible. It’s not until the Eternals reunite, starting with what Kingo has been doing with his life, that the film is really able to tap into the humorous aspects, and it’s from that point on that Eternals has a bit more levity and a brisker pace. Thematically, it’s obvious that Chloé Zhao is drawn to these characters as a means to explore not merely the burdens created by superpowers but the immense emotional strain of immortality. In the screenplay written by Zhao (credited twice thanks to a WGA process) with Patrick Burleigh, Ryan Firpo, and Kaz Furpo, thousands of years of their personal pain is examined as well as the pain of watching generations live and die from famine, war, and other maladies of the human condition. It shows that there is a level of ambition at play in Eternals but the constraints of the larger MCU and the sheer breadth of the film’s ensemble make it all but impossible to get into these themes with adequate depth. Helming her first action-packed blockbuster, Chloé Zhao delivers mixed results as an action director. Fight scenes featuring more close-ups aren’t nearly as stunning or effective as the action sequences that unfold in wider shots. While Eternals does eventually descend into a rather bombastic CGI finale, it’s not quite the same as recent MCU climaxes, meaning that while there’s plenty of CGI spectacle its not just a parade of anonymous baddies being dispatched en masse in a pixelated orgy of bloodless violence. The finale is kind of the Catch-22 that Zhao finds herself in directing a Marvel movie – these movies follow a successful formula and there’s only so far you can stray when hundreds of millions of dollars are on the line. With its vast roster of characters played by accomplished actors, Eternals at once gives some actors their due and shortchanges others. The big standouts are Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry, and Ma Dong-soek, each balancing the humor and pathos of their unusual eternal beings. Angelina Jolie and Salma Hayek bring a certain movie star steadiness to their characters but neither really hits their top form. Gemma Chan does a nice job anchoring the film as its de facto lead. However, her old flame played by Richard Madden really leaves their scenes with a massive charisma void. Madden just can’t carry the scenes he’s tasked with, and his onscreen chemistry with Chan mostly fizzles when compared to the relatively few scenes Chan shares with her human romantic interested played by Kit Harrington. It leaves Eternals with a number of likeable or inoffensive characters, but none with whom you can really connect with in any lasting way. In the end, Eternals embodies the good and bad that has run through the MCU since its inception. At once, it’s a piece of pop entertainment that touches on some interesting themes but can’t dare to fully follow through on going beyond the surface. It’s a film that shows a bit more ambition than its MCU brethren but is still reined in by the larger corporate gravity interested in keeping the box office receipts robust. Look, I think the MCU would be better suited if they did let their creative teams take more chances like Chloé Zhao attempts in Eternals. That being said, it’s important that Kevin Feige and his team actually let these movies follow through on their ambition and get really weird. Eternals merely hints at the grandiose space insanity of Jack Kirby. The MCU isn’t going to keep dominating pop culture if they keep playing it safe, and Eternals plays it too safe to really stand out from the pack. An ambitious comic book epic that tries to break the MCU mold, Chloé Zhao’s Eternals takes on a new roster of immortal heroes and a story that spans centuries but that ambition can’t break free from the constraints of the broader MCU. This here writing represents a symbol of Sean Mulvihill's individuality, and his belief in personal freedom. He's also a hack writer who drinks too much and falls in love with girls.",NEUTRAL
"Oct 26, 2021"," The Eternals are a group of heroes sent to Earth by the Celestials to protect primitive humans from creatures called the Deviants. Once they defeat the monsters, the heroes separate and blend in throughout the centuries shaping and influencing the progression of humans without interfering in their destructive nature. The ensemble cast includes Gemma Chan as Sersi, Richard Madden as Ikaris, Kumail Nanjiani as cosmic-powered Kingo, Lia McHugh as the eternally young, old-soul Sprite, Brian Tyree Henry as the intelligent inventor Phastos, Lauren Ridloff as the super-fast Makkari, Barry Keoghan as aloof loner Druig, Don Lee as the powerful Gilgamesh, with Kit Harington as Dane Whitman, with Salma Hayek as the wise and spiritual leader Ajak, and Angelina Jolie as the warrior Thena.  These superheroes grapple with not being able to stop man from destroying itself and whether humanity is worth saving. These themes are present throughout the script by Chloé Zhao & Patrick Burleigh and Ryan Firpo & Kaz Firpo. While the action is top-notch and entertaining, ETERNALS suffers from too much exposition. Zhao obviously didn’t want to make just another superhero flick and brings much deeper substance to the genre with meaningful themes about the fate of humanity and the universe. However, the exposition is often repetitive and covers similar issues when another Eternal is re-introduced as the group assembles to once again destroy the Deviants. Clearly, Zhao wanted each Eternal to have a character arc which is admirable but it often bogs down the movie and stalls when dealing with another character’s issue. Some of the questions posed by ETERNALS is very deep and meaningful. Brian Tyree Henry’s Phastos is disillusioned with humanity over its need to destroy each other. As an inventor of the group, his character grapples with the guilt of having helped in the creation of the atomic bomb. Or Druig (Barry Keoghan) whose power is controlling minds, is annoyed he can’t simply control humans and stop wars. Zhao ponders some meaningful issues in the ETERNALS, but it often feels like the themes are hitting you over the head. A large chunk of Act 2 is rather dull and repetitive. MCU films often deal with these sorts of themes but in a more subversive way. In the MCU timeline, ETERNALS takes place post blip but the film starts from the very beginning when the Eternals arrive on Earth and their early years living among the humans. Then the film fast-forwards to the present day but Zhao often flashbacks to an earlier time which is often jarring and takes the viewer out of the moment. While there’s no shortage of good action sequences, Act 3 is when the party really gets going when tension among the Eternals makes it the most compelling part of the MCU film. The Eternals’ powers are unique to the MCU and thus watching the superheroes in action is quite exciting. Richard Madden’s Ikaris is by far the coolest Eternal with his Superman abilities to fly and shoot lasers out of his eyes. Gemma Chan’s Sersi is the heart of the movie in her quest to save the human race. Angelina Jolie takes a back seat as a supporting character yet effective warrior as Thena. Every actor leaves an impression. ETERNALS is the most mature MCU film with themes that children may not understand but it’s got plenty of action to entertain the tiny humans. ETERNALS could have easily been a tighter film with much less exposition but it’s clear the director didn’t want to sacrifice character development which is admirable. As with most superhero flicks, stick around for the end credits when two huge surprises will inform you of the direction the MCU is headed. The word is out about one of the spoilers thanks to a reporter at a Hollywood trade publication spilling the beans on Twitter. When Kevin Feige said to expect a different kind of MCU movie, he meant it. ETERNALS is a Chloé Zhao production with beautiful imagery and meaningful themes behind a superhero film that leaves you pondering the same questions about whether we as a race are worth saving.",POSITIVE
"Oct 26, 2021"," Marvel’s Eternals could have been deliberately constructed as an answer to the company’s critics who complain they make the same movie over and over again. If nothing else, Eternals does try some new things. Long stretches owe more to 2001: A Space Odyssey and Prometheus than The Avengers. The film introduces an elaborate new mythology of ancient gods, aliens, and monsters to the existing Marvel Cinematic Universe. Some of that mythology features interesting ideas — most taken directly from the original Eternals comics by Jack Kirby — about the connections between superhero fiction and religious iconography. But every scene is burdened by an uneven cast and a leaden script crammed with millennia of backstory that repeatedly kills the story’s momentum. That’s a particular disappointment because Eternals is director Chloe Zhao’s followup to the outstanding Nomadland, which earned her Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Director earlier this year. Zhao is about as good a director as has worked for Marvel, but Eternals utilizes almost none of her strengths, which, as evidenced by films like Nomadland and The Rider, involve crafting profound character studies about troubled outsiders seeking their place in the world. On paper, that could describe the Eternals, who are powerful immortals sent to Earth by alien gods known as Celestials in the year 5000 BC. Since then, they have guided humanity from the shadows, helping their technological advancement and protecting them from another race of aliens known as the Deviants. Zhao’s earlier, superior films were intimate and nuanced. Eternals skims through the lives of ten characters across centuries.The things that made her indie movies special — their authenticity, their textures, their attention to detail — didn’t translate to massive blockbuster filmmaking where, even in a 150-minute movie, there’s not enough time to bring these people and their relationships to convincing life. Even more frustratingly, Zhao chose to focus her attention on the two least interesting Eternals. That’s Sersi (Gemma Chan), who can transmute objects, and Ikaris (Richard Madden), a more traditional superhero type who can fly and shoot beams of energy from his eyes, which he does roughly 60,000 times in this film. For eons, Sersi and Ikaris were in love. In the present day of the MCU, they are broken up, and all of the Eternals have separated under mysterious circumstances. When a new wave of Deviants threatens Earth, Ikaris seeks out Sersi in London, where she’s working as a museum curator and professor and dating a mortal named Dane Whitman (Kit Harington). The tortured romance between Sersi and Ikaris should be Eternals’ emotional core, but despite Ikaris’ remarkable energy powers, Madden generates zero sparks with Chan. That includes their big love scene, a first for Marvel Studios and truly one of the most lifeless depictions of sex in recent mainstream cinema. (Maybe because they’re ancient space gods and don’t know how to have sex? I’m trying to think of an excuse for it, and that’s the best I can come up with.) Chan has a stronger connection with Harington, but he’s got a small role, at least in this particular Eternals. (As always with Marvel, there is the promise that things will be better in the inevitable sequels.) With the Deviants causing trouble for the first time in centuries, it’s up to Sersi and Ikaris to reassemble the rest of the Eternals. That’s when the team’s most compelling members begin to show up, including Kumail Nanjiani as Kingo, who used his charm and good looks to become a massive Bollywood star, and Brian Tyree Henry as Phastos, the first openly gay hero in a Marvel film. Eternals’ best scenes consider how these ageless extra-terrestrials found their home among humanity, and relate to its people. Each character gets just a couple of minutes to do that, though, before they’re dragged away from their lives to take part in the Eternals’ new adventure. Jack Kirby created the Eternals after he returned to Marvel in the late 1970s following a brief run at DC Comics. By that point in his career, he was largely a one-man band, writing, illustrating, and editing his own work, and following his muse beyond the boundaries of traditional superhero comics. His Eternals stories are weird and wild and beautiful, and while the film certainly adapts his book’s essential premise about storytelling and myth, it bears almost none of its frenetic visual energy. That includes Zhao’s version of the Deviants, who in Marvel Comics are a distinct race of aliens with their own goals. In the Eternals movie, they’re largely a bunch of generic four-legged monsters with no goals beyond wanting to eat people. They just aren’t a big enough or entertaining enough threat to support an entire movie. Eventually, Eternals does ramp up to the point where the fate of the world rests in the heroes’ hands. But even then, and even with a story that travels the globe from ancient Mesopotamia to modern Alaska, the Eternals’ battle with the Deviants seems to take place in a vacuum of gorgeous locations and a handful of backlot sets totally distinct from the real world. Maybe that’s because acknowledging the impact of the film’s apocalyptic stakes would also mean having to explain why the dozens of other Marvel heroes do nothing to prevent the end of the planet. Marvel hasn’t been at this world-saving stuff as long as the Eternals but over the last 13 years they’ve gotten very good at what they do. Eternals finds the studio trying some new things, including a serious contemplation of where superheroes come from — both within the lore of the MCU and in our collective unconscious. That’s an idea worthy of serious exploration. In Eternals, it never quite comes to the foreground amidst a lot of listless exposition and the same sort of CGI-driven action sequences that conclude every Marvel blockbuster. When the smoke clears, Eternals is a movie about stories and, in a way, about the characters in one of those stories rebelling against the confines of their predetermined roles in the narrative. When they’re trapped in a movie as crummy as this one, it’s hard not to sympathize with their position. -Eternals would have been much better suited to a Marvel television series on Disney+. On TV, they could have explored the team’s sprawling history at length (or even one character at a time) and really delved into the headier sci-fi concepts. -It’s not Eternals’ fault it comes out just a few weeks after Denis Villeneuve’s Dune, but boy does the comparison between the two do it no favors. They’re both deliberate, artful science-fiction heavy on worldbuilding and loaded with far-out alien technology, but one feels real and tactile, with fascinating characters and political intrigue, while the other features about a dozen space gods in gaudy costumes zapping each other with gold CGI for 160 minutes. -I suspect mainstream audiences are going to care a lot more about the film’s two post-credits scenes than anything that happens during the actual movie. If Eternals isn’t the worst film Marvel Studios has ever produced, that’s only because The Incredible Hulk is an even bigger mess.",NEUTRAL
"Oct 26, 2021"," If you do not read any further, there are mid-credits and post-credit scenes. When it comes to the mid- and post-credit scenes, I have questions. I will not get into those questions right now in case you still need to see the film. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 previously introduced Marvel fans to the Celestials. We only knew about Ego but it turns out Ego is not alone in that regard. It is the Celestials that created the Eternals and sent them from planet Olympia to protect humanity from the Deviants. The Deviants were thought to be wiped out a few centuries earlier but they’re back with the Emergence being days away from destroying all life as we know it. If it is not Thanos, someone else is always trying to destroy earth. Don’t they have another planet they could go after? Oh, right. Anyway, I think Jack Kirby would be proud of Eternals. Not just that but the the fact that this film spans time allows the MCU to explore beyond just post-WWII. We get glimpses of Mesopotamia, Babylon, etc. Going after auteur filmmakers is one of the best things for the direction of the MCU. We’ve seen how Taika Waititi brought his brand of humor in Thor: Ragnarok. This time around, it’s Chloé Zhao bringing her brand of filmmaking. If you know Marvel films, they largely depend on green screen action. This isn’t so much the case here. While it’s no joke that there is a lot of visual effects in the film, Zhao goes for practicality on location where possible. I love that she shoots on location as much as possible. This helps for some beautiful imagery, too. Zhao may be a newcomer to the MCU but Ben Davis is a veteran cinematographer for the franchise. What I love the most about the cast is the diversity. It’s international, too. But just as importantly, their membership is split equally across the board with five men and five women. Together, they’re a family unit. Like any family unit, they certainly have their fights. Oh, do they ever! There’s also moments of comic relief with how Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani) brings along his valet and makes a documentary. If there is not a documentary among the bonus features, Marvel is missing a real opportunity! Anyway, the casting also brings some firsts. We have the first deaf character in Makkari (Lauren Ridloff). Previous MCU films have gay or bisexual characters. However, this is the first on-screen kiss between two gay characters, one of which is Eternals member Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry). Eternals utilizes the London area, the UK, and the Canary Islands to double for other cities around the globe. For instances, Phastos resides in present day Chicago but don’t expect to see his home in the Windy City. No, it’s a private home in Surrey. You could have fooled me though! Danielle Solzman is native of Louisville, KY, and holds a BA in Public Relations from Northern Kentucky University and a MA in Media Communications from Webster University. She roots for her beloved Kentucky Wildcats, St. Louis Cardinals, Indianapolis Colts, and Boston Celtics.

"Oct 26, 2021"," Adapting Eternals would always be a tall order for Marvel Studios. Among the hundreds of properties in the publisher’s library, they’ve been one of the most complex and least successful in their half-century of existence. Forget your weakling who just hates bullies, your inventor who learns to use his heart only after installing a new one, your party prince who chooses to protect people rather than look down upon them. Eternals is about 10 wayward angels who must decide whether or not saving humanity is worth spitting in the face of God. It’s a biblical story with the pacing and tenor to suit it. Endless exposition and multiple millennia-spanning love stories ask audiences to connect with something much less grounded than the studio has ever delivered before. Many won’t.  It’s the biggest swing yet from Marvel Studios, and although it doesn’t always achieve its aspirations, it’s refreshing to see the world’s leading action studio try to infuse its universe with bizarre 1970s sci-fi concepts without diluting them. Compared to the studio’s largely mediocre post-Avengers: Endgame output, Eternals proves they have more worlds to explore … even if the result is a bit messy and not be the crowd-pleaser to which fans are accustomed. An expository scroll opens the film, explaining how the Celestials (essentially space gods) seeded the universe with life. Then came the Deviants, who want to kill intelligent life. So Celestials created the Eternals to defeat them. Hailing from the planet Olympia, our Eternals have lived on Earth for over 7,000 years. They have interacted with humans while protecting them from Deviants. However, they are forbidden to interfere in conflicts between humans, as their secondary mission is allowing intelligent life to flourish on its own path, to become something more. Our 10 Eternals are a team, each imbued with a particularly useful ability for achieving their God-given objectives. Five are fighters: Ikaris (Richard Madden), Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), Thena (Angelina Jolie) and Gilgamesh (Don Lee). They protect humanity. The other five are thinkers, with powers more intellectual in nature: Sersi (Gemma Chan), Sprite (Lia McHugh), Druig (Barry Keoghan), Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), and Ajak (Salma Hayek). No single Eternal is capable of fighting a Deviant on their own without a struggle, so they must operate as a team to succeed. That’s a lot of characters, but the script and extended running time — in what is by far the franchise’s longest non-Avengers film — gives them each clear relationships and chances to shine in the story. The all-star cast doesn’t hurt, either. It’s important to understand that, as a franchise, the Eternals are perhaps the least successful property Marvel Studios has decided to adapt into a big-budget action-adventure film. In the comic books, Jack Kirby created them after leaving Marvel for DC (where he created his seminal Fourth World) and subsequently returning to Marvel after DC failed him. This isn’t a creation from the same generation as his classic 1960s work like Fantastic Four; Kirby’s return to Marvel brought him the opportunity to create his own stuff, and Eternals was his way of exploring the “ancient alien” ideas on which he was personally keen. They weren’t meant as a cornerstone of Marvel cosmology, but they became important as future writers pulled the concepts into new stories. These days, you can’t throw a rock in a comic shop without hitting something about the Avengers fighting Celestials; in fact, the current comics relocated their base of operations into the head of a dead one. Such was the potency of Kirby’s ideas. The Eternals themselves have always been a tough nut to crack, but thankfully director Chloé Zhao and her co-writers don’t sacrifice their inherent weirdness in the process of trying. And this is a weird movie, at least by the standards of Marvel Studios. This isn’t a solo film about a character dealing with his or her daddy issues, or an ensemble like Guardians of the Galaxy, where the ostensible team is fundamentally driven by the arrested development of its lead white male man-child … with daddy issues. The only daddy here is God itself, I guess, but at least it’s an upgrade. If any character is the lead, it’s Sersi, whose ability to transmute matter is more of an artistic talent than a weapon to wield. Chan plays Sersi as a quiet, thoughtful woman. She loved Ikaris in their past, but they separated hundreds of years before the present day; she’s now dating a human named Dane (Kit Harington) and loves living among humanity. She believes in us even when we don’t deserve it. Unlike other Marvel heroines, Sersi’s ultimate moment of power and self-actualization isn’t depicted as a use of violence. Sersi is simply a new kind of Marvel hero. This is a new kind of Marvel movie. Still, 10 characters and a massive new cosmic mythology is quite a lot for audiences to take in. Zhao’s much-deserved Best Director Academy Award for Nomadland caused a lot of chatter about whether her slower, more methodical storytelling would mesh well with Marvel Studios, which tends to keep its talented directors within the bounds of their genre-defining in-house style. Superficially, Eternals is certainly prettier and more organically shot than many of Marvel’s other material, although the big greenscreen moments at the end feel just as recognizable. It doesn’t feel cheap in the same way some of their more recent releases do. Where Zhao seems to bring her sensibilities here is in the character relationships and the slowed pacing relative to other Marvel films. There are only a few big action sequences to think of, and thankfully the climax isn’t just gray CGI sludge. This is a Marvel film where most of the movie is characters talking to one another, and it’s a welcome change, particularly because the characters are talking about whether or not they should turn against God. Their conflicts don’t go quite as far as I’d like, but there is at least a healthy dose of misanthropy to certain characters’ perspectives on the ethics of letting God destroy Earth, which is refreshing. Then again, most audiences don’t go to the movies, much less Marvel movies, to watch characters sit around and wonder whether they should kill the almighty. It’s a topic that interests me, particularly in the sci-fi realm, but frankly, Eternals feels destined to be met with mixed reception by the larger general audience. The story is long, talky and not focused in the way the other Marvel films are. Although it nods at other properties, it features no cameos by known Marvel characters. The implications of the new Celestial mythology are massive and change the mechanics of a Universe many have grown comfortable visiting a few times a year. And, frankly, as much as this review is positive, the movie is far from perfect. There are pacing issues. It uses flashbacks as a crutch, but not to the same embarrassing degree as Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, and some information feels introduced later than it should’ve been. The Sersi / Ikaris relationship is supposed to drive the story but isn’t quite central enough. Although they get their moments, this is hardly a deep-dive into any of the characters and their lives (this does include Marvel’s first legitimate LGBTQ+ representation, however). Worst of all, the ending continues a trend with Marvel Studios straight-up attaching what should be post-credits stingers to the final moments in their films. It’s frustrating, and more perplexing here, because the tease sets up one of the fundamental conflicts the Eternals face in the comics right at the end of their origin movie with little explanation. The Disney+ shows are already just six-hour teases for their new movies; the movies don’t need to tease the Disney+ shows. Eternals isn’t one of Marvel’s best and it’s nowhere close to its worst. It’s not even close to the worst thing they’ve put out in 2021; it’s clearly the best of the big-screen bows thus far. The scale and scope of its ambitions will make it a hard sell to audiences who value the traditional emotional clarity of the series’ storytelling thus far, but it will find a vigorous fanbase over time. This is an epic, strange story about angels, gods and all sorts of crazy science-fiction ideas that won’t appeal to most people … just like the comics.",POSITIVE
"Oct 26, 2021"," Seriously, what a snooze. Fresh off of winning the Best Director Oscar for “Nomadland,” Chloé Zhao has upchucked one of the MCU’s worst movies in ages. And to what end? “Eternals,” which will no doubt become a Jon Favreau punchline in a future “Avengers” film, need not exist in a universe that already counts the Fantastic Four and X-Men among its franchises. Yet here you go, ticket buyers — another far worse, uniformed collective of super-beings with conspicuously similar powers and a vague, grandiose mission to save humanity. Well, where were our amazing protectors when several hundred innocent people walked into a lousy, two-hour, 37-minute movie Monday night? The most important difference between the Eternals and X-Men, however, is that Hugh Jackman’s Wolverine and Halle Berry’s Storm are layered, fascinating character studies. Angelina Jolie’s Thena has the personality of a bar of soap and an accent that suggests her semester abroad in London was the best four months of her life. All the characters are similarly bland. Richard Madden’s Ikaris is hot, can fly and has laser eyes. Gemma Chan’s Sersi is able to change inanimate objects into other inanimate objects, but God forbid she alter her facial expression. Druig (Barry Keoghan) can control people’s minds, Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani) stars in Bollywood movies and has fire hands, Makkari (Lauren Ridloff) runs super fast, Gilgamesh (Ma Dong-seok) is really strong and Sprite (Lia McHugh) has the ability to trick people with optical illusions. The movie’s conflict is that the Deviants, which were believed to be destroyed, are back again, and our heroes must stop the atrociously animated monsters. Speaking of which, Denis Villeneuve’s “Dune,” which hit theaters last Friday, showed theatergoers the wonderment well-done CGI can achieve and how Marvel so regularly makes us beg for the bare minimum. “Eternals” whisks us to a lot of places like that — Iraq, South Dakota, Mexico, Mesopotamia, Babylon. They all look exactly the same and make the movie feel like, well, 7,000 years.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 26, 2021","Eternals has the expected thrilling action scenes but the non-action scenes might be too quiet and introspective for some fans ... However, the showdowns in the last third of the movie make up for the meandering story in the rest of Eternals.",POSITIVE
"Oct 26, 2021"," I can only assume Disney planned the November 5 release date of “Eternals” very carefully. This big budget action film will hit theaters just in time for Thanksgiving, which reaches the chef’s kiss of utter perfection — because it’s a $200 million turkey. Billed by Marvel Studios as an “exciting” new team of superheroes (what on Earth is the publicity department smoking?), the Eternals are ancient aliens who have been living on Earth for thousands of years. They look over humans and fight the menacing Deviants, giant monsters who exist in this cinematic world solely so there can be fight scenes. The film struggles to tie in the characters and plot with other MCU stories (like name-dropping Steve Rogers at the dinner table), which is getting ridiculous because a movie doesn’t need to be made about every single character in the universe. Director Chloé Zhao tries to create an epic action movie with a touch more focus on the characters, but her style and approach don’t work on a grand scale. The film expects an emotional connection with the audience very quickly, but Zhao doesn’t bother to put in the effort early on to develop one, so there is none. There’s little warmth to these characters, and I didn’t care about their relationships. Not only are there a lot of new faces to learn and keep up with, but they’re introduced in a jumble. Adding to the confusion is the disjointed storytelling, as the film constantly jumps around in time. The film expects some background knowledge of the original comic book, which in itself is a deep-dive for a Marvel-literate crowd. These aren’t outrageously popular characters, and the movie doesn’t adequately explain who they are, especially in the beginning. Even worse is that the actors (Gemma Chan, Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry, Salma Hayek, Angelina Jolie, Ma Dong-seok, Lia McHugh, Lauren Ridloff, Richard Madden, and Barry Keoghan) are largely miscast in a studio ploy that feels like a forced diversity initiative rather than consciously choosing the best person for each role. To be fair, the characters are unappealing and boring to begin with, so it’s easier to tolerate Jolie’s overacting or Nanjiani’s strained attempts at humor. There’s very little star power, and nobody steps up to carry the movie. It’s important to celebrate diversity and practice inclusivity, but this movie tries too hard to be “woke.” There’s a sex scene and a homosexual kiss that are no big deal except that they are in a Marvel movie, which makes both of them feel like a publicity stunt rather than meaningful and organic. This in turn cheapens any mainstream boundaries that are broken, which is a shame. The action scenes are passable, with lots of gold squiggles and swords and running and kicking. The grand finale battle is unintentionally funny because the costumes our heroes are wearing make them look like a bunch of low-rent Power Rangers. The film’s only real strength are the outstanding visual effects, which really do set the bar. They’re practically flawless, but not enough to make the movie fun or exciting. Good review. I’ve been hearing a lot of what you mentioned from other reviewers out there who have already seeing this movie. It’s shame because it looked quite interesting and Marvel has certainly been hyping this feature up for quite some time.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 26, 2021"," Directed by Chloe Zhao.
Starring Salma Hayek, Richard Madden, Gemma Chan, Angelina Jolie, Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry, Lauren Ridloff, Barry Keoghan, Ma Dong-seok, Kit Harington, and Lia McHugh. There are at least two scenes in Eternals (from Nomadland Best Director Chloe Zhao, who, if nothing else, has made something wildly different from what’s expected of MCU offerings) that undercut intended heavy drama. One of them is a response to the romance/sexless criticisms of the franchise that fails to generate intimate chemistry (being comprised of only a kiss doesn’t help much either, and worse, makes it seem only half-committed to rectifying that often lobbed complaint about a series spanning 25 entries where everyone is ripped to shreds and impossibly attractive yet seemingly incapable of lust and love). Another starts as a heartbreaking monologue expressing centuries of inner pain, eliciting an emotional response. That is until this character is knocked over the head unconscious, which is played for a laugh (at least I hope, considering the contrived silliness of it all and motions of the action itself). The latter is more annoying (the romantic chemistry has far more significant problems beyond a sex scene so tame it’s laughable people are even calling it that) and genuinely irritating. It’s not that the studio interference is invisible or that Eternals is 100% free from formulaic Marvel trappings, more so sealing the deal the experience prioritizes spectacle over a complex analysis of godlike humanity stretching from Mesopotamia BC to a post-Snap world. Chloe Zhao is one of the greatest filmmakers working today; it’s not her fault (she also co-writes alongside Patrick Burleigh, Ryan Firpo, and Kaz Firpo). The story she clearly wants to tell and gets to tell sometimes is infinitely more compelling than what the narrative ultimately boils down to (the same as every other Marvel movie). With that said, I would rewatch Eternals again over lesser MCU installments and some of the good ones. It doesn’t always work, but it is undeniably the most ambitious Marvel movie (and it didn’t need 25 other movies as stepping stones to a colossal-length grand finale), pitting religious and familial duties against one another. The team members themselves are each distinctly drawn with Barry Keoghan’s Druig, an omnipotent and brooding presence with mind control powers conflicted over whether or not to interfere in civilizations slaughtering themselves over and over, standing out among the pack. There’s also Sprite (Lia McHugh), ageless like the others, eternally a teenager, and understandably at a breaking point when it comes to being left out of what life has to offer, regardless of the time period. The fact that she doesn’t age scares people off and also forces her to relocate. Complicating matters in a richly human way, she has also fallen for Richard Madden’s Ikaris (essentially, Marvel’s version of Superman, acknowledged with a few clever jokes, but emotionally emotionless and dull performance to behold) who is still deeply in love with Sersi (a terrific Gemma Chan also trying to live an everyday life while getting serious with her human partner as played by Kit Harrington) after a 5000-year relationship hiatus. A case could be made that pre-AD (and even slightly after) Eternals is deserving of its own movie. Led by Salma Hayek’s Ajak, the titular deity soldiers are tasked with ridding the world of the Deviants (feral beasts that glimmer and glow), so there’s also plenty of room for action (as evident during the early goings here). The drama here is also much riper for boldness and originality, not to mention several fundamental character dynamics that could have been fleshed out to greater service what’s to come. It’s hard to say if Eternals needs its own Snyder Cut, so to speak, or if it should have been split up into multiple movies. Regardless, there’s an unshakable sensation that the story is flying past plenty of the plot points that provide and amplify the movie’s humanity. Nevertheless, once the job is done, they are ordered (by a higher being that only Ajak can communicate with) to sit back and watch society evolve, only to destroy itself time and time again, rising with more and more medical and technological advancements. As previously mentioned, for some this hellish cycle becomes a cross too heavy to bear, whereas others stick by their faith. In the case of Angelina Jolie’s Thena (the goddess of war, complete with the most acrobatic and sickest melee combat moves of the group, wielding a variety of blades), her mind is fracturing, causing her to enter a state of entranced confusion that physically turns her against her allies.  The engineer of the group Phastos (an evocative Brian Tyree Henry) also harbors guilt seeing his inventions used to fuel wars and genocides further. Rounding out the team is the ASL-speaking Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), the beefed-up Kumail Nanjiana as a fireball blasting source of comedic relief in Kingo, and powerhouse bruiser with a soft interior Gilgamesh (Ma Dong-seok). Once the Deviants are eliminated, they do go their separate ways (I won’t spoil what they all get up to, but some are given more intriguing material than others) and live out their lives however they feel fit, immortal, and never to interfere in human affairs (yes, not even helping out against Thanos). Naturally, they do have to come together once more as a unit, but disappointingly following in the footsteps of the Marvel template. Wonky drama aside, Eternals does have a unique visual style going for it (even without her regular cinematographer, Chloe Zhao and Ben Davis have captured a variety of stunning landscapes as the film globe-trots around the world and time) in addition to the usual competently crafted action set pieces, this time set to a phenomenally soaring soundtrack from one of the greatest in the industry right now, Game of Thrones’ Ramin Djawadi. It’s also a bonus that there is a great deal of human conflict within the high-stakes final battle. Again, Eternals is nowhere near as fully realized or satisfying as it could have been. Still, maybe if enough moviegoers embrace the admirable attempts at adult human drama (that is powerful when it does work), Marvel executives will take bigger creative swings so that we don’t have to watch the same superhero movie on loop for all eternity.",NEUTRAL
"Oct 26, 2021"," Eternals is the 26th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, though it was supposed to be the 24th but was delayed a year because you know why. And that’s perfectly all right because as we’ve seen with the other recent Marvel movies and shows — the “Phase 4” as they call it, so all the Marvel canon we’ve gotten since Spider-Man: Far From Home — has been practically interchangeable when it comes to timelines and what goes where and why. So on that note, Eternals is very much its own thing, and that has a lot to do with its Academy award-winning director, Chloé Zhao. Zhao, of course, has been on a terrific winning streak as a director of independent films, culminating in last year’s Best Picture Winner, Nomadland, which again, should have technically come out after this one, Eternals (if you don’t count festival releases). Nevertheless, she’s back with that same independent spirit of presenting engaging, heartfelt characters in massive, heart-opening locations. It fits, in a way, to give her these Marvel superheroes who are set up to exist in the background of all the other movies, because that’s really been Zhao’s wheelhouse as a director and screenwriter since Songs My Brother Taught Me, where this “new” story examines the hidden lives of extraordinary people who might not seem all that special at first glance. So who are the Eternals of Eternals? That’s the driving narrative of the film, to be honest, not just a set up for my own exposition. The Eternals are a group of powerful beings from a planet called Olympia — you can pretty much compare them to Asgardians from the Thor movies, at least in terms of sturdiness and capability — who were sent to Earth 7,000 years ago on behalf of the Celestials, who are essentially Marvel-branded, all-powerful space gods. We learn from a jargony opening text crawl that the Celestials have been around since the very beginning of the MCU. And they employ the Eternals to protect life-inhabited worlds from a race of predatory creatures called Deviants, which are essentially skinless, tentacle-clad cerberus dogs. Sort of. The Eternals themselves don’t age, and they’re also gifted with their own unique, magical attributes. One of them can move super fast, another can possess people, and one is basically Superman because he can fly and shoot laser beams. The movie even points this out in a very meta way, and that’s not the only time. This is a Marvel movie, so the filmmakers inserted a few offhand pieces of dialogue to lampshade the obvious question: If there are powerful beings like the Eternals just hanging around the planet, why didn’t they intervene with all of the major events we’ve seen in the movies? They didn’t try to stop Loki, Ultron, Thanos, and so on. The characters do address this a handful of times, and mileage will vary on how well the movie succeeds or doesn’t in putting that issue to bed, as there are even plenty of moments when it’s hinted they did do things behind the scenes throughout history. Though most of the historical revisionism, usually played for laughs, isn’t all that clever. It does boost some character chemistry and lighten the usually dour mood at times, but it’s nothing we haven’t already seen done better and more interesting in other films. So even though the Eternals have been waiting around all this time, they’re only called to action once they discover that the Deviants have returned, centuries after their supposed eradication. And they’re more powerful than ever, so we essentially embark on a “getting the band back together” plot, where we start with Gemma Chan as Sersi, the true heart of the group who can change the properties of matter. She’s been living with Sprite, played by Lia McHugh, who can create illusions but has always looked like a child despite her old age. Richard Madden plays Ikaris, the aforementioned Superman who everyone considers the strongest. He also has some romantic history with Sersi, but she’s moved on and started dating someone else, a museum curator played by Kit Harington. There are a lot of other Eternals (and characters), so I’d be here eternally trying to discuss all of them in detail — you can probably see why the runtime is a mammoth 2 hours and 37 minutes. There’s a large sum of lore, mythology, and character outlining in this movie, as well as a lot of philosophy, existentialism, and conflict driven by the clashing of these ideas. It takes time for the full stakes of the story to come into focus, and when it does, Eternals becomes Marvel’s Iliad, an ambitious, sprawling, globetrotting epic that is more about the characters and how they interact when having to make decisions that will impact countless people. There’s also a good bit in here that could resemble some Biblical stories, at least when it comes to themes about heavenly judgement and utilitarianism, but also what it means to be a human and to love a human. Even if you are supposedly “above” or outside the typically understood concept of humanity. These are all profoundly refreshing ideas and directions for a movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. They’re also far more adult and mature. Eternals can be enjoyed by younger viewers, absolutely, but it’s one of the first and maybe only of these to be primarily geared toward an older, smarter audience. Especially because it really drags the audience along many extended segments that can be quite demanding if you’re not all in with this story and these characters. When the movie ended, I had this prickling thought in my head while waiting for the inevitable post credits sequences, which are neither here nor there. I wondered, “What was this all for?” If I ask this question after most Marvel movies, I won’t find a satisfying answer beyond having a good time with an exciting movie. But Eternals has much higher aspirations. It doesn’t want to just be good, exciting, and a precursor to some new cosmic journeys in Marvel’s amusement factory. Zhao and the other screenwriters want us to feel something while watching this. They want us to have discussions about it. Yet coming out of Eternals, I found myself disappointed with most of the fine details. The main issue is the climax, which pays off an entire movie of doom, gloom, and inevitability with half-explained convenience and bizarre character choices and actions that have almost nothing to do, really, with the meaty debates these characters were having along the way. Part of the problem might lie in how Sersi, again played quite well by Gemma Chan, becomes less and less interesting as the movie progresses. In the beginning, she is actually quite fascinating as this eternal being who manages to love someone in a circumstance where she knows they can’t be together forever. She’s the heart and soul of this group, as well as the main character of the movie, but as we see more and more characters come into play, the script tightens Sersi up into a stiff, reactionary observer until she isn’t at the very last minute. I’m more than happy to see Chan return to the MCU after her small role in Captain Marvel, and she’s not a weak link in this ensemble, far from it. There just seems to be a lot missing from her and others in this movie because they had to cram so much else in. We have Kumail Nanjiani, for example, who makes a massive choice in the movie at one point, which might’ve made much more sense if there had been more time spent with him setting this decision up. Same goes with the leader of the Eternals, played by Salma Hayek, who we don’t get nearly as much time with as we probably need to establish her driving motivation in the present day. Many people might wonder, in fact, if Eternals might’ve been better served as a limited series with room to breathe. The effects are certainly polished for the big screen, though the line between cinematic and at-home viewing continue to dwindle in terms of what audiences expect from everything they watch, no matter the format. The soundscape and overall score is perfectly fine, on that note, but not remarkable or memorable. The action choreography is usually decent, though it’s really hard to believe anything happening onscreen is real within the parameters of what’s real in this world. The art direction is a bit desaturated and bland, particularly when it comes to the design of the Deviants and the costumes. It’s the same issue I had with Shang-Chi, where the green screen quality of the magical mayhem just doesn’t quite connect with what the director is trying to accomplish in terms of tone and function. That’s not to say Eternals is an eyesore, it’s actually quite nice to look at about half the time, especially when you consider the scope of what had to be shot and where to pull off all these locations and time periods and even the cosmic details thrown in as well. Considering how long I’ve went on about Eternals at this point, it can’t be said the film is dull, or there isn’t much to get into. As you can (maybe painfully) see, the movie sparks a lot of discussion, good or bad. I firmly believe that if Marvel is to continue its uninterrupted rise to global, pop cultural prosperity at the box office, it has to try new things. It has to take risks like this. That doesn’t mean the risks will pay off for absolutely everyone in the same way, and it’s probably not best if we get many more Marvel movies trying exactly this. But who could really replicate Chloé Zhao? There’s a small comfort knowing that there probably never will be a Marvel film like this one, even if you end up hating it or finding it completely forgettable. It’s a unicorn, or pegasus, or pick your mythological creature. I’m about half and half with the movie, and as much as I’d like to lean slightly positive, I can’t avoid the fact that by the end of Eternals, I felt nothing. And that’s odd considering how with the film I was up until that point. The pacing isn’t fantastic, but I was there, in this story, the whole way through waiting to see what would happen next. It’s a testament to the characters and how well they’re realized, more than anything else, which means the way the story resolves these arcs has a lot to do with how I leave the film and reflect back on it. Was the journey worth the destination? At this point, I’d say no, but it’s not as if the journey was unbearable or irredeemable. It just simply was, and that’s about it.

"Oct 26, 2021"," hen ferocious predators dubbed “Deviants” arrive on Earth, devouring human populations, the Celestial Arishem (David Kaye), a divine being in charge of crafting worlds, recruits the “Eternals,” a race of immortal warriors, to protect the puny earthlings. But as the ageless fighters, including Ajak (Salma Hayek), Sersi (Gemma Chan), Ikaris (Richard Madden), Thena (Angelina Jolie), Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), Sprite (Lia McHugh, whose character is ripped straight from “Near Dark”), Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), Gilgamesh (Don Lee), Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), and Druig (Barry Keoghan) carry out their assignment, they soon become enamored with the burgeoning peoples they strive to protect. When the Eternals’ mission is complete, leader Ajak sets them free to live amongst mankind to find their own purposes and fulfillment. Thousands of years pass and Sersi now resides in London, working as a teacher and contemplating moving in with her professor paramour Dane Whitman (Kit Harington). But when a Deviant suddenly appears and attacks Sersi, the intrepid defender must seek out her brethren and reunite the Eternals once more, for the resurgence of the long-thought-extinct beasts exposes new perils and revelations that will change the guardian heroes forever. With Greek mythology, creationistic concepts, and “Prometheus”-like references to the originations of mankind, “Eternals” sets out to introduce a wealth of omnipotent entities that have long ruled the universe – and Earth, in particular – with stern voices, glowing ropes of electric lights, and other CG-augmented orbs or projectiles of energy. Plus, they’re in an ancient battle against flying dragons and other hellions, which must be fended off with Superman-like laser blasts from the eyes, magical weaponry, and extraordinary physical strength. Essentially, it’s a mix of the most generic superhero tropes (and powers, such as lightning speed and mind control), dished out to various personas in rubbery costumes, like those of the X-Men or the Fantastic Four. “Are you a wizard? Like Doctor Strange?” Marvel Studio’s version of Earth is now one that has to acknowledge all of the previous, supernatural misadventures involving destructive clashes against alien invaders and otherworldly warlords bent on wreaking havoc across the galaxy. It’s a post-Thanos era, which looks a lot like 2021 (dubbed present day), but it’s also completely outlandish, since various super-beings live among normal humans. Disbelief should be a thing of the past, considering how frequently humankind has experienced concretely occult interactions. And yet, the main characters in “Eternals” are continually incredulous, reluctant to believe that former enemies have returned, that humanity and fellow immortals are capable of abominable actions or betrayal, and that their mission on the planet – dictated by yet another godlike monstrosity – includes more than simply beating back hordes of animalistic Deviants. At least it provides commentary on free will and the idea that even superheroes can be pawns in the morbid machinations of ever more powerful minds. Unfortunately, that leads to one of the major problems: when the conflicts are so existential in nature, so massively far-reaching, and governed by omniscient titans with no limits to their capabilities, the happenings down on Earth seem terribly inconsequential, trifling, and futile. Why should audiences care about these insignificant protagonists? But it’s not just the premise itself that is working against the focus on a platoon of preternatural saviors; the script is also shockingly dull. Numerous comic relief attempts fall flat, while one-liners are mild and forgettable. And the action sequences are routine and unmemorable, blending physics-defying movements with uninspired beasts. None of the roles here have much chemistry; despite far too many characters (when the band tries to get back together, it’s easy to forget the lesser participants and their special abilities), there doesn’t seem to be any harmony among the clan. A love triangle is unconvincing, a chain-of-command is never really identified, and teamwork feels completely unnatural. These personas are just too vapid to warrant their quantity, and many of them are the types of antiheroes that inspire contempt rather than amusement. “Something’s happening to Earth …” By the end of it all (which takes a long time to reach, considering the colossal length), the unexplained powers and the utter lack of definitions surrounding the stars and their opponents lends to the feeling that solutions and resolutions are made up on the spot. Handy bits of tech come into play at all the right moments – i.e., just in the nick of time – preventing any sense of satisfaction. No one truly earns their survival, or even fully understands how they save the day when they inevitably save the day; the finale is a frustratingly protracted rumpus of showdowns and duels in which characters spontaneously summon unknown talents to best combatants with equally undisclosed faculties. And then it concludes with an astonishingly absurd parting shot, suggesting that nothing of any real consequence has actually been accomplished.

"Oct 25, 2021"," The 10 members of the Eternals are the most powerful protagonists in the Marvel Cinematic Universe so far. They are neither humans nor gods, but immortal attendants of humanity. And during the 7,000 years they’ve spent living on Earth, they haven’t interfered with civilization’s affairs unless Arishem—a colossal cosmic entity who manipulates seemingly all energy in the universe—told them to. (So, no, they didn’t do anything about Thanos.) In a new Marvel blockbuster centered on these titans, audiences might expect an all-action showdown. But Eternals’ Oscar-winning director, Chloé Zhao, treats her characters—whose powers transcend the usual superhero’s—like they’re mere flesh and blood. In shot after shot, she mines a quiet and poignant humanity from the group. Their tale, in her hands, doesn’t examine Marvel’s typical themes, such as the burden of being powerful; instead, it’s about the nature of everlasting bonds. Through a story focused on reuniting a disparate team at odds over how to approach a crisis, Zhao explores a resonant question: When you clash with those you love, do you confront the conflict or overlook it? When the film begins, the Eternals have scattered across the globe. Some, like Sersi (played by Gemma Chan), the team’s empath, have embedded themselves in society, complete with a job and a boyfriend; others, like the mind-controlling Druig (Barry Keoghan), live in isolation. After Sersi learns that Deviants, monsters that the Eternals eradicated from Earth ages ago, have mysteriously returned following the events of Avengers: Endgame, she sets out to bring the group back together—except not everyone agrees with her plan. This intra-communal disagreement—not the presence of Deviants—provides the film’s narrative tension. Much of Eternals explores, through glances and touches, the force of the group’s camaraderie. A pair of romances—between Sersi and Ikaris (Richard Madden), and Thena (Angelina Jolie) and Gilgamesh (Don Lee)—are particularly affecting. Their millennia-spanning relationships are tender even during battles—which, by the way, still feel superheroic. Thena moves balletically, conjuring weapons out of thin air to slice at Deviants that Gilgamesh has clobbered. Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), the playful speedster (and the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s first deaf superhero), clears a path for cocky Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani) to fire energy projectiles. Their choreography can be mesmerizing. Zhao seems most eager, though, to depict the Eternals’ bonds with the mortals they’ve lived beside. Her camera dwells on these interactions: There’s Sersi planting crops alongside farmers. There’s Makkari bartering with merchants. There’s Sprite (Lia McHugh) creating illusions to teach children myths. In these moments, Zhao channels the singular humanistic vision that guided her stunning indies such as The Rider and Nomadland. In those movies, Zhao established herself as an empathetic and immersive filmmaker, prioritizing the sensual experience of her characters, drawing strong performances from actors and nonactors alike, and capturing people’s essence in minute details and lush photography. Her work feels like poetry. Much of Eternals possesses the same meditative magic: Natural light bathes the characters and sublime landscapes—broad skies, rolling prairies, churning seas—surround them. The Eternals experience life on Earth across thousands of years, and with the help of a strong ensemble cast, Zhao tracks their shared awe and despair as observers of history. But as a film that must introduce 10 characters whose origins involve the creation of the universe, Eternals also has much to explain. I’d braced myself for some prosaic exposition—no Marvel movie, 26 films in, can escape the greater apparatus of the franchise—but almost every flashback required further explanation. This is a movie that starts with an opening crawl summarizing the group’s origins and includes trips to 5000 B.C. Mesopotamia and A.D. 1521 Tenochtitlan, not to mention interludes in outer space. Sometimes the dense lore and immense scope enhance the story Zhao’s trying to tell: Jolie’s Thena, for instance, suffers from an affliction, based on the comics, in which having too many years of memories causes her to forget where she is in time. In that context, Gilgamesh’s repeated assurances—“You are safe, you are loved, you are Thena”—are heartbreaking. More often than not, though, information dumps slow the narrative. Such weighty comic-book history may help to explain how the weirder corners of the Marvel universe work, but they mostly distract from the film’s interest in the Eternals’ intense bonds. The fact that these scenes are frequently drenched in CGI doesn’t help: Whenever Arishem communicates with an Eternal, he yanks them off Earth and into space, abandoning Zhao’s signature style. It’s like listening to an orchestra that occasionally veers out of tune. Still, Zhao’s delicate examination of her characters outshines Eternals’ duller and more convoluted moments. The climax centers on the Eternals’ internal strife, and after spending so much time with this family, seeing them fight is both agonizing and breathtaking. No buildings fall, no hordes of alien armies invade, and no civilians are shown screaming in terror. The most tragic blow doesn’t come from a fist, but from a single look exchanged between two characters. That’s an ambitious approach—to sink a Marvel-size budget into a personal character study and still keep it feeling like a sweeping blockbuster. Only Zhao could have made it so.",POSITIVE
"Oct 25, 2021"," Earlier this month, I read a story in Vice about group of NFT “investors” who had become the victims of a “rug pull.” According to the report, the developer of a planned game called “Evolved Apes” had taken the money investors thought would go to the project and instead simply vanished. The report went sort of viral, I assume partly on account of how absurd a picture it painted of the NFT world, and how hard NFTs are for the average person to understand.  As far as I can gather, the idea behind NFTs is that you can own a piece of digital art, like a digitized animation cel, its authenticity verified by the blockchain (somehow?), and that this is somehow an investing strategy. You pay for the digital art in the hopes that someone else later on will pay even more. The idea for Evolved Apes then, was that this group of people would all own various NFTs, of these crude ape renderings. They would then pool their money to create a fighting game and some other multimedia projects involving those apes, and the games would, presumably, become more popular, causing the original NFTs to rise in value. For most people, I imagine this idea sounds both bafflingly inane and staggeringly idiotic, an attempt to somehow combine a Ponzi scheme with beanie babies and crypto. The weird idea at the center of it is that the tail can basically wag the dog; that one can begin with the individual, meaningless non-story elements of a story, and then simply create a story incorporating them, thus giving them value. Conceptually, it’s a bit like trying to make Looney Tunes as a pump-and-dump scheme for your rabbit drawing. At some point during Marvel’s absurdly extravagant premiere for its new movie Eternals, which blocked off half of Hollywood Blvd, had police monitoring the crowd from rooftops and featured in-house Marvel “reporters” interviewing guests on the red carpet like it was The Oscars, I wondered if what I was experiencing was essentially just a massive-budget NFT scheme. Disney and Marvel own “Eternals,” a piece of IP (intellectual property) created by Jack Kirby in 1976, as part of their corporate assets ledger. On its own, the rights to a semi-obscure, 45-year-old comic book can’t be worth much. But what if Disney could create… an entire ecosystem of content… in which those Eternals drawings could… fly around and fight and stuff? Then they might be worth millions! Billions, even!  I know, I know, I’m supposed to be reviewing the movie, and not the spectacle of the premiere or the corporate strategy and blah blah blah. But in a roundabout way, I am reviewing Eternals the movie. To be sure, Eternals isn’t the first semi-obscure comic book property to be turned into a film. But it feels more than any before it like the tail trying to wag the dog, driven less by the ideas of its creators than the hopes of its investors. Chloé Zhao directs, hot off her best picture-winning Nomadland, from a script written by Zhao, Patrick Burleigh, Ryan Firpo, and Kaz Firpo (a name with great mouthfeel, I shall never forget it). Disney has lately been the best in the business at both spotting and nurturing young talent, and Eternals production seemed like it was shaping up to be a case in point. Yet the film itself is a compellingly disjointed chimera that seems to move the goalposts of its own mythology every five minutes.  Eternals begins with a few paragraphs of prologue. “the Eternals,” we’re told, are a race of immortal humanoids, created by the same “Celestials” that created the universe. The Eternals’ purpose, then, is to defend Earth from the “Deviants,” a race of destructive predators who are always naysaying your investment strategies.  In the first sequence, the Eternal Sersi, played by Gemma Chan, has to save her human boyfriend Dane, played by Kit Harrington from Game Of Thrones, from a man-eating deviant, which basically looks like a stegosaurus made of CGI taffy. Sersi accomplishes this task using her power to transform inanimate objects into other inanimate objects (like a London bus into flower petals, or cobblestones into quicksand), and with the help of her teenage sidekick, Sprite (Lia McHugh), a shapeshifter and illusionist.  Dane manages to absorb all this, and the news that his girlfriend is an immortal 5,000-year-old alien fighter, with all the glibness of a Joss Whedon character ordering schwarma (he also apparently never questioned why his girlfriend’s bestie and roommate is a middle schooler). Almost immediately Dane has to ask why, if the Eternals have been protecting Earth all these years, they just stood back and let Thanos destroy half of all life in the universe a few years back (to say nothing of Hitler and Adam Levine and whatnot).  That Dane has apparently lived through Avengers: End Game along with us may partially explain his nonchalance about the supernatural. But the scene raises the much bigger philosophical question, of why the Avengers and Eternals should need to exist in the same fictional dimension at all. In two and a half plus hours, we never get closer to an answer. It just feels like corporate fashion. Someone somewhere simply decided that existing alongside The Avengers would make the Eternals more valuable, like dangling the possibility of a future merger to juice the stock. Is this for the viewers or the investors? Does Disney know the difference, or are they deliberately conflating the two?  The Eternals, it turns out, are led by Ajak, played by Salma Hayak, whose power is being able to communicate with a Celestial (a massive being with a mostly unintelligible basso voice who looks like a continent-sized version of The Iron Giant). Ajak in turn guides her team of Eternals, which includes Ikaris (pronounced “Icarus”), played by Richard Madden from Game Of Thrones, who can fly and shoot laser beams from his eyes, Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani) who shoots hand rockets, speedy Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), brainy (and gay!) Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), psychoactive Druig (Barry Keoghan), super-strong Gilgamesh (Don Lee), and weapon-conjuring ‘Thena (Angelina Jolie). The rub of the first scene is that the Deviants they all thought were dead are back, and now they have to get the band back together in order to defeat them.  Unfortunately for Chloé Zhao and the writers of Eternals, we’ve all seen that movie, so it can’t just be that simple. Instead, and without spoiling anything, it turns out that the Eternals’ mission might not be so straightforward and noble after all. Their mission is driven by a guiding philosophy seemingly borrowed from Game Of Thrones (along with the Stark actors): What do we say to the God of death? Not today.  I always loved that line, and on a conceptual level, it’s kind of fun that Disney has made a film about heroes learning to defy God. Because, hey, maybe God is a remote micromanager trying to make decisions with no regard for conditions on the ground. In practice, this story is mind-bendingly convoluted and contradictory. Throughout it all, the Eternals team is constantly coming together and fracturing, factionalizing along various lines. They feud, fight, and fall in love with each other, complete with what I’m pretty sure is Marvel’s first depiction of two superheroes having sex on a beach. (Can Sersi transform the sand on their genitals into Gold Bond powder? Let’s explore this further).  Zhao and Co. do their best to individualize all these characters. Kingo has become a Bollywood star, Druig has gone Kurtz in the Amazon, Thena has some kind of remembering disease known as “Madweary” which makes her disassociate and try to kill the other Eternals from time to time, and Sprite is cursed to live out all eternity as a pre-pubescent tween, a la Kirsten Dunst’s character from Interview With The Vampire. Nanjiani, now buff for some reason (does shooting magic lightning bolts from your fingers really require muscle?) actually succeeds in squeezing laughs from the material a few times, but mostly the characters have so little room to breathe between rationalizing the ever-shifting plot that even Marvel’s normally successful formula for comedic insouciance doesn’t really work. As in virtually all of these movies, the heroes must eventually come to the conclusion that humanity is worth saving, in spite of its faults — like the time they genocided the Aztecs or dropped nuclear bombs on Hiroshima (events referenced directly in Eternals). The odd thing is that Eternals has virtually zero human characters that might justify this view. None get more than a few minutes of screentime, such that the Eternals choosing to save them or not seems mostly a matter of demigod caprice. It’s an open question of who the antagonist even is. Zhao and company will introduce an admirable level of moral complexity, only to snuff it out one or two scenes later for no apparent reason in what’s meant to be a rousing triumph. The action is not un-compelling, it’s just very, very weird. It feels like they aren’t really trying to get us, the audience, to engage with any of these characters on a serious emotional level. They’re simply trying to build a massive playground in which these pieces of IP can continue to interact with one another accumulating maximum value. The narrative lengths to which the hired-gun creatives are forced to go to in order to accomplish this corporate mission are often comical and sporadically admirable, but what they haven’t done is create characters or a story that’s emotionally meaningful in any way.  Still, Eternals is hard not to recommend solely on the grounds that it’s so flailingly bizarre. It’s odd to a degree that’s impossible to convey without spoilers. I need you to see it so I know that I’m not hallucinating.",POSITIVE
"Oct 25, 2021"," La dupla Marvel/DC siempre ha sido una campo abonado al antagonismo y las comparaciones, de forma que lo ocurrido en la última década —con el intento simultáneo de engrosar dos universos cinematográficos— solo haya intensificado esta guerra de fandoms. Por encima del ruido internetero se ha ido percibiendo, sin embargo, algo mucho más interesante que las derivas industriales que acompañan cada sello, sobre todo a través de las iteraciones en DC de Zack Snyder y Patty Jenkins: mientras que el MCU está habitado por seres con grandes poderes, pero sin dificultad para identificarse con la humanidad que han de salvar, la Distinguida Competencia ha presentado a personajes más similares a dioses, que solo pueden relacionarse con nosotros en régimen de modelo a seguir, y cuyos conflictos internos están más abocados a la filosofía y la religión que a la dócil imbricación ciudadana de sus homólogos marvelitas. Solo hay que comparar cómo se ha gestionado en Marvel el temor por las bajas colaterales en las batallas —dando pie incluso a una guerra civil en tanto a los posicionamientos en este conflicto—, con lo visto en DC. De Batman v Superman al panteón que presentó Snyder en su Liga de la Justicia, previo intento de Joss Whedon por bajar a sus personajes a la tierra en la versión apócrifa. Una vez concluida la guerra del Infinito, sin embargo, pareciera que los héroes terrenales de Marvel ya han cumplido su papel, y en lo que se busca un relevo generacional no es de extrañar el interés de Kevin Feige por aumentar el alcance del campo de juego. Sea con ese multiverso en el que las series de Disney+ ya están indagando o con una película tan arriesgada como Eternals, que establece con total tranquilidad que durante decenas de años y películas siempre vivieron entre nosotros unos seres de enorme poder, aún más que el de Thor y la tropa de Asgard por cómo ni siquiera la cerveza atinaba a humanizarlos un poco. Los Eternals, creados por Jack Kirby, traen aparejada una cantidad tal de mitología que se puede percibir el sudor de los guionistas a la hora de tratar de encajarla en una narrativa que ya nos ha llevado a los rincones más distantes del espacio y el tiempo. No deja de ser meritorio, claro, que se quiera expandir este universo de un modo tan drástico, y arriesgado teniendo en cuenta el batallón de personajes que de pronto ha de incorporar a un canon ya bastante saturado de por sí. Eternals es, pues, una huida hacia adelante, cimentada afortunadamente con las mismas dosis de cariño y cálculo que han guiado siempre el MCU. Es una de las buenas noticias de una película ambiciosa que no anda sobrada de ellas. El aplomo con el que estos personajes son presentados, la solemnidad bien entendida con la que se los sitúa en el mundo, son admirables y brillan especialmente en las distancias cortas, cuando se intercambian chistes frente a una mesa antes de regresar al combate. En este terreno, además, la maquinaria de Feige se permite plantar algún hito que otro, como todo lo correspondiente a la vida familiar de Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry) o la tan publicitada escena de sexo, que no son tan anecdóticos como pudiera parecer en tanto al modo en que dialogan con las inquietudes discursivas de la película. Porque a fin de cuentas, sí, Eternals es lo más parecido a una Liga de la Justicia de Zack Snyder que pudiera fraguar Marvel, encabezada por dioses que se preguntan por qué se supone que deberían salvarnos y sufren de formas variopintas su convivencia en el planeta Tierra. El personaje de Sprite (Lia McHugh) es interesantísimo por cómo sintetiza este extrañamiento en la piel de un ser centenario atrapado en el cuerpo de una niña pequeña, mientras que un encantador Kit Harrington, como Dane Whitman, expresa con su sola presencia que la humanidad merece la pena, y que de vez en cuando hasta se merece un achuchón. Eternals está bien construida y pensada, fruto de una forma de hacer las cosas perfectamente establecida. Sin embargo, el sano afán humanista que enarbola su tesis termina difuminándose por culpa de un guion que no sabe cómo vehicularla si no es con diálogos plomizos, flashbacks interminables —algo de lo que también adolecía la anterior Shang-Chi y la leyenda de los diez anillos— y dramas románticos de derribo, representados por unos Richard Madden y Gemma Chan dolorosamente poco carismáticos. A costa de estas dificultades para encauzar la historia, la acumulación de subtramas y personajes empieza a agotar mucho antes de percatarse de que esta va a ser la película más larga del MCU justo antes de Vengadores: Endgame, sin que tampoco ayude la absoluta anemia visual que baña la película de principio a fin. Tras curtirse en el cine independiente y ganar un Oscar por Nomadland, Chloé Zhao demuestra con su primer blockbuster lo rápidamente que algo parecido a un “estilo” puede ser fagocitado por un agente tan voraz como Marvel, transmutándose en una ridícula marca de fábrica que busca vender atardeceres y rostros compungidos mirando al horizonte como expresiones de una identidad artística definida. Combinándose con la proliferación de monstruos CGI y la tediosa visualización de los poderes de toda esta gente —que nunca se insistirá lo suficiente, es muchísima gente, y gente a la que antes no conocíamos de nada—, a Eternals no le queda otra que desplomarse como una de las propuestas más débiles y morosas del canon marvelita. Y fracasar, por supuesto, a la hora de poner el audiovisual al servicio del poder incalculable de los protagonistas, ofreciendo imágenes congestionadas, desesperadas por abrazar una trascendencia que siempre se antoja esquiva. Otra cosa no, pero mostrar a dioses en acción siempre fue la especialidad de Zack Snyder, y es lo que provoca que, en el caso de Eternals, las comparaciones sean más odiosas que nunca.  Los Eternals, una raza inmortal creada por los Celestiales, han vivido en secreto en la Tierra durante más de 7.000 años, encargados de defenderla de la amenaza de sus homólogos malignos, los Deviants. Estos seres decidieron separarse una vez creyeron que el mal estaba derrotado, pero al poco tiempo del regreso de la mitad de la población durante los acontecimientos de 'Vengadores: Endgame', su líder Ikaris decide reunirlos para enfrentarse a la amenaza definitiva.

"Oct 25, 2021"," Before Marvel Studios announced that Oscar-winner Chloé Zhao (Nomadland) would be helming Eternals, there’s a very good chance that 99% of earth’s population had no idea who these Marvel Comics characters even were. (And before Nomadland, even fewer knew Zhao’s work.) Years later, people still might not know much about the characters or what to expect from the movie. In fact, the characters, created by legendary comic book creator Jack Kirby way back in 1976, have had as spotty a publishing history as the title character of Shang-Chi. Very few comic creators and Marvel editors knew what to do with them, and even Neil Gaiman certainly gave it the college try.  The opening crawl of Zhao’s iteration gives some idea of the scale to expect as it introduces the concept of God-like “Celestials,” and their adoring powered servants, the Eternals, who are sent to earth to protect humans from horrible “Deviants.” The central focus of this group is Gemma Chan‘s Sersi, who is teaching history in London and has an amorous relationship with fellow professor Dane Whitman (Kit Harrington). Sersi is also minding Sprite (Lia McHugh), an Eternal with the unfortunate curse of being created within a child’s body that never ages. After they fend off a Deviant attack with Sersi’s former lover Ikaris (Richard Madden), they need to go looking for their fellow Eternals, who have been scattered across the earth, in order to face a great Deviant attack, as forewarned by Prime Eternal Ajak (Salma Hayak). It’s obvious from the start that this group of heroes is mostly made up of a lot of pretty and buff but equally bland actors with next to no zero personality and with only a few exceptions. Kumail Nanjiani gives it a go by showing up as Kingo, who directs and acts in Bollywood films and probably has the biggest personality of the bunch, constantly cracking with only a few jokes that really land. One thing that’s immediately obvious is that Angelina Jolie is and has always been a superstar, because every time she’s on-screen as Thena, she just exudes more presence than anyone around her. That doesn’t mean it’s her best acting work, and she has the unfortunate running subplot of Thena being “mad-weary,” which comes up at random times and basically sends her into a blind rage. It’s a subplot that quickly gets tiring. Second best of the bunch is probably Brian Tyree Henry as Phastos, the Eternal who can use his light constructs to invent and create, but he really only shows up maybe an hour into the movie. Barry Keoghan does bring more of a personality to his character Druig than anything else he’s done, and yet, that doesn’t say a heck of a lot.  Since Eternals is so deliberately an ensemble piece, it means none of the cast is even really given much opportunity to stand out from the others, and it takes a good portion of the movie to figure out who is who and why you’re supposed be rooting for any of them.  One exception is the romance between Sersi and Ikaris, and where Dane ends up in the mix, as it’s one of the character subplots that does work well. A bigger overall issue is that Eternals just doesn’t have a much-needed and definitive villain or conflict other than those butt fugly Deviant creatures, who keep popping up with the sole purpose of killing humans but with very little other motivation until the last half of the film. Other Marvel movies have thrived on having great villains and actors playing them — Josh Brolin as Thanos, Tony Leung as Wenwu, etc. Without that, it never feels like there are enough stakes or actual threat that makes it necessary for the Eternals to be on earth. We probably should get to some crafts, because they’re mostly up to Marvel par, but there were also issues there. Kudos to Chao and her location manager for finding some absolutely stunning landscapes and vistas on which to shoot. Heck, even Camden in London looks great when shot by Cinematographer Ben Davis, BSC. By comparison, the production design is quite lacking when compared to other MCU films, and that might be because there are so many great natural spaces that any construct just doesn’t stand out. There are also problems with costumes, since Costume Designer Sammy Sheldon Differ and her team has designed and created these beautiful outfits for the Eternals, but then the story puts them in bland street clothes for much of the movie so they’ll fit in with humans.  The visual effects vary in quality, but some of that might come down to the creature designs, which have absolutely nothing to do with the Deviants as created by the late, great Jack Kirby, and they just look odd. (The alien creatures in The Tomorrow War earlier this year just seemed far more menacing.) The way visual effects are used to create the Eternals’ light construct powers is far more effective,  but there’s nothing that really takes your breath away except maybe the Eternals’ spaceship, the Domo. The scale of the towering Celestials works better when there are other things in shot for comparison, but the main Celestial, Arishem, just looks like a giant rock behemoth with none of the color or detail that made them jump off the page when drawn by Kirby. (The group’s collective Uni-Mind, which is absolutely enormous and awe-inspiring in the comics, is just another CG effect, essentially, and therefore, also unimpressive.) The score by Ramin Djawadi (Game of Thrones) never really stands out as something new or original for this kind of movie. To be honest, after hearing how Pink Floyd’s “Time” works so well early in the movie, I was generally hoping for more interesting musical choices. Eternals finally achieves the scope and scale of a Kirby creation in its final epic act where the  Eternals are in their costumes, facing a  “Prime Deviant” (voiced by Bill Skarsgard, It‘s Pennywise), and trying to stop the destruction of earth — all fairly de rigeur storytelling for a Marvel movie. Because of that, there just doesn’t seem to be a purpose for this movie, because Kenneth Branagh’s Thor and the Thor sequels had already done a better job with the idea of Gods fighting creatures to protect earth’s human population. That fact just makes Eternals feel redundant and recitative.  I was truly hoping Ms. Zhao would exceed anyone’s lofty expectations with her first foray into the Marvel Universe. Instead, Eternals feels like a step back and step down after her previous two films, The Rider and the Oscar Best Picture, Nomadland. Her attempt to bring her panache for strong characterization ends up creating a cadre of superheroes with very little personality when introduced, then takes far too much time before you even care about their conflict. The people who love everything Marvel will surely eat this one up, as they do everything Marvel, but it’s hard to feel this is up to par with Marvel’s best, especially following so closely after the far superior Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. The sad fact is that the Eternals are not the Avengers, nor were they ever going to be the Guardians of the Galaxy, so basically, Eternals is Marvel’s Suicide Squad… but with a slightly better ending.",POSITIVE

The 26th MCU film is audacious in a way unlike anything that has come before it. Although elements seem to share the galactic feel of ""Captain Marvel,"" the trippy ambition of ""Doctor Strange,"" or the classical myth-making of the ""Thor"" films, never before has a Marvel Studios production swung for the fences quite like this one, telling a tale that spans thousands of years, encompassing civilizations both terrestrial and quite extra, and offering substantial storylines detailing a dozen main characters. At times, this ambition threatens to take the film down, but Chloé Zhao's impressive-looking movie unapologetically wields ambition as if it were a superpower.





Watching ""Eternals,"" it's also striking how Marvel has accomplished something movie studios attempted unsuccessfully for decades: bomb-proofing a film release. How many people who see ""Eternals"" really want to see ""Eternals""? And how many others would much rather be going to ""Spider-Man 9"" or whatever, but will see this film simply because they've seen the 25 that preceded it (and the Disney+ series as well) and fear that if they don't see ""Eternals,"" the MCU will move along without them? It's a valid concern, because this film introduces all sorts of concepts — from celestial string-pullers to spinoff characters — likely to influence future MCU adventures.
Based on one of Jack Kirby's crowning achievements when he returned to Marvel in the '70s, the first film adaptation of ""Eternals"" opens with a convoluted scrawl wielding words like ""Arishem,"" ""Deviants,"" and ""the prime Eternal."" You might want to take notes — what this film lacks in capes and tights, it makes up in jibber-jabber.





We then meet the titular super group in 5000 BC Mesopotamia: molecule-shifting Sersi (Gemma Chan), Superman-like Ikaris (Richard Madden), energy-firing Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), illusion-wielding Sprite (Lia McHugh), technology-savvy levitator Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), speedster Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), mind-controller Druig (Barry Keoghan), super-puncher Gilgamesh (Ma Dong-seok), agile weapons-wielder Thena (Angelina Jolie), and their boss (at least on Earth) Ajak (Salma Hayek). At the risk of reinforcing an earlier point, take notes.
To break down their epic story in simple, Reader's Digest-like terms that will likely result in a lot of angry comic book fans: the Eternals were created by the alien Celestials to defend and cultivate Earth. Much of this defending has been against ""the Deviants,"" a previous Earthbound race gone wrong. After millennia spent battling these creepy, energy-sucking creatures, the Eternals thought they had won the war; Ajak rewarded the troops by telling them all to take the Eternals' equivalent of a long weekend (a few hundred years) to chill. Now, on the heels of the ""Avengers: Endgame"" Blip, the Deviants have seemingly returned, causing the Eternals to stop teaching, dancing, and taking human lovers and instead cut their vacations short. Oh yeah, and one of them has also turned up dead.





The first thing you notice in ""Eternals"" is the stunning cinematography — if ever there was an MCU film to see in IMAX, this is it. The film frequently feels like Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" mixed with the free-flowing narrative ambitions of Terrence Malick, rather than any superhero film you've seen before. The next thing you notice is the equally stunning beauty of the cast, manifesting this concept of god-like beings through the flawless features and impressive cheekbones of Chan, Jolie, Madden, and others, as well as a multicultural, non-gender-conforming aesthetic that effectively represents the grand scope of humanity, rather than any particular civilization or era's interpretation of what a ""supreme being"" should look like.

But then it's time for the plot, and this is where things start going off the rails. Constant, often unannounced flashbacks have a disorienting effect on the viewer (are we in 575 BC Babylon? Present day South Dakota? 1531 AD somewhere else?) as does the unforced error of examining the backstory of each and every Eternal as if they were the film's main character. In some instances, characters die moments later, making all this backstory feel like a wasted trip down a dead end — and also burdening the film with a flimsy logic where the characters seem to heal their wounds and be unkillable when the plot requires it, but at other times they seem to die quite easily. Later in the movie, somebody gets stabbed — and the film holds on it, as if this is a major occurrence — only to have the character later flick it away like a bug bite. The movie's lack of continuity in such moments leaves the viewer unsure in many instances whether a blow is inconsequential or could, for some reason, be fatal. Then there are moments like when Salma Hayek tells another character in 575 BC to ""Get a life!"" While we can't be certain of such things, it seems unlikely that people were using that phrase back then. There are also some quirky decisions made around character motivations: At the height of the film's action, after we learn that an event called ""the emergence"" is going to end all of humanity, the Eternals must choose between saving humans and forsaking them — except for one Eternal, who decides to peace out; later, he is reunited with the rest, and nobody seems to be bothered by his reticence in their time of need. Another Eternal decides to turn an entire village into their own personal zombies for generations, a dereliction of duty that is barely remarked upon and quickly forgiven. Then there is a subplot involving Ikaris going dark that plays like a pale imitation of ""Invincible,"" ""The Boys,"" and heck, ""Superman III."" Perhaps Achilles should have been an Eternal, because another heel is one that has plagued MCU films since the beginning: its failure to present a clearly defined, terrifying, truly memorable villain. It's a safe estimate that ""Eternals"" has somewhere in the neighborhood of six (or more) villains, most of whom are not working in conjunction with each other, and whose villainous ways emerge and then recede as required by the plot rather than any common sense. Half of these beings are lifeless CGI, including a disappointing realization of The Deviant Warlord Kro. Can we get a Joker around here? A Thanos? How about a Doctor Doom? At the end of the day, a movie about good vs. bad can only be as good as its bad. Which is a shame, because there is a lot in ""Eternals"" to like, albeit in small doses that almost feel like their own films. Gemma Chan carries the movie impressively, harnessing a unique talent to be charming and feel like a character in a Hallmark movie one moment, then turning into an all-powerful immortal being the next; her fun romance with Kit Harrington (who plays an incredibly forgiving ""normal"" guy ... or is he?) is a highlight. Also worth noting is an emotionally powerful, groundbreaking subplot involving Henry's character and his home life, which involves a husband and a son. Angelina Jolie is similarly impactful as an Eternal whose mind has begun playing Alzheimer's-like tricks on her that always seem to flare up at the most inopportune moments — but again, she frequently feels like she's in her own movie at the fringes of this one. ""Eternals"" also continues the fascinating new Hollywood tradition of having actors bulk up for comic book roles, only to costume them in ways that make them look no different. Google Kumail Nanjiani and the first thing you'll see are thirst-trap pictures of the amazing physical transformation the comedian undertook, starting around late 2018, for the role of Kingo; much like JK Simmons in the DC Universe, you'd never know it from what you see on film. By the time the flick begins to focus on Kingo (which honestly, arrives far too late), the audience is treated to some much-needed comic relief, reminding us that Nanjiani's comedic skills are as buff as ever. His character has been masquerading as multiple generations of a Bollywood acting/directing dynasty, and although one has to wonder who the intended audience is for the ""behind-the-scenes"" documentary that his valet (Harish Patel) is filming, there are some great moments of levity in that storyline. By the end of its lengthy run, ""Eternals"" stumbles across the finish line with a dizzying mix of spaceships, superpowers, erupting volcanoes, and other spectacles. The audience also gets two post-credits scenes that make promising revelations abut MCU developments to come, and a promise that ""The Eternals will return."" But ultimately, that statement feels as much like a threat as it does a promise. After watching the first film, should the Eternals get a second one? Or would these characters be better scattered to the wind, sprinkled into disparate Marvel movies and Disney+ shows so that someone like Jolie's Thena can get a more deserving close up? Ultimately, ""Eternals"" feels a bit like homework: If you don't want the rest of the class to move on without you, it's mandatory; but in the end, you'll just be glad to turn it in and move along to the next thing.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 25, 2021"," It's the third movie in the space of five months and comes after fans have enjoyed (to varying degrees) four TV shows on Disney+, all of which connect to the overarching narrative of Phase 4. Marvel fans are used to this kind of bounty as there were three movies apiece in 2017, 2018 and 2019, but will there ever prove to be one movie too far? The fear is that it could well happen with Eternals after some surprisingly mixed early reactions, and the fact that it features no established MCU characters. What could save Chloé Zhao's movie is that, on paper, it's a genuinely exciting prospect: a superhero team-up movie with the MCU's most diverse cast yet from an award-winning director. And while that should probably be enough to get most MCU fans to show up, it turns out that not even a director like Zhao can overcome familiar flaws in almost all of Marvel's origin stories. The scale of Eternals is unlike anything we've seen to date in the MCU, but it also ends up in a movie that just has too much on its plate. After a Star Wars-esque opening crawl, Eternals takes us right back to 5,000 BC in Mesopotamia as the immortal heroes arrive on Earth, kickstarting a fight against mankind's oldest enemy, the Deviants, that spans millennia.  The main story picks up in Camden, North London as the Deviants return to cause trouble in Sersi's (Gemma Chan) life – and the lives of every other Eternal. Something called the Emergence is on the way and after the Eternals went their separate ways centuries earlier, it's time to get the squad back together. To go into any more plot details would risk entering spoiler territory as even though MCU fans have never met these characters, there are still some major surprises in store across the movie's epic 157-minute runtime. Zhao takes us back-and-forth across the history of the Eternals to both fill in their past and set up their future, meaning that even though it's long, there's a lot going on at any one time.  The balance isn't always quite right, though, as the flashback sequences rarely offer anything of note. They always look beautiful, not just thanks to the incredibly attractive cast, but also the vistas. It's in this imagery that you can see Zhao's fingerprints, even if a lot of her other directorial elements are lost in the MCU-ness of it all. Because that's the thing. Like with the recent Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, Eternals might want to be different to all that's come before, but it's still an MCU movie at its heart. The story is impressively free of major nods or connections meaning even newbies can understand it, yet it still falls foul of familiar origin-story issues such as a bland villain and CGI-heavy final act.  Since it's centred on an entirely new team, Eternals has a lot of groundwork to get through that includes the basics of what exactly an Eternal is, who the ten characters are and why they're on Earth. That's before you even get to the actual plot of the movie and, at times, it feels like there's a lot of showing when telling would have been the best way forward, especially when some flashbacks end up feeling like padding. The main plot itself follows a fairly standard 'get the team together to fight a big threat' journey, so it can end up feeling episodic. Yet what saves Eternals is that Zhao has an impressive cast to call upon, filled with charismatic performers who can make the formulaic feel fresh.  Gemma Chan gets an MCU part worthy of her talents – after she was wasted in Captain Marvel – with Sersi the heart and soul of the movie, even if her connection with Richard Madden's Ikaris never quite convinces. Kumail Nanjiani provides the comic relief as Eternal-turned-Bollywood star Kingo, while Don Lee and Angelina Jolie prove to be the movie's most affecting duo as Gilgamesh and Thena. It's inevitable that in such a stacked ensemble as this that some cast members suffer in terms of screentime, especially Lauren Ridloff's Makkari and Barry Keoghan's Druig. Their lack of time is disappointing for different reasons: Ridloff given her position as the MCU's first deaf superhero and Keoghan because Druig highlights the interesting moral dilemmas of the Eternals' role on Earth.  When there's a world to save and future movies to set up, Zhao never quite gets enough time to really dig into the morality of what the Eternals are doing – or rather, not doing – when standing by as humanity harms itself. Delving into those concepts could have lifted the movie away from its standard team-building mission, but there's just too much going on already.  Even with the issues over the story though, Eternals does bring something new to the MCU and feels original enough to make it worth seeing. Not only is there a diverse cast, we get our first gay superhero in Brian Tyree Henry's Phastos, but there's also the first sex scene in any MCU movie. They might be superpowered immortal beings, but at least Zhao knows that they'd find time for some actual rumpy-pumpy. The movie arrives in cinemas shortly after the much-anticipated Dune where Denis Villeneuve took the bold decision to split Frank Herbert's novel into two. Watching Eternals, you can't help feeling that you wish Zhao took a similar approach instead of ambitiously trying to fit everything into one movie. You'll feel like you're watching a condensed version of the Infinity Saga from Iron Man right through to Avengers: Endgame. From the gathering of superheroes to the world-threatening event (with some team conflict along the way), there are elements of both the Avengers movies and the various standalone events. There's always something going on in Eternals, but you'll wish it took more time. Ultimately, every origin story succeeds or fails based on whether you'd want to see the central heroes again and on this note, Eternals absolutely works. With an intriguing ending and some genuinely exciting credits scenes, you'll want to return to Zhao's impressively-crafted world and now that the exposition is out of the way, the possibilities are eternal. ©2024 Hearst UK is the trading name of the National Magazine Company Ltd, 30 Panton Street, Leicester Square, London, SW1Y 4AJ.

"Oct 25, 2021","A disappointment of cosmic proportions, Eternals never takes off due to a pedestrian script that wastes a galaxy of talent. [Full Review in Spanish]",NEGATIVE
"Oct 25, 2021"," Although these carnivorous aliens were seemingly defeated 500 years ago, the Eternals remained on the planet. Now, in present-day London after an earthquake, these beasts are back. It first comes to the attention of Sersi (Gemma Chan) and Sprite (Lia McHugh), who soon team up with Sersi’s former flame Ikaris (Richard Madden). Gradually, they seek out fellow Eternals across the world, including the fractured Thena (Angelina Jolie), hiding in the Australian Outback with Gilgamesh (Ma Dong-seok). Zhao revels in the script’s globe-trotting nature, which takes the team from South Dakota to Iraq and the Amazon, where they find Barry Keoghan’s Druig living as a godlike figure in the jungles. The most amusing dynamic involves Kumail Nanjiani’s Kingo. Now a preening Bollywood star, his relationship with his fawning valet (Harish Patel) brings some much needed light relief to an overly earnest storyline that sees the Eternals question their very reason for being protectors against the Deviants. Much of the film’s plot points circle around Ajak (Salma Hayek), their appointed leader who communes with Arishem, an all-powerful celestial entity who oversees the Eternals’ adventures. But the less said about that, the better. There’s plenty of back-and-forth to earlier time periods, including a striking shot of 1945 Hiroshima after the atomic bomb had been dropped. But at over two-and-a-half hours, the film struggles to find its rhythm, weighed down by the onus of carrying so many central characters. Some are marginalised. Lauren Ridloff’s Makkari, the first deaf MCU character, gets short shrift, as does Brian Tyree Henry’s gay hero Phastos, while Kit Harington’s Dane Whitman barely registers. The fight-driven action is fun – Jolie really has a ball – but it all feels geared towards setting up further adventures, especially the tantalising post-credits sequence. As a stand-alone, Eternals is a middling Marvel movie.",NEUTRAL
"Oct 24, 2021"," The broad and common critique of Marvel movies, generally, is that they are often anonymously made, cookie-cutter in shape, and—if created by an indie auteur—set up in a way that generally strips that filmmaker of their voice or any discerning identity. In some regards, Chloé Zhao’s “Eternals” seems engineered as an exact rejoinder to this criticism. If Marvel is generally boxing in their filmmakers (so some claim anyhow), then they’ve allowed Zhao, an Oscar winner for this year’s “Nomadland,” to do whatever she wants. While the freedom to create sounds ideal on paper, the actual result is an overlong (2 hours 45 minutes) movie that is one of Marvel’s dullest efforts in years—a convoluted film that is enervating and uninvolving. In short, be careful what you wish for, “Eternals” is creative freedom backfiring. But on paper, Zhao is doing all the right things and giving (some) audiences what they’ve wanted for years: room to breathe and meditate on character, provide ample room for emotion, and even include a sex scene (that is sadly, totally sexless). No matter the good intentions, the screenplay, credited to Chloé Zhao and Chloé Zhao & Patrick Burleigh and Ryan Firpo & Kaz Firpo (yes, Zhao, twice) is a chore and a convoluted one at that. “Eternals” is a chore to explain too, and even comes with an opening “Star Wars”-like crawl—it is by far the Marvel movie with the most mumbo jumbo backstory explaining the setup of things. The shortest possible version of that is this: Eternals are immortal aliens created by cosmic building beings called Celestials. Celestials build planets—Deviants, the CGI monsters, and bad guys of the movie—try and destroy civilization, and the Eternals are kind of like the space police that make sure Deviants don’t kill everyone. This group of Eternals, a cadre of fighters and thinkers, has been on Earth since the dawn of time, protecting humanity, but told they cannot intervene in any matters aside from the ones that involve Deviants (there’s no interfering in World Wars or the threat of Thanos). Set over two timelines—the past, seeing the Eternals over many different eras, empires, and civilizations—and present day, where the Eternals have long since broken up as a family unit. After a long, fight-‘em-up prologue in the past—seemingly inserted just to show some early action of the entire team in their glory—“Eternals” opens in the modern-day. Sersi (Gemma Chan from “Crazy Rich Asians”) is dating regular human, Natural History Museum historian Dane Whitman (Kit Harrington of “Game Of Thrones”), and while he suspects she’s “special,” doesn’t know the full extent of her powers. Sprite (Lia McHugh), an Eternal who has the appearance of a child, is constantly hanging around Sersi for some reason, but before anything can really be explained, the Deviant creatures—thought to be extinct for centuries and the reason the Eternals thought they no longer needed to exist as a team—have turned up suddenly (this means Sersi’s former flame, Ikaris, played by Richard Madden, precipitously returns too). Their inexplicable return sets off a chain reaction of plot that turns “Eternals” into a sort of long and winding cosmic murder mystery: how did the Deviants come back to life? Surely Ajak (Salma Hayek), the wise and spiritual leader of the Eternals will know the answer. In short, it’s time to get the Eternals band back together again, but the murder of one of their ten members points to a larger conspiracy afoot. Complicating matters, most of the Eternals are scattered to the winds, doing their own thing, many no longer interested in fulfilling their role of celestial enforcer (the most entertaining of these stories is Kumail Nanjiani as Kingo, an Eternal now posing as a Bollywood filmmaker and star). This story isn’t all that interesting, but at least it’s forward-moving with a clear and simple narrative goal in mind: find out who killed [redacted Eternal] and find out how this is all connected to the return of Deviants (the answer is an incomprehensible mess of wtf cosmic gibberish that only confuses and deflates the film further, think those overly elaborate scenes in “The Matrix: Reloaded” when the Architect grinds the movie to a halt with soul-draining exposition). But the already wonky “Eternals” pacing and plot is further mired by a structure that keeps jumping back in time, essentially demonstrating how the group broke up. The short answer is a crisis of conscience, led by Druig (Barry Keoghan). What good are these powers if they can’t be used to stop civilization and humanity from destroying itself some of them ask? With Deviants seemingly defeated, and the Eternals serving no purpose on Earth, without structure or the permission to help better humanity, the group dissolves. And while this central ethical question is the most interesting moral meat of the movie—losing faith in humanity— the way it gets there is long, circuitous, and fatiguing. By the time this backstory is all revealed (the mid-way point) and the present-day plot can finally move forward unencumbered, you just don’t really care and there’s still an hour-plus of movie to go. While there are some twists and surprises in the way of antagonists, none of them engaging enough to wake the film to life, and some of the true nature of Celestials, the central CGI-Deviant monster (even the super Deviant one that talks), is an extremely tiresome and uninteresting villain. Furthermore, with ten Eternals to get to (Angelina Jolie, Brian Tyree Henry, and Don Lee comprising some of the other members), you never really get much reason to care about anyone other than Sersi, who is really the heart of the story and the one Eternal that really believes in humanity (Sprite and Madden’s Ikaris are the two other major characters). While Zhao is a terrific filmmaker in her personal arthouse films (“Nomadland,” “The Rider”), not much of what makes those films so poetic and captivating is present here, aside from a similarly unhurried pace which does wonders in her own meditative films and is a kiss of death here. That’s maybe not entirely true. It’s pretty to look at too and has her trademark, low-lit, natural-light look is intact. And “Eternals” is admittedly ambitious and trying to do something different in the MCU. But neither of those aims are inherently good things, especially when the basics of a story never fully remotely come together (there’s a love story at its center which feels “new” for Marvel too, but it’s never affecting). In some senses, Zhao bucks the Marvel formula, but goes so far off-piste, everything that’s enjoyable about Marvel—the breezy snap, crackle, and pop of escapist watchable entertainment—go out the window in favor of something far more muddled. In another sense, it’s not all that different, just not orchestrated very well with an ill-advised structure that mars the entire affair.",NEUTRAL
"Oct 24, 2021"," REVIEW: Directly after the success of Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, the MCU is back with a new set of heroes to fight the good fight. Eternals tells the tale of a group of superpowered beings sent here to protect the citizens of Earth. The globe-trotting, multi-character adventure directed by Chloe Zhao features a star-studded cast. The Eternals include Gemma Chan as Sersi, Richard Madden as Ikaris, Kumail Nanjiani as Kingo, Lia McHugh as Sprite, Brian Tyree Henry as Phastos, Lauren Ridloff as Makkari, Barry Keoghan as Druig, Ma Dong-Seok as Gilgamesh. Oh, and did I happen to mention Angelina Jolie as Thena and Salma Hayek as Ajak? Well, they’re also part of this large cast of MCU’s next generation. The question is, how well does this new adventure fit into the already packed series of films? Let’s get into it. For centuries, the Eternals – Godlike immortal men and women created by the ancient Celestials – have protected the citizens of Earth from the monstrous Deviants – Celestial created beasts that wreak havoc as often as they can. Believing that they had rid humanity of the threat of the creatures, Sersi and Sprite soon find they were wrong. Sersi, now living a “human” life with her boyfriend, Dane Whitman (Kit Harington) – and accompanied by Sprite – come face to face with one of them. The discovery brings on a reunion of sorts for the Eternals, who all went their separate ways centuries before. Now, they must band together again to find out why the peaceful existence without the Deviants has ended. Why have these monsters returned? As they seek out the reason for the uproar, they must find the ability to trust each other, as well as themselves, once again. The best thing about Eternals is the sheer beauty on display. After having massive critical success with Nomadland – including a couple of Academy Award wins for her troubles – the director has found a bit of beauty in this sci-fi fantasy adventure. Along with DP Ben Davis, this visually sumptuous feature film manages to create quite the landscape. It’s a beautiful film. Whether it involves battles between monsters and heroes, or a striking image of someone flying too close to the sun, it’s quite a pretty picture here. At times, the CG goes a bit overboard – you know, like a lot of superhero flicks can – but most of the images on display are pretty damn impressive. It’s a bold and bright feature with a few inspired moments spread throughout the film. One of the most impressive feats of this modern tale is its ability to utilize the entire cast. Each character feels about as important as the other. Even Jolie appears to be fine stepping down and letting others shine. However, the same is not factual for Kit Harington. Playing Sersi’s boyfriend doesn’t lend itself to a ton of screentime. Could it be that the MCU has plans for him in the future? I think it’s a safe bet that’s a big yes. The standouts include young Lia McHugh’s Sprite as a world-weary soul with a secret. Brian Tyree Henry is also terrific, bringing a sense of humor and heart to this world. Harish Patel adds a bit of fun with his friendship with Kingo. And finally, Gemma Chan gives one of the most sincere performances in the film as a woman torn by her present and past. It’s a solid collection of actors who do their best to make this story work. The components are there to make a fun and engaging superhero flick. However, something is missing. Sure, the look of the film is impressive. As well, there was some serious money spent on the talent involved. Even the score by Ramin Djawadi works well. Yet it’s the script that doesn’t quite thrill. The story and pacing lag heavily. And this didn’t do this film any favors as it travels back and forth through time. With a ton of exposition and a couple of oddly timed comedic moments, and even a quick and unnecessary sex scene, it’s a bit difficult to fully invest in their plight. The ultimate goal and reason for the Deviants return may be slightly unexpected, but it’s just not that interesting. Sure, all this leads to a few twists and turns near the end. Unfortunately, getting to that point is only mildly amusing. Eternals is a decent flick, but it rarely manages to rise above what we’ve already seen from the MCU. With the visual style here, this could have been a brilliant introduction to this world of these immortal heroes and villains. The ideas presented can be strong, and it was nice to see a slightly different approach to this already crowded superhero genre. Even still, it was difficult to get overly excited about what is essentially a massive budget monster flick with ethereal-looking people trying to stop them. However, this is certain to be a hit. And who knows, with all the introductions out of the way and a couple of revealing post-credit sequences, there are exciting possibilities for the future of the Eternals. Let’s just hope the “Celestials” can come up with something more enjoyable for the sequel. Be warned though, a few too many spoilers giving away information on this one, so avoid reading them if you can.",NEUTRAL
"Oct 24, 2021"," It's been a long wait for Marvel's Eternals, and expectations for the film have only grown since Chloé Zhao won Best Director at the Oscars earlier this year for helming Nomadland. Eternals is easily Marvel's biggest undertaking when it comes to introducing characters, taking eleven people from the comics and attempting to give them all moments to shine throughout the film. While Eternals manages to navigate 7,000 years of backstory fairly seamlessly, the film's present-day plot ends up feeling muddled and occasionally confusing. Eternals succeeds in being a visual spectacle, but often falls flat when it comes to story. The Eternals are a race of immortal beings with superhuman powers who have secretly lived on Earth for thousands of years. However, they were instructed by powerful cosmic beings called Celestials to only help humans when evil creatures called Deviants are involved. After centuries without incident from the Deviants, the creatures begin to reappear, and the Eternals must reunite to stop them and take on a bigger force known as the ""Emergence."" There are ten Eternals to keep track of throughout the movie; Sersi (Gemma Chan), Ikaris (Richard Madden), Ajak (Salma Hayek), Thena (Angelina Jolie), Sprite (Lia McHugh), Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), Druig (Barry Keoghan), and Gilgamesh (Don Lee). There's also an important human in the mix, Dane Whitman (Kit Harington), who works with Sersi at the Natural History Museum in London.  Surprisingly, the film's writers (Zhao, Patrick Burleigh, Ryan Firpo, and Kaz Firpo) manage to not only flesh out each character but make you care about them and understand their various dynamics with each other. Each Eternal has a unique power and personality, and some get along better than others; some as friends, some as lovers. There has never been a Marvel movie with such a diverse cast and the film does an amazing job of showcasing representation without making it feel forced. Seeing a well-rounded cast of heroes is both invigorating and heartwarming, and it should set a precedent for the future of comic book films. The greatest thing about Eternals is that every Marvel fan is going to come out having a different favorite character. Each actor shines in their own way, giving 100% towards their performance, which is the only way to successfully make a movie about eleven people. Whether or not you like Eternals, you will surely get excited about at least one character's future in the MCU.  While the story of Eternals is lacking, the visuals are quite stunning thanks to the work of Zhao, who used practical locations throughout the film. This added some much-needed texture to the movie and helped save it from falling completely flat. With any luck, Zhao will get the chance to come back to this world for a sequel with a more focused plot.  One of Eternals biggest strengths is also a bit of a weakness. The movie stands completely on its own, which means you barely need any knowledge of the MCU to follow along. On one hand, this is one of the more refreshing and intriguing things about Phase Four. Eternals proves the MCU can take big risks and go absolutely anywhere. On the other hand, Eternals' disconnection from the rest of the franchise makes it less rewatchable than most of the movies that came before. Hopefully, the film will become more important to the overall MCU arc down the line, but for now, it feels more like a distant cousin than a part of the family. Of course, there are still delightful mid-credits and post-credits scenes that will hype you up for the future.  Eternals will likely be one of the more divisive films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The strong characters and visuals will be enough for some fans to consider it one of the best of the franchise while others will find its messy plot and extended runtime a hard pill to swallow. No matter how you feel about Eternals, there's no denying Phase Four is off to an exciting start.",POSITIVE

"Oct 24, 2021"," For considerable swaths of its hefty running time, Marvel Studios’ Eternals doesn’t feel much like the “typical” Marvel movie, whatever that may be. At its best, Eternals attempts to push the Marvel Cinematic Universe forward in new directions, much like Thor, the two Captain America sequels, Avengers: Infinity War and Black Panther did. While it may not ultimately be as successful as most of those films were at doing so, Eternals takes more than a few risks—almost payoff enough after 25 previously more traditional MCU outings. The Eternals themselves are probably among the most esoteric and obscure of Marvel’s thousands of characters, largely being visible to only the most diehard readers. Created by Jack Kirby and unveiled in 1976 via a 12-issue series written and drawn by the master, the Eternals were posited as a race of superbeings who watch over Earth at the behest of their creators, the gigantic cosmic beings known as the Celestials, and protect it from the Deviants, a monstrous race also accidentally created by the Celestials. The Eternals’ comic book mythos is long and complicated—even if they’ve appeared in print relatively rarely compared to other Marvel heroes—and it weaves together dozens of characters and storylines. Even Thanos himself is an Eternal, according to the comics. Marvel Studios has streamlined and altered the Eternals’ backstory for the screen, but it’s still unwieldy enough that the script by director Chloé Zhao, (Nomadland) and three other writers, has to work its way through a number of flashbacks and exposition dumps. Those prove to be among the sequences that make this 156-minute origin story feel slow and even inert at times, but they’re balanced out by (ironically enough) the humanity and intimacy that Zhao and her excellent cast bring to this millennia-spanning epic. The main narrative is kicked off in the present with the reappearance of Deviants—conceived here as the same kind of pouncing, overgrown CG monsters we’ve seen in countless other sci-fi films and not the intelligent, belligerent humanoids of the comics. This development occurs centuries after the Eternals seemingly eradicated them from the face of the Earth. The Eternals, 10 in all, have gone their separate ways since then, encouraged by their majestic, compassionate leader Ajak (Salma Hayek) to lead their own lives while they wait for the Celestials to return them to their home planet of Olympia. But the reemergence of the Deviants and other strange occurrences force them to reassemble. As the team reunites, old relationships, tensions, and grievances flare up while the team realizes that there may be more to their mission than they ever knew. Zhao, shooting with the same visual splendor of her previous films, yet also with more traditional compositions than those documentary-like outings required, crosscuts between the present day and a series of flashbacks that show the Eternals playing a shadow role in human history and debating just how much they can interfere in it (the rule: they can’t). We also learn the beginnings of the great romance between two of the group’s leaders, Sersi (Gemma Chan) and Ikaris (Richard Madden), an affair which has long cooled over the millennia, as well as the origins of the strange, dangerous madness that is slowly taking over the mind of powerful warrior Thena (Angelina Jolie). Some of the Eternals seem to have adjusted well to life as retired superheroes, such as Sersi who works familiarly enough to superhero movie fans as a museum curator. She’s also romancing a fellow worker named Dane Whitman (Kit Harington). Meanwhile Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani) has found an unusual way of creating and sustaining a career as a Bollywood star for the better part of a century. Weapons inventor Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry) has also settled down to a quiet life with his human family. But the most poignant might be Sprite (Liam McHugh), who’s trapped in the body of a 12-year-old and extremely resentful about it. It is the development of these characters and their relationships, and the largely excellent work of the cast members who inhabit them, that form the best parts of Eternals. Which conversely may make some fans looking for explosive fights and action sequences restless. The story ultimately puts our protagonists in a divisive moral quandary as well, with neither choice the “good” or “bad” one, and reasonable arguments made on either side. The action sequences that do occasionally punctuate the story, mostly involving the Deviants, are perfunctory and marred by the near-terrible CG of the monsters themselves, some of the shoddiest work we’ve seen to date in a Marvel movie (and quite shocking from the studio that brought us the magnificent Thanos). On the other hand, a fight scene involving several Eternals squaring off against each other is thrilling stuff, mainly thanks to the character dynamics that inform it, and also because it almost gives us a preview of what an X-Men movie could look like when one finally comes to the MCU. Speaking of the MCU, Eternals sets itself apart from its 25 cousins by rarely invoking any of them. Brief, passing mentions are made of Thanos, the Blip, and the Avengers, but this is a self-contained film and mini-universe within the larger canon, right down to the mid-credits and post-credits scenes (both of which are Marvel deep cuts, one quite good and the other feeling more like a cheap stunt). How and if the Eternals will find themselves interacting with the Avengers, the Guardians of the Galaxy, Thor, or anyone else in the MCU is a question that will presumably be answered in films to come. The film at hand certainly plays more like a relationship melodrama than a superhero action ride, with a majestic sweep, less of the usual quippy dialogue, and a few daring moments such as an actual (albeit still modest) love scene involving two unclothed adults. The film also features, in another sequence, the MCU’s first gay kiss. And here, unlike a similar moment in The Rise of Skywalker, that kiss feels at least somewhat earned and organic, thanks again to the cast and Zhao’s way with simple human interaction. Chan, Henry, Barry Keoghan (as the mind-controlling Druig), and Madden are all quite strong, with Chan bringing Sersi’s love for humanity to the forefront, and Madden adding imperfection to essentially the Superman of the group. Best is Nanjiani, who takes his usual comic persona in a dramatic direction as he wrestles with a painful existential conflict and blasts energy bolts from his hands. The weak link is Jolie, who does have a few good moments as Thena but, as usual, seems to be posing more than acting. Much better is a heartfelt Don Lee (Train to Busan) as her loyal friend, the super-strong Gilgamesh (in another first, the first Korean superhero in a Hollywood motion picture). The entire cast looks quite good in their Eternals costumes and guide their characters into effective mixes of the humane and the all-powerful. Zhao lines them up in a number of stunning shots throughout the film, and gives everything a colorful, widescreen texture that should be seen in a large theater. The presence of the great Kirby is felt throughout as well in the geometric designs that pervade the technology of the Eternals and the places where they’ve left their mark on in human history. Eternals itself is far from perfect, but—as with Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings and shows like WandaVision—it does indicate that the Marvel movie factory is not content to rest on its already massive bed of laurels. Introducing a large new cast of mostly unfamiliar characters, giving them a complex, time-spanning backstory, and making its central conflict more personal than usual, Eternals is not exactly the arthouse fare we’ve seen before from Zhao but it isn’t a typical superhero tentpole either. When it finds the sweet spot between both is when it works the best.",POSITIVE
"Oct 24, 2021","There are enough good elements here to warrant a fresh tomato, but wow did Chloe Zhao not understand the MCU assignment. Madden, Jolie, Nanjiani & Ridloff are the standouts.",POSITIVE
"Oct 24, 2021",Visually stunning. Marvel's most ambitious film to date. Leans a bit heavier on the exposition. The most different film in the entire MCU which is refreshing.,POSITIVE

"Oct 24, 2021"," This 26th offering from the Cinematic Universe introduces a new set of immortal, superhuman characters to fans that have lived on earth 5000 thousands of years, yet never age a day. While they are created to do this, they are not allowed to interfere in any other aspects of war, or change human history – something many of the Eternals struggle with over their long lives. This all-star crew of world-savers include Irkaris (Richard Madden) Ajak (Salma Hayak) Gemma Chan (Sersi), Druig (Barry Keoghan), Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani) and Angelina Jolie as Thena, who gives an oh-yes-I-remember-how-good-she-is-now performance as the slightly broken superhero. Chan and Madden lead the film, and while Madden plays the alpha character with laser eyes convincingly enough, Chan mostly hits one note with often blank expressions. Directed by double Oscar winning Chloé Zhao (Nomadland), it shows little of her distinctive style and has so many stories, time travelling and character crises running alongside each other you forget whose side you’re on. Zhao does give the Marvel fans an actual sex scene though, which is very unusual for the franchise, and there’s a superb section set in present day north London, which is a visual treat.",NEUTRAL
"Oct 24, 2021"," A couple of years ago, the actor Kumail Nanjiani posted a shirtless photograph on social media to unveil his brand new super-heroic physique. The freshly swollen and glazed star was formerly known for amiable turns in comedies like The Big Sick, but he revealed he had spent the past 12 months working with “the best trainers and nutritionists, paid for by the biggest studio in the world” to prepare for his role in Eternals, the latest item in the Marvel blockbuster portfolio.  Nanjiani plays one of a troupe of racially eclectic demigods who flew to Earth in 5,000 BC inside a giant chunk of Toblerone, and are now trying to stop a godlike robo-being that’s been gestating inside the planet from hatching out. Yet his muscles are nowhere to be seen. His character, whose name is Kingo, spends most of the film shooting computer-generated fireballs at computer-generated monsters, while dressed in a long-sleeved mauve tunic.  So why the urge to get buff in the first place? The answer is the problem with Eternals in miniature: it’s constantly engaged in a kind of grit-toothed authenticity theatre, going out of its way to show you it’s doing all the things proper cinema does, even though none of them bring any discernible benefit whatsoever to the film at hand.  Take the fact that many scenes have been shot out in the wild, rather than in green-screen-draped studios. The lighting is so flat and bland, and the actors’ performances so detached from their environments, that they might as well have stayed indoors and saved themselves the trip. Then there is the unusual decision to give the heroes some dramatic down time – banter over dinner, heart-to-hearts at sunset, romantic strolls and other indie drama staples. Again, it’s a promising idea, but it’s all so drearily written, you find yourself wishing they’d just get back to the fights.  The more muted tone rules out Marvel’s fast and flippant house style: instead, Eternals opts for solemnity peppered with wackiness, which occasionally gives it the feel of a Japanese anime series. (It also features the least brand cross-promotion since the first Guardians of the Galaxy.) Much is made of the fact the ten-strong team are capital-D diverse – which might have meant something if they weren't also completely capital-I insipid. Angelina Jolie’s regal swordswoman Thena is like a parody of a Jolie character: all piercing stares and breathy monologues, until it’s time for her CG avatar to tap in and perform some preposterous combat acrobatics. Nanjiani’s Kingo, who moonlights as a Bollywood megastar, has a musical number, yet inexplicably doesn’t actually sing in it. There is also a sex scene (chaste) and a gay kiss (fleeting): both moments that remain boundary-pushing in Marvel terms, which in itself is depressing beyond belief. Eternals was directed and co-written by the spectacularly talented Chloé Zhao, whose Nomadland won three Oscars including Best Picture earlier this year. (Marvel got in early, hiring her after the release of her second film, The Rider, in 2018.) But Zhao’s compassionate eye and poetic feel for landscape are nigh-on undetectable here, unless you count a few incidental shots of the Eternals wandering through villages, chatting to locals and helping with chores. Yet the fact they’ve been around since neolithic times raises an awkward question.  Why didn’t they intervene during the events of any of the previous 14 years of Marvel movies? And the explanation given is, essentially, that they’re a bunch of jobsworths: since they were put on Earth specifically to vanquish an alien race called Deviants, vanquishing Deviants is all they’ll do, with the rest hand-waved through on the grounds that it’s character-building (wars stimulate technological progress, and so on). Perhaps the hope was that Marvel’s 26th film might rattle the franchise out of its comfort zone. But the franchise is nothing but comfort zone, which renders its latest entry an instant white elephant.",NEUTRAL
"Oct 24, 2021"," By hiring Academy Award winner Chloé Zhao to helm its much-awaited Eternals and handle the cinematic introduction of 10 new superheroes in its canon, Marvel has not lost its marbles. And no, its not sending the MCU in the art house direction of Nomadland and The Rider, the two most notable Zhao-directed films to date. Instead, it is putting an important and potentially gold mine of a new franchise into the hands of a filmmaker who clearly has the chops to pull off the action and special effects necessary, but also, more crucially, put the emphasis on the human side of things. In the post-Avengers era of the MCU, this is an encouraging move on the part of producer Kevin Feige, and one bound to pay off with fans, if not necessarily add devotees of Zhao’s previous, more austere work to the legions of MCU fanatics. For the 25th Marvel film, and perhaps the one that will be most indicative of the future directions of the Disney-owned powerhouse, Zhao has quite a job to do in introducing us to 10, count ’em, 10 new superhero characters, who, at the end of the endless end credits, are already promised (in James Bond fashion) to “return.” Tell that to the Fantastic Four, just one example of where a franchise can go terribly wrong and fans revolt. Marvel needs not worry, because even for the casual moviegoer not invested in every twist and turn in these epics (count me in on that), this is an accomplished and entertaining comic book movie that manages to somehow keep us engaged and invested in the journeys of this group of apparently immortal fighters and thinkers, as they are divided and defined, who had been doing their thing in consistently and collectively saving humanity from itself ever since the dawn of man about 7000 years ago. As we meet them, they are spread out all over the globe in the present day, as these immortal aliens from the planet Olympia have managed to immerse themselves largely into the actual human population, protecting us from evil creatures known as the Deviants. The latter had long been thought vanquished, but now have emerged again, forcing the Eternals, led by matriach Ajak (Salma Hayek), who also has a direct line to the all-important Celestrials, to bring them back together in Seven Samurai style to once again save Earth from extinction. Like so many of these comic book setups, Eternals has the bones of a classic Western, and Zhao and her co-writers (Patrick Burleigh and Ryan and Kaz Firpo, the latter pair also with Story credit) have done their best to give each distinctive personalities, abilities, self doubts and complexities to make this all work over the course of two and a half hours. The running time might have been trimmed, because it felt like Eternals, with a number of “endings,” actually takes an eternity to sign off.  That is a quibble that no doubt will be manna from heaven, in fact, for fans of this kind of thing, who probably would want it go on longer. But it does clearly take a village to save the universe, and we have got one here. Most intriguingly, we have Angelina Jolie finally succumbing to membership in the MCU, effectively cast as Thena, a fighter more comfortable with her abilities in battle than in her own skin. Jolie is striking in the role, which relies on physicality far more than words. Also impressive is Gemma Chan (Captain Marvel, Crazy Rich Asians) as Sersi, a talented thinker who, while true to her multi-thousand-years duties, is also fancying merging with the human race and close male friend Dane Whiteman (Kit Harrington), who holds the banner for actual people here. She has also been romantically linked over the many centuries to Ikaris (Richard Madden), a dashing fighter with true swashbuckling style who finds hanging on to a serious relationship for all eternity isn’t easy. The most entertaining of these Eternals is definitely Kumail Nanjiani’s Kingo, a fighter who now, in his down time after thousands of years in the spotlight of various wars and victories for the Eternals, still wants the fan adoration. So, of course, he becomes a major star of Bollywood movies. These scenes are worth the price of admission, and Nanjiani fits this superhero motif with all the required panache and comic relief, accompanied by his faithful valet Kurun (Harish Patel). Lia McHugh nicely transforms as Sprite, a frustrated fighter stuck forever in the body of a 12-year-old. Barry Keoghan is the sometimes-difficult thinker Druig, who can make trouble for his colleagues, to be sure. We also have the first deaf member of the MCU in the presence of Makkari, a fighter played eloquently and effectively by deaf star Lauren Ridloff. This is no mere “woke” piece of casting, but a character and actor that belong as much as anyone. Also making his own history here is the terrific scene-stealer Brian Tyree Henry as the thinker Phastos, responsible for much of the tech abilities of the group, who has settled into a nice domestic life with his male partner and child. The fact that there is a same-sex kiss on screen, and it is done as no big deal, shows maybe we are coming farther than we thought in this genre. Finally, Don Lee is a complete delight as Gilgamesh, another fighter and cohort of Thena, who is fearsome on the battlefield but a pussycat at heart. This is one hell of a diverse cast, but the actual casting never brings attention to itself, and for that, Zhao and her casting director Sarah Halley Finn (Avengers) deserve genuine applause. The film itself has top production credits, no easy task here, as there are lots of epic-style flashbacks mixed in with the present day. The action darts from 7000 BC and Mesopotamia to 2500 BC and Babylon to 400 AD and the Gupta Empire to 1521 AD and the Aztec Empire and….well you get the idea.  Cinematographer Ben Davis shoots it all superbly and even manages those great landscapes and sunsets that Zhao has showcased in her earlier indie efforts. Zhao seamlessly uses expert filmmaking skills weaned on a smaller scale to great effect on this huge canvas. Nate Moore joins Feige as producer. Disney releases Eternals in theatres only (for at least a 45-day window before hitting Disney+) on November 5, and theaters are definitely where this should be seen. It is the second consecutive post-Avengers era Marvel movie to show encouraging new signs of life; last month’s Shang-Chi was the other one.

"Oct 24, 2021"," The sci-fi saga, which features a star-studded ensemble cast, follows a group of immortal aliens who have been secretly living on Earth for thousands of years, waiting for the moment they are needed to protect humanity. The repercussions of the Avengers’ decision to reverse The Snap continue to ripple through the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) in Oscar-winning director Chloe Zhao’s origin story for a new supergroup of otherworldly protectors. Set directly after Bruce Banner wields the Infinity Gauntlet in Avengers: Endgame and snaps his fingers to restore beings in the universe eliminated by Thanos, Eternals initiates a seven-day countdown to a cataclysmic event called the Emergence, which will render humanity obsolete. An opening crawl, a la Star Wars, succinctly distils a new mythology that dismisses the Big Bang Theory and introduces an ancient race of beings known as Celestials, led by the mighty Arishem, which have shaped our universe for millennia. Zhao’s script, co-written by Patrick Burleigh, Ryan Firpo and Kaz Firpo, tests that bitter sentiment and the gossamer-thin moral threads separating heroes from villains to breaking point using one of the most diverse, inclusive teams in the sprawling MCU. Deaf actress Lauren Ridloff communicates with her fellow Eternals in American Sign Language, Brian Tyree Henry portrays one half of the franchise’s first openly gay relationship and the ranks are filled with strong, powerful women including the group’s spiritual leader, played by Salma Hayek. By shifting the focus away from special effects-laden action set-pieces and on to character arcs and storytelling, Zhao bloats the running time to an uncomfortable two-and-a-half hours and delivers arguably the least adrenaline-pumping Marvel escapade to date. It’s a brave new world and she reduces dramatic momentum with copious flashbacks to 575 BC Babylon, 400 AD in the Gupta Empire and 1521 AD Tenochtitlan to illustrate bonds between the Eternals’ leader Ajak (Hayek), who possesses the power of healing, and dutiful acolytes Ikaris (Richard Madden), Sersi (Gemma Chan), Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), Sprite (Lia McHugh), Phastos (Tyree Henry), Makkari (Ridloff), Druig (Barry Keoghan), Gilgamesh (Don Lee) and Thena (Angelina Jolie). Jumping forward to the present, Sersi lectures on ancient artefacts at the Natural History Museum in London with her unsuspecting boyfriend Dane (Kit Harington), Kingo is an egotistical Bollywood star with a doting manager (Harish Patel), and Phastos has embraced fatherhood with his architect husband (Haaz Sleiman). Eternals bears Zhao’s fingerprints as the most emotionally intimate Marvel story to date and while it’s an ambitious adaptation of the comic books in many respects, including an artfully composed al fresco sex scene, some conventions remain, including tantalising scenes embedded in the end credits. The first humorously teases one direction for the franchise’s next chapter while a second hints at a character’s complicated family history dating back to medieval England. Flecks of humour, courtesy of Nanjiani and Tyree Henry, are extremely welcome as are the few occasions when scriptwriters exercise brevity – like a verbal allusion to Peter Pan to untangle a messy love triangle.",POSITIVE
"Oct 24, 2021"," More than any other Marvel movie since the start of this whole MCU phenomenon, director Chloé Zhao’s Eternals feels like “just a superhero movie.” Kevin Feige’s Marvel movies have, to various degrees, differentiated themselves from each other and from the competition by appropriating various genres and selling them as “superhero-plus” action spectacles. Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a Tom Clancy-ish spy thriller, Ant-Man is a heist flick, Shang-Chi is a wuxia fantasy, etc., etc. Eternals, comparatively, just presents a centuries-spanning story of celestial superbeings whose defining attributes are their immortality and their arbitrary superpowers. At its worst, it plays like exactly the kind of run-of-the-mill “But, it’s about superheroes!” franchise-starter that Hollywood has doomed itself trying to craft in the wake of Batman Begins and The Avengers. At its best, it’s actually a meta-textual approximation not of any genre but of a rival brand. In a skewed, unsubtle way, Eternals plays like Marvel trying their hand at a Zack Snyder-ish DC Comics movie. The cast of immortal aliens have a more-than-passing resemblance to your favorite DC Super Friends. For example, Richard Madden is “not Superman,” Salma Hayek (who wants to protect humanity whether or not they deserve it) is “not Wonder Woman,” Kumail Nanjiani (who can project cosmic energy from his hands) is “not Green Lantern,” Lauren Ridloff is “not The Flash,” and Brian Tyree Henry (a brilliant scientist with a grim view of humanity who dresses in blue) is “not Batman.” I can’t speak to the origins of the Jack Kirby’s original comic book, so this may all be source-faithful, but the film’s pondering (and sometimes compelling) conversations about the role of invincible gods living among mere mortals and the debates about whether to shape their own destiny against the will of higher powers will remind folks of Man of Steel and both cuts of Justice League. Alas, these folks don’t have the advantage of being established/iconic superheroes, so in this film they come off as off-brand knock-offs. Even with a 2.5 hour runtime, the screenplay (courtesy of Patrick Burleigh, Ryan Firpo and Kaz Firpo) struggles to balance the world-specific exposition and character development for nearly a dozen wholly new human characters. Guardians of the Galaxy had five newbies to introduce, only three of which were human, amid a conventional narrative that required little on-the-go explanation. In this case, the to-type casting (save for a fine against-type Barry Keoghan) does a lot of heavy lifting. Eternals spends much of its running time detailing the past-tense adventures of these ageless protectors. Only the third (and best) act focuses on present-tense storytelling. What action we get is mostly the same “superpowered heroes shoot effects out of their hands or throw punches to defeat CGI-created monsters.” That trick got old even when Guillermo Del Toro’s (still-superior) Hellboy overdosed on same back in 2004. Much of Eternals plays as if the mere idea of a superhero movie with CGI monsters is still special. Like most Marvel movies, this one is 95% stand-alone, save for awkward conversations about why the Eternals didn’t pitch in during Infinity War (real answer - the fight lasted less than a day and the Eternals might not have been aware of it at the time) and trailer-friendly debates about whether any of them should lead the now-defunct Avengers. That said, the film doesn’t really offer up much of a reason for why we should want to see more of these specific MCU superheroes either in a sequel or tagging along in a team-up. Nanjiani is amusing per usual (and I like how his arc plays out) and Henry is winningly droll, but otherwise most of the cast comes off like ordinary superheroes in an ordinary superhero narrative. Gemma Chan is technically the film’s lead, and she’s quite good even if she mostly has to react to fantastical events and/or showier co-stars in her midst. The film still plays out like a glorified prequel for the sequel in a way closer to Fantastic Four than Batman Begins.",NEUTRAL
"Oct 24, 2021"," The Times is committed to reviewing theatrical film releases during the COVID-19 pandemic. Because moviegoing carries risks during this time, we remind readers to follow health and safety guidelines as outlined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and local health officials. I don’t know if this constitutes a spoiler, but it might just count as news: The latest Marvel movie, “Eternals,” actually features a sex scene. It’s pretty short (the scene, not the movie) and not particularly steamy, which has less to do with the chemistry of the participants than the chilly-looking riverbank they’ve chosen for the occasion. We’re in Babylon circa 575 B.C., and Ikaris (Richard Madden) and Sersi (Gemma Chan), immortal beings known as Eternals, are expressing their love not just for each other but also for the planet they will spend the next several thousand years trying to protect. Happily, director Chloé Zhao seems to have resisted the temptation to film them writhing on a beach, perhaps aware that she isn’t making “From Here to Eternals.” To be sure, one PG-13-rated snippet of superhero hanky-panky probably isn’t going to undo the terminal chastity of the Marvel enterprise, which has spent almost 30 films largely squandering the erotic appeal of skin-hugging suits and supernaturally toned abs. But that discussion will have to wait for another day. The point is that, in a couple of key and already loudly advertised respects, “Eternals” isn’t entirely Marvel business as usual. That’s hardly the worst news for those of us who bring a reflexive skepticism to each of this franchise’s offerings, whether good (“Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings”), bad (“Black Widow”) or, in this movie’s case, somewhere wackily in-between. The Avengers are briefly mentioned and never seen. There are no crash courses in tesseract physics or Asgardian politics. Instead there are crystalline images (shot by Ben Davis) of sandy beaches, surreal rock formations and active volcanoes, set against music (composed by Ramin Djawadi) that’s less Alan Silvestri than “Koyaanisqatsi”-era Philip Glass. The action jumps between centuries and sometimes millennia for reasons that have nothing to do with the quantum realm. As present-day scenes blur into prehistoric flashbacks and the running time swells past two hours, our heroes find themselves in the grip of an existential mystery: What are we doing here? Why did our maker put us here, and why has he fallen silent for so long? To these alternately ravished and glazed-over eyes, then, “Eternals” plays like an extravagant blockbuster riff on “The Tree of Life” — a connection that would feel deliberate even if a giant tree didn’t spring forth in one of the movie’s lovelier CGI epiphanies. Like more than a few filmmakers, Zhao has long counted Terrence Malick an influence; like relatively few filmmakers, she has managed to channel that inspiration in ways that feel more than merely imitative. There’s little of Malick’s whispery cosmic lyricism in her trilogy of rough-hewn independent features — “Songs My Brothers Taught Me,” “The Rider” and last year’s Oscar-winning “Nomadland” — but there is a vision of nature both humble and exalted, as well as a fascination with human lives in all their quotidian glory. Some of that fascination lingers in “Eternals,” if not nearly enough. There are a few charming glimpses of superhero domesticity, one of which, featuring Brian Tyree Henry and Haaz Sleiman, is sweet enough to feel like more than the sum of the “Marvel’s first gay kiss” headlines it’s bound to generate. Ajak (Salma Hayek), the Eternals’ wise, cryptic leader, is shown making her home on the South Dakota plains, which reinforces Zhao’s auteur signature and makes a nicely muted visual contrast with the more colorful, plotty scenes in contemporary London and ancient Mesopotamia. That last spot marks the official beginning of the story, laid out in a convulsively time-shuffling script adapted (by Zhao, Patrick Burleigh, Ryan Firpo and Kaz Firpo) from Jack Kirby’s original comic books. In 5,000 B.C., the Eternals first descend to Earth from a gleaming rectangular spaceship that looks a bit like the “2001” obelisk and a bit like something out of a Formica catalog. Armed with names derived from various mythologies — there’s a Thena (Angelina Jolie), but also a Gilgamesh (Don Lee) — and beautifully filigreed CG weapons, these 10 fighters have been sent here by their all-powerful creators, the Celestials, to protect humanity from a race of resilient, ribbony, vaguely chimera-like monsters called Deviants. Cut to the present day, when we learn that the Eternals have been scattered to the winds, until a renewed threat from the rapidly evolving Deviants (which I kept thinking of as the Variants) forces them to reunite. Extended flashbacks fill in the various personal fallouts and professional disappointments that transpired during the 7,000 years in between. From the beginning, the Celestials instruct the Eternals to blend in with their surroundings — an easier task for the impish shapeshifter Sprite (Lia McHugh) than for, say, someone played by Angelina Jolie — and to use their superpowers only when Deviants are involved. As the centuries pass, those restrictions become frustrating for a tech genius like Phastos (Henry), who laments humanity’s growing facility with weapons, or a gifted telepath like Druig (a terrifically dry Barry Keoghan), who could single-mindedly stop all wars and genocides but is forbidden to do so. This strict non-interventionist policy, handed down from on high with little explanation, frustrates their do-gooder impulses — Why can’t they do their job and save humanity? — even as it nudges them toward the harder question of whether humanity is actually worth saving. The evidence would suggest the answer is no, as we can see from the fall of Tenochtitlan and a tacky flashback to the smoky ruins of Hiroshima. Like a softer-edged, brighter-colored version of last year’s “The Old Guard,” “Eternals” tracks a group of ageless fighters forced to bear the toll of endless, pointless atrocities. Our propensity for violence and chaos is of course part of what makes us human. But so is our capacity for wit, grace and beauty, some of which is on display in an amusing Bollywood-style production number starring Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), the Eternals’ designated musical-comedy relief, and also in the warm romantic byplay between Sersi and her hunky post-Ikaris mortal squeeze (Kit Harington). The question of free will comes to a head when the Eternals catch up with Druig, who now oversees a community of peaceful, blissfully mind-controlled humans living deep in the South American jungle. (Even those who griped that Zhao made Amazon look good in “Nomadland” might be unprepared for how good she makes the Amazon look here.) All this philosophical hand-wringing, presented with the expected complement of wisecracking banter, gives “Eternals” an initially pleasurable mix of goofiness and gravity. It would be nice to report that this fusion made Zhao’s movie a surreally trippy outlier in the Marvel cosmos, a picture that succeeded in liberating itself from the creative shackles of our most ubiquitous big-screen (and small-screen) franchise. The longer it goes on, however, and the more it explains itself, the less these free-will-obsessed characters seem to evince any agency of their own. They’re trapped in what increasingly plays like an off-brand, off-its-game “Avengers” movie, in which various attention-grabbing firsts — whether it’s the speedy Makkari (Lauren Ridloff) becoming Marvel’s first Deaf superhero or Chan’s Sersi serving as Marvel’s first Asian female headliner — haven’t been sufficiently developed as characters beyond their representational precedents. The Eternals’ onscreen struggle, pitting them against the whims of a grimly authoritarian overlord, too precisely mirrors their relationship to the Disney/Marvel corporate apparatus that created them and that will exploit them until  their potential is exhausted. What initially seemed fresh and invigorating devolves into something you’ve seen countless times before: The fate of the world hinges on an epic burst of teamwork, as well as one character’s perfunctory realization of long-suppressed potential. Longtime friends betray and forgive each other, and eyes and hands shoot bolts of gilded lightning. A rush of end-credits cliffhangers elicits gasps from the audience, and the final title card — “Eternals will return” — starts to sound less like a promise than a threat. You walk out in the depressing realization that you’ve just seen one of the more interesting movies Marvel will ever make, and hopefully the least interesting one Chloé Zhao will ever make.

"Oct 24, 2021"," ""Eternals"" boasts A-listers from Angelina Jolie and Salma Hayek to Kumail Nanjiani and the film offers some of Marvel's most shocking moments. Unfortunately, much of the talent is underutilized in this stacked cast. Directed by Academy Award winner Chloé Zhao (""Nomadland""), the film stumbles for the first hour as several plotlines in the movie compete to be the main star.  From the start, we're introduced to 10 super-powered beings, a group called Eternals, who were sent to Earth 7,000 years ago to defeat a monstrous group known as Deviants and help mankind thrive. Each Eternal is bestowed with a unique set of gifts, including flight, laser beams, brute strength, super speed, and the power to heal, among others. From the large opening fight sequence, it looks like the Eternals would have been handy in a lot of the previous MCU battles. Conveniently, the group was told not to interfere with any human dilemmas — like taking on Thanos — unless instructed to do so by a mysterious force that's better left explained in theaters. After 5,000 years together, the Eternals fracture into smaller groups to try and find their own separate paths on Earth. In the present, the gang must get back together to prevent the destruction of the planet while also fighting off those mysterious Deviants. Much of the film is spent painstakingly gathering the Eternals to stop an event called the Emergence, while also dealing with the Deviants who may or may not have anything to do with Earth's end of days. Simultaneously, some of the Eternals are navigating relationship drama. There's a love triangle between Gemma Chan, Richard Madden, and Kit Harington's characters (because why not?) while a different member of the group sometimes wants to murder them all (but not on purpose). Though the second half of the film is better with great action sequences and beautifully constructed moments that feel out of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" or the end of 1968's ""Planet of the Apes,"" it doesn't make up for an oddly structured part one that feels like it was pieced together, taken apart, and then Frakensteined all over again. In the comics, there are dozens of Eternals. While the 10 in the movie are a solid representation, the film deviates so much from the comics that it doesn't matter which members were chosen. The movie would have been better served by having three or so fewer main characters to let the storylines breathe. Audiences expecting to see Jolie as a gorgeous warrior may be disappointed to learn her character struggles with a memory issue and is essentially babysat by another Eternal, Don Lee's Gilgamesh, sidelining both characters for the majority of the film. Imagine benching Jolie and Lee, the latter a huge South Korean star (watch him in ""Train to Busan""). When they're finally allowed to show off their fighting skills, those are some of the film's best sequences. Meanwhile, Hayek's Ajak is the maternal leader of the group with her healing powers, but she's not given much to do. Once you see her character's arc, it's not difficult to understand why the actress told Elle she ""got into a serious fight"" with the film's director over the script. Touted as Marvel's first deaf superhero, Lauren Ridloff (""The Walking Dead"") is underutilized and feels like a mere check of the diversity box. It's a shame because a moment late in the film showing her character's super speed drew cheers from the premiere crowd. By the film's end, we know little of her background and motivations. Perhaps none of this should be a surprise once you know Ridloff told The Hollywood Reporter that the cast ""had a hard time... agreeing on what exactly the story was going to end up being."" It sounds like there may have been too many cooks in the kitchen offering ideas for what Marvel's ""Eternals"" should look like. It shows. Even the Deviants get the short end of the stick. Explained far too quickly, they appear as little more than typical CGI Marvel monsters. But, if you've read the comics, you know that's not the case — they're likened to tortured souls who weren't created as beautifully as the Eternals. We start to see that hinted at with one particular Deviant, Kros, but the film never takes the initiative to deep dive into an exploration of his species.  At one point, it seems the film may touch upon a history between Kros and one of the Eternals, but the moment quickly passes. It's yet another missed opportunity. Chan, Madden, and Lia McHugh are all standouts. Madden is, essentially, Marvel's Superman who can fly and shoot beams out of his eyes. He's nearly indestructible. Chan's Sersi, who has a soft spot for humans, and McHugh's Sprite, a thousand-year-old Eternal trapped in a 12-year-old's body, are the film's heart. Harington is delightfully funny, too, as Sersi's human boyfriend, Dane Whitman. He previously showed off his comedic chops in HBO's ""7 Days in Hell."" He's not in the film much, but the actor told Insider we can hopefully expect to see more of him in the future. But it's Kumail Nianjiani who steals every scene in the movie and gets the film's best quip as Kingo. ""Eternals"" didn't come alive until Nianjiani re-entered the movie in a Bollywood dance sequence, which the actor spent months learning. Get this man his own Disney+ spin-off. A complaint critics often have reviewing any Marvel movie is that the stakes never feel high. Real harm rarely comes to the main characters because they need to be back for a sequel.  One of the most impressive things ""Eternals"" does is let you know that it's a more mature movie right from the start. It's not afraid to get violent. ""Eternals"" is as close to Disney's version of ""The Suicide Squad"" as we may ever get. There are some truly shocking moments in the film and at least one twist you likely won't guess. One of those shocking moments comes very early on in the movie and may disappoint some fans.  Parents of young children should be aware there's a sex scene in the movie. Though it's a close-up shot of two characters, there's obvious thrusting. For a Marvel movie, it seemed unnecessary since the audience is told the two characters have been together for thousands of years. We didn't need them to prove it with a 10-second lovemaking scene.  When Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry) finally rejoins the Eternals, we meet not just him, but his husband and son who were previously revealed in marketing. They're Marvel's first openly gay family and their inclusion is presented without feeling shoe-horned in the way it has in previous Disney films.  It shouldn't have taken 25 Marvel movies to see an openly gay character in the MCU. (No, that moment in ""Avengers: Endgame"" was not great representation.) During the film's premiere, Marvel Studios' president, Kevin Feige, told Variety that ""Eternals"" is ""just the start"" of representation on screen. To its credit, the film's final 30 or so minutes — once the Eternals are finally gathered together, fighting for a cause — are excellent. There are big reveals as puzzle pieces set up in the first half come together. The film may have benefitted from making some of these reveals known earlier.  Both end-credits scenes are two of Marvel's best, and each has huge ramifications for the future of the MCU. But you shouldn't have to sit through a so-so movie to see them. In ""Eternals,"" it seems like Marvel wanted another ""Guardians of the Galaxy."" The 2014 surprise hit was an adaptation of an obscure comic book that grossed $772 million worldwide. Marvel likely figured they could do the same with ""Eternals,"" an equally obscure comic the company revitalized. But in this case, lightning didn't strike twice. The difference with ""Guardians"" is you fall in love with each fully fleshed-out character. By introducing too many characters all at once, ""Eternals"" became disjointed and hard to follow, even if you were well-versed in the comics. Ultimately, ""Eternals"" tried to do too much — it wanted to be a romance and an end-of-world spectacle while introducing 10 new diverse heroes, multiple villains, and another potential antihero. Sadly, there were too many cooks in the kitchen. ",NEGATIVE
"Oct 24, 2021"," A funny thing happened during the construction of a series of shareholder-pleasing, fan service tentpoles: actual storytelling broke out, the kind that has more to say about our real lives than it does the continuity of a fictional universe. A film full of wonder and romance and fueled by an agenda and audacity all its own, Chloé Zhao’s Eternals, the 26th-but-whose-counting film in a series that has reshaped modern filmgoing (mostly—at least for those who prefer surprise when visiting movie houses—for the worse), is a rare reminder of the power and purpose of event filmmaking beyond filling corporate coffers. Eternals ★★★1/2
(3.5/4 stars)
Directed by: Chloé Zhao
Written by: Chloé Zhao, Patrick Burleigh, Ryan Firpo, and Kaz Firpo
Starring: Gemma Chan, Richard Madden, Angelina Jolie, Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry, Lia McHugh, Don Lee, Salma Hayek, Barry Keoghan, Lauren Ridloff and Kit Harington
Running time: 157 mins. Here is a movie that builds myths around characters whose outsized powers are matched by their emotions and whose epic adventures navigating immortality has left them with a shattered understanding of the nature and value of humanity. In the process, it helps us make sense of and find meaning in our own fractured world. Whereas the initial cycle of Marvel Movies was a reaction to and reprocessing of the tragedy of 9/11, the new wave of movies has placed the focus squarely on the sins of our fathers. Whether it was Natasha Romanoff in Black Widow untangling her relationships with burly father figures both oafish and evil (David Harbour’s Red Guardian and Ray Winstone’s Dreykov, respectively) or Shang-Chi’s power-hungry but otherwise absent paterfamilias (Tony Leung’s Mandarin), the Bad Dad era has come crashing down upon the MCU like an exploding Helicarrier. The Eternals, a coterie of godlike beings sent to Earth many millennia ago with the very limited but crucial mission of battling their destructive counterparts (the unfortunately named Deviants), begin to fracture as they consider whether to defy their maker and leader Arishem, a six-eyed, red-armored being of untold and seemingly unlimited abilities, when he instructs them not to interfere with Earth’s impending destruction. Leading the pro-Earth contingent is Sersi (Crazy Rich Asian’s Gemma Chan) who can manipulate matter with a touch of her hand. She singlehandedly ushered in the Bronze Age some 5,000 years ago by turning a knife from stone to metal, a relic now on display at the museum where she works as an educator and furtively dates her coworker Dane (Game of Thrones’ Kit Harrington), who will undoubtedly play a larger role in future movies. In the opposite contingent, and seriously complicating her budding relationship, is the love of her unending life, Richard Madden’s Ikaris. Flying to and fro as he shoots blasts of cosmic energy from his eye sockets and sports a blank scowl, Ikaris treats the fate of humanity with the disinterested shrug of a bored teenager who has been given anything he wants. Almost all the relationships between the many Eternals crackle with energy and history. But the connection between Sersi and Ikaris (who among us has not known a couple like this?) brings to bear something that these movies have all but given up on: sexual and romantic vibrancy. Angelina Jolie, playing the supersized team’s ultimate warrior Thena while dripping with sensuousness, also helps on this front. But she mostly serves a different purpose. After witnessing the life cycle of at least one planet and possibly many more, the burden of those memories has afflicted her with something called “mad weary,” which sounds like an ennui-inflicted British rapper, but is these godlike beings’ version of Alzheimer’s. For anyone who has cared for a loved one suffering from dementia, seeing the Eternals strongman Gilgamesh (Train to Busan’s Don Lee) protect and nurture Thena as she lashes out on him and others is deeply moving. It also calls to mind how Brady looked after his sister, friend, and broken horses in Chloé Zhao’s remarkable 2018 film, The Rider. One of the most impressive aspects of the Eternals is how the culturally representative team’s identities play into the theme and story in powerful and essential ways; these are not just a series of boxes to check. For example, when the legality of your family unit could be wiped away on the whim of a politically stacked judiciary— as is the case with team’s tinkerer Phastos (a wonderfully emotive Brian Tyree Henry), a father married to an architect played by Lebanese actor Haaz Sleiman— it makes sense to question an overlord’s capricious and destructive orders. The cosmic energy that the individual Eternals spin into their outfits, power blasts, weapons, and trinkets swirl and swoosh like doodles of endless possibility— a pulsing gold version of the magical lines created by Harold’s purple crayon. The whole film carries this same sort of precocious, playful sense of discovery and creation, giving even its most portentous and seemingly political moments joyful buoyancy. As is the case with any movie this maximal (the film is just a skosh shorter than the original Godfather), Eternals often borders on being simply too much. It is inevitable that one if not several of its buffet line of lead characters would get short shrift; Kumail Nanjiani’s lightly vainglorious Kingo, who spends his eternity on Earth becoming a Bollywood star, feels particularly ill-defined. Mostly though, Zhao keeps the movie’s inherent bigness working in her favor. This is a film that asks on a grand scale questions we grapple with every day. How do we navigate and understand difference? Why do we value humanity so much when humans often do not seem to value each other? Zhao keeps these far-reaching propositions grounded through the laser-like focus of her vision and the precision of the images dreamed up by her and veteran MCU lensman Ben Davis. For once in a movie like this, ocean waves and cloudscapes carry as much weight as the ultra-choreographed battles between intergalactic interlopers. But none of it means more than when she holds the camera close in on the incredible faces of her actors. Either full of awe or overcome with emotion, these faces remind us that, in this case at least, there is a beating heart and animating spirit just below the surface of this highly polished and always humming machine.

"Oct 24, 2021"," I’ve yet to meet anyone who dislikes Chloé Zhao’s spartan, Oscar-winning epic, Nomadland. Her new movie will be more divisive. It’s a lavish, ambitious, Marvel superhero movie that starts with the words: “In the beginning… before the six singularities…” Any viewer who reads that and thinks “before the what now?” is in for a galaxy of pain. So let’s just assume you’re au fait with all things connected to the six infinity stones, that you’re on board with the idea that the titular immortals, controlled by even more powerful group known as Celestials, have been protecting humans for 7,000 years, and that, at the very least, you’re intrigued by Zhao’s incredible, incredibly diverse, cast, which includes two middle-aged actresses in major roles. Like Rachel Weisz in Black Widow, Angelina Jolie and Salma Hayek fight for the right to look non-fetal in an action movie and emerge triumphant. Hayek is Ajak, the serene healer in charge of the the Eternals, who the gang half-jokingly refer to as “mummy”. Matricide, by the way, is a big theme. Without giving away crucial plot details, Ajak’s second in command is laser-eyed Ikaris (Richard Madden), but Ajak’s favourite child is matter-shifting, self-doubting Sersi (Gemma Chan) who, at the start of the movie, is living in London. As our heroes are shown dealing with a race of predators, aka Deviants, a cunning parallel is drawn between Ikaris and Sersi and Peter Pan and Wendy (this Peter and Wendy were lovers, back in the day, and had actual sex, but the comparison still works). There’s a Tinkerbell in the mix, too, in the form of the gang’s one teen member, the discontented, confused and lustful illusionist, Sprite (Lia McHugh). I’ve always loved the deeply flawed Tinkerbell. Zhao does the J M Barrie character proud, not just by giving Sprite juicy dialogue, but via the youngster’s non-binary, retro-but-modern look (think Doctor Who meets Cocteau Twins’ Elizabeth Fraser meets Greta Thunberg). Sprite, basically, is full of nice and nasty surprises. Also fascinating and funny, particularly in their modern forms, are Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), Makkari (Lauren Ridloff) and Druig (Barry Keoghan). In the present day, Kingo is a pampered Bollywood film-star and Phastos has a kid and an Arab husband. Meanwhile, Druig is an Amazon rainforest shamen and Makkari, the first deaf superhero, is bored as hell. This lot are endlessly smart and sarky. We’re used to top-notch bickering from Marvel but the self-aware, sibling-like rivalry here seems extra divine because it allows ideas explored in Nomadland to be revisited. Maybe we don’t need a “true home” in our lives. Or a “boss”. The whole cast are fabulous, with one exception. Chan’s a bit wooden. As far as the script’s concerned, she’s the chosen one. But I wish Zhao hadn’t chosen her. Anyway, the fights, especially in the film’s last third, are astounding, beautifully paced and crammed with detail. The way the tentacles of the Deviants snap and curl around Makkari and Goddess of War Thena (Jolie) is especially pleasing. Zhao also ensures the landscapes – stuffed with volcanoes, trees, rocks and lakes – are otherwordly in a way that makes you yearn to get lost in a remote spot, rather than watch more movies and/or stare at the cover of a Pink Floyd album. Mention must be made, too, of how authentic Camden Lock looks. The whole place is a fugball of kebabs, beer and murky canal water. Zhao really knows her London. Admittedly, not all the visuals commands respect and one aspect of the CGI is very distracting. Chunky objects keep rearing into view, covered in sparkly gold patterns. Maybe it was because I was feeling peckish, but these supposedly momentous entities kept reminding me of deluxe boxes of chocolates. Anyone for a Ferrero Rocher? Yes, please! Next time I watch this (and I can’t wait to do so) I’ll go on a full stomach. The whole thing is really long (two minutes longer than Dune, 25 minutes longer than Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings). Does it take an eternity to end? Not at all. With characters and concepts this strong, Zhao’s quite right to take her time.",POSITIVE
"Oct 24, 2021","  Eternals, directed with a keen and confident eye by Chloé Zhao (Nomadland), is the most ambitious film yet in the Marvel Cinematic Universe to date. Its impressive visuals and stunning cast do good work with the material. However, the sheer scope of the project and some narrative choices make the film feel unbalanced. While it's not quite a true classic of the genre, Zhao creates the best possible incarnation of the Eternals fit for the big screen.   The latest MCU film -- and one of the first to deal with the immediate aftermath of Avengers: Endgame -- splits its attention across multiple time periods. It charts the development of humanity juxtaposed against the nigh-immortal Eternals. Created by the Celestials to protect worlds across the cosmos, the film is grounded by Sersi (Gemma Chan). One of the most empathetic of the Celestials, she's found herself living in present-day London, serving as a teacher and working with her romantic partner Dane Whitman (Kit Harrington). But when a global earthquake strikes and the Eternals' long-believed dead foes the Deviants resurface, the Eternals must reunite to discover the truth behind their return and their purpose.   The Eternals are comprised of Ajak (Salma Hayek), their matronly leader; Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), the bombastic blaster; Sprite (Lia McHugh), the snarky illusionist; Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), the inventor; Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), the inquisitive speedster; Druig (Barry Keoghan), a rebellious mind-controller; Thena (Angelina Jolie), the mentally fraying warrior; and Gilgamesh, the brawler (Don Lee). The other primary Eternal is Ikaris (Richard Madden), perhaps their most powerful warrior. The cast is uniformly strong, finding emotional cores beyond their surface-level personalities and tics. A charming Harrington makes the most of his limited screen-time. Nanjiani, McHugh, Henry, and especiallyRidloff stand out amongst a stellar cast.   However, the film's true star is its director. Fresh off her Academy Award for Nomadland, Zhao's film looks unlike anything else in the MCU -- in the best way possible. It feels epic, but Zhao grounds its massive scope around the Eternals' action. In between well-shot action beats, which are especially impressive considering the sheer variety of powers on display, Eternals hones in on smaller moments that make its cast pop as unique characters. There are also hints of lore and world-building in the film that might be among the most visually stunning sequences in the entire decade-plus franchise -- further proof Zhao's skill-set is truly impressive enough to switch from indies to the MCU with ease.   The script -- by Zhao, Patrick Burleigh, Ryan Firpo, and Kaz Firpo -- blends in plenty of unique characters and heavy subjects without losing sight of the narrative's momentum. It's not nearly as quippy as other Marvel films, choosing to rely on character beats and interactions instead. It's also a film that's willing to embrace passion and romance in a way that others in the franchise never really could -- notably giving ample time for Phantos's romance, marking the first time Marvel Studios depicted a gay romance on-screen. Its filmmaking is all-around comparable to the more impressive entries in the MCU.   What keeps Eternals from elevating to the top tier of the franchise is that its massive scope can sometimes play against the story. While the Eternals are all well-defined and constructed, the near-constant perspective hopping can blunt the story's forward momentum. Some elements work only thanks to the strong cast -- most notably Kingo's loyal valet Karun (Harish Patel). Some of the plot shifts can be obvious from a mile off. Other story developments -- like the threat of the Deviants -- feel like an afterthought. It's a story that relies on convenience and coincidence during heightened moments, leading the film, at times, to feel rushed.   Eternals isn't bad at all and ranks among the better entries of the MCU. In terms of raw ambition and scope, Eternals belongs in the same camp as Black Panther. However, Eternals has too many balls in the air for any director to catch them all; although, Zhao's work with cinematographer Ben Davis makes it a sight to behold while they try. The cast members are all welcomed additions to the grand tapestry of the MCU. It's just a shame it couldn't find a way to trim just a bit of the fat from the story. It could have been a stone-cold classic instead of a heady standout that lands like an unwieldy entry in the superhero genre.  LEGO builders and Eternals fans can collect all ten of the celestial creations, but will need to purchase four separate LEGO sets to do so.",POSITIVE
"Oct 24, 2021"," The Marvel Cinematic Universe as we know it is but a provincial backwater compared to the colossal scope of this latest addition, which covers such vast expanses of space and time that squeezing it all into one movie is almost a scientific breakthrough in itself. Everything about Eternals is huge, which is both its strength and its weakness. In terms of visual spectacle, it gives us cosmic vistas that would not look out of place on a prog-rock album cover or a documentary about the Big Bang. The story spans the entire globe and the entirety of human civilisation, from Mesopotamia to modern-day London, from the Australian outback to ancient Babylon, with innumerable CGI-heavy set pieces along the way. Sitting through the endless credits (which many will do to catch the very last bonus scene) you get the impression every VFX artist in the world was employed in making this. Some of their work is agreeably bizarre; some, it must be said, is downright terrible. Along with the epic scope comes an equally huge, and refreshingly diverse, cast of characters; these include Gemma Chan, Richard Madden, Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek and Kumail Nanjiani. There is also an epic mythology to get our heads around: even before a line of dialogue is spoken, three dense paragraphs of text explain how our 10 Eternals came to earth to protect it from the predatory Deviants (sort of skinless, sinewy beasts with prehensile tentacles) at the behest of Arishem, “the Prime Celestial”. If you’re lost already, bad luck: there’s plenty more to come, which demands some planet-sized chunks of exposition. At times if feels like you are watching a very sophisticated PowerPoint presentation. The Eternals have superpowers: Madden’s alpha-Eternal Ikaris can fly and shoots beams from his eyes, Jolie’s Thena fights with magic weapons, Lauren Ridloff’s Makkari is super-fast, and so on. But they are less your standard-issue Marvel superheroes than immortal, indestructible gods, who have been living among us incognito for the past 7,000 years. “Why didn’t you help fight Thanos?” one ordinary human reasonably asks. Eternals can only intervene when Deviants are involved, they say. Like the Wakandans in Black Panther, the Eternals are divided over how to apply their superiority. Power, responsibility, loyalty and unity are overriding themes. But there are very few moments when these immortals actually come into contact with humans, which makes their plight feel somewhat abstract. It’s only when the Eternals’ own fates are jeopardised that they really take an interest in saving us little people. To reveal more would be spoiling the plot’s surprises, and would require explaining terms such as “the Emergence”, “the Mahd Wy’ry” and “the Uni-Mind”. It’s certainly… different. One of Eternals’ biggest surprises is its director: Chloé Zhao, who won two Oscars earlier this year for Nomadland, her lyrical, semi-documentary survey of America in the here and now. There are superficial aesthetic similarities – a lot of magic-hour sunset scenes – but the two films could not be more different. The trademark of Zhao’s previous work was their intimacy and realism. Eternals is a gigantic exercise in un-realism. Zhao at least manages to ground the story in some personal drama. The film’s emotional centre is Chan’s matter-transforming Sersi who must reassemble the Eternals in the face of a new threat, although she’s still smarting from her recent break-up with Madden’s Ikaris. (By “recent”, we’re talking 2000 years ago.) Lia McHugh’s Sprite also holds a candle for Ikaris, but being trapped in the body of an 11-year-old girl puts her at a disadvantage. There’s an un-Marvel-like sex scene between two naked people, and a gay character kisses their same-sex partner – although both these moments are fleeting. Nanjiani provides some much-needed comic relief as Eternal-turned-Bollywood movie star Kingo (though Harish Patel as his documentary-shooting “valet” feels like a misstep). Jolie’s real-life star power is somewhat dimmed by her character’s unconvincing personality disorder. And some of the minor Eternals barely get time to make an impression. That’s the problem: there’s just too much going on: it’s all headed towards yet another “race against time to stop the really bad thing happening” climax. It’s not exactly boring – there’s always something new to behold – but nor it is particularly exciting, and it lacks the breezy wit of Marvel’s best movies. One of the strengths of the MCU to date is how it has taken time to define each character individually and lay out the grand narratives over successive movies, building a sense of momentum. Here, it’s all thrown at us at once. It’s like coming into Avengers: Endgame cold without having seen any of the preceding instalments. Most mortals will simply find it too much. Bigger isn’t always better.",NEUTRAL
"Oct 24, 2021"," La ganadora del Oscar por 'Nomadland' Chloé Zhao dirige la película que pretende desmarcarse más del estilo Marvel, pero lo consigue solo en parte. En cines el 5 de noviembre. La Fase 4 del Universo Cinematográfico Marvel no deja de experimentar. Lejos de elegir un camino claramente marcado, cada título que se presenta -ya sea en la gran o la pequeña pantalla- pretende demostrar que con la Saga del Infinito solo hemos podido ver una mínima parte de las posibilidades que tiene esta franquicia. 'Eternals' de Chloé Zhao prometía, además, ser la película más desmarcada de todo lo que habíamos visto hasta ahora. Y en parte lo es, aunque quizás no tanto como parecía.Sin duda es una propuesta muy ambiciosa. La ganadora del Oscar por 'Nomadland' se atreve a presentar nada menos que diez nuevos personajes en una historia que nos lleva desde los inicios de la humanidad hasta el presente posterior al chasquido de Thanos. 'Eternals' está basada en los cómics que el legendario Jack Kirby publicó en los locos años 70, centrados en unos alienígenas inmortales del planeta Olympia enviados a la Tierra hace miles de años por los Celestiales, unos poderosos seres espaciales capaces de crear planetas, para proteger a la humanidad de unas criaturas depredadoras llamadas Deviantes y que así los terrícolas pudieran desarrollarse y prosperar. Los Celestiales les dan una regla muy clara: solo pueden interferir si los Deviantes están involucrados.Esta norma inquebrantable se encuentra en el centro de la idea presentada por Zhao a Marvel y es el punto más fuerte de la historia de la película. El relato de los ""dioses en la Tierra"" es sin duda lo más interesante, cuanto más se acerca la directora a la ""humanidad"" de estas criaturas incapaces de envejecer y que han vivido milenios entre los seres humanos, cuanto más explora cómo se han adaptado a vivir entre nosotros, más cautivadora resulta 'Eternals'. La película va dando saltos continuamente entre el pasado y el presente, mostrando cómo los Eternals van descubriendo las maravillas de los seres humanos y llegan a entender por qué somos dignos de su protección, algunos hasta el punto de que les resulte casi imposible mantenerse al margen tras haber presenciado injusticias, guerras y masacres que ellos podrían haber parado sin despeinarse. Así veremos cómo esta familia, un tema que está resultando muy recurrente en la Fase 4, acaba separándose hasta el día de hoy, en el que una nueva amenaza les obligará a volver a reunirse. Pero ellos no son los mismos que aterrizaron hace 7.000 años.Zhao consigue que nos importe cada uno de estos personajes, aunque le haya sido imposible encontrar el equilibrio entre diez protagonistas que no habíamos visto antes en el UCM. La historia se centra sobre todo en Sersi (Gemma Chan), la Eternal más cercana a los humanos y la que más ha hecho por encajar a lo largo del tiempo. En la película la veremos crecer de quizás el miembro del grupo más propenso a poder vivir perfectamente sin poderes a encontrar a la heroína y líder que no sabía que podía ser, y Chan defiende el papel fantásticamente. Poco a poco iremos conociendo a los demás miembros de esta peculiar familia, cada uno con un superpoder concreto que nos ayudará a distinguirlos (Sersi puede transformar la materia; Thena, el personaje de Angelina Jolie, convierte la energía cósmica en cualquier arma imaginable; Druig, el de Barry Keoghan, puede controlar la mente), y cada uno cuenta con un conflicto, un drama existencial, para que conectemos con ellos. El problema es que, a pesar de que la película dura dos horas y media, hay personajes que quedan relegados a una posición muy secundaria y sus historias son resueltas con poco atino o de forma bastante abrupta. Es muy difícil conseguir lo que logró James Gunn con 'Guardianes de la Galaxia', aunque él tenía que jugar solamente con la mitad de fichas que Chloé Zhao. Al menos ha conseguido que todos ellos tengan alguna escena con la que se pueden lucir, dando a Jolie momentos de acción muy espectaculares o convirtiendo a Lauren Ridloff y Kumail Nanjiani en unos robaescenas. Ninguno de ellos son personajes básicos, pero tal bombardeo de caras nuevas puede que juegue en contra de su atractivo a largo plazo dentro de la franquicia. ¿Cuántos niños y niñas acabarán decantándose por Makkari o por Ikaris en el recreo? ¿Puede tanto personaje conquistar la cultura popular como un Capitán América?Lo que sí forman es uno de los repartos más diversos del Hollywood actual, y todo ello está integrado de manera totalmente natural. Makkari (Ridloff) es la primera superheroína sorda del UCM, pero es tan poderosa como cualquiera de sus compañeros y compañeras. Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry) es el primer protagonista gay de la saga. No solo es la primera representación LGTBQ+ real que vemos en Marvel, es una de las tramas más bonitas de la película, dando a Phastos una motivación, proteger a su familia, que miles de personajes heterosexuales han tenido a lo largo de la historia del cine. Son la propia representación de la diversidad que tenemos las criaturas que han venido a proteger. En ese sentido 'Eternals' es un triunfo, y cada actor y actriz del cast ha estado a la altura de las expectativas.También al otro lado de las cámaras encontramos un trabajo de primer nivel. Chloé Zhao consigue que la película tenga algunas de las escenas más bonitas del UCM gracias a haber apostado por escenarios reales (Fuerteventura entre ellos) y a su característico juego de planos, contraluces y a aprovechar la luz natural, aunque quizás por eso la película tiende a ser demasiado oscura en algunos tramos. El diseño de producción, tanto de la parte histórica como de la más fantástica y espacial, y los efectos visuales terminan dando personalidad propia a la cinta con una forma de magia (que utiliza la energía cósmica) que la diferencia de las de, por ejemplo, Doctor Strange o Wanda. Y la cautivadora banda sonora de Ramin Djawani termina de darle el envoltorio épico a estos personajes, que para los humanos acabaron convirtiéndose en parte de sus mitos y leyendas (no es coincidencia que Ikaris suene a Ícaro y Thena recuerde a Atenea, por ejemplo).Ojalá el guion hubiera tirado más por ese lado, por el de la huella de los Eternals en la historia de la humanidad y cómo han adaptado sus conflictos internos e impulsos a una vida más terrenal, y no tanto por esconder, en realidad, una historia que recuerda demasiado a muchas otras películas de Marvel. Por supuesto que el tono intimista de Chloé Zhao llena la película de una madurez, solemnidad y peso que carecen otros títulos de la franquicia, pero no condiciona a la trama lo suficiente y volvemos a encontrarnos con un grupo de superhéroes intentando salvar al mundo de la enésima destrucción del planeta y de una amenaza que vuelve a ser un enemigo impersonal y plano que no está a la altura del nivel de detalle del resto de la película. Los Deviantes son villanos totalmente olvidables que tampoco hacen justicia a la versión del tebeo, más carismáticos y con conflictos sobre su propia existencia y su papel en el mundo que les convertían en mucho más que ""depredadores"". Por suerte el guion tiene sus sorpresas y sus giros que equilibran un poco la acción, pero que culminan en un clímax resuelto de una forma bastante burda. Aunque la película no pierde mucho ritmo, lo que es loable dada su duración, la misión principal es un ejemplo perfecto del mayor problema que tiene Marvel en el punto en el que se encuentra: estar a la altura de las propias expectativas. ¿Cuántas veces se puede intentar destruir el mundo? Esta sensación de deja vu con el estilo Marvel también ocurre con el humor, que por primera vez en bastante tiempo llega a resultar difícil de empastar con una trama más seria y adulta (el sexo ha llegado por fin a Marvel) como la de 'Eternals'. Risas consigue, pero son algo más incómodas que en otras ocasiones. La película parece diferente, sin duda gracias al estilo de Zhao luce diferente, y tenía historias distintas de sobra para jugar. Pocos personajes del UCM pueden tener problemas derivados de haber vivido en el mismo lugar durante miles de años sin envejecer. Es una pena que al final 'Eternals' sea una película más convencional de lo que podría haber sido, y demasiado cargada.¿Cómo encaja en el plan maestro?No todas las películas posteriores a 'Vengadores: Endgame' pueden tener la escala de 'Vengadores: Endgame'. Si hay algo que 'Shang-Chi' supo hacer muy bien fue presentar personajes, sentar las bases y dejar que crezcan en futuras entregas, y tenía muy claro que quería contar una historia de padres e hijos. 'Eternals' quiere ser una historia de origen de diez personajes, cada uno con un drama existencial, y que el problema principal sea la destrucción del mundo, si acaso intentando darle un atisbo de debate sobre el colonialismo. Y mientras que la primera parte la salva aunque lo haga de forma irregular, la segunda la desvía muy lejos de la exploración de personajes y de esos dilemas entre lo divino y lo humano que son mucho más frescos que otro Apocalipsis, que además vuelve a hacer bastante poco creíble que no aparezca ningún otro superhéroe para al menos ver qué está ocurriendo.¿Puede pecar Marvel de pasarse de ambiciosos? La película llega en un momento en el que el UCM tiene muchos frentes abiertos y después de verla tampoco queda claro cuál va a ser el camino a seguir a largo plazo. A las primeras pinceladas del multiverso y lo que sea que trama la condesa Valentina ahora tenemos que sumar una expansión gigantesca de la mitología del UCM, una que no es nada fácil porque introduce diez Eternals, a los Celestiales y a los Deviantes, y que por supuesto a lo largo de la trama se va enredando y dando más pistas para el futuro, como es la aparición de Dane Whitman, el personaje de un sorprendentemente carismático Kit Harington. ¿Quizás están abarcando demasiado? ¿Llegará un punto en el que los espectadores que no sean fans acérrimos de la franquicia digan ""basta"" con tanto personaje nuevo, tanto legado, tanta serie y tanta información que tragar de golpe? 'Eternals' llega demasiado pronto en esta nueva era para Marvel, que quizás debería apostar más por recular y volver a lo básico: presentar el relevo generacional y darles tiempo para crecer antes de enfrentarlos al gran enemigo o problema de esta nueva Saga. A falta de ver las escenas postcréditos (que no nos enseñaron en el pase de prensa), no termina de quedar claro cuál será su papel en el plan maestro de Kevin Feige.Nota: 7Lo mejor: La construcción de personajes y sus conflictos individuales. Esa deriva hacia temas más adultos. El diseño de producción y la música. Algunos planos son de los más bonitos del UCM.Lo peor: A nivel narrativo quiere contar demasiado en un punto ya complicado del UCM. Quiere ser rompedora, pero esconde una película 100% Marvel, para bien y para mal. La reducción de los Deviantes a enemigos impersonales. La Fase 4 del Universo Cinematográfico Marvel no deja de experimentar. Lejos de elegir un camino claramente marcado, cada título que se presenta -ya sea en la gran o la pequeña pantalla- pretende demostrar que con la Saga del Infinito solo hemos podido ver una mínima parte de las posibilidades que tiene esta franquicia. 'Eternals' de Chloé Zhao prometía, además, ser la película más desmarcada de todo lo que habíamos visto hasta ahora. Y en parte lo es, aunque quizás no tanto como parecía. Sin duda es una propuesta muy ambiciosa. La ganadora del Oscar por 'Nomadland' se atreve a presentar nada menos que diez nuevos personajes en una historia que nos lleva desde los inicios de la humanidad hasta el presente posterior al chasquido de Thanos. 'Eternals' está basada en los cómics que el legendario Jack Kirby publicó en los locos años 70, centrados en unos alienígenas inmortales del planeta Olympia enviados a la Tierra hace miles de años por los Celestiales, unos poderosos seres espaciales capaces de crear planetas, para proteger a la humanidad de unas criaturas depredadoras llamadas Deviantes y que así los terrícolas pudieran desarrollarse y prosperar. Los Celestiales les dan una regla muy clara: solo pueden interferir si los Deviantes están involucrados. Esta norma inquebrantable se encuentra en el centro de la idea presentada por Zhao a Marvel y es el punto más fuerte de la historia de la película. El relato de los ""dioses en la Tierra"" es sin duda lo más interesante, cuanto más se acerca la directora a la ""humanidad"" de estas criaturas incapaces de envejecer y que han vivido milenios entre los seres humanos, cuanto más explora cómo se han adaptado a vivir entre nosotros, más cautivadora resulta 'Eternals'. La película va dando saltos continuamente entre el pasado y el presente, mostrando cómo los Eternals van descubriendo las maravillas de los seres humanos y llegan a entender por qué somos dignos de su protección, algunos hasta el punto de que les resulte casi imposible mantenerse al margen tras haber presenciado injusticias, guerras y masacres que ellos podrían haber parado sin despeinarse. Así veremos cómo esta familia, un tema que está resultando muy recurrente en la Fase 4, acaba separándose hasta el día de hoy, en el que una nueva amenaza les obligará a volver a reunirse. Pero ellos no son los mismos que aterrizaron hace 7.000 años. Zhao consigue que nos importe cada uno de estos personajes, aunque le haya sido imposible encontrar el equilibrio entre diez protagonistas que no habíamos visto antes en el UCM. La historia se centra sobre todo en Sersi (Gemma Chan), la Eternal más cercana a los humanos y la que más ha hecho por encajar a lo largo del tiempo. En la película la veremos crecer de quizás el miembro del grupo más propenso a poder vivir perfectamente sin poderes a encontrar a la heroína y líder que no sabía que podía ser, y Chan defiende el papel fantásticamente. Poco a poco iremos conociendo a los demás miembros de esta peculiar familia, cada uno con un superpoder concreto que nos ayudará a distinguirlos (Sersi puede transformar la materia; Thena, el personaje de Angelina Jolie, convierte la energía cósmica en cualquier arma imaginable; Druig, el de Barry Keoghan, puede controlar la mente), y cada uno cuenta con un conflicto, un drama existencial, para que conectemos con ellos. El problema es que, a pesar de que la película dura dos horas y media, hay personajes que quedan relegados a una posición muy secundaria y sus historias son resueltas con poco atino o de forma bastante abrupta. Es muy difícil conseguir lo que logró James Gunn con 'Guardianes de la Galaxia', aunque él tenía que jugar solamente con la mitad de fichas que Chloé Zhao. Al menos ha conseguido que todos ellos tengan alguna escena con la que se pueden lucir, dando a Jolie momentos de acción muy espectaculares o convirtiendo a Lauren Ridloff y Kumail Nanjiani en unos robaescenas. Ninguno de ellos son personajes básicos, pero tal bombardeo de caras nuevas puede que juegue en contra de su atractivo a largo plazo dentro de la franquicia. ¿Cuántos niños y niñas acabarán decantándose por Makkari o por Ikaris en el recreo? ¿Puede tanto personaje conquistar la cultura popular como un Capitán América? Lo que sí forman es uno de los repartos más diversos del Hollywood actual, y todo ello está integrado de manera totalmente natural. Makkari (Ridloff) es la primera superheroína sorda del UCM, pero es tan poderosa como cualquiera de sus compañeros y compañeras. Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry) es el primer protagonista gay de la saga. No solo es la primera representación LGTBQ+ real que vemos en Marvel, es una de las tramas más bonitas de la película, dando a Phastos una motivación, proteger a su familia, que miles de personajes heterosexuales han tenido a lo largo de la historia del cine. Son la propia representación de la diversidad que tenemos las criaturas que han venido a proteger. En ese sentido 'Eternals' es un triunfo, y cada actor y actriz del cast ha estado a la altura de las expectativas. También al otro lado de las cámaras encontramos un trabajo de primer nivel. Chloé Zhao consigue que la película tenga algunas de las escenas más bonitas del UCM gracias a haber apostado por escenarios reales (Fuerteventura entre ellos) y a su característico juego de planos, contraluces y a aprovechar la luz natural, aunque quizás por eso la película tiende a ser demasiado oscura en algunos tramos. El diseño de producción, tanto de la parte histórica como de la más fantástica y espacial, y los efectos visuales terminan dando personalidad propia a la cinta con una forma de magia (que utiliza la energía cósmica) que la diferencia de las de, por ejemplo, Doctor Strange o Wanda. Y la cautivadora banda sonora de Ramin Djawani termina de darle el envoltorio épico a estos personajes, que para los humanos acabaron convirtiéndose en parte de sus mitos y leyendas (no es coincidencia que Ikaris suene a Ícaro y Thena recuerde a Atenea, por ejemplo). Ojalá el guion hubiera tirado más por ese lado, por el de la huella de los Eternals en la historia de la humanidad y cómo han adaptado sus conflictos internos e impulsos a una vida más terrenal, y no tanto por esconder, en realidad, una historia que recuerda demasiado a muchas otras películas de Marvel. Por supuesto que el tono intimista de Chloé Zhao llena la película de una madurez, solemnidad y peso que carecen otros títulos de la franquicia, pero no condiciona a la trama lo suficiente y volvemos a encontrarnos con un grupo de superhéroes intentando salvar al mundo de la enésima destrucción del planeta y de una amenaza que vuelve a ser un enemigo impersonal y plano que no está a la altura del nivel de detalle del resto de la película. Los Deviantes son villanos totalmente olvidables que tampoco hacen justicia a la versión del tebeo, más carismáticos y con conflictos sobre su propia existencia y su papel en el mundo que les convertían en mucho más que ""depredadores"". Por suerte el guion tiene sus sorpresas y sus giros que equilibran un poco la acción, pero que culminan en un clímax resuelto de una forma bastante burda. Aunque la película no pierde mucho ritmo, lo que es loable dada su duración, la misión principal es un ejemplo perfecto del mayor problema que tiene Marvel en el punto en el que se encuentra: estar a la altura de las propias expectativas. ¿Cuántas veces se puede intentar destruir el mundo? Esta sensación de deja vu con el estilo Marvel también ocurre con el humor, que por primera vez en bastante tiempo llega a resultar difícil de empastar con una trama más seria y adulta (el sexo ha llegado por fin a Marvel) como la de 'Eternals'. Risas consigue, pero son algo más incómodas que en otras ocasiones. La película parece diferente, sin duda gracias al estilo de Zhao luce diferente, y tenía historias distintas de sobra para jugar. Pocos personajes del UCM pueden tener problemas derivados de haber vivido en el mismo lugar durante miles de años sin envejecer. Es una pena que al final 'Eternals' sea una película más convencional de lo que podría haber sido, y demasiado cargada. No todas las películas posteriores a 'Vengadores: Endgame' pueden tener la escala de 'Vengadores: Endgame'. Si hay algo que 'Shang-Chi' supo hacer muy bien fue presentar personajes, sentar las bases y dejar que crezcan en futuras entregas, y tenía muy claro que quería contar una historia de padres e hijos. 'Eternals' quiere ser una historia de origen de diez personajes, cada uno con un drama existencial, y que el problema principal sea la destrucción del mundo, si acaso intentando darle un atisbo de debate sobre el colonialismo. Y mientras que la primera parte la salva aunque lo haga de forma irregular, la segunda la desvía muy lejos de la exploración de personajes y de esos dilemas entre lo divino y lo humano que son mucho más frescos que otro Apocalipsis, que además vuelve a hacer bastante poco creíble que no aparezca ningún otro superhéroe para al menos ver qué está ocurriendo. ¿Puede pecar Marvel de pasarse de ambiciosos? La película llega en un momento en el que el UCM tiene muchos frentes abiertos y después de verla tampoco queda claro cuál va a ser el camino a seguir a largo plazo.

"Oct 24, 2021"," At this point, audiences are used to having all the background information they need when they sit down for a Marvel movie. The cinematic universe has been steadily building since 2008, each installment expanding on the one before it. Sure, some exposition occasionally describes whatever Macguffin is being used to drive plot this time, but for the most part, there's not much by way of surprise. That's why it's jolting that Eternals—the latest film in the MCU directed by this year's Best Director winner Chloé Zhao—opens with a lengthy crawl. ""In the beginning,"" it starts. ""Before the six singularities and the dawn of creation."" It's a dense text introducing what is essentially an entirely new origin myth for the universe. It's also why Eternals is refreshing even as Marvel fatigue is growing more and more inescapable. While not without messiness and over-plotting that bogs down and overcomplicates the narrative, Eternals succeeds as a vast and unrepentantly serious bit of world building with a moral quandary at its center. There were questions as to how Zhao, known for her work with non-professional actors chronicling people at the margins in the American West for the Oscar-winning Nomadland, would make the transition to blockbusters, specifically working under the meticulous hand of Marvel's head honcho, Kevin Feige. Marvel has gotten the reputation for hiring fantastic filmmakers and flattening their styles, and while Eternals certainly doesn't play like anything else Zhao has done, it also doesn't mute her vision. Amid all the magic and skin-tight costumes, Zhao has made a movie that's both humane and earthy, but also wonderfully weird, one where the internal debates between superhumans are more interesting than the punches they throw. As that aforementioned opening explains, the Eternals are a group of beings deployed to planets by gods called Celestials to fight beast-like creatures known as the Deviants. The heroes at the center of this story have been sent by Arishem to Earth where they are led by Salma Hayek's Ajak. They are supposed to help human society advance, but not interfere too greatly and stay away when there are any conflicts not involving the Deviants. (And there's your explanation as to why they didn't aid in the fight against Thanos that took up two Avengers movies.) When the present-day action starts, the members of the team are scattered over the planet. They have been living in hiding for centuries after eliminating what they assumed were the last of their foes, although, of course they are not the last. A Deviant appears in London where Sersi (Gemma Chan) is working as a schoolteacher, dating a nice man played by Kit Harington, and living with Sprite (Lia McHugh), the team's perpetual tween. Richard Madden's Ikaris, Sersi's ex and a Superman-type who can blast villains with his eyes, arrives to help, and they conclude that the gang needs to be reunited to fight back the impending threat. As Sersi and Ikaris traverse the globe searching for their comrades, Zhao jumps back and forth in time showing how the Eternals existed in civilizations like Babylon and Tenochtitlan, as well as how they came to unravel. Each Eternal is defined less by his or her powers—which range from mind control to running really fast—than the actors that play them. Kumail Nanjiani makes Kingo a vain Bollywood star; Barry Keoghan brings his skittish energy to the wily Druig, who has a bond with Lauren Ridoff's Makkari, the first deaf superhero in the MCU. Brian Tyree Henry is a sensitive inventor as Phastos, while Ma Dong-seok and Angelina Jolie make a sweet odd couple as the warriors Gilgamesh and Thena, the latter of whom is constantly repressing trauma. In fact, it's Chan and Madden, the two most central of the ancient fighters, who give the blandest performances, yet Zhao makes up for that by imbuing their relationship with a sensuality that's often missing from the MCU—lo and behold, there is a very tame sex scene along with some semi-heavy kissing. While seeing two god-like figures naked on a beach together—with no visible nudity—might seem minor, it's actually a key decision that informs the rest of Zhao's take. These characters might be thousands of years old, but there's a tangibility to these relationships that informs how the protagonists move on screen. At the same time, while the other more galactic Marvel entries have gone for goofy humor to ground the otherworldly elements, Zhao keeps Eternals serious for the most part, allowing intentional aloofness that is only fitting for the subject matter. When the screenplay—by Zhao, Patrick Burleigh, Ryan Firpo, and Kaz Firpo—does try to wink at the rest of the MCU with jokey asides, the dialogue is jarringly out of place. Those are some of the few awkward moments that weigh Eternals down along with plot holes and some distinctly unremarkable CGI. Eternals, of course, is part of a bigger plan, as evidenced by the much-discussed post-credits scenes that were not shown during the New York screening I attended, but immediately spoiled by some in Los Angeles. It's a movie that's best when it's floating in a more primordial space, disconnected from what came before.",POSITIVE
"Oct 24, 2021"," Jack Kirby’s 1976 comic about humanoid defenders of Earth births a new chapter for the MCU, with an ensemble featuring Gemma Chan, Richard Madden, Kumail Nanjiani, Salma Hayek and Angelina Jolie. It was probably unrealistic to expect Chloé Zhao, independent film’s foremost spiritual chronicler of the American West and an Oscar winner for Nomadland, to completely reinvent the superhero movie. Nevertheless, Eternals does bend the ubiquitous fantasy genre to some degree to fit the director’s customary vein of humanistic intimacy measured against an expansive natural-world canvas. The attention to character, group dynamics and emotional texture makes the film often feel more alive in its quieter moments than its fairly routine CG action clashes. But the depth of feeling helps counter the choppy storytelling in this new tangent in the MCU narrative. New, of course, is a relative term given the amount of cross-referencing that’s now a requirement of most Marvel movies and TV series. While the Eternals — defenders of Earth from a faraway planet who have lived among humanity for millennia — are a fresh crew, they drop repeated references about the chaos wrought by Thanos when he erased half of all life across the universe (in Avengers: Infinity War) and question who will lead the Avengers moving forward. Some overlap seems inevitable. Two post-credits teaser scenes reportedly hinting at the direction of future installments were chopped off the end of the film’s first New York press screening. (Thanks for the trust, Disney.) But word leaked from the Los Angeles premiere the same day about one in particular, which had fans hyperventilating in rage or excitement — or both — about the casting of a pop culture heartthrob as the junior sibling of an MCU supervillain. Further clues for Marvel Comics aficionados as to how ongoing plotlines will develop come from the name of seemingly human bystander Dane Whitman (Kit Harington), who drops vague hints in the final scene that there’s more to him than meets the eye. In a first taste of the movie’s tendency to dump exposition by the bucketload, an opening crawl traces the Eternals back to the dawn of time, when the immortal beings from the planet Olympia were sent to Earth by the Celestials to protect humanity and civilization against marauding alien apex predators known as Deviants. Those dragon-like monsters are first seen emerging at startling speed from the waters of Mesopotamia in 5000 B.C., attacking a prehistoric tribe with their massive jaws and lance-like tendrils, until the Eternals swoop in to save them. Jumping ahead to the present day, we learn that the Deviant threat was defeated centuries earlier. The Eternals disbanded their once-tightknit family and went their separate ways, some integrating harmoniously with humans, some seeking solitude or pairing off in isolation, and others chafing at the rules that prevent them from using their powers to intervene in mankind’s conflicts. One of the most content of the Eternals to live among humans is Sersi (Gemma Chan), an ancient artifacts specialist at London’s Natural History Museum, who keeps her co-worker boyfriend, Dane, in the dark about the transmutation powers that enable her to convert matter by touch. She also serves as a surrogate big sister to Sprite (Lia McHugh), a 7,000-year-old storyteller with the power to conjure illusions, unhappily trapped in the body of a preteen punkette. Part of Sersi’s resistance to taking her romance with Dane to the next level seems to be due to an on-off history with Ikaris (Richard Madden) that spans centuries. A fighter endowed with the power of flight and eyes that shoot destroyer beams, Ikaris appears conveniently just as a global earthquake reawakens the Deviants. Emerging out of the canal at Camden Lock, the monsters this time appear to be directly targeting Eternals, not humans, their lethality magnified by a newfound ability to heal themselves. The script by Zhao, Patrick Burleigh, Ryan Firpo and Kaz Firpo uses the comic introduced in 1976 by Jack Kirby only as a baseline, creating its own world imbued with a contemporary sensibility. There are a lot of lurching shifts, both geographical and temporal, before the band of 10 distinctly drawn Eternals and their respective powers come into focus, loosely split between fighters and thinkers. The diversity of the principals that was already apparent in advance marketing is even more notable in the film itself. Not only do Black, Latina, and East and South Asian characters get to don the latex suits, but representation extends also to queer and deaf Eternals. Not to mention the witchy other-worldliness of Angelina Jolie. It’s to the credit of Zhao and her appealing ensemble that this mix actually feels organic to the story and not merely like woke pandering. It also fits with the key element lifted from Kirby, the Uni-Mind, which allows the Eternals to overcome their differences and consolidate their power into one mighty collective force. The matriarch of the group is Ajak (Salma Hayek), a spiritual guide who’s been chilling, cowgirl-style, in the sleepy hills of South Dakota when the Deviant reemergence calls for the band to get back together. Ajak can generate a golden sphere that allows her to communicate directly with their Celestial maker, Arishem (voiced by David Kaye). But neither the origin story nor the details of their purpose on Earth have been truthfully conveyed to the Eternals, creating ambivalence from some about the mission that reunites them after centuries apart. While the zigzagging convolutions of the storytelling can prove frustrating, particularly in the film’s lumpy first half, there’s plenty to keep you engaged in the mix of camaraderie, friction and rivalry among the bantering Eternals, who are not without vulnerabilities. The script finds humor and poignancy in the challenges of a group of soldiers forced to find their purpose in a mortal world that for the longest time has not required their special skills. The most amusing comic relief comes from Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), who can mold firebombs to hurl in battle with his bare hands but has spent the years becoming a one-man Bollywood dynasty. Working his eyebrows like the cheesiest of matinee idols, Nanjiani is clearly having a blast playing an endearingly vain character, trailed with fawning loyalty by his human valet and videographer, Karun (Harish Patel). The mentions of Kingo’s blockbuster Shadow Warrior screen franchise almost demand a spinoff series. Others are more burdened by their cosmic gifts. Sullen Druig (Barry Keoghan) has retreated into the Amazonian jungle, embittered by humanity’s self-destructive nature and by the veto on him using his mind-control powers to end their cycle of violence. Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), a deaf speedster, is bored and restless with her exile on Earth. And techno-savant inventor Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), troubled by the role his developments have played in human tragedy, has sought comfort in domestic stability. The matter-of-fact presentation of a loving gay family represents a breakthrough for Marvel. Jolie’s Thena, a warrior able to generate and morph filigreed golden swords and spears at will, suffers from a form of dementia known as Mahd Wy’ry, a kind of memory overload that makes her a danger to her companions. That yields a touching bond with jovial strongman Gilgamesh (Don Lee), who signs on as her protector, keeping her away from harm in the Australian Outback. But the key relationship is in the romantic crossed wires of Ikaris, Sersi and Sprite, who stand in for Peter, Wendy and Tinkerbell in a Peter Pan scenario that eventually puts them on opposing sides of a divide. Zhao seems more invested in this emotional interplay than the many battle scenes, which take place everywhere from the Aztec empire to the Amazon. The clashes are efficiently choreographed but somewhat rote, even if it’s a thrill to see relative elders like Jolie and Lee busting serious moves — the former with balletic grace, the latter like a brick wall in motion. The muted excitement of the fight scenes is perhaps due in part to the antagonists being interchangeable CG monsters, random creepy-crawly destroyers rather than the foot soldiers of a compelling villain. That said, the Eternals’ ability to generate gold geometrical force fields and weaponry delivers some cool effects work, at times suggesting the intricate beauty of art nouveau draftsmanship with hints of M.C. Escher. Overall, the film benefits enormously in terms of texture from the wide-ranging location work, with the majority of settings simulated in various parts of the U.K. and the Canary Islands. Those include the ancient civilizations of Mesopotamia, Babylon, Tenochtitlan and the Gupta Empire, impressively re-created by production designer Eve Stewart, as well as stops in modern-day London, Alaska, Mumbai and Australia, among others. The visuals have an epic scope that renders the Eternals, for all their superhuman powers, inhabitants of a recognizable world, scarcely different from the mortals among whom they hide in plain sight. The action generally is staged against physically imposing settings without relying too much on greenscreen trickery, a choice validated by Ben Davis’ sweeping naturalistic cinematography, which gives the film a less synthetic look than the average MCU joint. For those of us growing “mad weary” with superhero fatigue, there’s no escaping the usual drawbacks of a prolix run time, a dense overabundance of plot and the narrative limitations inherent in the formula. For all the millions of fans who keep the MCU industrial machine humming, there are millions more who just can’t get too worked up about folks in fancy athleisure wear facing off against mutant lobsters penciled in by digital animators. But from the early image of Sersi emerging from a London Underground station at Piccadilly Circus to the dreamy strains of Pink Floyd’s “Time,” the soulfulness, the contemplative weight of Zhao’s vision at least puts this among the more interesting and original entries in the ever-expanding canon.",POSITIVE
"Oct 24, 2021"," Director Chloé Zhao’s ETERNALS is unlike anything you’ve seen before in the MCU. Outside of harnessing the innate power of natural environments to not only augment, but fascinatingly juxtapose its sprawling fantasy tale filled with the unreal, it refreshingly bucks convention by not following the studio’s typical story and aesthetic formulas. In effect, she and her team deliver a uniquely evocative, extraordinarily epic superhero film that features a thought-provoking, thematically dense narrative, enriching emotional stakes, and actual, tangible queer representation (that’s action, not solely talk). It’s assured, masterful work – one that should also finally put to bed the discourse that these movies are largely sexless. The Eternals are a group of super-immortals instructed by omnipotent super-being Arishem to unwaveringly follow his orders to rescue Earth from a slew of deadly creatures called Deviants, whose goal it is to wipe out intelligent life. The benevolent-but-dysfunctional team include supreme leader Arjak (Salma Hayek), molecularly-skilled Sersi (Gemma Chan), laser-eyed Ikaris (Richard Madden), cosmic energy-powered Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), mischievous illusionist Sprite (Lia McHugh), knockout Gilgamesh (Ma Dong-seok/ Don Lee), builder Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), lightning-fast runner Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), mind-controlling Druig (Barry Keoghan) and champion warrior Thena (Angelina Jolie). They’ve existed throughout history, combatting these otherworldly destructive forces, but also supervising and encouraging humankind on their journey toward enlightenment. The plan is that once the evil menace has been eradicated from the planet, the gang can return home to their planet of Olympia. Or so they thought. Even though the peril appears to be vanquished, the super secretive superheroes have been abandoned, left awaiting instruction for centuries, splintering across the globe. However, a world-shaking earthquake awakens both an evolved species of Deviants and a new threat of global extinction. They take it upon themselves to reassemble, slowly discovering that what they steadfastly believed may or may not have not been the truth. With humanity again thrown into crisis, they must set aside their differences and figure out what’s the right thing to do, which doesn’t necessarily mean what they’ve been commanded to do. Zhao and collaborating screenwriters Patrick Burleigh, Ryan Firpo and Kaz Firpo bring a well-earned, nurtured sense of balance to each of these characters’ story threads. Frequently intertwining their individual journeys works efficiently, for the most part. We feel the burdensome romance between ex-flames Sersi and Ikarus, the respectful, platonic friendship tether formed between warriors Gilgamesh and Thena, and, despite it getting dealt short shrift, the caring bond between Druig and Makkari. Yet, while the unrequited crush Sprite harbors for Ikarus aids in her arc, it makes a play for the obvious, obtusely referencing Tinker Bell and Peter Pan’s relationship dynamic. More so, Sprite’s inner turmoil is A reductive carbon copy of vampire Claudia’s anguish in INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE, where her maturity has grown beyond her youthful corporeal confines. Zhao takes great craft and care for her ensemble to have memorable Movie Moments showcasing their prowess. The calculated pace at which they “get the band back together” again helps make these moments land. Hayek’s luminous work reverberates throughout. Chan is the effervescent, graceful beating heart behind the drama. Jolie’s melodramatic arc is as equally entrancing as her bad-ass stunt-work, and especially potent in her climactic fight. Madden handles the push-pull of his character’s conundrum with engrossing command. Keoghan’s wild card temperament is at the forefront, giving the character a distinct edge. Ridloff is captivating in her career-defining role. Henry’s standout, scene-stealing performance is full of dimension, internality, vulnerability and wisdom. Nanjiani’s tasked to carry much of the film’s levity and he does so with aplomb, demonstrably during the long-running gag involving him and an ever-present video-camera his valet is handling. But it’s Lee’s grasp of nuanced facets that genuinely wows, combining humor, heart and physical acumen, making him the picture’s MVP.  On the technical side, Ben Davis’ cinematography earns top marks. His eye for naturalism shines a spotlight on the characters’ humanity, providing an interesting, beguiling sense of wonder and joy witnessing extraordinary beings and creatures placed in ordinary locations. These elements would clash in lesser hands, but here, it adds to an interesting character study. That’s not to say everything is handled perfectly. Due to the picture’s unconventional nature, some of its construction is left a little wanting. Flashbacks dovetail almost innocuously into present day problems without much warning or visual dexterity. Everything dealing with Sersi’s long-suffering boyfriend Dane (Kit Harrington) is ham-handed. It’s great that her relationship doesn’t define her, but it comes as a detriment when he’s largely forgotten about for a large portion of the run time, leading us to question why he’s even there in the first place. The Big Bad being battled isn’t a traditional villain, but a cataclysmic event where the team’s clashing theologies and ideologies are challenged, creating tension as to whether or not they’ll unite to alter the fate of the world. It’s a good idea in theory, brilliantly feeding into heady thematic concepts surrounding free will, ecology and selflessness versus selfishness. However, it blunts the audience’s collective cathartic release, as they may yearn to see invincible heroes overcoming an uncontrollable evil mastermind. The spectacle of what Zhao and Company have created, overall, feels awe-inducing and inspiring. Her fingerprints are all over every frame and yet her distinct, grounded, character-driven style doesn’t clash with what’s expected from the genre, only magnifies the greatness lying in its underpinnings.",POSITIVE
"Oct 24, 2021","Eternals certainly doesn't lack for ambition, but for now, Marvel -- emboldened by its success -- has reached for the stars without quite getting there.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 24, 2021"," The newest Marvel superhero film covers more than 7,000 years of history and, if that wasn’t a large enough feat, introduces 10 very different new personalities – including characters played by A-listers Angelina Jolie and Salma Hayek – to the mega-popular movie franchise, courtesy of Oscar-winning director Chloé Zhao (“Nomadland”). An impressively ambitious and often beautiful film, “Eternals” (★★½ out of four; rated PG-13; in theaters now) is in many ways the anti-Marvel movie: It only occasionally references the ultra-connected MCU, favoring mythology creation over forcing itself into the grander plan. Unfortunately, the exceedingly earnest narrative struggles to juggle its many subplots and tries to do too much in its hefty two hours and 37 minutes. The Eternals are immortal superpowered beings sent to Earth – specifically Mesopotamia, circa 5000 B.C. – by the cosmic Celestials to protect humans from dangerous alien monsters called Deviants. And akin to the Avengers, they’re a complementary supergroup: healing leader Ajak (Hayek), matter-manipulating Sersi (Gemma Chan), illusionist Sprite (Lia McHugh), inventive Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry) and mind-controlling Druig (Barry Keoghan) are the thinkers, while eye-blasting Ikaris (Richard Madden), energy-shooting Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), ultra-speedy Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), weapons master Thena (Jolie) and super-strong Gilgamesh (Don Lee) are the warriors. But this family went their separate ways after wiping out all the Deviants over several millennia, and in present day, the movie catches up with Sersi in London, where she and her roommate Sprite pass themselves off as humans in society. Sersi is out with her boyfriend, museum co-worker Dane Whitman (Kit Harington), when a Deviant attacks them and Ikaris (aka Sersi’s ex) shows up to save the day. The reappearance of the creature, more souped-up than they’ve seen before, leads Sersi, Sprite and Ikaris on a “getting the band back together” mission, first tracking down Ajak in South Dakota and then finding the others: Kingo, for example, is a famous Bollywood star and Gilgamesh is working with Thena on PTSD resulting from eons of war. But as they reunite, old dysfunction returns, truths are revealed and differences arise about their role on Earth in the past and present. Utilizing Zhao’s penchant for naturalistic environments, “Eternals” looks unlike any other Marvel movie and is perhaps the most welcoming for MCU neophytes in forever. There are as many references to Superman (yes, the rival DC hero) as there are to Thor, and it helps to cast 10 ridiculously attractive people as characters even comic book fans deem obscure. It’s a minor miracle that each Eternal gets their moment: The movie-stealing Nanjiani’s great whenever the fame-obsessed Kingo has a chance to shine; Sersi being torn between Ikaris and Dane symbolizes much of what the movie tries to say about humanity; and the Thena/Gilgamesh dynamic is also fascinating. (Jolie gets one of her best action roles in years here.) But when you factor in the heap of characters, the various twists and turns, a murder mystery and all the bouncing between present day and ancient history, “Eternals” becomes a head-spinning, multicar pileup of stuff. An intriguing theme like the ethical conundrum of the greater good is just touched on instead of satisfyingly explored. Zhao’s included so many Marvel firsts and important diversity elements – a sexual encounter (albeit PG-rated), Makkari's inclusion as a deaf superhero, a gay family being an important part of Phastos’ story – yet each only gets so much screen time before the story moves on to something else. Zhao understands the larger assignment, as the epic sets the stage for future MCU intrigue. Her attention to detail and eye for design do wonders, even if by the end it all feels like an eternal chore.",POSITIVE
"Oct 24, 2021"," Whether you’re considering timeframe scope, narrative density, or character origins, Marvel’s Eternals is the cinematic universe’s most ambitious single-film swing. Try introducing ten-plus major characters while simultaneously explaining why interstellar super-duper-heroes ignored all Marvel atrocities and telling a contained central conflict. Chloé Zhao’s more humanistic approach to immortal protectors does its best to personify these mighty warriors who thus far stayed away from Avenger initiatives, and yet there’s just so much movie still to digest. Zhao achieves a thematic tenderness and vulnerability that seems fresh within the MCU, all before a third act that rushes through cumulative payoffs like it’s closing time at the pub and you’re still sober. From Babylon to Hiroshima, London to South Dakota, Ajak (Salma Hayek) and her Eternals squadron have influenced the evolution of humankind on Earth. Their initial mission is simple — protect mortals from cosmic predators known as “Deviants” until complete enemy eradication. Then the team’s floating Celestial overlord asks them to stay hidden until further notice, for roughly seven thousand years after their 5000 BC arrival. Sersi (Gemma Chan) gravitates towards museum artifact studies, Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani) becomes a generational Bollywood icon, and so on as the Eternals pursue separate passions. That’s until a rogue Deviant attacks Sersi, illusionist Sprite (Lia McHugh), and pretty-much-Superman Ikaris (Richard Madden), which sparks a reunion to finish their mission once and for all. It’s difficult because Eternals strives to fulfill three narrative purposes. Introduce Ajak’s god-beings who erected civilization, seamlessly incorporate Eternals mythology into ongoing MCU canon, and pose a doomsday threat that only the Eternals can defeat — three heads that need to feed. Timelines collide as scenes jump between something comparatively insignificant like Sersi’s struggles with human boyfriend Dane Whitman (Kit Harington) to engineer Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry) standing amidst Japan’s nuclear wasteland while sobbing because his technological blessings became man’s atomic weaponry. Zhao’s interest in the Eternals’ conscious dilemmas as superheroes restricted from human interference is immense, nestled amidst exposition with the authenticity of Nomadland’s intimate existentialism — but feels outweighed. Eternals is a more mature, representative slice-of-life Marvel film that challenges important preconceptions. These Disney superheroes f#&k, in the words of Silicon Valley’s Russ Hanneman — for real, they’re allowed to explore sexual pleasures of the flesh. Phastos shares a same-sex kiss with his husband on camera as Zhao imbues this welcoming fearlessness about the characters who promote inclusiveness beyond a throwaway group-session line. Don’t expect another smash-and-dash S.H.I.E.L.D. battler — Zhao’s collaborative screenplay remains fixed on how humankind’s advancement through strife and wars weighs on the idle Eternals who can do nothing but watch. Some embrace love’s complications and communal goodwill; others question their sacrifice and embody their Greek tragedy inspirations. These fractures in the armor of gods are always when Eternals shines like an Infinity Stone. Alternately, Zhao struggles to empower the personal journeys of most Eternals guards. Mind controller Druig (Barry Keoghan) defies Celestial obedience knowing he could prevent horridness like mass genocide, yet his defiant identity shifts into a later-act romance with deaf speedster Makkari (Lauren Ridloff) — who just waits on their Domo spacecraft for the inevitable “band’s back together” highlight. Gilgamesh (Don Lee) and Thena (Angelina Jolie) share a special bond since soldier Thena succumbs to a berserker illness that plunges her into a confused, violent rage — Gilgamesh and his fists of fury conclude that arc with slightness thanks to the plot’s circumstantial nature. Characters vanish from relevance only to return like nothing’s changed, subplots fall out of importance at random, and the entire quest throttles through another digitally enhanced culmination of action teases that lack the concreteness of a fully realized ending. Other Marvel titles have built franchise appeal on standalone stories — Eternals feels like it’s rushing the assignment a period before class, crossing t’s and dotting i’s with reckless abandon. All stated, there’s still wonder to behold, such as cinematographer Ben Davis’s mix of outstanding planetarium stargazing and Zhao’s signature golden hour sunbursts that caress Mother Nature’s natural landscapes. Zhao sneaks so much essence from Nomadland and The Rider into fights where CGI canine hellspawns endanger Eternals until Sersi’s elemental manipulation atomizes one into a tree. We’re also gifted gags where bulgy bruiser Gilgamesh bakes berry pies in an adorable apron, or finger-gunner Kingo hires a valet (Harish Patel as superfan Karun) to film an unsolicited behind-the-scenes Eternals documentary. There’s humor present as Don Lee plays a huggable teddy bear and ripped-as-hell Kumail Nanjiani uses his comedic background to accentuate Karun’s out-of-place but humble presence. Zhao seems more comfortable than expected working within jokier frameworks while still grasping onto those broken shards of hope for our messy, imperfect species. Inarguably, Eternals is a whole lotta movie. Chloé Zhao does her best with a Marvel experience that’s closer to the three-hour mark — there’s luxury and fondness within photography and relationships. When characters like Phastos enter their spotlight superhero solos, the result is economical and enjoyable as special abilities draw similarities to DC icons — a recurring joke thanks to rights approvals. Eternals is visually elegant thanks to Zhao’s creative sensibilities, but such an exposition-heavy undertaking does get the better of the filmmaker more than a handful of instances. What else can you expect from an adaptation whose text is bulkier than your entire franchise to date, which Zhao indulges in the narrative’s infinite grandness for better and worse.

"Oct 24, 2021"," Chloé Zhao’s 2020 film Nomadland begins with sparse lines of text that set up an entire world of loss. A sheetrock plant in the real-life town of Empire, Nevada, shuts down in January 2011. In six months’ time, Empire’s ZIP code is discontinued. It’s a ghost town. A stable-seeming environment is revealed to be constantly in flux, sometimes with frightening and destabilizing speed.  Eternals, Zhao’s follow-up to her acclaimed Academy Award-winning film, also begins with explanatory text. This time however, it’s more lore than story, about beings from another planet brought to ours for a purpose the audience won’t fully grasp until the end of the film. It is withholding and not inviting, as if, from the very start, there are two forces at war for the kind of film Eternals should be. The latest film from Marvel Studios is equal parts puzzle piece and experiment. Eternals expands the frontiers of the MCU providing hints about what its future may hold while also being a project of formal ambition. Zhao deliberately breaks from the well-established Marvel formula to tell a more sweeping and mature story — the sort of story the filmmaker is known for. The script takes the sort of seismic shifts that can happen around us in six brief months and blows them up on a geologic scale across thousands of years, through the eyes of the most consciously diverse cast in a superhero blockbuster. Eternals, however, is ultimately haunted by that formula, continually yielding to the familiar whenever it tries to show us something new.  Eternals is also saddled with one of the densest premises in Marvel Comics history, a relative anomaly in the large stable of memorable characters created by comics legend Jack Kirby. Even the considerably streamlined film version can’t lay the groundwork without heaps of exposition: The Eternals, the film’s opening text describes, are superhuman champions from a world called Olympia, dispatched to Earth by a cosmic god named Arimesh, a Celestial, in order to defend humankind from the monstrous Deviants. Throughout history, the Eternals have been here, helping humanity by fighting off Deviants and slowly providing technological advancement — to a certain point. Because the Eternals have another mandate: They cannot interfere in Earthly conflicts that don’t involve the Deviants.  This is the reason the film gives — in an actual conversation, between characters — for The Eternals taking a raincheck on Thanos’ genocidal rampage or any of the horrors and atrocities of the past. It’s a bit hard to swallow, especially when the film goes to great special-effects lengths to depict historical moments of mass destruction. To the film’s credit, part of Eternals narrative arc is its characters wrestling with the morality of this mandate. The misfortune of putting this dilemma to characters who live for thousands of years is pretty simple: The longer the characters take to let awful stuff happen before they do something about it, the more they seem like chumps. In the present day, however, it’s pretty easy for the Eternals to follow this mandate. All of the Deviants on Earth have been wiped out, but instead of being offered a ticket to their home, Olympia, they’ve been effectively abandoned by their god and gone their separate ways, living in secret among the people of Earth. The exposition pauses and the action begins when Sersi (Gemma Chan) and Sprite (Lia McHugh), who live in London as a teacher and an (eternal) 12-year-old, respectively, are attacked by a not-so-extinct Deviant who also seems strong enough to kill Eternals. When the Superman-esque Ikaris (Richard Madden) arrives to help fend the Deviant off, a mini Eternals reunion becomes a full-blown road trip to get the family back together and figure out what’s going on with the Deviants.  From here, Eternals becomes a hybrid travelogue and historical epic. As Sersi, Ikaris, and Sprite reunite with their seven other “siblings” across the globe, the film flashes back to pivotal moments of their time on Earth, reflecting on their relationships with each other and humanity. They’re in Mesopotamia in 5000 B.C. kickstarting the Bronze Age; then they’re in Babylon in 575 B.C. seeding the wonders of the Hanging Gardens; then they’re in 1575 Mexico watching in shock as genocidal Spanish colonists murder the people of Tenochtitlan. In cross cutting from one era to another, Zhao begins to emphasize place more than anything else — even action scenes seem to fade to take a backseat, a momentary interruption to the interpersonal drama of the Eternals as they question their role in the places around them. They fall in and out of love with each other, and humanity. They meet and are rebuffed by their god, Arishem the Celestial. They spend most of the film in doubt, unsure of what to do or believe. But Eternals is contemplative to a fault. Every time a new character is introduced, the ones we’ve previously met re-explain the story, and the same agreements and disagreements play out. In the best moments, Zhao allows the film to breathe around its most well-realized characters, like Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani) who has settled into life as a Bollywood star and joins up because he wants to turn the adventure into a documentary about him saving the world with his ridiculously powerful finger guns. Less bombastic but equally compelling is Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), the Eternal inventor who, out of guilt for accelerating human technology to atomic war is possible, has retreated into a quiet domestic life with his human husband and son in the suburbs.  The film’s cast is too big to give every character a fulfilling arc, but the film’s script by Zhao, Patrick Burleigh, Ryan Firpo, and Kaz Firpo devotes most of the film’s runtime to its least compelling characters. Sersi, with her vague power to transmute inanimate matter from one form to another, most effectively shown off when she turns a speeding bus into rose petals, is the de facto protagonist, but also a listless one: She is torn between her life pretending to be mortal and dating her historian boyfriend Dane (Kit Harington) and her grander purpose, which she starts to question, but only when forced to. It’s almost like the Eternals take their vow of nonintervention so seriously that they also refuse to drive the film’s plot.  Much has been made about what Chloé Zhao brings to the MCU as a filmmaker, largely stemming from Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige gushing over her insistence that Eternals be filmed on real locations, and not largely on green-screened soundstages, as many Marvel films are. The result is distinctive, but also strangely hollow. It’s as if, in order to accommodate the needs of a Marvel blockbuster, Eternals could only stage its action in the most barren of natural environments: a beach, a forest, a desert. Places big and open enough that a soundstage could be approximated, however begrudgingly. When it’s time for the naturalism of the film to give way to artificial action, the result is surprisingly demure — with one spectacular exception at the very end, Eternals’ action is quite small; a strange contrast to its grand scope. When the heroes “suit up” for their final fight, it almost feels wrong, or reluctant. The pat descriptors Marvel executives like Kevin Feige append to MCU films don’t hang so neatly on Eternals. Genre shorthand does a poor job of conveying what a viewer should expect. There are no heists, no spycraft, no strange new worlds nor hidden fantasy realms. Eternals is a meandering film about being estranged from your family, and how difficult it is to get the stones up to finally see them again. It’s two and a half hours full of people many thousands of years old going from place to place and talking about the good old days. After over a decade of the MCU formula’s dominance, it’s easy to mistake Eternals’ deviance for profundity. Films that wrestle with difficult experiences can often be difficult to watch, and intentionally so. Unfortunately, Eternals isn’t bold, merely incongruous. The simpler explanation is truer: Eternals is a mess.  It’s a movie concerned with conveying scale, about big ideas and forces that move on a geologic timetable beyond any one life. It wrestles with a morality that stretches beyond the considerations of one person or one planet, with purpose when time and distance have next to no meaning. The Marvel output bucks and protests under these conditions. The company’s plot-driven blockbusters are overwhelmingly concerned with the present, and to an arguably greater extent, what’s next. Eternals considers where we are, where we’ve been, and how much it’s changed us, if at all. These are largely internal ideas that are not easily translated to superhuman brawls in dim environs, where the beauty of the natural world is just a blank canvas for lasers and punching. Every fight is like a tether pulling Eternals back to the ground when it would rather fly. Each scene expounding on the cosmology of the MCU does more for movies we haven’t seen yet than it does for the one we’re watching. Movies can be big enough for ideas like this: difficult conversations of cosmic import with no clear answer, angry confrontations with an uncaring god, and whether or not our moral compass should shift as our perspective and reach grows. But a film must create a world where those questions matter, to its characters and to its audience. In a few short lines, Zhao did that with Nomadland. Eternals, however, just isn’t big enough. Or perhaps the Marvel Cinematic Universe is just too small. ",NEGATIVE

Alexander the Great may have wept when he found himself with no more worlds to conquer, but super-producer Kevin Feige — having usurped every screen on Earth and reshaped the global entertainment landscape in his own image — merely straightened his baseball cap and announced that it was time to begin the next phase of his crusade. He knew there were more planets to rule, more parallel dimensions to explore, and more revenue streams for Disney shareholders to tap dry. Most of all, Feige knew that it wasn’t enough to dominate the creative arts; if the Marvel brand were to achieve its rightful place in the hearts and minds of all humanity, it would have to unseat the Creator themselves. A major step towards achieving a kind of singularity between the Marvel Cinematic Universe (lucrative and popular) and the Actual Physical Universe (prestigious but full of fading stars), “Eternals” starts by papering over every origin story that science and religion have ever invented. “In the beginning…,” reads the text on screen, a supergiant Celestial named Arishem created the heavens and the Earth out of space dust. It created us, too — for reasons that will later be explained at great length during one of modern filmdom’s most explosive info dumps — along with a race of sinewy monsters called “Deviants” and an immortal alien task force known as “Eternals” that was eventually dispatched to protect our species after the beasts evolved beyond Arishem’s control. Oops. The idea that our planet and everyone on it was designed by such a sloppy cosmic builder makes a lot of sense, and some of the more ass-kissing Eternals are quick to defend Arishem by arguing that humanity’s greatest threats have always spurred its greatest strides. But the fact remains that Arishem is a fallible being, and the cataclysmic “emergence” triggered by the sudden return of half the world’s population will force the Eternals to question their maker for the first time in the 7,000 years since they landed on Earth. On paper, that should be enough to make “Eternals” a radical departure from the rest of the MCU, as well as a sharp escalation from the previous two installments of the mega-franchise’s current phase (the no-stakes prequel “Black Widow” and the relatively self-contained origin story “Shang-Chi”). In practice, it still amounts to several hours of watching good actors save the world from bad CGI, as philosophical differences erupt into a weightless battle royale while civilization itself hangs in the balance. By making such an unadventurous movie about how crisis breeds creativity, Marvel effectively illustrates why even the most independent-minded of filmmakers are powerless to evolve an apex predator franchise that doesn’t have any Darwinian impetus to adapt. Which isn’t to say that “Eternals” fails to score any points for its scope and relative sense of gravity, or to overlook the subtle — and not so subtle — ways that it pushes back against the plastic-ness of a franchise that often looks as if it had been filmed against a Zoom background. Chloé Zhao, who shot her Oscar-winning “Nomadland” during pre-production on this movie, isn’t the first auteur to faintly put their stamp on one of the assembly-line spectacles manufactured by Feige’s money factory. Nevertheless, there’s a galaxy of difference between hiring a populist like Shane Black to gift “Iron Man 3” with a bitter dose of Christmas spirit, and handing the reins of a $200 million blockbuster to an arthouse darling who’d never shot on a set, cast most of her roles with non-professional actors, and boasted a body of work that consisted of two micro-budget indie dramas (both inextricable from the rugged naturalism with which they were filmed). Giving Zhao this job is simply the most interesting decision that Marvel has made behind the camera since Edgar Wright’s departure from “Ant-Man” suggested the studio wasn’t interested in making any. Nobody is going to mistake “Eternals” for “Songs My Brother Taught Me” — and Feige’s justifiably mocked enthusiasm over Zhao’s use of real-world locations is a helpful reminder of how low the bar has been set for this stuff — but compared to the diarrheal computer goop of the “Endgame” finale, this might as well be Dogme 95. Exterior scenes are desaturated for seriousness but shot with natural light, dialogue is often exchanged without a bombastic underscore, and many of the Eternals introduced by Zhao, Patrick Burleigh, and Ryan and Kaz Firpo’s script look and behave like real people (even if they’re actually deathless aliens who are stuck in the same bodies for all time). Some of the bigger special effects are so monumental they circle past realism and all the way back around until they achieve a sense of awe that’s been sorely absent from the MCU. In a refreshing change of pace for these movies, the climactic orgy of 1s and 0s is rendered with a tact that feels more ominous than numbing (“Shadow of the Colossus” comes to mind). But there are other moments of digital majesty along the way. The prologue, in which star-crossed Eternals Sersi (Gemma Chan) and Ikaris (Richard Madden) first meet each other aboard their crew’s Earthbound spaceship, is kissed with some of the stately grandeur that Stanley Kubrick brought to “2001.” In the “Everyone is hot but no one is horny” era of Marvel films, kissing is as far as things would ever go; by contrast, it’s only a few scenes after the Eternals endear themselves to the people of ancient Babylon and begin their protective watch over our species that two of them consecrate our planet with some old-fashioned shimmying under the sheets. Silly as it may sound, even that very PG tryst helps contribute to the earthiness of Zhao’s approach. And Sersi and Ikaris aren’t the only Eternals with a pulse, even if these one-dimensional characters (she empathetic, he duty-bound to a fault) are largely humanized by their mutual attraction. After 25 adventures populated by sexless action figures, the basic fact of physical intimacy — whether expressed through allure or absence — makes a big difference across the board. No relationship in the MCU has exuded the sheer warmth shared between techno wizard Phastos (a sweet but out of his element Brian Tyree Henry) and his husband. The forever prepubescent Sprite (Lia McHugh) is agonized by the knowledge she’ll never be an adult. The mind-controlling Druig (a compellingly aloof Barry Keoghan) is isolated from humans by the control he wields over them, just as the softhearted Gilgamesh (a gloriously robust Don Lee) is cut off from his platonic life partner because her deadly alien dementia keeps them at an arm’s length (Thena is played by Angelina Jolie, whose immense star power unbalances such a minor role). Sersi and Ikaris may be flattened by the sheer weight of their moral positions, but the rest of this film’s uncommonly human supporting characters help anchor “Eternals” to reality while its scale grows large enough to make the entire Avengers saga feel like a blip in comparison. Even Kumail Nanjiani’s Kingo, who injects some much-needed levity into Marvel’s least comic movie and has more fun with the whole immortality thing than any of his fellow alien friends, is given the space to make a bizarre yet supremely relatable choice in the build-up to the final battle. The dramatic heft of Zhao’s film stems from the sense that it’s telling the story that underwrites all of the other stories in the MCU, and when the Eternals are inevitably fractured into rival groups, their fighting words are grounded with the weight of shared millennia. If only those words weren’t so frequently at odds with the movie around them. Much of the endless yammering in “Eternals” focuses on the vital role that death plays in rebirth, and yet it’s the ever-evolving Deviants who represent the natural order of things. The majority of Zhao’s heroes, on the other hand, decide to reject the wisdom they’ve gleaned from 7,000 years on Earth and side against the circle of life. It’s hard to blame them — even immortal space creatures are willing to die for love — but watching the Eternals reject the infinite churn of the universe and fight to protect the status quo is as touching a metaphor for The Movies at large as it is a damning self-critique of these ones in particular. “Eternals” was uniquely poised to push the MCU in new directions, and Feige’s decision to entrust it to such a fiercely individualistic filmmaker would seem to suggest a willingness to make good on that potential. The story may cut to the core of series mythology, but aside from the Emergence it’s almost completely divorced from the rest of the saga. That’s also true enough of the movie’s style and tone, at least in the context of a franchise that previously just rotated between different flavors of the same basic dish. The Eternals are told not to interfere with the workings of our world, and so it stands to reason that their adventure exists a half-step outside of the MCU — if the previous 25 installments could be thought of as the attractions of a theme park, “Eternals” takes place behind the doors marked “employees only.” Alas, this elastic mega-franchise only allows itself to be stretched so far before it snaps back to its default shape. For all of the incidental choices that set “Eternals” apart and seem to promise that Marvel has found the chutzpah required to break — or even bend — the vibranium blockbuster mold it so boldly forged in the first place, Zhao’s film is still just adhering to a template. Its idea of conflict is still characters barking platitudes at each other (here rehashing an intergalactic version of the same trolley problem that antagonized Iron Man against Captain America in “Civil War”). Its idea of resolution is still having those characters fly around and shoot finger lights at stuff in a way that never fools your brain into believing the physical reality of what you’re watching. And while the Deviants serve a curiously different purpose here than previous MCU baddies might lead you to expect, it’s one that underlines why people fighting computer-generated monsters is the biggest waste of time in the world. Yes, all of these are superhero tropes writ large, and comic book fans might see them as features instead of bugs. But can’t these movies do anything else? Is it too much to ask the most dominant kind of cinema on the planet to shake things up and challenge itself in a more significant way? That “Eternals” feigns at such freedom only makes it harder to stomach when it falls back on the same old song, even if Zhao sings it in a slightly different key than we’ve heard before. Superhero movies are often defended as the Westerns of their day, but Westerns are a genre — the MCU is just a stencil, and Zhao’s ability to paint with a different brush ultimately highlights how even she had to color inside the lines. The Marvel Cinematic Universe will continue to expand for the foreseeable future, but it may need to be threatened with extinction before it can actually grow.

"Oct 24, 2021"," The superheroes in Chloé Zhao’s “Eternals” are bound to each other by many things, starting with the interlocking rings and shafts and bolts of golden light that emanate from their very being. The light — a cosmic energy they share — is the piping that lines their uniforms, and it’s the shape-shifting weaponry they conjure to battle the Deviants (gnashing, fast-break monsters that resemble dinosaurs with everything but their sinew and bone stripped away). That filigreed network of light, floating and darting through the air, serves many purposes, and it’s the most tangible figment of Chloé Zhao’s artistry — her way of grabbing hold of the vast machinery of a $200 million comic-book franchise movie and turning it into something elegant and aesthetic, with visual effects that dance before your eyes. The film presents the Eternals, who have spent 7,000 years saving life on Earth, as an organically unified army of noble warrior souls. Unlike, say, the X-Men, who are boldly demarcated in their powers (this one catches fire, that one has metal claws, this one makes the best chocolate soufflé you ever tasted), the Eternals, while they do have individual talents, such as the ability of one of them to shoot golden rays of light (there it is again) out of his eyes, all share powers like super-strength and the gifts of flight and teleportation. Their free-flowing, all-for-one unity extends, in spirit, to the diversity of the characters, which is something the film presents with a no-big-deal effrontery that makes them a winning prototype of a more dynamically inclusive superhero world. Four of the Eternals are white, three are Asian, two are Black, and one is Latina. One is gay, one is deaf, and one is an androgynous tween who never grows up. Any troll who surveys this lively medley of backgrounds and temperaments only to gripe that the movie is too “woke” might have lodged the same complaint about “Star Trek” 55 years ago. Zhao is far from the first director to take the leap from ardently crafted medium-budget independent cinema to the corporate stratosphere of helming a superhero movie. That she’s one of the first women — and one of the first Asians — to do so is a landmark worth celebrating. Yet as I approached “Eternals,” the question I was most curious about was whether Zhao, who in “Nomadland” and “The Rider” defined her filmmaking style in a unique poetic way, would carry any remnants of that mode over to the blockbuster universe. Her previous films are raw and real enough to feel like staged documentaries, yet they’re cut together, image by image, with a gripping pointillistic exactitude. “Eternals” has none of that. It’s clear that Zhao, in signing up for this project, made a decision to put her highly expressive and idiosyncratic style on the shelf, and to embrace the straight-up expository conventionality of Marvel filmmaking. That’s something of a disappointment. Yet Zhao’s sensibility, to a degree, comes through — in the casual humanity of the characters, in the flow of quip and conflict and passion (at times romantic), in the beauty of the effects, in the no-sweat way that Zhao scales up her logistical skills. She’s a master craftswoman, and “Eternals,” while too long (157 minutes? really?), is a squarely fun and gratifying watch. Yet one has to say, the film feels very standard. It’s in the genre of team superhero movies, and at this point, between the Avengers and the X-Men, the Guardians of the Galaxy and the Justice League, the Suicide Squad and the Fantastic Four, there have been more than 20 of those. They have their tropes — the camaraderie and the backbiting, the falling apart and the coming together. Zhao works within those tropes, lending them sturdy drama and dimension and springing some major twists on the audience. The Eternals have lived through most of human history, and the film keeps flashing back to key episodes of it (in Mesopotamia, Babylon, Hiroshima). They show up whenever the Deviants do, slaying the beasts so that the human race can go on, and sometimes — though they’re not supposed to — nudging the evolution of civilization along. (They introduce the plough, and will tend to hypnotize a group of fighters into laying down their arms.) In the contemporary world, each Eternal has a home, but they’re a bit like vampires: ageless impersonators of normality (though as we learn, they can die). Sirse, played with a serene three-dimensional command by Gemma Chan, is our heroine, a London museum curator who has carried on a love affair across the centuries with the dashing Ikaris (Richard Madden) — though that ended, and now she’s involved with the merely human Dane (Kit Harington). Kingo, played by the droll Kumail Nanjiani as the most amusingly off-kilter superhero since Deadpool, is an acerbically vain Bollywood star. Gilgamesh (Don Lee) is an affable strongman living in isolation in the Aussie outback, and Phastos, played with a scene-stealing quarrelsome magnetism by Brian Tyree Henry, is a suburban dad in Chicago with a husband and an adorable son. The other Eternals include Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), an ebullient deaf speed dasher, and Thena (Angelina Jolie), a fierce warrior who has succumbed to “Mahd Wy’ry” (pronounced “mad weary”) — that is, she’s cracking up as a result of having collected too many memories. (The only cure, which she rejects, is to have the slate of your mind wiped clean.) When summoned, the Eternals are better than good at defeating Deviants, who are now attacking them directly. But there’s a wrinkle in the cosmic sphere: Ajak (Salma Hayek), the wise and seemingly benevolent leader of the Eternals, has been guarding a secret — and when we learn it, it elevates the drama to a rather intriguing moral plane. Ajak communes with a Celestial, one of the majestic beings that keep the universe going; he’s portrayed as a kind of iron giant in the sky and has revealed the Eternals’ true purpose to her. It is not what it seems. But is he a dark force like Thanos or a benevolent god? Maybe both. Speaking of which, how, exactly, does the plot of this movie intersect with the “Avengers” saga? If you want to give yourself a case of Mahd Wy’ry, discuss. It turns out that Earth has been serving as a giant seed pod to hatch a new Celestial, and if the Eternals are to support that mission, it means…well, darkness. Can they come together to defend their adopted home? The suspense will not be killing you, though the final battle summons aspects of grandeur. To me, there are three top-tier team superhero movies: the first “Guardians of the Galaxy,” “Zack Snyder’s Justice League,” and “Avengers: Infinity War.” “Eternals” is a fluid and sometimes bedazzling entertainment I’d place on the next tier, because it never transcends its conventionality and makes you go “Damn!” Maybe next time, Zhao can raise the stakes on the heroic vibes by mixing in a drop of nomad reality.",POSITIVE
"Oct 24, 2021"," There were more than a few raised eyebrows when it was announced that Eternals, the latest offering from the Marvel Cinematic Universe would be directed by award-winning indie filmmaker Chloé Zhao (The Rider, Nomadland). Famed for her restrained and unfussy style, Zhao may not have seemed like the most obvious of choices to take on such a project, but on the whole it felt like a step in the right direction for the popular franchise.
Created in 1976 by Jewish comic book artist Jack Kirby and based on a brand new set of MCU characters, Eternals promised to be not only thematically unique, but to also feature a commendably diverse cast made up of some unlikely comic book heroes.
Angelina Jolie leads a stellar cast which also features British actors Gemma Chan (Humans), Game of Throne co-stars Richard Madden and Kit Harrington and South Korean American actor Ma Dong-seok. Elsewhere, Dublin-born indie favourite Barry Keoghan (The Killing of a Sacred Deer) also stars alongside comedian Kumail Nanjiani and acclaimed stage and screen actor Brian Tyree Henry (If Beale Street Could Talk).
After the return of half the population in Avengers: Endgame, the Eternals — an immortal race who have secretly lived on Earth for over 7,000 years—reunite to protect humanity from the Deviants. Sersi (Chan) finds herself face to face with her former love Ikaris (Madden). Meanwhile, Thena (Jolie) is suffering a personality crisis which could destroy her and all those around her. After suffering a bitter betrayal, Sersi and the rest of the Eternals must fight to save Earth and humanity from total obliteration. 
As much as it pains me to say it, Zhao presents one of the weakest MCU offerings yet. Eternals is a mishmash of well-meaning, yet jarringly verbose and bafflingly incoherent nonsense which is only just abut saved by some half decent performances. While nobody can say whether Zhao is fully responsible for the film’s failure, there is little doubt that this truly isn’t the film any of us were expecting from this hugely accomplished filmmaker.
If there is one thing that could always be improved upon in any given superhero movie, it is that often we are left with an under developed plot in favour of big action set pieces. In the case of Eternals, I often found myself longing for long drawn-out fight scenes and elaborate explosions in the hope of drowning out the feeling of tedium left by the very introspective nature of this particular story. Furthermore, the film’s worst crime is how little Angelina Jolie is given to work with, which is genuinely one of the most disappointing aspect of this whole sorry affair.
Still, there’s no doubt that Marvel devotees will once again lap it up and might even forgive the rather shambolic nature of this offering, but on the whole there isn’t much here in a way of plot to make anyone want to sit through this more than once.

"Oct 24, 2021"," In a Marvel story, time is fluid and history collapses, except when you’re sitting through one of their more artless and chaotic peril-fests, in which case the world being saved can’t come soon enough. Hiring Chloe Zhao to direct “Eternals,” however, sparked a curiosity unusual for a zealously protected billion-dollar commodity: Would the small-bore, contemplative humanity Zhao brought to “The Rider” and her Academy Award–winning “Nomadland” survive the scaled-up Marvel Cinematic Universe playbook? The answer is a qualified yes, in that there’s no mistaking that “Eternals” — adapted from creator Jack Kirby’s story of space immortals called to protect Earth’s humans throughout its history — is both a Marvel superhero epic, as massively conceived as they come, and unquestionably Zhao’s version of one, as attentive to beauty and intimacy as it is to the expected fate-of-all-life concerns. On a granular watching level alone, it feels temporally different. Shots in “Eternals” linger more than your average restlessly cut MCU whiz-banger. Even with 10 new heroes to get to know — centered by Gemma Chan’s transmutation-powered Sersi, Richard Madden’s high-flying Ikaris, and Angelina Jolie’s warrior Thena — there’s a quality-time vibe to everyone’s emotional trajectory, thanks to an image-making ethos with Ben Davis’s deep-focus cinematography that affords many good, long looks at an Eternal majestically foregrounding a stunning location, or having a genial, confrontational, even romantic moment with a colleague. (There’s even a moment of PG-13 lovemaking.) The effect is that “Eternals” puts a welcome premium on what it might feel like to have a close-knit bond across many centuries, and then have that bond be threatened. So yes, these are Zhao horizons (photographic and metaphorical), only with superpowers, galactic suits and gnarly CGI alien beasts called Deviants sharing the space. The director’s drink-it-in approach does make “Eternals” the second-longest in the franchise canon. But with a story zipping around the globe (London, South Dakota, Iraq, Australia), flashing back through empires (Babylonian, Aztec, Gupta) and sporting a handful of languages — including sign, courtesy of the first deaf MCU character, speedy Makkari (a winning Lauren Ridloff) — there are still plenty of narrative vectors to keep things pacey alongside the usual action sequences and squabbly team-dynamic humor. (Kumail Nanjiani’s energy-blasting, vain Kingo shoulders most of those laughs.) We first meet this diverse ensemble — led by matriarch Ajak (a stiff but sincere Salma Hayek), point person for their Celestial boss — on their inaugural mission, swooping into early-civilization Mesopotamia from their slab of a spaceship to save a tribe of ill-equipped humans from marauding Deviants. Jumping to present day London, where Sersi is now a teacher and dating an unsuspecting normie (a game Kit Harington), we learn that the Eternals’ shadow guardianship of human progress was completed eras ago. They now live ageless lives amongst mortals around the world. For gentle protector Gilgamesh (Don Lee), living in the outback, it means more time for hobbies and looking after a battle-scarred Thena. For Kingo, it’s indulging Bollywood stardom with a valet (the wonderful Harish Patel) recording his every move. Who immortal retirement is not so easy for is Sprite (Lia McHugh), an ancient in the body of a 12-year-old, forever seen as a child. What spurs an urgent reunion is the sudden reappearance of the Deviants, thought to have been vanquished for good at Tenochtitlan in 1521. That date was also when Spanish colonizers made their move, yet Ajak’s insistence — shown in flashback — that Eternals avoid meddling in conflicts between humans doesn’t sit well with the group, especially Druig (Barry Keoghan), who’d just as soon stop wars with his mind-control powers, and the fantastic Brian Tyree Henry’s sensitive super-inventor Phastos, eager to give humans all the technology he can devise to better themselves. These are, of course, ideals with downsides; the fact that the screenplay (by Zhao, Patrick Burleigh, Ryan Firpo and Kaz Firpo) wants to wrestle with the cataclysms of power, inaction and progress across history — albeit in a simplified manner which yet recalls the power of myths to amplify the big questions — is still a significant one for an MCU epic. After so many Marvel movies that give lip service to the thornier ramifications of its hero narratives, there’s an earnestness to the operatic stakes in “Eternals” that somehow helps fuse what’s physically spectacular and philosophical about it. That it’s played out, too, by a cast that looks like our world only burnishes what Zhao is trying to pull off from inside a trope-laden franchise. Does that make “Eternals” fun, you ask? Look, hasn’t there been enough tiresome digitalized adrenaline from these things already? Not an answer? Then, yes, there is fun; plenty of stunts, jokes, combat, visuals, twists and, for the romantics, more than one love story, and not all of them straight, thank god. The performances do their jobs, too, especially when, outside the regulation superhero pantomiming. Zhao’s compassionate gaze requires something extra, for love, destiny, the planet, everything. After all, there might be a volcano erupting in the background, or a planet-sized being in the frame.  But what makes “Eternals” feel special is that, for once, the director genuinely cares as much about the character within that spectacle, as the spectacle itself.",POSITIVE

Our experts review games, movies and tech over countless hours, so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about our reviews policy. After 13 years, four Avengers, and 21 other blockbusters, we know what to expect by now from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. There’ll be action and spectacle and clever character crossovers, with enough slyly knowing humor to offset the occasional tragic exit or life-decimating blip.  There have definitely been bumps along the road, not to mention a woeful dragging of heels in the diversity and inclusion department. What cannot be queried is that Kevin Feige and his pals have constructed Hollywood’s most dependable hit factory, with a guaranteed global audience more than happy to gobble up more of the same. The moment Eternals begins, though, they’ll know they’re getting something different. A Star Wars-style scroll unfurls a new cosmic mythology, one in which all-powerful beings named Celestials rule the roost from the heavens, while ageless warriors – the Eternals of the title – do their bidding on Earth. A dizzying opening salvo locates these heroes, 10 in all, in Mesopotamia in 5020 B.C., using their superpowers to defend a beachhead from a snarling sea-beast armed with whirling serpentine tendrils.  The customary Marvel logo, meanwhile, is accompanied not by Michael Giacchino’s stirring fanfare but by Pink Floyd’s ""Time"" – a canny choice for a film that spans 7,000 years of human history and spends much of its two hours and 30-odd minutes hopscotching between millennia like a hyperactive Tardis. On paper, the boundless imagination of comic-book innovator Jack Kirby and the low-key naturalism of Oscar-winning Nomadland director Chloé Zhao seem irreconcilable poles apart. On screen, though, they combine to create a movie of epic scale and ambition, with a keening, pensive soulfulness at its heart that invites serious contemplation on existential imponderables.  The Eternals – nominally led by Salma Hayek’s Ajak, a maternal healer with Wonder Woman’s taste in headgear – are tasked with battling 'Deviants', like that aforementioned sea creature, and have been expressly instructed not to meddle in human affairs. After so many centuries, though, how can an empath like Sersi (Gemma Chan) not have affection for the mortals she co-exists with? And how can a shape-shifter like Sprite (Lia McHugh) – a fellow immortal doomed for all time to be the girl who never grows up – not feel curious about what life might be like as a mature and fecund woman? These aren’t the sort of questions Iron Man or Thor had much room for as they hared about the galaxy in search of Infinity Stones. Indeed, there is much more of a Zack Snyder’s Justice League vibe to the MCU’s latest ensemble, which we see gradually reunited in the present day in response to a series of mysterious earthquakes that portend a rupture in the current world order.  Exotic flashbacks to ancient Babylon and 16th-century South America reveal why the now-separated Eternals require reassembling, as well as the reason the once-fearsome Thena (a rather underused Angelina Jolie sporting a stilted English accent) isn’t quite the force she used to be. A witty pit-stop in India, meanwhile, has Kumail Nanjiani’s Kingo reinvented as a Bollywood leading man, complete with a loyal valet (Harish Patel) documenting his every utterance. Putting the team back together takes up so much time it’s inevitable that some members get less attention than others. It is unfortunate that it’s Brian Tyree Henry’s gay family man Phastos and Deaf actress Lauren Ridloff who are most noticeably sidelined, the latter’s much-heralded casting as speed dynamo Makkari amounting to little more than a cameo.  In the year of CODA and Rose Ayling-Ellis on the UK's Strictly Come Dancing, it’s a pity that more was not done to integrate Ridloff – and the sign language in which she so eloquently converses – more fluently into the story. As it is, we’re left wanting more from her – something that can’t really be said of Richard Madden’s Superman-ish Ikaris, Barry Keoghan’s sullen mind-manipulator Druig, or Kit Harington’s Dane, a beige love interest for Chan’s sensual Sersi, whose role seems set to be expanded in future instalments. Fans expecting the slam-bang escapism of Black Widow and the genre-based certainties of Shang-Chi may be initially wrongfooted by Zhao’s tinkering with the established formula. Yet her daring pays off with a movie that, for all its players’ Guardians-style banter, has a purposefulness and gravitas that feels strikingly akin in places to Denis Villeneuve’s recent Dune.  This is certainly the first Marvel film to reference both the Hiroshima bombing and the Tenochtitlan massacre of 1520, while the connections it draws between overpopulation and extinction seem explicitly tailored to contemporary environmental concerns. That it can do this while also putting Don Lee’s Gilgamesh in a fuzzy pink romper suit bodes well for a franchise that looks eminently capable of developing in more than one direction.

"Oct 24, 2021"," Throughout the long runtime of Marvel's ""Eternals,"" I weirdly could not stop thinking about a random phrase from a season 2 sketch of ""I Think You Should Leave with Tim Robinson."" In that sketch, Santa Claus retires from delivering presents to children for the more lucrative job of starring in action movie cash grabs, which he enthusiastically promotes with the nonsense descriptor: ""It's kind of a cosmic gumbo."" The phrase intentionally pokes fun at the movie biz practice of combining colorful adjectives in a way that sounds sophisticated, but actually means nothing. And that's the phrase that kept echoing through my head as I watched ""Eternals,"" Marvel's most ambitious and majestic film yet. Now it sounds like I'm trashing ""Eternals"" — not at all. At best, I think it's the work of a singular director who brings with her a grand, awe-inspiring vision of austere science-fiction the likes of which has never been seen in Marvel before. At worst, I think it's a mixed bag. But ""Eternals"" does feel like a strange combination of a truly inspired filmmaker and a meticulously focus group-tested pitch, with director Chloé Zhao given all the tools at the studio's disposal to bring her vision to life. It's impressive and mythic and wild and dazzling, yet it also feels strangely diluted. So ... you might say it's a cosmic gumbo. ""Eternals"" follows the titular group of immortal beings who were sent to Earth by a group of all-powerful cosmic entities known as the Celestials, some of the first lifeforms created in the universe. The Eternals are sent to defend the Earth from the Deviants, monstrous aliens that mindlessly devour any lifeform in its path. Led by the wise Ajak (a beatific Salma Hayek), the Eternals include the compassionate but naïve Sersi (Gemma Chan, practically the definition of ""doe-eyed""), the group's pseudo-Superman member Ikaris (a deliciously dubious Richard Madden), the aggressive warrior Thena (Angelina Jolie, fragile and fierce in equal measure), and the finger gun-wielding Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani, having a blast). Filling out the rest of this unlikely family are the youthful Sprite (Lia McHugh), who has the power to create illusions; Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry, injecting a deep sensitivity into his role), inventor extraordinaire; Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), a deaf speedster; Gilgamesh (Don Lee, an indomitable presence in and of itself), the strongest and kindest of the group; and finally, Druig (Barry Keoghan, playing with his inherently threatening energy), the member with the ability to manipulate the minds of others. The group arrive on Earth in the prehistoric era, 7,000 years before the Avengers existed, with a simple mission: to eliminate all the Deviants. They're told not to interfere in human conflict, but are not discouraged from nudging along human progress, with Phastos introducing many an innovation to the humans, Sprite weaving some myths for the adoring humans, and Sersi aiding in the cultivation of crops. The film skips back and forth in time, as we pick up with Sersi in modern day, living amongst mortals and happy in a relationship with a fellow professor, Dane Whitman (Kit Harington, reveling in a lighter role for once). But her normal life is interrupted by an attack from a Deviant — the last of which the Eternals thought they had eliminated thousands of years ago — and the return of her longtime ex-lover, Ikaris. Terrified at the prospect of the Deviants returning, Sersi rallies Ikaris and Sprite to find the rest of the Eternals, who have scattered around the globe and have long abandoned humanity to their feckless ways. From the beginning, ""Eternals"" was a big gamble for Marvel. The Jack Kirby-created comics upon which the movie is based are some of the trippiest things to come out of Marvel Comics — so eye-popping and visually dense that you'd think drugs were involved in its creation (for the record, Jack Kirby is very anti-drug). They're also quite niche, even for Marvel Studios. But Marvel was able to turn the formerly obscure Guardians of the Galaxy into its biggest superstars, so why not another group of cosmic superbeings?  To do that, they needed a strong creative hand, and they found that in Chloé Zhao. Zhao is possibly the biggest get for Marvel yet — a historic Oscar winner and a beloved auteur for her exquisite double bill neo-Westerns ""The Rider"" and ""Nomadland."" But her naturalistic style seemed at odds with the gonzo acid trip of Kirby's ""Eternals."" So how does it all shake out? With a movie that does eventually manage to find the perfect median between the mythic weirdness of Kirby's comics and Zhao's meditative naturalism. The only problem is that it takes a long time to get there. The first half is, to put it mildly, rough. As Sersi, Ikaris, and Sprite travel the globe to find their fellow Eternals, the film weaves in flashbacks to the early days of their arrival, building to the group eventually fracturing. There's a dissonance in those flashbacks, which are filmed largely on-location in various fields and rock formations and are shot in that dusky magic hour which lovingly drapes so much of Zhao's films. The scenery is beautiful and the landscapes breathtaking, but it's inhabited awkwardly by the Eternals, who placidly stroll around the vistas in their stiff supersuits and spend half of the flashbacks lining up to pose in ""superhero team"" formation (I counted at least three times). There's probably some intent to the distance with which this insanely talented ensemble play the characters in this early half — they're told not to interfere with humans, but they come to care for them anyways — but it only undercuts the humanistic streak that Zhao brings to the film. It's only when the film's meditative tone (or attempt at doing so) gives way to the grand, brazenly weird mythos that ""Eternals"" starts to kick into gear. But even so, the most interesting seeds of ""Eternals"" are only hinted at, and only come to the surface toward the end of the film — and by then, it feels like the film has only just gotten started. Zhao employs a Villeneuve-inspired (i.e. sleek obelisk-style spaceships) aesthetic to convey the austere, incomprehensible vastness of space, and then brings out the indomitable Celestials — hulking, mammoth figures who loom over all creation and hint at a kind of cosmic horror. The most intriguing part of ""Eternals"" is its subtext. ""Eternals"" is by far Marvel's bleakest film, essentially consigning humanity to inevitable destruction. It's not hard to see the climate change allegory in that worldview, but it's the kind of gutting revelation that basically gets breezed past by the film in favor of more people in spandex punching ""World of Warcraft"" monsters. With ""Eternals,"" Marvel turns a risky gamble into another piece of the puzzle. Its cosmic ambitions, its prevailing humanism amid a nihilistic outlook, and its gestures at maturity — the (real!) sex scene, the depth and warmth that they give to Henry's LGBTQ relationship — are not enough to make ""Eternals"" more than just another film to fit neatly in the Marvel Studios mold. But even so, Zhao brings an elegance to the film and the cast bring a vulnerability and care to their characters that leave a lingering impression, even as the last super-punch fades.",POSITIVE
"Oct 24, 2021"," Eternals is sprawling — across scenery, across centuries, you name it. Director Chloé Zhao’s immortal epic dances across timelines and alliances with ease. Though, despite the spectacle of it all, the latest Marvel film falls victim to the old “just because you can doesn’t mean you should” in some areas. The depth of the story is coupled with the huge, sweeping landscapes that Zhao is known for, but when you’re focusing on such a huge, overarching story with an already impressive runtime, breathtaking but otherwise time-consuming nature shots can start to feel like a bit of a chore. The story follows ten immortal beings throughout Earth’s history as they fight to protect the planet from the Deviants (they’re basically large, cranky, tentacle-y murder monsters, for those unfamiliar). Sersi, Ikaris, Kingo, Sprite, Phastos, Makkari, Druig, Thena, and Gilgamesh all follow their leader, Ajak, on their mission to serve the celestial Arishem. Each Eternal has their own unique powerset and, as you can imagine, their own special interpersonal drama within their complicated little family. While they don’t all get the same amount of screentime, you can imagine how tall of an order this film was by the main cast size alone. It’s joked that the team was the original Avengers a couple times in Eternals, which really helps drive home the wide arc that the story is trying to accomplish. The team of immortals may be interwoven in a way that you can’t really tell their origins individually, but imagine going into the first Avengers with no prior introduction to the team. That’s the insane task Zhao was given. By and large, she rises to meet that challenge. We’re given a good grasp on the temperament and motivations of each of the ten with limited story bloat. If there’s an area where the team dynamic fails, it’s in the immortality of it all. Grave sins are committed throughout the story, all of which seem to be quickly forgiven and forgotten. This is likely to illustrate that holding a grudge gets boring after being alive for several centuries, but it gives their internal conflict less emotional impact. Much of our time is spent with Sersi (Gemma Chan), Sprite (Lia McHugh), and Ikarus (Richard Madden), and the rest of the screen time is mostly balanced between the remaining seven Eternals. This is the most diverse cast in Marvel Studios history. That fact is exciting in and of itself, but one of the most fun aspects of the film is that you could be in a room full of ten people and each one of them could easily answer with a different favorite member of the team both from character and performance perspectives, as they’re all so vastly distinct with their own specific  qualities. Thena (Angelina Jolie) filled that role for me, but it could have easily gone to Gilgamesh (Ma Dong-seok) or Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani) as well. A not insignificant aside to the performance conversation is Disney and Marvel’s repeat offenses when it comes to queerness in their films. Eternals is the latest in a long list of Disney-related properties with the promise of queer representation, and we’re all tired. But this one’s gay! Actually, this time. For real. Brian Tyree Henry’s Phastos is a lovely, developed character with a real life and a loving family. The bar for the franchise’s LGBTQ representation is on the floor, and we’re not here to outline the exact happenings for spoiler reasons, but trust that this time the claims of a gay character is actually true. Better still, you can expect to be surprised by the intimacy of Zhao’s Eternals on multiple levels. Eternals’ success as a film can almost entirely be attributed to the performances and relationships between characters. Their conflict and complicated connection to the human race makes for incredibly interesting subject matter. The grand scale of the galactic aspects of the story catches up quick, though. Once things shift past the Deviants and become more of a Celestial struggle, the story starts to rip at the seams. The problem is that it feels like there was truly no way for Zhao to succeed here. Scrapping some of her trademark grand landscape shots wouldn’t have made enough time for her to be able to connect us to these characters and give us the kind of grand finale that Marvel films are known for. Conversely, had their story been split into two films, the first one would have been called incomplete (not to mention the three-year gap that would have followed due to the MCU’s packed slate). An irresistible force meets an immovable object, and the collision results in what feels like superficial sparks. In the end, these complicated gods feel like the most human of Marvel’s heroes. Perhaps it’s the diversity of their team, or their messy, messy, relationships. Either way, the humanity of it all has a real impact here. Karun (Harish Patel) — Kingo’s manager and the human we spend the most time with in the film — fits right in because they’re flawed in the exact same ways humanity is flawed. Also because he is incomparably brilliant and one of Eternals’ brightest spots, but that’s beside the point entirely! Eternals is huge. Centuries worth of stories and a whole team of vastly different heroes are condensed into a visually stunning and impeccably acted film. The relationships of these complicated characters keep things as fresh as they can, but the story gets unwieldy when it shifts into a cosmic scale. Had it kept the narrative closer to home, it would have played better as a standalone film, but it wouldn’t have felt like the grand Eternals introduction into the MCU had that been the case. Director Chloé Zhao was met with an impossible challenge that she took on with grace, skill, and her trademark jaw-dropping scenery. ",POSITIVE
"Oct 24, 2021"," It’s hard to overstate how much of a coup it was for Marvel Studios to hire Chloé Zhao as the director of Eternals. Plenty of high-profile filmmakers have walked through its doors, but Marvel is, first and foremost, a producer-driven studio, guided by the five-dimensional chess moves of Kevin Feige, who can see the studio’s future like Doctor Strange with the Time Stone. Directors come and go, but Feige is always there. Zhao feels different. The most recent winner of both Best Director and Best Picture Oscars (for Nomadland), Zhao brings prestige and critical cred. She is an impressively understated, tender, ground-level kind of filmmaker. Her first three films, all carefully paced and driven by characters over narrative, harnessed the psychogeography of American landscapes to better understand marginalised people surviving on the fringes. What happens when this most humanistic of director is let loose with superhumans? There’s a fascinating tension in Eternals between the unstoppable force of the Marvel project and the immovable object of Zhao’s artistic sensibilities. In many ways, this looks and feels nothing like any Chloé Zhao film we’ve seen before. Her regular cinematographer, Joshua James Richards, is out; Marvel lenser Ben Davis is in, along with the truckload of CGI necessary for superhero stories. Zhao’s trademark realism and semi-documentarian approach is gone, substituted by stiff fantasy exposition and blockbuster conventions. No bad thing in themselves, but anyone anticipating the first ‘arthouse Marvel’ should temper their expectations. And yet in many ways, this film looks and feels nothing like any previous Marvel film. There are, for example, at least a couple of firsts: a genuine sex scene, and an onscreen gay kiss — unheard of in the normally rather chaste MCU. She finds room, too, for visual flair and authorship, even within that blockbuster framework; her love of a wide-angle panorama or a Terrence Malick-esque sunset lends this Jack Kirby cosmic romp a much-need earthiness. It’s an important counter-balance, in fact, because Eternals is nothing if not ambitious. In many ways this is Marvel’s Genesis story: a Star Wars-style opening crawl sets things up in biblical proportions (“In the beginning…”). The Eternals, we are told, are not just Earth’s true mightiest heroes, but essential cogs in the engine of human evolution. Like the monoliths of 2001: A Space Odyssey, they nudge us along at the key turning points of civilisation, and provide inspirations for ancient human myths. This is storytelling on an epic scale, spanning from 5,000 BC to the present day, the stakes laid down by the godlike Celestials. The film’s confident structure barrels between flashbacks and locations, trotting the globe from ancient Mesopotamia to the gardens of Babylon to the Aztec city of Tenochtitlan to, erm, Camden High Street. Playing on such a colossal stage, it’s inevitably challenging to keep the focus at the (super)human level. Zhao takes her time introducing everyone properly, devoting much of the runtime (at 157 minutes, this is the MCU’s second-longest film after Endgame) to getting the team of ten back together, after centuries apart. It’s undeniably refreshing to see such a mix in the line-up — these ancient immortals talk in Irish brogues or American Sign Language without ever feeling the need to address it — but some characters leave more of an impression than others. The definite standouts are Kumail Nanjiani’s Kingo, an Eternal who takes on a second career as a Bollywood star; his ‘valet’ Karun, played by Harish Patel, who supplies a scene-stealing everyman befuddlement; and Angelina Jolie’s Thena, effortlessly regal and classically aloof. Richard Madden’s Ikaris and Gemma Chan’s Sersi have trickier jobs; as steely heroes and nominal leaders, they’re lumbered with generic dialogue (“We’re a team — we should stick together!”) and smothering earnestness. It’s surprising, in fact, how earnest Eternals can be. Sometimes that’s a welcome contrast from Marvel’s stock-in-trade snark. As with Star Trek’s Prime Directive, the Eternals are bound into a non-interventionist policy — only fight the Deviants, otherwise leave well alone. Is it moral, the film ponders at one point, for superheroes to simply sit back and let humans commit genocide? More frequently, though, it seems to fall into familiar traps about saving the world and learning to work together as a team; when a giant, CGI-heavy battle begins to thwart another potential apocalypse, you start to feel a formula being leaned on. It’s a stunningly successful formula, of course. But it means, despite that exciting name on the director’s chair, this is still business as usual for Marvel — a continuation, rather than a great leap.",NEUTRAL
"Oct 24, 2021","  The 26th movie in the overall Marvel Cinematic Universe and third of Phase 4, Eternals introduces an entirely new team of superheroes to Marvel Studios' franchise world. The film is directed by Chloé Zhao (Nomadland) from a script she co-wrote with Patrick Burleigh (Ant-Man and the Wasp), Ryan Firpo (Bet Raise Fold) and Kaz Firpo (Refuge), and based on a story by the Firpos. Eternals adapts the Marvel Comics characters of the same name, which were created by Jack Kirby in 1976, bringing the alien heroes to the world of the MCU. While Eternals has most of the benchmarks of a Marvel movie, Zhao's sprawling superhero epic is unlike anything the MCU has produced before.   The story of the film kicks off in 5000 BC, showing how the Eternals are sent to Earth to protect the planet and the humans who live on it from the evil aliens called Deviants. Throughout time, the team battles the Deviants until they're all but extinct, though the Eternals are forbidden from getting involved in any human conflict. The movie picks up in present day with the team having split up. Sersi (Gemma Chan) is living in London with Sprite (Lia McHugh) and dating the human Dane Whitman (Kit Harington). When a Deviant attacks, Ikaris (Richard Madden) arrives and the Eternals realize they must reassemble their team. The three of them travel the world to visit their former team members: Ajak (Salma Hayek), Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), Thena (Angelina Jolie), Gilgamesh (Don Lee), Druig (Barry Keoghan), Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry) and Makkari (Lauren Ridloff). Together, they must figure out why the Deviants are back and come up with a plan to protect the Earth.   Despite the number of characters included in Eternals, Zhao's movie does an excellent job of weaving their stories together and showing the various ways each hero is affected by their time on Earth. However, a central thematic storyline is achieved by focusing much of the plot around Sersi and Ikaris. Their romantic relationship has ended by the time the film picks up in the present day, but it works as an emotional core to Eternals. Their romance is genuinely sweet, if rushed, with a montage — that includes a marriage scene that is followed shortly by the MCU's very first sex scene — doing most of the work to establish Sersi and Ikaris' relationship. Their dynamic is much more complicated in the present day storyline, and the tragedy of their failed romance gives Eternals much of its heart, providing a depth to the story.   While Sersi and Ikaris receive much of the movie's attention, Eternals also gives the other characters their due. Sprite has her own tragic storyline as she struggles to fit into a world that sees her as a child, and McHugh  fantastically pulls off the delicate balance such a character arc needs. Nanjiani's Kingo often acts as comedic relief in Eternals, which the actor is well-suited for, though the third act seems like it doesn't know what to do with him. Thena and Gilgamesh have their own deep connection that's not quite as explored as Sersi and Ikaris', but Jolie and Lee are an immensely fun duo to watch. Keoghan, Henry, Ridloff and Hayek are all given something to work with, even if their characters are slightly more one-note. Still, there is a surprising amount of depth to Druig, Phastos, Makkari and Ajak that is either explicitly laid out for viewers or hinted at through the characters' actions and interactions with the other Eternals. Overall, the film was given the monumental task of introducing ten completely new characters to the MCU and developing them enough to ensure audiences would root for them all - and Zhao deftly pulls it off.   Though Eternals is essentially a character drama, Zhao still manages to include most of the major hallmarks of a Marvel movie, particularly action and humor - for better or worse. The action of Eternals is, for the most part,  grounded in reality largely because Zhao films the fight scenes in daylight and on location. There's little of the grayish half-light or CGI backgrounds. This makes the movie feel more immersive and the action more thrilling as a result, with the exception of certain shots of Ikaris flying and fighting deviants. As for the comedy, Eternals has humor in spades thanks to both Kingo and Sprite. While much of the comedy is fun and entertaining like most Marvel movies, there are other times when a joke undercuts an important emotional moment (though Eternals does this less than Thor: Ragnarok). For all Eternals attempts to stand apart from other MCU entries — and it does, mostly, achieve this — it's still very much a Marvel movie. That might be comforting for those who really like the Marvel formula and disheartening for others hoping to finally get a truly different MCU film.   Ultimately, Eternals is worth seeing for all fans of the MCU, from casual to diehard. Zhao is able to provide enough of a different Marvel movie experience for Eternals to feel fresh (at least compared to past phases). Phase 4 is proving to be one of Marvel's most experimental, with Black Widow, Shang-Chi and the Ten Rings and now Eternals bringing something new and never-before-seen to the MCU, which is exciting both in terms of each individual viewing experience and for the franchise as a whole. The 26th film in the franchise may set up an exciting future for the MCU (though it should be noted the post-credits scenes were not show during this reviewer's press screening), but Eternals is a thrilling, epic superhero adventure all its own, with a captivating emotional heart brought to life beautifully by Zhao's direction. It's a Marvel movie unlike anything the MCU has seen thus far.   Eternals will be released in theaters on Thursday evening, November 4. It is 157 minutes long and rated PG-13 for fantasy violence and action, some language and brief sexuality.  Tyler Perry's latest movie, Mea Culpa, was a Rotten Tomatoes disaster, but his next movie is on its way to being much better received by critics. Obi-Wan Kenobi is a character with many different abilities, both in Star Wars canon and in Legends. However, not all of these powers are canon. Matt Damon has a tendency to appear in minor, often comedic, cameo roles in various film projects, from Thor: Ragnarok to EuroTrip to Deadpool 2.",POSITIVE
"Oct 24, 2021"," Sprite (Lia McHugh), Sersi (Gemma Chan), Ajak (Salma Hayek), Druig (Barry Keoghan), and Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry) in Marvel Studios’ ETERNALS.

Some will love it, some will hate it, and some will think it is just alright. However, this critic finds it easily landing in her top 10 MCU films, and perhaps even in the top 5. It is visually stunning, tells an interesting and compelling story, takes just enough from the comic books but still is it’s own thing, and of course, has a fantastic cast who all get their moment to shine. Eternals tells the story of God-like creatures that were sent down to Earth to stop the Deviants, who are a predator species and are attacking humanity. When the job is done, or so they think, they stay on Earth for thousands of years, living as humans and waiting to be called home. Waiting to be told that their time there is done. However, something starts to happen and Deviants are coming back. Having gone their own ways over the course of many years, they must all band together again to take them on. Exploring why they have all gone to do their own thing is interesting, and the plot here is a great one. There are flashbacks throughout the movie as it jumps through time in order to give viewers every detail of the Eternals. Seven thousand years is a lot to cover in just over two and a half hours, but Eternals pulls it off perfectly. The most obvious thing to talk about with Eternals is the fact that it is visually stunning. This movie is gorgeous to look at, there is no denying that. From far away shots of one person in a beautiful outdoor setting, to incredible action scenes with mind blowing CGI, to the time spent in space with ominous and threatening Celestials. The cinematography here is amazing and trust me when I say this movie deserves to be see on the biggest screen possible. It is absolutely gorgeous to watch. Nearly every scene is breathtaking — and when the action is brought into it — WOW! There is a lot going on here, so seeing this movie more than once is something that is highly recommended.  As a reader of the comic books, it was nice to see that there a lot of nods to them, but that the story itself is something new and unique. There are many aspects of the characters and plot points taken from comic books, but they are shaped into a completely different event, which is appreciated. It is always nice to sit down and be surprised by a movie, when you think you know what is going to happen.  For those who know absolutely nothing about the Eternals, have no fear, this movie does a fantastic job of letting you get to know each and every one of them. Their powers, their strengths, their weaknesses, but also their hopes, dreams, and fears. It is almost guaranteed you will leave this movie feeling like you got to know all of the members of the team equally. Marvel’s Eternals kicks right off with the action and makes sure there is a decent amount of it throughout the film. However, the story itself and the dialogue are allowed the breath, which is important with a movie as dense as this one is. These are all new to the MCU characters, and there are a lot of them. For the average movie goer to be able to understand exactly who they are, what they are doing, and why they should care, there is a lot of character development that needs to be added in. Luckily this is done in a really great way that doesn’t disrupt the pacing, and doesn’t take away from the film as a whole.  Yes, Eternals clocks in at 2 hours and 37 minutes — but it never feels that long, and that is the important thing. When the film started to wrap up, I was surprised it had been that long. This is impressive considering exactly how heavy this movie really is, and says a lot about how well it put together the emotion, the heart, the humor, and the action. This movie is soulful and deep — something you don’t often get with a Marvel film, so soak it up. Take it all in and enjoy every breathtaking moment. It has a lot of first for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and that is not a bad thing. In order to avoid spoilers I will not get into specifics, even though they are already out there, but know that one of them is very important to include in a movie like this, and I am very glad they did it.  There is a lot going on here, and while it all could have easily been a mess, it worked for me. I was captivated and attentive the entire way through, always eager to see what was going to happen next. There is a massive ensemble cast for Eternals, with ten new heroes to explore, and to learn what they have been up to since they have been on Earth since the time that humanity started. While this is clearly a lot of new characters to meet and get to know, it feels like each and every one got the time that they deserved on screen. They all have their moments. Some more than others, of course. Not to mention the new characters on top of the Eternals like Dane Whitman. While they all do not get equal screen time, it seems that they all get their time to shine, and have their purpose in the movie. It is very difficult to pick standout characters because of this. It should be noted that Kumail Nanjiani’s Kingo steals every scene he is in. He is hilarious, quirky, and just a whole lot of fun. Not to mention his finger gun power is really, really freaking cool. Just wait until you see it in action and try not to cheer. It is very clear that he is having the time of his life being a hilarious superhero.  (L-R): Sprite (Lia McHugh), Druig (Barry Keoghan), Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), Karun (Harish Patel), Sersi (Gemma Chan) and Ikaris (Richard Madden) in Marvel Studios’ ETERNALS.

There are a lot of emotional moments involving them, and they all shine in their own way. If there was to be a main character in the movie, it would be Sersi. However, each and every other character is given their time as well. This just feels more like Sersi’s story than anyone elses. Angelina Jolie’s Thena deals with some trauma in this movie and she is the perfect actress for that role. I have heard several people say that she is underused but I just do not feel that way. She was fantastic and did a great job with her complicated character. Speaking of complicated, Barry Keoghan’s Druig is one that audiences might struggle to like at times, but one thing you can say is that he is never boring. He is a very interesting character but one that will have you wondering how you feel about him throughout the film — much like his character is in the comics.  Lauren Ridloff’s Makkari is another character that will make you laugh. She is funny, witty, and unafraid of the others. She is deaf and played by a deaf actress, which is something that should be applauded. She also has some of the best fight scenes in the entire film. She runs fast — like really fast — and seeing her in action is one of the best parts of the movie.  Lia McHugh plays Sprite, and character who is just as old as all of the other Eternals, but stuck in the body of a child. She brings a lot of great moments to this character, and is sure to have you in your feels and you see her struggle. In the comic books it is well known that Sprite just wishes to grow up. That comes across in the film, mixed with her fun loving spirit.  Everyone’s powers look incredibly cool when executed, but the way that Sprite’s appears around her fingers while creating an illusion is one that stands out. It is attention to detail like this that makes Eternals one of the best MCU films. Richard Madden’s Ikarus is full of surprises. He has been labeled the Superman of the film because he shoots lasers out of his eyes and flies, which is fair, but because of that he is one of the most powerful members of the Eternals. His story is a fun one to watch unfold. Last, but certainly not least, Brian Tyree Henry’s Phastos brings heart, kick butt action, super smarts, and something unexpected to this movie. While it is certainly hard to pick favorites, he is likely to be at the top of everyone’s list. He has a lot of heart, and is unafraid to wear his emotions on his sleeve.  Oh, and as for Kit Harrington’s Dane Whitmore, fans will not get a whole lot of him. He is in the movie sporadically, but when he is, he is fantastic. Don’t worry though, we are sure to see a lot more of him soon. If you know about him from the comic books, then you know he is quite an important character. While this is not fully explained in the film, there are some hints at it, and it has been assured by Marvel that fans will be getting more of him.  Of course I cannot say too much about the post credit scenes in an effort to remain spoiler free. Even though some outlets have shared major details already, I refuse to be one of those people. These scenes are best gone into knowing nothing about them. The movie itself ends on a slight cliffhanger, but these end credits burst open the door for nearly infinite MCU possibilities. Avid comic book readers will be screaming, jumping around, and completely flipping out as they are revealed. There are some new characters coming to the MCU and holy cow, we cannot wait for them to be explored. There is also a cameo voice that will literally give you goosebumps, so get ready to be coming up with all the theories, even though WandaVision taught us to never do that again.  L to R: Karun (Harish Patel), Gilgamesh (Don Lee) and Sersi (Gemma Chan) in Marvel Studios’ ETERNALS.

It doesn’t feel like a typical Marvel movie and for those who know nothing about the Eternals, there might be some struggling here. It takes time to get to know them all and because of that this is a dense movie. There is a lot to take in here, but it is done so well that it will should not overwhelm audiences. This movie is ultimately about family. It is beautiful, touching, and all around an amazingly emotional film. There is a lot to unpack, but it is worth spending the time to do it right. That is where this movie excels. It takes its time, allowing important moments to breath. Character development is important when introducing anyone who might be sticking around the Marvel Cinematic Universe for a while, so it is very much appreciated that this film took the time to do it with many new characters. Luckily there wasn’t much need for world building since this is a universe fans have lived in and explored for years. Thankfully there was no need to really explain the world surrounding these characters — or we could have been looking at a four hour long movie. Honestly though, if anyone could have pulled it off it is Chloe Zhao. Her vision for this movie is stunning, well executed, and simply put, incredible. When I say that Eternals is like nothing we have ever seen in a Marvel movie before, I mean it. Sure there is action, but it isn’t at the forefront of the film. This movie is kind of a love letter to humanity, and I am here for it, even if humanity kind of sucks right now. Eternals is going to invoke a lot of emotions. Remember, this is a new Phase of the MCU and it is time to move on from what we know and love and dive into the unknown. If this is what the future of Marvel looks like, sign me up! Marvel Studios’ “Eternals” welcomes an exciting new team of Super Heroes to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The epic story, spanning thousands of years, features a group of immortal heroes forced out of the shadows to reunite against mankind’s oldest enemy, The Deviants. The outstanding ensemble cast includes Richard Madden as the all-powerful Ikaris, Gemma Chan as humankind-loving Sersi, Kumail Nanjiani as cosmic-powered Kingo, Lauren Ridloff as the super-fast Makkari, Brian Tyree Henry as the intelligent inventor Phastos, Salma Hayek as the wise and spiritual leader Ajak, Lia McHugh as the eternally young, old-soul Sprite, Don Lee as the powerful Gilgamesh, Barry Keoghan as aloof loner Druig, and Angelina Jolie as the fierce warrior Thena.

"Oct 24, 2021"," From a certain point of view, Marvel Studios’ Eternals has something for everyone. It’s a cosmic-fused superhero film featuring a diverse cast, lots of action, interesting dramatic stakes, and enough humor to keep it from feeling too self-serious. It’s even directed by indie-darling and recent Oscar recipient Chloe Zhao to bridge the gap between the comic book geeks and the arthouse freaks. Is this the best Marvel has to offer? Not quite. However, I’m curious how the mainstream audiences will react to a film that’s both patient and packed with entertainment value. Setting aside whatever faults I found, Eternals is decidedly different and more conceptually interesting than most MCU entries. Eternals are an immortal alien race created by the Celestials (we met one of them before in the form of Kurt Russell in Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 2). These immortal beings have secretly lived on earth for over 7,000 years, with the sole goal of protecting humanity from Deviants. These threatening monsters are depicted are tentacle-covered, four-legged beasts that can absorb the energy of those they encounter. The Deviants are also seemingly no match for the Eternals. They were quickly disposed of long ago, leaving the Eternals to continue living among humans. So, what does an immortal being do with that time? I found the exploration of humanity to be fascinating. Anyone looking to understand what Zhao is bringing to the MCU can see it’s more than characters scenes primarily set during twilight hours. Based on the script she co-wrote with Patrick Burleigh, Ryan Firpo, and Kaz Firpo, Zhao took this Jack Kirby comic book and found ways to have the characters fixate on their purpose, their connection to humans, and what it means to live one’s best life. This is a story about individuals trying to comprehend a race of insignificant beings compared to the ever-expanding universe they have full knowledge of. How does one begin to provide all of the perspectives required to show that level of thought? Eternals features a large ensemble cast, each of whom possesses a superpower and distinct personality. Gemma Chan is the film’s ostensible lead. She stars as Sersi, an empathetic character who can manipulate matter. She was once in a relationship with Richard Madden’s Ikaris, the most powerful of the Eternals, with the ability to fly and project laser beams from his eyes. His weariness contrasts with Sersi, despite how drawn they still may be to each other. Lia McHugh is Sprite, an Eternal who can project illusions and has the body of a 12-year-old child. A common concept is an inherent drama of being forever young and how that influences one’s decisions. Similarly, Barry Keoghan is Druig, an Eternal who can manipulate minds. He finds many faults with being instructed not to interfere with humanity, despite all he could accomplish if given a chance. Angelina Jolie and Don Lee portray Thena and Gilgamesh, two powerful Eternals (one has cosmic weapons, the other has cosmic muscles). The two share a deep bond. Also powerful is Lauren Ridloff’s Makkari, the first deaf superhero in the MCU. She possesses super-speed, which once again manages to be a visually inventive superpower to see in action. Brian Tyree Henry portrays Phastos, an inventor, while Kumail Nanjiani is Kingo, an Eternal who can project cosmic energy from his hands. These two provide a tremendous amount of comic relief. However, they are also surprisingly tasked with some of the more emotional heavy lifting. Compared to the others, these two managed to develop independent lives on earth, reflecting in their perceptions of what matters most. Phastos has a husband and a child (for once, Disney features a gay character that doesn’t feel like pandering), while Kingo has developed a career as a Bollywood superstar. Once the world-ending stakes of the film are established, both characters provide plenty of reasons for why the choices they make are justified. It speaks to these characters’ effectiveness that the impact of their decisions makes a real difference in how the film continues to develop. Leading all of these characters is Salma Hayek as Ajak, an eternal with the ability to heal. She’s also the bridge between the Eternals and the Celestials, who lay out the tasks and have instructions on how to proceed. Thanks to her mothering qualities, Ajak allows the film to open up its warmth and spiritual side as the audience comes to learn more about what it means to be a planet’s protector. The interesting side effect is noting how these Eternals inspired various myths, icons, and other heroes throughout history. Of course, there is drama to shift the plot in specific directions, but the approach is a fresh one. While the film features a variety of flashbacks to show hundreds if not thousands of years ago, the present narrative finds Sersi, Sprite, and Ikaris “getting the band back together” to understand how the Deviants have seemingly returned. This allows us to get to know the characters while also seeing how their opinions contrast between each other and their past selves. At over two and a half hours, this is one of the longest MCU films. At times, it does find issues with knowing how to balance the aspects an audience has come to expect with an MCU film and Zhao’s instincts. Namely, with a requirement to either add action or humor every so often, it has a tendency to get in the way of the film’s more cerebral elements. Whether or not one likes all of the action comes down to appreciating the visuals. Watching superpowered immortals go at it with powerful monsters or even each other only provides so much in terms of stakes. The visual effects are impressive at times, as it’s fun to see these different powers utilized in different ways. DP Ben Davis, who has worked on several MCU films, equipped himself well to balance Zhao’s sensibilities with a familiar (albeit flatter) presentation found in Marvel’s features. One thing I certainly appreciated was the effort to utilize real locations. While it’s still a balance between places such as the Canary Islands and sets at Pinewood Studios in England, this feels like another feature where the filmmaker was making clear choices instead of feeling like part of a machine. Serving this aspect well was seeing the actors providing strength through their performances without being inhibited by the world around them. It’s hard to say this Marvel movie is a naturalistic take, but I feel confident enough in saying Zhao’s efforts didn’t’ simply fade into the background. Getting back to the core themes being explored, Eternals has a lot on its mind that I would have been happy to see discussed even more. Without detailing where this film goes, the idea of God-like beings assessing the necessity of the human population and what cost specific actions could have on the rest of the universe is the sort of cosmic comic book craziness that could keep readers up at night. For a film to harness that kind of storyline for the sake of an adventure film made for the masses, well, I can only hope we see more MCU entries daring to ask existential questions about existence that don’t have easy answers. Were it to all come together stronger on a structural level, I could see Eternals landing in the highest tier of MCU movies. As it stands, this is one of the more ambitious entries that I’ll continue to think about as we see more of whatever Phase Four has to offer. The film has all of the goods in terms of casting, humor, action, visuals, and more. With little left to prove, I’m happy enough to see strange, insightful swings in new directions. Eternals has proven it doesn’t have to be perfect to be good, and it doesn’t necessarily need to shy away from the stuff people like about the MCU to be unique.",POSITIVE
